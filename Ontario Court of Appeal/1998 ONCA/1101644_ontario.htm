[1]  The appellants appeal the decision of Jenkins J. directing
that the Land Registrar for the County of Perth remove a mortgage
given by 1101644 to Jacobs and 946320. It is admitted that there
was never any agreement between Jacobs and 1101644 that 1101644
would grant Jacobs a mortgage. Jacobs was of the opinion 1101644
owed him and 946320 money and, in order to protect their
interests, Jacobs caused a mortgage to be given by 1101644 to
himself and 946320. He did not ask the officers or directors of
the company to authorize the mortgage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant submits firstly that Jenkins J. lacked
jurisdiction to set aside the mortgage because the originating
process in this matter was an application whereas it should have
been an action. In our view, rule 2.02(2) and rule 14.05 (3)
provide jurisdiction for the commencement of this proceeding as
an application and the granting of the declaration sought.
Section 132(9) of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. B.16, also relied on by Jenkins J., enables a court to
set aside a transaction where a director or officer of a
corporation has failed to disclose his or her interest in a
material transaction. In our opinion, Jenkins J. did have
jurisdiction to make the order he did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellants also submit that, even if Jenkins J. had
jurisdiction, he erred in principle in refusing to direct the
trial of an issue because it is the appellant's position that the
Board was not properly constituted. The appellants have raised
the question of whether the Board was properly constituted in
other proceedings which are not before this court. In this
proceeding, on the state of the material before Jenkins J., he
did not err in refusing to grant the trial of an issue as to the
validity of the mortgage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs on a party and party
basis.</font></pre></td>
