<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p>[1]  The trial judge accepted the appellant retailer’s evidence that the respondent 
  wholesaler agreed to reduce the price of the leather jackets sold by the respondent 
  to the appellant from $95 to $75 per jacket. The evidence of Mr. Goldgrub supported 
  that finding.</p>
<p>[2]  Although the trial judge accepted Mr. Goldgrub’s evidence about the adjustment 
  to the deal that he made with the respondent, the trial judge permitted the 
  respondent to resile, in part, from the price concession that he had granted 
  the appellant. In particular, the trial judge found that the $20 per unit price 
  reduction should apply only to those jackets sold between April 25, 1993 and 
  June 20, 1993.</p>
<p>[3]  The respondent contends that in the circumstances (circumstances that 
  have to do with the collapse of an on-going business relationship between the 
  appellant and the respondent), the respondent was entitled to change his position 
  with respect to the price to be paid by the appellant for the jackets. We do 
  not agree.</p>
<p>[4]  In light of the trial judge’s finding of fact, we think that the appellant 
  was entitled to a $20 per jacket reduction on all of the jackets. The respondent 
  should not be entitled to resile from his general concession, as found by the 
  trial judge, on the price to be paid by the appellant for the jackets.</p>
<p>[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. Paragraph 1 of the judgment below 
  is varied to reflect judgment for the respondent in the amount of $104,240.35, 
  including pre-judgment interest to the date of the trial judgment. The appellant 
  is entitled to costs of the appeal. Since the appellant did not complete payment 
  for the jackets, even at the reduced price, the respondent is entitled to costs 
  of the trial.</p>
