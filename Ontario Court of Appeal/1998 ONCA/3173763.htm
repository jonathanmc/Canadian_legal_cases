    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The numbered company respondent, as assignee of the security
held by the Royal Bank, stands in its shoes as far as the facts
surrounding the taking of the guarantee are concerned. The bank
was separately represented from the appellant when it took the
guarantee and there is nothing in the evidence to disentitle it
from relying on the guarantee it signed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  As far as the third party respondent is concerned, the
appellant takes the position that it was put on notice of the
appellant's arrangement with the bank at a meeting on February
13, 1990 - the only time that the appellant and his brothers met
with a representative of the solicitors who acted for them - by
notes placed on a document entitled &quot;Consent Authorization and
Direction&quot; stating &quot;consent to put condos up for collateral&quot; and
&quot;only condo units&quot; and stroking out the words after a recital of
agreement to give guarantees &quot;each to the extent of $2,500,000&quot;.
The appellant's objection to this document was the possible
exposure of the interest in the condominiums of a family estate.
The trial judge accepted the evidence of Mary Wilson that she
&quot;recalled the defendant expressing some concern only about the
interest of the Estate with respect to the execution of the
Consent, Authorization and Direction.&quot; That document was never
signed. In any event, it had nothing to do with the guarantee
which is the subject of the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant takes the position that McMillan Binch knew
from that document that the appellant intended to limit his
guarantee to the extent of his interest in condominium properties
over which the bank already held mortgage security. Therefore, he
submits, when they forwarded the subsequent guarantee form from
the bank's solicitors, which was in the form of an unconditional
guarantee in the amount of $2,500,000, they should have informed
him, as his solicitors, that his guarantee was not limited to his
interest in the condominiums. However, although the guarantee was
forwarded from the bank's solicitors through McMillan Binch, they
did not open the envelope which contained it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant was an experienced businessman who had signed
unconditional guarantees before and he knew what they meant. He
originally signed a guarantee in this case using the corporate
seal and it was not accepted by the bank's solicitors. He was
informed that &quot;this is your personal guarantee of the liabilities
of the Corporation limited to the sum of $2,500.000...&quot; He
therefore was told in simple terms what the guarantee said and
had two opportunities to read and consider the terms of the
guarantee which he signed. At no time did he ask McMillan Binch
to advise him as to the meaning of the guarantee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  We are of the view that the trial judge rightly concluded
that McMillan Binch did not fall below the standard of a
reasonable solicitor in the circumstances of this case. We cannot
conclude that the trial judge erred in his important finding on
what the appellant said to Mary Wilson on February 13, 1990. The
trial judge found that the appellant understood what he was
signing. His solicitors could only have confirmed that knowledge.
Accordingly, even had they been negligent, their negligence would
not have caused the appellant's loss.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appeal as against both respondents is dismissed with
costs.</font></pre></td>
