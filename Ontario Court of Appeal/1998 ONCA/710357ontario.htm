    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal from the order of the Honourable Mr.

Justice Logan dismissing the application of two landlords

(710357 Ontario Limited and 840703 Ontario Limited) for an order

quashing By-law 33/95 and s. 13 of By-law 37/92 of the

Corporation of the Town of Penetanguishene (the &quot;Town&quot;) on the

basis that the impugned provisions were passed without

legislative authority.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Logan J., after considering what was meant by the term

&quot;ultra vires&quot;, concluded that s. 13 of By-law 33/95, which

provided that owners were responsible for the payment of water

rates, &quot;discriminates against certain owners of property and

consumers of water.&quot; However, he concluded that By-law 33/95 was

&quot;... not essential to the valid operation of the water system

within the Town of Penetanguishene. It is trifling in character

and administrative in nature. The doctrine of ultra vires would

not apply to an administrative matter of this kind.&quot; He therefore

dismissed the appellants' application, but without costs because

of his finding that, since the by-law discriminated against

certain owners of property, it was unlawful. The landlords

appeal. They contend that the motions judge erred in failing to

find that there is no statutory authority that would permit the

Town to recover water rates from them and that the by-law

provisions in issue are, therefore, unlawful and should be

quashed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
THE FACTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In 1992, the Town assumed control of the operation and

management of the municipal waterworks system. The operation and

management of the system before that time has been the

responsibility of Penetanguishene Water and Light Commission. On

July 27, 1992, the Town passed By-law 37, s. 13 of which

provided:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Where a house or building is tenant occupied,
          the owner will be billed. An owner may make
          written application to the Treasurer to have
          the tenant billed provided the owner agrees
          to be responsible for any unpaid bills. This
          does not relieve the owner from any liability
          for payment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  In response to By-law 37/92, the appellants, who own and

manage 27 residential apartment units at 155, 157 and 159 Church

Street North in the Town, signed applications with the Town to

have accounts for water rates sent directly to their tenants.

Consistent with s. 13 of By-law 37/92, the appellants

acknowledged that any arrears were payable by them as property

owners.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  By 1995, the Town concluded that the existing method of

billing for water rates was resulting in an unacceptable level of

bad debt. It thus passed By-law 33/95. That By-law repealed and

replaced s. 13 of By-law 37/92. The purpose of the new s. 13 was

to eliminate the option for the owner of premises to have tenants

billed directly for water rates.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  By-law 33/95, passed by Council on May 24, 1995, provides:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   That section 13 of by-law 1992-37 be
               hereby repealed in its entirety and be
               hereby substituted with the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               13.  Notwithstanding any arrangements
               between property owners and tenants or
               users of the property, the property
               owner shall be billed for and shall pay
               all rates and charges for water service.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   That this by-law shall take effect and
               shall be effective on the 1st day of
               July, 1995.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The effect of By-law 33/95 was that as of July 1, 1995,

property owners, not tenants, would be billed for and be

responsible to pay water and sewer charges.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  Under the 1995 scheme (the new s. 13 introduced by By-law

33/95) the Town billed the owners of rented premises directly for

water and sewage. The appellants received 27 separate, flat-

rated, bills (one bill for each rented unit). Under the 1992

scheme these bills had been sent directly to individual tenants.

The appellants' premises are serviced by the Town's water and

sewage system and the individual units are not metered

individually.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE APPELLANT'S POSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  The appellants took issue with By-law 33/95 and moved to

quash it. They emphasize practical problems they face if primary

responsibility for water and sewage bills falls upon them in

circumstances where all of the leases for 155 to 159 Church

Street North provides that the tenants pay &quot;... all water and

sewer rates with respect to the premises.&quot; They emphasize that

there is no provision in any of the leases which would permit

them to recover water and sewer charges from a tenant in the

event that they had to pay those charges. They contend that to

recover water and sewer charges, they would have to resort to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what they submit is a time-consuming and cumbersome rent review

process. They also contend that even if they were successful on a

rent review application, the prescribed limitations on rent

increases would not permit them to recover all of the water and

sewer charges from their tenants.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] The appellants submit that once the motions judge had found

that s. 13 of By-law 33/95 was &quot;unlawful&quot;, he erred in not

quashing s. 13 of the By-law. I agree with that submission.

Nonetheless, the question remains -- does the Public Utilities

Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.52 (the &quot;Act&quot;) provide authority to permit

the Town to require landlords to pay for water and sewer services

provided to tenants?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] There is no doubt that if the impugned provisions are intra

vires of the Town, that is if they are permitted to collect water

and sewer charges directly from owners, the appellants, and other

similarly situated landlords, will face practical problems in

recovering water and sewer charges from tenants. However, these

difficulties notwithstanding, the central issue is whether the

Act gives the Town authority to require owners to pay for water

and sewer services provided to tenants. The resolution of that

issue requires an examination of certain provisions of the Act to

determine whether the owner of an apartment building in which

individual apartments are not separately metered is a &quot;consumer&quot;,

as that term is used in the Act.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] Section 55 of the Act gives the Town authority to operate

its waterworks. The supply of water to buildings is required by

the Act if any of the &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;the occupant&quot; or &quot;other person in

charge of any such building&quot; requests it. Thus, tenants, as

occupants, can compel the Town to supply water to their premises.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] The only authority in the Act that would permit the

imposition of a condition before supplying a public utility,

including water, is found in s. 50(4) which provides:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          50. (4)   Any corporation before supplying
          any public utility to any person or to any
          building or premises, or as a condition of
          continuing to supply the utility, may require
          any consumer to give reasonable security for
          the payment of the proper charges therefor or
          for carrying the public utility into the
          building or premises. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] A municipal corporation's authority to regulate the

distribution and use of water and to fix the price for the use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">water is found in s. 8 of the Act:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.   The corporation may regulate the
          distribution and use of the water in all
          places where and for all purposes for which
          it may be required, and fix the prices for
          the use thereof, and the times of payment,
          and may erect such number of public hydrants
          and in such places as it may see fit, and may
          direct in what manner and for what purposes
          the same shall be used, and may fix the rate
          or rent to be paid for the use of the water
          by hydrants, fireplugs and public buildings.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] Section 12 of the Act also gives the municipality the power

to pass by-laws that regulate, among other things, the price to

be paid for water.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          12.  The corporation may pass by-laws for
          regulating the time, manner, extent and
          nature of the supply by the works, the
          building or persons to which and to whom the
          water shall be furnished, the price to be
          paid therefor, and every other matter or
          thing related to or connected therewith that
          it may be necessary or proper to regulate, in
          order to secure to the inhabitants of the
          municipality a continued and abundant supply
          of pure and wholesome water, and to prevent
          the practising of frauds upon the corporation
          with regard to the water so supplied, and for
          providing that for a contravention of any
          such by-law the offender is guilty of an
          offence. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] Section 28(2) of the Act specifically refers to consumers

and provides a municipal corporation with a discretion as to the

rents, rates or prices charged to various classes of consumer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          28.  (2) In fixing the rents, rates or prices
          to be paid for the supply of a public utility
          the corporation may use its discretion as to
          the rents, rates or prices to be charged to
          the various classes of consumers and also as
          to the rents, rates or prices at which a
          public utility shall be supplied for the
          different purposes for which it may be
          supplied or required. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] As can be seen, s. 28(2) identifies &quot;consumers&quot; as the

persons required to pay for water charges. It does not contain

any reference to owners.


[18] Section 28(3) gives the municipal corporation authority to

shut off supply in default of payment. Thus, if a municipal

corporation or public utilities commission can require an owner-

landlord to pay water charges, the owner's failure to pay could

result in service to all leased units being shut off.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] By the provisions of s. 31(1) the municipal corporation

acquires a lien for a public utility supplied to the owner or

occupant for use on the land of the owner or occupant. The lien

is on the debtor's interest in the land and is triggered by the

supply of a public utility (water) for use on the lands. Section

31(3) gives the municipal corporation authority to distrain upon

the goods and chattels of &quot;the person liable to pay for the

amount due for any public utility supplied to the person.&quot;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] It is common ground that the Public Utilities Act provides

authority to the Town to collect hydro rates from landlords such

as the appellants, as owners, only if the appellants can be taken

to be &quot;consumers&quot;, as that term is used in the Public Utilities

Act. That premise was accepted by this court in Bracebridge Hydro

Electric Commission v. 796479 Ontario Ltd. (1991), 2 O.R. (3d)

761 (Ont. Gen. Div.); appeal dismissed February 9, 1995,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unreported.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] In Bracebridge, the issue was whether Bracebridge's policy

that required landlords to guarantee payment of tenants' hydro

rates was valid as it applied to the subject rented premises, all

of which were separately metered. The motions judge held that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord was not a &quot;consumer&quot; within the meaning of what is now

s. 50(4) of the Act. Bracebridge appealed. In its brief

endorsement dismissing the appeal, the court said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the present circumstances where there is
          individual metering and the tenants are
          billed individually, we agree with the
          motions court judge that the owner cannot be
          considered a &quot;consumer&quot; so as to be required
          to guarantee the accounts of individual
          tenants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22] The Town takes comfort from the reference in Bracebridge to

individual metering and separate billing. Since the appellants'

premises are not separately metered, the Town contends that

Bracebridge does not directly apply to this case. The Town

submits that when the apartments are not separately metered,

Bracebridge suggests that the owner (landlord) would be a

consumer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In my opinion, if &quot;consumer&quot; is given its plain ordinary

meaning, as I think it should be, a landlord-owner is not a

consumer. Consumer as referred to in the Act is that person who

uses, that is consumes, water supplied by a municipal corporation

or a public utilities commission. That interpretation of consumer

seems to me to accommodate the ordinary meaning of the word</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;consumer&quot; and it accords with the statutory provisions set out

in the Act that deal with the obligation to pay for utilities.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Sections 8 and 28 of the Act plainly link charges for water

to the use of water. As I have noted, s. 50(4) of the Act permits

the municipal corporation, as a pre-condition to supplying any

public utility, to require &quot;any consumer&quot; to give a reasonable

security for the payment of public utility charges. This confirms

that only consumers are liable to pay water rates.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] There is, however, no reference to owners in those sections

of the Act that provide a municipal corporation with the

authority to charge for a public utility, or impose an obligation

to pay for the use of the utility.1 In addition, it seems to me

that if a tenant is entitled to the supply of water, it would be

incompatible with that entitlement to permit an entire

residential apartment building to be deprived of water because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a payment default by the owner.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In my view, if a person other than the user of water, that

is a consumer of that utility, was obligated to pay for it, the

Act would have plainly said so. When the legislature dealt with

the obligation to pay public utility (water) rates, it imposed

the obligation on the utility's user, that is the consumer of the

utility, without reference to the relationship of the payer to

the property to which the utility is supplied. In my view,

landlords, as owners, are only liable to pay for water charges if

the landlord uses the water, as would occur in a superintendent's

apartment occupied by the landlord, or its employee. In that

case, the landlord's obligation to pay for water would accrue

because the landlord is a consumer, not because the landlord is

an owner.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] I do not think anything turns on the presence or absence of

individual meters. Meters simply quantify use. They do not

determine who the user of a public utility is. I cannot accept

the submission that a landlord is a consumer where there are no

individual meters, but is not a consumer where there is

individual metering. The same persons, that is the tenants, are

using the water in both cases. In the unmetered premises the

tenants pay a flat rate. In the metered premises, the tenants pay

according to the amount of water they use. Thus, where there is

no individual metering, low water users will inevitably subsidize

high water users. In both circumstances the consumer is the

tenant. I do not take this court's judgment in Bracebridge to

stand for the proposition that the owner of rented premises that

are not separately metered is a consumer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[28] In my opinion, there is no statutory authority that would

permit the Town to charge the appellant owners directly, as

consumers, for water supplied to their tenants. The billing

scheme contemplated by By-law 33/95 is, in my view, not

authorized by the Act. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and

quash By-law 33/95. Since By-law 33/95 repealed s. 13 of By-law

37/92, quashing of By-law 33/95 will resurrect s. 13 of By-law

37/92. Section 13 of the old by-law also provided for the billing

of owners for water rates. I would, in the circumstances, also

quash s. 13 of that by-law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[29] In my view, the appellants are entitled to costs here and

below.
