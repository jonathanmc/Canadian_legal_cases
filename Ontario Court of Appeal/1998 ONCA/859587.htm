    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>DOHERTY J.A.:
</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Dambrot J. declaring
that the appellant's (Starmark Property Management Limited)
distraint and sale of a spray paint booth located on property
leased by Starmark to a tenant was unlawful. Dambrot J. further
held that the respondent, Atlantic International Equipment Sales,
the vendor of the booth under the terms of a conditional sales
contract, was entitled to reacquire possession of it upon
compliance with ss. 34(4) and 34(5) of the Personal Property
Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (P.P.S.A.).

[2]  The essential facts are these:

	In February, 1996, H.K. Auto Centre rented certain premises
from Starmark.

	Under the terms of the lease, all improvements, except trade
fixtures, became the property of Starmark when the lease expired.
The tenant was required to remove trade fixtures at its own
expense at the expiration of the lease. The lease gave the tenant
very limited rights to remove and replace trade fixtures during
the term of the lease. That limited right was not available if
the tenant was in default under the lease.

	In March, 1996, Atlantic sold the spray booth to H.K. Auto
Centre for $27,659.00. Under the terms of the agreement,
ownership of the booth remained with Atlantic until all payments
had been made. Atlantic did not register its agreement under the
P.P.S.A.

	The booth was installed in the leased premises in March,
1996.

	The booth was 28 feet by 14 feet and weighed some 3,500
pounds. It was attached to the floor by numerous small nails
which could be easily removed and was connected by various pipes
to the electrical, water and air systems within the leased
premises. Exhaust fumes from the booth were expelled through a
vent which exited the building through a hole in the roof. The
vent was bolted to the roof.

	In September, 1996, H.K. Auto Centre owed rent arrears of
about $12,000.00. Starmark levied a distress on the leased
premises and took possession of the spray booth. The booth
remained on the rented premises in the same condition it was in
prior to the distraint.

	At the time of the distraint, H.K. Auto Centre had paid
about $11,000.00 toward the purchase of the spray booth and owed
Atlantic about $17,000.00.

	Starmark sold the spray booth to a third party who had
agreed to lease the space formerly leased by H.K. Auto Centre.

	Atlantic became aware of the purported sale, registered its
conditional sales agreement under the P.P.S.A., and commenced
these proceedings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Starmark claims that it was entitled to sell the spray booth
and apply the proceeds to pay the rent arrears either because the
booth was a fixture and became part of the property which it
owned, or because the spray booth was a chattel, and although
owned by Atlantic, was subject to distraint under s. 31(2) of the
Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7. Atlantic takes the
position that the spray booth was not subject to distraint as it
was a fixture and that under the terms of s. 34 of the P.P.S.A.,
its interest had priority over Starmark's interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Dambrot J. made a careful and detailed analysis of the
evidence and the issues. His reasons are reported (1997), 34 O.R.
(3d) 43, and as I am in substantial agreement with them, I need
not repeat much of what appears in those reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Dambrot J. found that the spray booth was a trade or
tenant's fixture. That finding involved the application of long-
established legal principles to largely uncontested facts. As
Dambrot J. neither misapprehended the evidence, nor the
applicable law, his finding must stand unless it is unreasonable.
Given the manner in which the equipment was attached to the land,
the terms of the lease, and the purpose of the attachment (i.e.
to improve the functioning of the machinery and not to improve
the property), I think the characterization of the spray booth as
a fixture and not as a chattel was a close call. I cannot say,
however, that Dambrot J.'s characterization was unreasonable. The
case must be approached on the basis that the spray booth was a
trade fixture.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Can a landlord distrain against a trade fixture? If the
answer is yes, then when Starmark distrained against the spray
booth it acquired a lien over that property: Commercial Credit
Corp. Ltd. v. Harry D. Shields (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 703 (C.A.),
aff'g. (1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 106 (Ont. H.C.). Under the terms of
s. 4(1)(a) and s. 20(1)(a)(i) of the P.P.S.A., that lien would
have priority over the security interest of Atlantic which was
unperfected when the distraint occurred and the lien arose:
Leavere v. Port Colborne City (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 44 at 49-50
(C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  As Dambrot J. observed, a landlord's right to distrain
against trade fixtures is a matter of some controversy in the
case law. Most of those cases come from the last century and make
difficult reading for those unschooled in the intricacies and
idiosyncracies of the common law of real property. As I
understand the old cases, they describe two situations in which
things placed on the leased premises by the tenant for the
purpose of carrying out the tenant's business could not be
distrained by the landlord. First, if the thing had become fixed
to the property so as to become part of it, it could not be
distrained. Second, even if the thing had not become affixed to
the property so as to become part of it, it could not be
distrained if, upon payment of the arrears, it could not be
returned to the tenant in the same condition it was in before the
distraint. This second qualification on the landlord's power to
distrain developed when distraint required the actual removal of
the goods from the leased premises to a pound. If that removal
would damage the property so as to render restitution in the same
condition impossible, then the property could not be distrained:
Hellawell v. Eastwood et al. (1851), 155 E.R. 554 at 5611; Darby
v. Harris (1841), 113 E.R. 1374.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  As indicated above, Dambrot J. found that the spray booth
was a trade fixture. A trade fixture is a thing which has become
part of the property, is used by the tenant in the tenant's
business and is removable at the instance of the tenant: Deloitte
&amp; Touche Inc. v. 1035839 Ontario Inc. (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 139 at
150 (Gen. Div.), aff'd, without reference to this point, June 23,
1998 (C.A.). The status of trade fixtures while they are attached
to and are part of the property was explained by Meredith C.J. in
Stack v. T. Eaton Co. et al. (1902), 4 O.L.R. 335 at 338 (Div.
Ct.):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          That, even in the case of tenants' fixtures
          put in for the purposes of trade, they form
          part of the freehold, with the right,
          however, to the tenant, as between him and
          his landlord, to bring them back to the state
          of chattels again by severing them from the
          soil, and that they pass by a conveyance of
          the land as part of it, subject to this right
          of the tenant.  [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  A trade fixture is as much a part of the freehold as any
immoveable fixture as long as the trade fixture has not been
severed from the freehold by the tenant at the time of the
distraint. As distraint runs against the tenant's property found
on the land and not against the land itself, it follows that
trade fixtures which are part of the land at the time of the
purported distraint cannot be subject to distraint: Crossley
Brothers Limited v. Lee, [1908] 1 K.B. 86 at 90; Provincial Bill
Posting Company v. Low Moor Iron Company, [1909] 2 K.B. 344 at
349 (C.A.); Bailey v. Miller, [1932] 3 W.W.R. 260 at 263 (Sask.
C.A.); Bruce v. Smith, [1923] 3 D.L.R. 887 at 889 (Alta. C.A.);
Cashman Holdings Ltd. v. Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. (1990), 1
C.B.R. (3d) 80 at 85 (B.C.S.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Dambrot J. referred to Howell v. Listowell Rink and Park Co.
(1886), 13 O.R. 476 and Davy v. Lewis (1859) 18 U.C.Q.B. 21
(C.A.) as cases which suggest that a landlord can distrain trade
fixtures. Both predate Chief Justice Meredith's definitive
description of the status of a trade fixture in Stark v. T. Eaton
Co. et al, supra. Furthermore, Davy v. Lewis did not involve a
distraint by a landlord. It was a dispute between the landlord
and a party claiming the equipment under the tenant's rights to
the equipment as set out in the lease between the tenant and the
landlord. Burns J. held, at p. 30, that the respective rights of
the landlord and those claiming under the tenant fell to be
determined by the terms of the lease which declared the property
to be the &quot;sole and absolute property&quot; of the tenant. He held
that in those circumstances the equipment was the property of the
tenant throughout the term of the lease and the tenant could
remove it from the leased premises and sell it at any time. He
said, at p. 30:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Whether the law would make all this
          machinery trade fixtures, and liable to rent,
          or not, the parties, in my opinion, have
          completely separated the right of property
          from the freehold, even though the steam
          engine and parts of the machinery were
          annexed to it, and they have intentionally
          preserved its character of chattels under all
          circumstances. That character was not to
          commence at the expiration of the lease, or
          when the lessee should sever it from the
          freehold, but was to be at once, at the
          commencement of the term, and so remain. ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] Davy v. Lewis stands for the proposition that as between the
landlord and tenant, the terms of the lease govern their
respective rights to property described in the lease. The lease
made it clear that the equipment remained the property of the
tenant and could be removed by the tenant at any time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In Howell, supra, at p. 402, Cameron C.J. specifically
declined to determine whether the property was distrainable. He
did, however, suggest that all tenants' fixtures, even if they
had become part of the freehold, were subject to distraint if
they could be returned to the tenant in the same condition they
were in before the distraint. This view seems to be contrary to
the common law as described in Hellawell v. Eastwood et al.,
supra. According to that case, the ability to restore the
property to the tenant in its prior condition was only relevant
if the object in question had not been so attached to the
property as to become part of the freehold. In any event, Chief
Justice Cameron's comments are dicta and somewhat unclear.
Indeed, the authors of Williams and Rhodes, Canadian Law of
Landlord and Tenant, 6th ed., Vol. I at pp. 8-66 cite Howell as
authority for the proposition that trade fixtures are exempt from
distraint.

[13] It has long been established that immoveable fixtures are
not distrainable at common law. Trade fixtures are different from
immoveable fixtures in that they can be restored to the status of
chattels at the option of the tenant. Despite that difference,
trade fixtures have been treated, certainly in this province, as
true fixtures as long as they are attached to and part of the
land. The strong weight of authority supports the position that
as long as trade fixtures are fixtures, they are no more subject
to distraint than immoveable fixtures. The complaint that this
position makes the landlord's right to distrain depend, in some
cases, on matters as inconsequential as a few screws or nails has
validity, but is not a new complaint: see Crossley Brothers
Limited v. Lee, supra. Although the landlord and tenant
relationship is now closely regulated by statute, the Legislature
has not seen fit to abandon the common law distinction between
fixtures and other goods and chattels of the tenant for the
purpose of determining the landlord's right of distraint. Nor has
the Legislature altered the common law definition of fixture
applicable to the law of distraint. As long as the common law
prevails, the manner in which the property is attached to the
land will be a significant consideration when deciding whether
property is subject to distraint.

[14] In the absence of any legislative initiative, I do not think
it would be wise for the judiciary to strike out on a different
course and formulate a new approach to the determination of the
landlord's rights to distrain property on a leased premise. The
present law as to the nature of trade fixtures has been settled
in this province for over 90 years. I am not convinced that a
different approach would yield benefits that would offset the
inevitable uncertainty that a new approach would engender.

[15] Having determined that Dambrot J. correctly held that the
tenant had no right of distraint against the spray booth and
hence no lien, I move to s. 34 of the P.P.S.A. That section
settles priorities between those who have a security interest in
a fixture and those who have an interest in the property to which
the fixture is attached. Section 34(1) provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1)  A security interest in goods that attached,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  before the goods became a fixture
               has priority as to the fixture over
               the claim of any person who has an
               interest in the real property; or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  after the goods became a fixture,
               has priority as to the fixture over
               the claim of any person who
               subsequently acquired an interest
               in the real property, but not over
               any person who had a registered
               interest in the real property at
               the time the security interest in
               the goods attached and who has not
               consented in writing to the
               security interest or disclaimed an
               interest in the fixture.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] The scheme created by s. 34 constitutes a legislative
determination that the annexation of secured goods to realty
should not result in the loss of a security interest which had
attached but had not been perfected prior to the goods becoming
part of the land: Surrey Metro Savings Credit Union v. Chestnut
Hill Homes Inc. (1997), 29 B.L.R. (2d) 43 at 50-51 (B.C.S.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] It was argued that s. 34 applies only to immoveable fixtures
and not to trade fixtures. The case law reviewed above denies the
validity of that distinction. Nor does s. 34 qualify the use of
the word fixture. Indeed, s. 34(3), which gives the secured
interest holder a qualified right to remove the secured goods
from the property, strongly supports the conclusion that s. 34
applies to trade fixtures. I would align myself with those
authorities which have so held: Deloitte &amp; Touche v. 1035839
Ontario Inc., supra; Cormier v. Federal Business Development Bank
(1984), 25 B.L.R. 194 at 205 (Ont. Cty. Ct.). Section 34 of the
P.P.S.A. applies to this case.

[18] Section 34(1)(a) is the applicable subsection. Even though
Atlantic did not perfect its security interest until after
distraint proceedings, it had, under the terms of s. 11 of the
P.P.S.A., an attached security interest at the time the spray
booth was installed on Starmark's property. Starmark had no
interest in the spray booth before it became a fixture. Under the
terms of s. 34(1)(a), Atlantic's attached secured interest had
priority over Starmark's claim which arose out of its interest in
the real property. Atlantic was entitled to reacquire the
property under s. 34.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] After concluding that Atlantic had priority, Dambrot J. went
on to consider the nature of Starmark's interest in the property
(pp. 55-56). As Atlantic had priority over that interest,
whatever it may have been, I find it unnecessary to decide the
exact nature of Starmark's interest in the spray booth.

[20] Dambrot J. also considered Starmark's right to distrain
against the spray booth on the assumption that it was a chattel
and not a trade fixture (pp. 47-53). While I find his analysis of
the arcane language in s. 31(2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act
persuasive, I prefer to leave that issue to a case in which it
actually arises on the facts.

[21] I would affirm the judgment of Dambrot J. In that judgment,
he directed that Starmark could acquire the booth upon payment to
Atlantic of the outstanding balance of the purchase price,
together with interest, costs and expenses as set out in the
judgment. Starmark did not seek to acquire the booth, but instead
appealed that judgment. I would give Starmark 15 days from the
release of this judgment to acquire the spray booth from Atlantic
upon compliance with the terms set out in paragraph 3 of the
judgment of Dambrot J.
[22] The respondent is entitled to its party and party costs on
the appeal.
