    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[1]  This appeal raises the questions when a document is

&quot;under seal&quot; and what constitutes a &quot;specialty&quot; for the

purpose of determining whether the applicable limitation

period is six years or twenty years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  In April 1989 the defendants, Jacqueline and Paul

Iacovoni (&quot;the purchasers&quot;), entered into a written agreement

with Glenellen Homes Limited (&quot;the vendor&quot;) to buy a new home

to be built by the vendor in Aurora, Ontario. The transaction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was to close in June 1990. In May 1990 the purchasers wrote to

the vendor to say that they were financially unable to

complete the purchase and would not close. On the closing date

they waived the necessity of a formal tender.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  The vendor's solicitors then wrote to the purchasers'

solicitor declaring the purchasers to be in breach of the

agreement, stating that their deposits were forfeited and

holding them responsible for any loss suffered on the resale

of the property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  The vendor then itself got into financial difficulty.

This action was brought by the assignee of its receivables in

May 1996. The purchasers pleaded that the vendor's corporate

status had lapsed and that, as a consequence, the plaintiff

had no status to commence or prosecute the action. The

vendor's corporate status was revived in September 1996. The

purchasers then pleaded that the action was statute-barred,

the six-year limitation period having expired in June 1996,

before the revival of the plaintiff's corporate status. The

vendor's position was that the agreement was under seal, that

it was therefore a &quot;specialty&quot; and that the applicable

limitation period was twenty years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  The purchasers then moved to dismiss the action upon a

number of grounds, including:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1)  the claim was statute barred because the plaintiff's
     corporate status had been cancelled at the time the
     claim was issued and was not revived until the
     limitation period had passed;
(2)  the assignment to the plaintiff was invalid for a number
     of reasons;
(3)  the assignment did not include the right to sue;
(4)  the action was champertous.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  The parties agreed that if the limitation defence

succeeded, it would be unnecessary to deal with the other

grounds. Accordingly, the trial judge dealt only with that

defence. Relying on the definition of a &quot;specialty&quot; as a

&quot;contract under seal,&quot; he concluded that the agreement of

purchase and sale was not &quot;under seal&quot; and that it was not a

specialty within the meaning of the Limitations Act, R.S.O.

1990, c. L.15, s. 45(1)(b). He dismissed the action with

costs. His reasons are reported at (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 561.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  I agree with his conclusions. My reasons are set out

below.


FACTS AND ISSUES</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  The agreement in issue is on a printed form bearing the

name of the vendor and of the Toronto Home Builders

Association. The form is six pages long, plus a three-page

appendix. It was entered into first by the purchasers, whose

offer was then accepted by the vendor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  The marginal note beside the last article of the

agreement proper is entitled, &quot;Acceptance.&quot; This article is

followed by a testimonium clause and the two together read as

follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><em>Acceptance</em>	31. This offer shall be irrevocable by
          	the Purchaser until 11:59 p.m. on the

          	time, if not accepted, this offer shall
          	be null and void. If accepted, this
          	offer shall constitute a binding
          	Agreement of Purchase and Sale.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Although the testimonium clause includes the word

&quot;sealed,&quot; there is no indication that any seal of any kind was

ever affixed opposite or near the signature of either

purchaser. Nor is there on this form, as there is on some,

printed brackets or parentheses or the initials L.S., or a

darkened spot resembling a photostatic copy of a law seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] It is not clear whether the corporate seal of the vendor

was affixed to the agreement.


[12] Apart from what was printed and written on the form,

there was no evidence as to the intentions of the parties in

signing the agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] The issue is whether the limitation period in the

circumstances was six years or twenty years. The Limitations

Act, s. 45(1)(b) and (g) provides as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          45. — (1) The following actions shall

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] If the agreement between vendor and purchasers was a

&quot;specialty,&quot; then the time limited for commencing an action

upon it is twenty years. If it is not a specialty, then the

document a specialty?&quot;</font></pre>

[15] The Dictionary of Canadian Law, Second Edition, Carswell

1995, provides the following definitions:


          SPECIALTY. n. A contract under seal.
          SPECIALTY CONTRACT. A contract under seal.
          SPECIALTY DEBT. 1. A bond, mortgage or
          debt which one secures by writing under
          seal. 2. &quot;...[S]ometimes used to denote
          any contract under seal, but it is more
          often used in the sense of meaning a
          specialty debt, that is, an obligation
          under seal securing a debt or a debt due
          from the Crown or under statute....&quot;

[17] In Royal Bank of Canada v. Kiska, [1967] 2 O.R. 379

(C.A.) this court dealt with an appeal from a dismissal of a

claim on a guarantee. Kelly J.A., speaking for the majority,

allowed the bank's appeal upon the basis that the guarantee

was not executed under seal. Laskin J.A. dissented and, in the

course of doing so, discussed at length the significance of

the forms used. When the defendant signed the document in

question, there was no wafer seal on it, but one was

subsequently affixed by the bank manager. Laskin J.A.

concluded that the guarantee was not under seal. At pp. 390-91

he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             We are in the field of formality; and
          so long as the doctrine of consideration
          subsists with its present constituents,
          it is commercially useful to have an
          alternative method of concluding a
          binding transaction. The formal contract
          under seal is not as formal today as it
          was in the time of Coke; apart from
          statute (and there is none on the
          subject in Ontario relevant to the
          present case), there has been a
          recognized relaxation of the ancient
          common law requirement of a waxed
          impression. (An account of the origin
          and development of seals will be found
          in Wigmore on Evidence, vol. VII, 3rd
          ed., s. 2161.) Neither wax nor an
          impression is any longer obligatory. A
          gummed wafer is enough when affixed by
          or acknowledged by the party executing
          the document on which it is placed. I
          would hold also that any representation
          of a seal made by a signatory will do.
          The present case is an invitation to be
          satisfied with less than the foregoing.
          We confront the question of how far we
          should, as a common law development,
          relax formality and still affirm that we
          are not enforcing a gratuitous promise
          merely because it is in writing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             The document put forward by the bank
          has the familiar words &quot;Given under seal
          at ...&quot; and &quot;Signed, Sealed and
          Delivered in the presence of.&quot; At the
          end of the dotted line for the signature
          of the executing party is the bracketed
          word &quot;seal&quot;. Neither the words &quot;Given
          under seal&quot; nor the formula of &quot;Signed,
          Sealed and Delivered&quot; suffice, even when
          taken collectively [sic], make a
          signatory chargeable under a sealed
          instrument when it has not in fact been
          executed under seal. The respective
          words are merely anticipatory of a
          formality which must be observed and are
          not a substitute for it. I am not
          tempted by any suggestion that it would
          be a modern and liberal view to hold
          that a person who signs a document that
          states it is under seal should be bound
          accordingly although there is no seal on
          it. I have no regret in declining to
          follow this path in a case where a bank
          thrusts a printed form under the nose of
          a young man for his signature. Formality
          serves a purpose here and some semblance
          of it should be preserved, especially
          when it is recalled that the common law
          did not require either a testimonium or
          an attestation clause to make a sealed
          instrument enforceable; the operative
          act was the affixing or adoption of a
          seal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] At p. 392 he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             This brings me to the final point,
          namely, whether sufficient formality is
          preserved by the inclusion in the
          printed form of the bracketed word
          &quot;seal&quot;. I think not, because this is
          merely an invitation to place a seal at
          that spot. It affirms the need of
          formality rather than dispensing with
          it: see Thomson v. Skill (1909), 13
          O.W.R. 887. A more difficult situation
          would exist if, instead of the bracketed
          word &quot;seal&quot;, there was an imprint of a
          wafer seal reproduced on the document.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and at p. 393 he concluded as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...I would not equate &quot;indication of a
          seal&quot; with indication of a place to put
          a seal, which is the case here. I favour
          the view expressed in Empire Trust Co.
          v. Heinze, 242 N.Y. at pp. 478-9, that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             There must be something in the nature
             of a seal, some mark to indicate a
             seal affixed to the signatures to
             constitute a document a sealed
             instrument. The intention to seal
             under these circumstances, whether
             expressed or implied does not make a
             seal. The recital &quot;signed, sealed and
             delivered,&quot; etc. or the words
             &quot;whereunto we have affixed our seals&quot;
             do not make a sealed instrument, if as
             a fact nothing is affixed to the
             signatures which the law recognizes as
             a seal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There, by statute, the word &quot;seal&quot; or
          the letters &quot;L.S.&quot; opposite the
          signature were recognized as a seal of a
          person other than a corporation. We do
          not have such a provision here.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Laskin J.A.'s view of the requirements of a document

under seal were followed by Misener J. in his decision in

Corporation of the Township of South-West Oxford v. Bailak

(1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 360. That was an application by the

purchaser of land for specific performance. The issue was

whether or not the agreement was a specialty. The execution

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] At p. 364, Misener J. noted:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Although the photocopy does not
          clearly disclose it, the corporate seal
          of the municipality appears opposite the
          signatures of the reeve and the clerk.
          However, no mark of any form appears
          opposite Mr. Bailak's signature.
          Accordingly, there is nothing at all
          capable of indicating a seal or a
          physical act that could be construed as
          a sealing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] After referring extensively to the reasons of Laskin J.A.

in Royal Bank of Canada v. Kiska, supra, Misener J. said, at

pp. 367-68:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             It may well be that the common law on
          this aspect has proceeded beyond what
          Laskin J.A. thought appropriate — see
          Bank of Nova Scotia v. Paradise Motor
          Inn (Guelph) Ltd. (1982), 30 C.P.C. 183
          (Ont. H.C.J.), at p. 187 — but I am not
          aware of any case that has gone to the
          point of accepting recitals of sealing
          as sufficient to constitute a sealing.
          It is perhaps of some significance that
          the apparent inclination of some judges
          to dispense with all formality of
          sealing appears to be based on the dicta
          of Danckwerts J. in Stromdale &amp; Ball
          Ltd. v. Burden, [1952] Ch. 223, [1952] 1
          All E.R. 59, [1951] 2 T.L.R. 1192 (Ch.
          D.); and, perhaps on the views of Lord
          Justice Cairns in First National
          Securities Ltd. v. Jones, [1978] Ch.
          109, [1978] 2 All E.R. 221, [1978] 2
          W.L.R. 475 (C.A.). Yet the latest
          English authority on the subject, of
          which I am aware, shows no such
          inclination. In TCB Ltd. v. Gray, [1986]
          Ch. 621, [1986] 1 All E.R. 587, [1986] 2
          W.L.R. 517 (Ch. D.), Sir Nicolas Brown-
          Wilkinson V.C. had to decide whether a
          power of attorney was executed in
          accordance with s. 1(1) of the Powers of
          Attorney Act, 1971 (U.K.), c. 27. That
          section declared that an instrument
          creating a power of attorney &quot;shall be
          signed and sealed by, or by direction
          and in the presence of, the donor of the
          power&quot;. At p. 594 All E.R., he said
          this:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             (The document) is signed by the
             defendant and opposite his signature
             there appear the words &quot;signed sealed
             and delivered by the said Victor
             William Arthur Gray in the presence
             of&quot; and then Mr. McGinnis witnesses it
             ... there is no seal or other mark on
             the document to indicate that it has
             been sealed, nor is there any oral
             evidence to suggest that the defendant
             did anything when executing it beyond
             signing it. On the contrary, Mr.
             McGinnis said that the lack of a seal
             or wafer on the document was an
             oversight on his behalf. Approaching
             the evidence on any normal basis, I
             would be unable to find as a fact that
             anything constituting sealing took
             place.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I was pressed by counsel for TCB

             First National Securities Ltd. v.
             Jones [1978] 2 All E.R. 221, [1978]
             Ch. 109 in which the courts have
             adopted a benign approach in deciding
             that a document has been executed as a
             deed. The courts have gone a long way
             towards holding that any document
             delivered as a deed (even though
             nothing is done to the document itself
             at the time of execution) is proved to
             have been executed under seal. Yet no
             case in the High Court has been cited
             to me in which the court has gone as
             far as it would be necessary to go in
             this case, there being nothing to
             indicate that something amounting to
             sealing took place beyond the fact
             that the words of the document refer
             to it having been sealed. If I were to
             hold that this document was in fact
             sealed, I would not only be flying in
             the face of what actually happened,
             but also disregarding the statutory
             requirement that the document should
             be sealed. I think it would be wrong
             to extend the legal fiction any
             further and I decline to do so. If it
             is open to the defendant to raise the
             point, I would hold that the power of
             attorney had not in fact been sealed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             There is nothing in this case to
             indicate a sealing beyond the recitals
             of sealing, and I am not prepared to
             accept that as sufficient in law. I too
             decline to extend the fiction any
             further than it has so far been
             extended.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] There is nothing in our statutes with respect to the

signing of contracts for the purchase or sale of land which

requires that the document be sealed. Nor is there any

statutory equivalent of the legislation referred to by Laskin

J.A. in Royal Bank of Canada v. Kiska whereby the word &quot;seal&quot;

or the letters &quot;L.S.&quot; opposite the signature were recognized

as a seal of a person other than a corporation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] The basic logic underlying the decision below is that the

words &quot;signed, sealed and delivered&quot; anticipate three events —

signing, sealing and delivering. No one would suggest that an

unsigned document was &quot;signed.&quot; Why then should a document

which bears no trace of a seal be deemed to be sealed?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[24] In these circumstances, I agree with Laskin J.A. and

Misener J. that the fiction should not be further extended. I

also agree with the judge below that, in the absence of any

other evidence as to the intention of the purchasers, &quot;mere

recitals are not sufficient to create a contract under seal.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[25] This is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, but in view

of the more general interest in the question &quot;what is a

appropriate.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ARE ALL CONTRACTS UNDER SEAL SPECIALTIES?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[26] As in the case of contracts said to be &quot;under seal,&quot;

there are many decisions on this question which are difficult

to reconcile. I agree with the conclusion of the motions judge

in the instant case that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             The clear trend in the modern case law
          is that while a seal may be a necessary
          condition for a specialty, it is not a
          sufficient condition. Although not
          particularly significant to the issue
          before the court, a number of relatively
          recent cases have held that a contract
          or other instrument bearing a corporate
          seal is not automatically a specialty.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I adopt the following passage from G. Mew, The Law of

Limitations (Toronto, Butterworths, 1991) at p. 139:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             It is accordingly the nature of the
          claim, and not only the formalities of
          execution of the contract giving rise to
          the claim, which determines whether an
          action is an action upon any bond or
          specialty.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Perhaps the most helpful authority in the present context

is the one referred to in the dictionary definition of

speciality which appeared earlier in these reasons, namely, R.

v. Williams, [1942] A.C. 541, an appeal from this court. The

issue concerned the location of shares in a company for

succession duty purposes. The company was incorporated in

Ontario and the shares were owned by a testator who died

domiciled in the State of New York. The head office of the

company was in Ontario and it had two offices, one in Ontario

and one in New York State. The share certificates were, at all

material times, physically located in the State of New York

and were under the seal of the company. It was argued that,

being under seal, they were specialities and therefore located

where the certificates were found. In the course of deciding

that the shares were not specialties, Viscount Maugham, on

behalf of the Privy Council, said, at pp. 554-56:

             [1]  It will be convenient at this place to deal with the
          contention that the certificates are specialties on the ground
          that they are under the seal of the company, and that the
          shares were therefore situate in Buffalo. This was held to be
          the case by the judgment of Masten J.A. on the authority of
          two Irish cases (In re Drogheda Steam Packet Co., Ld. [(1903)
          1 Ir. R. 512]; Smith v. Cork &amp; Bandon Ry. Co. [(1870) Ir. R. 5
          Eq. 65], and of In re Artizans' Land &amp; Mortgage Corporation
          [[1904] 1 Ch. 796].  These cases have not escaped criticism,
          as Masten J.A. himself observed, but whatever view may be
          taken as to their authority they do not justify the conclusion
          that a certificate for shares in a company is for general
          purposes a specialty. The word &quot;specialty&quot; is sometimes used
          to denote any contract under seal, but it is more often used
          in the sense of meaning a specialty debt, that is, an
          obligation under seal securing a debt, or a debt due from the
          Crown or under statute: see Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney-
          General for Alberta [[1930] A.C. 144]. Such an obligation was
          for centuries treated as very different from an ordinary debt.
          Indeed, the act of creating a specialty by deed was at one
          time possible only to men of the highest rank. Unlike debt, it
          was enforced by an action of covenant: Holdsworth, A History
          of English Law, 3rd ed., vol. iii., p. 417. The deed itself
          was the foundation of the action, the original debt, if any,
          being merged. The terms of the deed were conclusive. Specialty
          debts till recent times conferred special rights. They used to
          rank in the administration of the estate of a deceased person
          in priority to simple contract debts; and, unlike such debts,
          were enforceable against the real estate. They were said to be
          &quot;of a higher nature&quot; than debts by contract. It is, therefore,
          not surprising that specialty debts by deed were treated from
          an early date as bona notabilia where the deeds were found at
          the time of the death, unlike ordinary debts which were said
          &quot;to follow the person of debtor.&quot; That this is still the rule
          was decided in the House of Lords in the well-known case of
          Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope [[1891] A.C. 476], where an
          interesting passage from Wentworth on the Office of Executors
          (1763), pp. 45, 47, 60 (1.) was referred to and followed: see
          also Toronto General Trusts Corporation v. The King [[1919]
          A.C. 679]. It may be useful to note that the situs of the
          specialty debt was originally one of considerable importance,
          because of the different prerogatives of the Archbishops of
          Canterbury and York. If there were assets in both provinces,
          there had to be several administrations, and administration in
          one was void as to the goods situate in the other: see
          Swinburne on Wills, 7th ed., vol. ii., p. 790 et seq. The rule
          as to situs had no meaning except in the cases where the
          specialty was an asset.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Their Lordships are concerned here merely with the question
          whether the certificates being under seal can be treated as 
	  establishing that the shares of the testator must be regarded
	  as situate where the certificates were found at the death of
	  the testator. They plainly are not specialty debts. They do
          not contain any express obligation or promise. As Lord Cairns
	  observed in Shropshire Union Railways &amp; Canal Co. v. The Queen
	  [(1875) L.R. 7 H.L. 496, 509], the certificate was not the 
	  title, but evidence of the title, to the shares: see also
	  Attorney-General v. Higgins per Martin, B. [2 H. &amp; N. 339].
	  Being little more than pieces of paper evidencing the right to
	  shares in the company it is impossible to regard them as taking
	  the modern place of &quot;notable goods.&quot; The ancient rules as to
	  situs of specialty debts have no real application in such a
          case. It should be added that the view that ordinary certificates
	  for shares are not specialty debts has been assumed to be
	  correct in a number of decided cases both in Canada and in
	  England and in a much greater number of cases where there
	  has been no litigation.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Whether a construction contract, executed under corporate

seals, is a specialty for statute of limitations purposes was

decided in Suburban Construction Ltd. v. Nfld.

&amp; Labrador Housing Corp. (1987), 19 C.P.C. (2d) 43. After

referring to R. v. Williams, Morgan J.A., speaking for the

court, said at pp. 46-47:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             I agree with O'Regan J. that not every
          document signed by a corporation by the
          affixing its corporate seal would become
          a specialty. When the seal of a
          corporation is affixed to a contract
          made by the corporation, it has the same
          effect as the signature of an
          individual. However, any contract, which
          if made between private persons would by
          law be required to be under seal, may be
          made on behalf of a company in writing
          under its common seal. Whether what
          would ordinarily be a simple contract is
          transformed into a contract by specialty
          by execution under seal can only be
          determined having regard to the
          intention of the parties as evidenced
          and the true construction of the
          document in question.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             In this case, the learned trial Judge
          centred his attention on the formalities
          of execution of the document rather than
          on the nature of the claim. He concluded
          that the document, being under seal,
          created a specialty. The logical result
          attendant on that conclusion is that any
          contract under seal creates a specialty
          for all purposes within the meaning of
          the statute. No authority has been cited
          nor am I aware of any that supports such
          a conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Although the word &quot;specialty&quot; is
          sometimes used to denote any contract
          under seal, it does not follow that
          every action arising out of a contract
          under seal is an action on a specialty
          within the meaning of the Statute of
          Limitations. The context limits the
          &quot;specialty&quot;, contemplated by the
          Legislature, to that on which an action
          for debt lies. The specialty is the
          undertaking to pay under seal and the
          action is taken, not on the debt, but on
          the obligation. The terms of the deed
          securing the debt is conclusive. The
          statute does not extend to damages on a
          covenant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             In this case, the claim is for an
          amount in excess of the accepted tender
          price as well as for general damages.
          Such causes of action, though arising
          from a contractual relationship, are not
          actions on a &quot;bond or other specialty&quot;
          as contemplated by the statute and do
          not fall within the statutory limitation
          period of 20 years. They are actions
          taken on a simple contract and are
          governed by the six-year limitation
          period.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             For the foregoing reasons I would
          allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
          appealed and direct that the limitation
          period for the present action is six
          years from the time the cause of action
          accrued. Costs on appeal and in the
          Court below will be costs in the cause.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Misener J., in South-West Oxford v. Bailak, supra, relied

on Suburban to come to the same conclusion. At pp. 368-69 of

his reasons, he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             I have said enough to dispose of this
          application, but I do not wish to leave
          the impression that I necessarily agree
          with counsel in their characterization
          of the first issue. As I said at the
          outset, both counsel take the position
          that if Mr. Bailak's execution of the
          agreement dated August 1, 1972 was under
          his seal, then the obligation imposed
          upon him by para. 7 thereof is a
          specialty obligation. I am aware of the
          fact that both the 2nd and 3rd editions
          of Halsbury's Laws of England (London:
          Butterworths) and the 3rd edition of The
          Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (Toronto:
          Carswell) support their position.
          However, I am not convinced that the
          authorities support that position. I
          refer to R. v. Williams, [1942] A.C.
          541, [1942] 2 All E.R. 95, [1942] 3
          D.L.R. 1, [1942] 2 W.W.R. 32l, a
          judgment of the Judicial Committee of
          the Privy Council on appeal from the
          Ontario Court of Appeal, and to
          Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Housing
          Corporation v. Suburban Construction
          Ltd. (1987), 19 C.P.C. (2d) 43, 38
          D.L.R. (4th) 150, a judgment of the
          Newfoundland Court of Appeal. I think it
          is at least arguable on the strength of
          these cases, that the word &quot;specialty&quot;
          as it appears in s. 45(1) means a
          covenant that secures a debt, and not a
          covenant that creates neither a debt nor
          an obligation that bears any
          relationship to a debt. The specialty,
          so defined, has its own peculiar history
          in the common law. When the first
          Limitation Act was passed in England in
          1623 [Limitation Act, 1623 (Eng., 21 Ja.
          1), c. 16], the specialty was excluded.
          Indeed an action &quot;of covenant or debt
          upon any bond or other specialty&quot; was
          not the subject-matter of any limitation
          in England until the passage of the
          Civil Procedure Act in 1833 [Civil
          Procedure Act, 1833 (U.K., 3 &amp; 4 Will.
          4), c. 42]. This limitation was then
          imported verbatim into Upper Canada,
          later to be condensed into the form in
          which it now appears in s. 45. I think
          that the specialty may now be said to be
          an anachronism, and I question whether
          it is right to breathe life into it by
          broadening its definition to embrace
          every obligation under seal.
