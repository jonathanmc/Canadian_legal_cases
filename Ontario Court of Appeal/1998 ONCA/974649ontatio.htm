    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosure  finding that the failure to disclose the  prosecution</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The  court refused to stay the proceeding but rather  ruled</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  For  purposes  of  this  appeal,  the  Crown  concedes  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  the Crown's failure to make proper disclosure infringed
          the appellants' Charter rights described by the Supreme
          Court of Canada in R. v. Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C.
          (3d) 1. In that case, the court held that the right to
          disclosure is one of the components of the right to
          make full answer and defence which in turn is a
          principle of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of
          the Charter;
     (b)  the provincial offences court had jurisdiction to find
          there had been a breach of the Charter. This position
          is consistent with the view that trial judges in extant
          cases are in the best position to address issues of
          alleged breaches of an accused's rights under the
          Charter to a fair trial or to make full answer and
          defence. See for example R. v. Mills (1986), 29 D.L.R.
          (4th) 161 at 173-74.
     (c)  The provincial offences court was a court of competent
          jurisdiction under s. 24(1) of the Charter to make the
          order compelling disclosure of the document in
          question. This authority flows from the broader power
          of the provincial offences court to stay proceedings in
          appropriate circumstances which emanates from its power
          to control its own process and from s. 46(2) of the POA
          which confers on a defendant the right to make full
          answer and defence. See R. v. Young (1984), 13 C.C.C.
          (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The only issue raised on this appeal is whether the provincial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offences  court  had jurisdiction to make the  cost  order.  That</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction depends on whether the provincial offences court  is</font></pre>

          of  the  Charter  has  been  the  subject  of
          consideration  in  a number  of  cases.   The
          weight of authority is that s. 24(1) does not
          create courts of competent jurisdiction,  but
          merely  vests  additional  powers  in  courts
          which  are  already  found  to  be  competent
          independently of the Charter. We  agree  with
          Mr.  Doherty that a court is competent if  it
          has  jurisdiction, conferred by statute, over
          the person and the subject-matter in question
          and,  in addition, has authority to make  the
          order sought. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may  be a disadvantage in that procedural objections which  might</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant who has been misled will have been prejudiced.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter  of the section and provides a remedial authority that  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some  instances  would be a fair and reasonable response  to  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the purpose of the Act. It is, in effect, a legislative tradeoff.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] For the reasons above, I am of the view, that s. 90(2) of the POA</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">include legal fees.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] &quot;Expenses&quot; is also used in s. 60(2) which provides:</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infringement of the Charter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49]  The  rationale for the third requirement in Mills  is  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Parliament  and  the  legislatures have  the  responsibility  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fixing  the  jurisdiction of the courts. The  Charter  should  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpreted  and  applied  within  that  existing  jurisdictional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">framework. In Mills, McIntyre J. said at p. 171:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          To begin with, it must be recognized that the
          jurisdiction of the various courts of  Canada
          is  fixed by the Legislatures of the  various
          provinces and by the Parliament of Canada. It
          is  not for the judges to assign jurisdiction
          in  respect  of any matters to one  court  or
          another.  This is wholly beyond the  judicial
          reach. In fact, the jurisdictional boundaries
          created  by  Parliament and the  Legislatures
          are  for the very purpose of restraining  the
          courts  by confining their actions  to  their
          allotted spheres. In s. 24(1) of the  Charter
          the  right  has been given, upon the  alleged
          infringement or denial of a Charter right, to
          apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to
          obtain  such  remedy as the  court  considers
          appropriate  and  just in the  circumstances.
          The  Charter has made no attempt  to  fix  or
          limit   the   jurisdiction   to   hear   such
          applications.
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">And further at p. 172, McIntyre J. said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The absence   of  jurisdictional  provisions   and
          directions in the Charter confirms  the  view
          that the Charter was not intended to turn the
          Canadian  legal system upside down.  What  is
          required rather is that it be fitted into the
          existing  scheme of Canadian legal procedure.
          There  is no need for special procedures  and
          rules to give it full and adequate effect.
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The requirement in Mills that a court has &quot;the authority to make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the order sought&quot; is not a requirement that it have authority  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make the order for a Charter breach. That authority flows from s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">24(1).  Rather,  the  requirement is  that  the  court  have  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authority   to  make  the  type  of  order  sought   within   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction  it exercises, independently of the Charter.  If  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were otherwise there would be no need for s. 24(1).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] That being said, the Crown argues that an authority such as that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found  in  s.  90(2), which may only be exercised in limited  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specific  circumstances, is not a sufficient jurisdictional  base</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon which to found remedial authority for Charter breaches under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.  24(1).  The Crown submits that it is necessary to anchor  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.  24(1)  jurisdiction to a more broadly based power  than  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found in s. 90(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] The Crown does not suggest, however, where the line between an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authority that may be exercised in limited circumstances and  one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  broader application should be drawn nor what principle  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apply in determining that one existing jurisdiction is sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and another is not.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] In my view, once it is accepted that s. 24(1) expands or enlarges</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the grounds upon which an existing jurisdiction may be exercised,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there  is  no  reason to distinguish some existing  jurisdictions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from others on the basis of the breadth of circumstances in which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that jurisdiction applies.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54]  Interpreting the third requirement in Mills so that even  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">narrowly based remedial authority conferred independently of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter  is sufficient basis for a court to be competent to  make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  same  type  of  order under s. 24(1), will  result  in  more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternatives being available to courts making remedial orders for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter breaches.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] This has two important advantages; first, it will provide a court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  greater  scope  to address the actual  prejudice  that  has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resulted  from  the  breach it has found to  have  occurred.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme  Court has held that the question of prejudice  resulting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  a Charter breach is a matter that relates to the remedy  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  fashioned under s. 24(1). It has also held that the  remedies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should  be  tailored to the Charter right that has been  breached</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  that  it  is hoped that trial judges will devise imaginative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedies  to  serve  the needs of individual  cases.  See  R.  v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Carosella  (1997), 142 D.L.R. (4th) 595 (S.C.C.) at  612;  R.  v.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supra, at p. 173.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] It is logical that a court with a broader remedial authority is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more  able to fashion a reasonable and appropriate remedy  suited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the circumstances of the particular case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] Second, applying the Mills test so that courts making orders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under s. 24(1) have more remedial options will promote efficiency</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and accessibility to the courts for Charter breaches. There is an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obvious  advantage  if  the court that finds  a  breach  has  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could be exercised. At pp. 270-71, he said:</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     There  is  no statutory authority which authorized

          well  settled, however, that superior  courts
          have the inherent jurisdiction to award costs
          against  the Crown in a criminal  case.  That
          power  has  been exercised only  rarely  and,
          before the advent of s. 24(1) of the Charter,
          could  be  exercised  only  where  there  was
          serious  misconduct  on  the  part   of   the
          prosecution: see R. v. Ouellette  (1980),  52
          C.C.C.  (2d) 336, 111 D.L.R. (3d) 216, [1980]

          (Que. C.A.). Chadwick J. found that there was
          no  misconduct on the part of the Crown which
          would  justify an award of costs  against  it
          based upon pre-Charter jurisprudence.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     He held,   however,  that  24(1)  of  the  Charter
          enlarged the grounds upon which a court could
          exercise  its  discretion  to  grant   costs.
          Section   24(1)  enables  one  whose  Charter
          rights  have  been infringed to  apply  to  a
          &quot;court  of competent jurisdiction&quot;  for  such
          remedy as the court considers appropriate and
          just  in  the  circumstances. If  a  superior
          court  of criminal jurisdiction did not  have
          inherent jurisdiction to award costs  against
          the  Crown,  it  would not  be  a  &quot;court  of
          competent  jurisdiction&quot;  to  grant  a  costs
          remedy  for  the infringement  of  a  Charter
          right. However, such a court has jurisdiction
          to  award  costs  against  the  Crown  in   a
          criminal  case and, in my opinion, the  clear
          effect  of s. 24(1) is to enlarge the grounds
          upon which that jurisdiction can be exercised
          to include a Charter infringement, along with
          misconduct by the prosecution.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     In my   view,  there  is  no  material  difference
          between  the situation of the superior  court
          and   that  of  the  Provincial  Court.   The
          Provincial  Court prior to the Charter  could
          award  costs  against the  Crown,  albeit  in
          limited  circumstances.  These  circumstances
          were  circumscribed by statute, the  Criminal
          Code,  whereas  in the case of  the  superior
          court it was circumscribed by common law.  In
          any   event,   the   Provincial   Court   had
          jurisdiction to grant the remedy of costs  as
          codified  in ss. 601(5), 803(4),  809(1)  and
          840 of the Criminal Code. The Charter has not
          enlarged this jurisdiction, but rather to use
          Galligan  J.A.'s words, &quot;the clear effect  of
          s. 24(1) is to enlarge the grounds upon which
          that jurisdiction can be exercised to include

          does not say where the court must derive  its

          whether  the  court derives its  jurisdiction
          from  its  inherent  jurisdiction  which   is
          circumscribed  by the common law,  or  if  it
          derives  jurisdiction from statute, which  is
          circumscribed    by   statute.    Both    had
          jurisdiction  prior to the Charter  to  award
          the  remedy  of costs against the Crown.  The
