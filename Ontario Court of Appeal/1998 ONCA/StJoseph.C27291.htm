    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">COMMISSIONER'S APPEAL RE THE HOUSING CORPORATION

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   In  this appeal, the Divisional Court held that the Housing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation's land was exempt from municipal taxation pursuant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.3.12  of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.3l (&quot;the  Act&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  only  issue in this appeal is whether the land  in  question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meets  the  criteria of that section for exemption from taxation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  law  is clear that when a taxpayer claims an exemption  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taxation  he or she has the onus of showing that he or she  comes</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RELEVANT FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The  Housing  Corporation  is  the  owner  of  the  subject</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property, which comprises 59 residential apartment units used  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accommodate senior citizens. This is the only undertaking of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Housing Corporation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The 59 apartments comprising the property, which is known as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Marie  de la Ferre Apartments, are all allocated  to  senior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">citizens,  defined for this facility as individuals 59  years  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">age  or  older or couples where one spouse is 59 years of age  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">older.  They  are  allocated in accordance  with  a  Target  Plan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approved  by  the  Ministry of Housing: 3l to households  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Deep  Core  Need&quot;  category;  10  of  the  &quot;Shallow  Core  Need&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">category; 6 of the &quot;Non-Core Need&quot; category; and 12 where  market</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rent  is charged. Thus, it is clear that 20% of the occupants  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  apartments pay market rent. The balance all pay rent  geared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to income.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The apartment complex is built on land which was originally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">severed   from   land  owned  by  the  order  of  the   Religious</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospitallers of St. Joseph of Cornwall (the &quot;Order&quot;).  A hospital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was originally located on the severed land, and operated by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Order, was moved to another location and the land was sold by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Order  to the Housing Corporation at a price of  $l,050,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The hospital buildings were converted to the apartment complex as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it  now exists at a price of $2,582,719. All capital funding  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  for  by a mortgage to the Ontario Housing  Corporation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The income to operate the complex is derived from rentals paid by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">residents,  parking  charges, and  charges  for  use  of  laundry</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities.  An annual administration fee is paid  to  the  Order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which, we were informed, is responsible for managing the complex.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">We were informed that the fee is approximately $60,000. An annual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">budget  is  presented  to  the  Ministry  of  Housing,  and  when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approved, the Ministry pays to the Housing Corporation an  amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficient   to  make  up  the  shortfall  between   income   and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenditures. As an example, in 1993 the amount actually paid  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">government was $483,176. Part of the expenses claimed to make  up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  shortfall included $437,749 paid as interest on the mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the property. Other expenses were administrative overhead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(which   must  represent  the  management  fee  for  that  year),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance,   maintenance  wages  and  benefits,   materials   and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">services,   municipal  taxes,  utilities,  and   &quot;other&quot;.   Total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenditures, including mortgage payments, amounted to $664,296.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  government subsidies are not referable  to  individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">units, but are blanket subsidies resulting, at least partly, from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">less  than  market rentals paid by low and middle  income  senior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">citizens.  In  fact, the evidence does not indicate  whether,  if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">market  rental  were  paid by all tenants, the  income  would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficient   to  cover  the  costs  set  out  in  the   financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statements.  This is because approximately 66%  of  the  cost  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operation  involves  payments on the mortgage  financing  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">total  purchase  price of the realty and the renovations  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">buildings.  In  effect, it appears from the materials  before  us</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that cash was received by the Order which established the Housing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation  for  the  purchase of  the  land  from  it  and,  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition,  government  subsidies  pay  annually  for  the   total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financing  of that purchase. In addition, the Order is in  annual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receipt of a management fee for administering the operation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   The  relevant exemption provision -- s.3.12 of the  Act  --</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reads as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Land    of    an    incorporated   charitable
          institution organized for the relief  of  the
          poor,  The  Canadian Red Cross  Society,  St.
          John  Ambulance Association, or  any  similar
          incorporated    institution   conducted    on
          philanthropic  principles  and  not  for  the
          purpose of profit or gain, that is supported,
          in  part at least, by public funds, but  only
          when the land is owned by the institution and
          occupied  and  used for the purposes  of  the
          institution.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The  only issues for us to decide are whether  the  Housing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation is &quot;an incorporated charitable institution  organized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  the  relief  of  the  poor&quot;, or is  a  similar  incorporated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">institution.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    The   Housing  Corporation  is  clearly  an   incorporated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">institution.  If it is organized for the relief of  the  poor,  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think  it  can be assumed, at least in this case, that  it  is  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;charitable&quot; institution. Thus the issue is narrowed  down  to  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration  of whether the institution was organized  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief  of  the poor, or is a similar institution. As I  see  it,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those issues break down into three questions: first, whether  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate  objects  are relevant, or whether  it  is  the  actual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operation of the corporation which should be considered;  second,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if the latter, is the institution organized for the relief of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenants;  and, third, whether it is or is not organized  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief  of  the  tenants,  does the evidence  indicate  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenants are poor?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  Are the corporate objects relevant?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The corporate objects of the Housing Corporation, as set out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in its Letters Patent, are:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          To provide and operate non-profit residential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          accommodation   and   incidental   facilities</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          thereto exclusively for:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)  persons of low income;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii)  senior  citizens primarily  of  low  or</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          or modest income;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          or any combination of subparagraphs (i), (ii)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and (iii).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  Looking at the corporate objects, particularly of a  single</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose  corporation  such as this, should be  of  assistance  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining whether the institution was &quot;organized for the relief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the poor&quot;. However, it goes without saying that they cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusive;   otherwise  determining  whether  an  exemption   is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available  would depend purely on the drafting of  the  corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objects.  It  is the property for which exemption is claimed  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  actual  operation and administration which  are  of  primary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern in determining whether the exemption criteria are met.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  In this case, the facts indicate that apartments are  being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">let  to  senior citizens of low and modest income, and  to  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">senior  citizens presumably not in those categories, as they  pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">market value rent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)   Is  the  institution organized for the relief  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenants?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  This  question is important because, if the institution  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  organized  for  the relief of the tenants  then  it  doesn't</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter  whether  they  can be categorized as  &quot;poor&quot;  or  not.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider  this to be a vital question on the facts of this  case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  it  is for this reason that the method of administration  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Housing Corporation was outlined earlier in these reasons.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">read  the  words &quot;organized for the relief of the poor&quot;  to  mean</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  it  would  be  the  corporation itself,  by  some  form  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">endeavour  of  the  corporation, which would provide  the  relief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved. In this case, the corporation itself does very  little.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It  raises no funds by efforts of its members for the support  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the institution, such as solicitation of the public or other fund-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raising  projects  or events. It does not manage  the  operation;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  is done by the order of the Religious Hospitallers  of  St.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Josephin  in return for payment of an annual fee of approximately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$60,000. The Housing Corporation is the registered owner  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property which it purchased from the Order, but the purchase  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fully  financed, and the cost of financing is paid for in  total,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  government  funds. From the outset, the actual operation  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administration were organized so that the Housing Corporation has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  nothing  which is for the relief of  the  tenants.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">total  cost  is borne by a combination of the tenants  themselves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and government.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  In my view, the Housing Corporation was not &quot;organized  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  relief  of&quot; the tenants within the meaning of the  exemption</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  Having come to that conclusion, I feel compelled to comment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  one  portion  of the wording of s.3.12 which  I  find  rather</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">peculiar  in  the context in which it is found, and that  is  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">portion  which states, &quot;that is supported, in part at  least,  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public  funds&quot;. I would have thought that, given the  nature  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">function  of  the  institutions which would be seeking  exemption</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  the  section, supported &quot;by public funds&quot; would mean  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  organizations  are supported by appeals to  the  public  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds to assist in their work. It would seem strange to me that a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeals to the general public could not. However, that issue  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised before the Supreme Court of Canada in 1973 in the case  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assessment  Commissioner of the Corporation  of  the  Village  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Stouffville v. Mennonite Home Association of York County et  al.,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1973]  S.C.R.  189. In that case, Spence J.,  speaking  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority,  appears  to  limit the meaning of  the  words  &quot;public</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds&quot; to funds from a government source.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  In  our  case,  all  of the funds to  operate  the  Housing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation project come from the tenants and government sources.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It  is  that fact which, as stated above, compels me to  conclude</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it is not the Housing Corporation which provides relief  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the tenants in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Before leaving this portion of my reasons, I wish to comment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  an issue raised by the Commissioner which questions the whole</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose  of this litigation. On the facts as outlined  above,  if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   Housing  Corporation  were  to  succeed  in  obtaining   an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exemption,  there  would  be no item in  its  statements  showing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal  property taxes as an expense. This would reduce  their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deficit  by  the  amount  of  those  taxes.  However,  since  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provincial government makes up the total amount of that  deficit,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Housing Corporation has nothing obvious to gain in obtaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an  exemption. It appears that the only result is  to  shift  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">burden  of the shortfall, to the extent of the municipal property</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tax  amount,  from  the province to the municipality,  which  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">never a party to the arrangement in the first place.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (c)  Are the tenants poor?

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  Having  concluded  that  the Housing  Corporation  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;organized for the relief of&quot; the tenants, it is not necessary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decide whether the tenants are &quot;the poor&quot;. However, because  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  an  appeal from the decision of the Divisional Court,  it  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary  to comment on the statement on p.2 of its  very  short</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is   no  analysis  of  how  the  Divisional  Court  reached  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion,  other than their comment that 80% of the  units  are</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jeannette Despatie, assistant executive director of The Religious</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospitallers  of  St. Joseph of Cornwall, acknowledged  that  the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The fact is that the tenants who do not pay market rent  are</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defining  the  word &quot;poor&quot;. The members of the  Divisional  Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">panel  were obviously willing to take a leap of faith in deciding</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">They  did  not, however, analyse the other aspects of  this  case</font></pre>
