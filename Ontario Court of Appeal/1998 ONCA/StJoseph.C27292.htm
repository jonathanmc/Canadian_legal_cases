    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   The  sole issue in this appeal, as stated in the factum  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant, is &quot;whether Cornwall is entitled to an  exemption</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from municipal taxation for that portion of its lands leased,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available for lease, or otherwise not 'used' by Cornwall.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Reasons of Forget J.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  Forget J. held that both the rented property and the vacant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property were exempt. His two basic reasons were, first, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenants  &quot;are non-profit organizations which are being subsidized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  the  applicant by the payment of nominal rents&quot; and,  second,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that &quot;[o]ccupation and use by others upon payment of a fee, where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  revenue generated is used to maintain the property  for  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charitable  purpose, is occupation and use within the meaning  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.  3(12)&quot;. The Divisional Court upheld Forget J.'s decision, but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did  so  in  a  one page endorsement which did not refer  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rented  or  vacant property at all, but merely  stated  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">residents of the Villa were &quot;poor&quot; within the meaning of  s.3.12,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and therefore the &quot;lands&quot; were exempt from taxation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]   The  Divisional  Court  did  not  address  the  issue   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">segregating  portions  of  the property  for  tax  purposes  and,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore, its endorsement is not of assistance to us. Forget  J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not treat the property as segregated for tax purposes because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the two reasons referred to above.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  Nominal rents charged to tenants

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  I  found nothing in the evidence filed on the motion before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Forget J. to indicate that the tenants were &quot;being subsidized  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the applicant by the payment of nominal rents.&quot; However, even  if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they  were, that fact would not be sufficient to entitle Cornwall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  an  exemption for the rented portion of the land. To  qualify</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for an exemption, it would be necessary for Cornwall to show that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  rented  premises were used for its charitable purposes,  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charitable purposes of some other institution.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)   Rent  used  to  maintain property for  its  charitable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  I  found  nothing in the evidence filed on  the  motion  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicate  that  the  rents generated were used  to  maintain  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  for the charitable purposes of Cornwall. The  financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information filed constituted rental information on each  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases and financial statements for the operation of St. Joseph's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Villa--the home for the aged operated on the property.  The  land</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  owned  by  Cornwall, not by the Villa, and I can only  assume</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the rent was received by Cornwall. It is certainly not shown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  any of the revenue information relating to the Villa. We were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given  information as to the purposes of Cornwall, but none  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to whether the rents were used for those purposes.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Exclusive, constant, or permanent occupation of the premises

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  Cornwall argues that, since it is conceded that the portion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the lands occupied by the Villa is &quot;occupied and used for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes of&quot; Cornwall, and thus is exempt from taxation,  all  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  land  should  be  exempt  because  exclusive,  constant,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permanent occupation by the taxpayer is not necessary to  qualify</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  exemption.  The  cases cited by Cornwall involve  situations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where  portions of land are occupied by institutions  or  persons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other  than  the  taxpayer. It is Cornwall's position  that  they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stand  for  the propositions that it is not necessary to  qualify</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  exemption that the land be exclusively occupied and used  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  taxpayer itself, nor is it necessary that occupation by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taxpayer  be constant or permanent, nor is it necessary that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taxpayer occupy all of the premises for its own purposes.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  City  of Toronto v. Governors of University of Toronto,  et</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">al.,  [1946]  O.R. 215, 2 D.L.R. 532 (C.A) is a decision  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario Court of Appeal involving an unusual arrangement for  use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  premises on Yonge Street in the City of Toronto leased to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board  of  Governors  of  University of Toronto.  The  university</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established  a school of physical and health education  and  used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  necessary space in the building for that purpose. By  letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  the  Bursar  and Secretary, the Board of Governors  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">University  gave  permission to the  Eaton  Girls'  Club  to  use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available portions of the premises at such times as they were not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being  used for the purposes of the physical and health education</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">department  of  the  university. The relevant  exemption  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assessment Act at that time was s.4.3, which read:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.     The  buildings  and  grounds  of   and
          attached  to or otherwise bona fide  used  in
          connection  with and for the  purposes  of  a
          university...so  long as such  buildings  and
          grounds  are  actually used and  occupied  by
          such   institution,  but  not  if   otherwise
          occupied.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  It  should  be  noted  first  that  there  are  significant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">differences  in the exemption provisions involved.  Section  3.12</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires  the  person claiming exemption to be the owner  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">land,  while  the  provision in the University  of  Toronto  case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires  only use and occupation. The portion of the reasons  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that case which Cornwall relies on is found on pages 221 and 222,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the court, states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  use made by them [the Eaton Girls' Club]
          of  the  premises is not in any way connected
          with or for the purposes of a university.  It
          may  be, too, that the number of such members
          who actually use the premises is greater than
          the  number of university students who do so,
          and  that a larger part of the space is  used
          by  them  than is used by the Board. But  the
          use of a portion -- even the larger portion -
          -  of  the  premises for purposes other  than
          those  of  a  university does not necessarily
          preclude  a  finding  that  the  building  is
          actually used by such institution within  the
          meaning and intent of the legislation.  I  do
          not  read  the  words in the subsection,  &quot;so
          long  as  such  buildings  and  grounds   are
          actually   used   and   occupied   by    such
          institution, but not if otherwise  occupied&quot;,
          to  mean  &quot;so  long  as every  part  of  such
          building and grounds is used and occupied  by
          such   institution,  but  not  if   otherwise
          occupied or used in part&quot;. If such a  meaning
          had been intended, appropriate language would
          no  doubt have been used to make that meaning
          plain.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  At  first  blush  those words might  seem  to  apply  to  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation  such as ours. However, I am of the view that  they  do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not.  First,  Laidlaw J.A. goes on to state that the question  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether  a person is an occupier or within an exemption provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  a  question  of fact. He then states that two  principles  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupation  can  be  gleaned  from  the  cases  --  first,   that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupation depends on the right of regulation and control of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises in question, and second, that occupation does not depend</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  legal title. The second principle is irrelevant in our  case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because Cornwall does have legal title, and because it must  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">title  to fit within the statutory provision with which our  case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deals.  The first principle is, however, of some significance  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">our  case. There is no evidence that the leases in this case were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  of the usual type which give occupation, and thus regulation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  control, to the tenant within the terms of the lease. It has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given up those rights.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In the University of Toronto case regulation and control  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  building was not given up by the University. The letter sent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the Eaton Girls' Club made that abundantly clear. It stated:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          You  are  at liberty until further notice  to
          use  for  the purpose of your Club, available
          portions  of our premises...at such times  as
          we  are not using all of the premises for the
          purpose  of the Physical and Health Education
          Department of the University....
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  Because occupation is a question of fact in each individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, it is clear that the University of Toronto case, given  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unusual facts, is of assistance not in the sense of presenting an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analogous  fact situation but, rather, in articulating principles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to apply in considering the question of occupation.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In National Ballet School v. Assessment Commissioner, Region</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">No.  9, et al. (1979), 10 M.P.L.R. 208 (H.C.J.), Grange J.  dealt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the question of exemption from taxation of l.2 acres of land</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on which was located a large house which was used by the National</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exemption  provision was somewhat different  from  the  one  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which we are dealing, but the major issue in the case was whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  facts  of  use by the National Ballet School  satisfied  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement  that  &quot;such grounds and buildings  are  exempt  only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">while actually used and occupied by&quot; the National Ballet School.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]  Grange J. considered that the real difficulty in that  case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  the extent of the use of the property by the National Ballet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">School.  In  dealing with the portion of the exemption  provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  is similar, although not identical to ours, he stated,  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p.211:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          They  [the  words of the exemption provision]
          do  not  require &quot;constant&quot; use or  &quot;regular&quot;
          use;  nor  even  do they require  &quot;exclusive&quot;
          use.  Nor  is there any requirement that  all
          the  property be used or that it be used  all
          of the time.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  The  principle of &quot;right of regulation and control  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises&quot;  as articulated in the University of Toronto  case  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  referred  to  by Grange J., although he  did  discuss  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles in that case which were relevant to his decision.  His</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case  involved  use which was not constant in respect  of  either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time or space. It did not involve relinquishing any regulation or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control of the premises as in our case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  The  last case relied on by Cornwall on this  issue  is  Re</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Governing Council of the Salvation Army, Canada East and Regional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assessment Region No. 22 et al. (1983), 21 M.P.L.R. 99  (H.C.J.),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  decision  of Reid J. of the Ontario High Court of Justice.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that case 200 acres of rural land was owned by Salvation Army. On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the property it operated a place of refuge for the rehabilitation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of destitute alcoholics and drug addicts, called &quot;Hope Acres&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The only real issue in the case was whether 125 acres of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  contracted  out to a farmer was exempt  from  taxation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This  is the closest to our situation of all those cited  to  us.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  statutory provision involved is the same, and the facts  are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">similar   in  some  respects.  There  are,  however,  two   major</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">differences. First, the evidence indicated that all profits  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  contract with the farmer were to be used for the  charitable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes  of  the Salvation Army -- specifically to help  finance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  operation  of Hope Acres. As stated earlier,  there  was  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence  in  this case that the rental income was used  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charitable purposes of Cornwall. Second, it was the view of  Reid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.  that  the lease to the farmer would not grant to  the  farmer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclusive  or constant possession. The indications are  otherwise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in our case.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at  the  time  of the application of Cornwall, were not  actually</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  not  necessary that all of the premises be in use all of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time  in order to satisfy the test of occupation and use for  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESULT

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In my view, the portions of the land which are rented out to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  The portions of the premises which are not actually in  use</font></pre>
