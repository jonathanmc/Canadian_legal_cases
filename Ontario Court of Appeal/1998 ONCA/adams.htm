<p>[1] The trial judge did not err in refusing to permit a question which, as 
  framed, did not provide a basis for showing that the witness had a motive to 
  favour the prosecution. He did not preclude questioning in related areas that 
  might have had some probative value. We have not been persuaded that there is 
  a basis for interfering with the convictions which, in our view, are supported 
  by the evidence.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal from convictions is dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to sentence, we are of the view that the trial judge erred 
  in principle and placed undue emphasis on general deterrence. This appellant 
  had no prior record and, as found by the trial judge, the offence was out of 
  character and there was no risk that the appellant would re-offend. The amount 
  of drug involved was very small and there is absolutely nothing to suggest any 
  kind of commercial endeavour. The appellant has been on bail now for over four 
  years without incident. He has usually been either gainfully employed or attending 
  school. In our view, these unusual circumstances warrant a suspended sentence.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed 
  and the sentence on count number 1 is varied to a suspended sentence with six 
  months' probation on the statutory terms. We see no need for any additional 
  conditions. The sentence on count number 3 is reduced to time served.</p>
