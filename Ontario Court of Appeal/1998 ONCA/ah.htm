    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant raised two grounds of appeal against
conviction, the first being that the trial judge erred in
refusing to stay the proceedings, the second that the proceedings
resulted in a miscarriage of justice due to ineffective
representation by trial counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    STAY OF PROCEEDINGS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant was charged in 1993 with a number of sexual
offences involving his daughter. According to the complainant,
the abuse commenced in 1972 or 1973, when she was four or five
years old and it continued until 1980, when she was 12.
[3]  Although the complainant disclosed the abuse to her mother
in 1981, it was not until 1985 that she reported the matter to
the police. An investigation followed, and the complainant
provided the police with two lengthy statements in which she
described the various incidents of sexual misconduct between her
and the appellant.
[4]  Much as the investigating officer considered the complainant
to be a reliable and believable witness, after consulting with
Crown counsel, it was felt, for reasons which proved to be
unsound, that it would be difficult to secure a conviction
against the appellant. Accordingly, a decision was made not to
prosecute and this was brought to the attention of the
complainant and the appellant.
[5]  From 1985 to 1993, the file lay dormant. However, in 1993,
at the instance of the complainant, the investigation was re-
opened and the appellant was charged shortly thereafter. By this
time the original investigative file no longer existed. It had
been shredded in 1991 by the investigating officer in accordance
with the Ontario Provincial Police guidelines governing the
maintenance and destruction of inactive files.
[6]  It is against this backdrop that the appellant applied to
the trial judge for a stay of proceedings. He raised two grounds
in support of his application.
[7]  First, he contended that his right to make full answer and
defence had been irreparably prejudiced as a result of the
destruction of the complainant’s 1985 statements to the police.
Second, he argued that the current prosecution was unfair in the
sense that it contravened fundamental notions of justice and
thereby undermined the integrity of the judicial process.
[8]  With the concurrence of counsel, the trial judge reserved
his decision on the stay application until after he had heard all
of the evidence on the trial proper. Notably, the appellant did
not testify on the stay application or the trial, nor did he call
any evidence.
[9]  After considering the whole of the evidence and the relevant
legal principles, the trial judge concluded that the application
was without merit and he refused to stay the proceedings.
[10] On appeal, counsel for the appellant advised the court that
she was not pursuing the unfair prosecution issue and that her
sole concern related to the appellant’s ability to make full
answer and defence.
[11] In concluding that the destruction of the 1985 statements
did not prevent the appellant from making full answer and
defence, the trial judge instructed himself in accordance with
the test laid down by this court in R. v. A.(D.) (1992), 76
C.C.C. (3d) 1 per Dubin C.J.O. at p. 8:</font></pre>
      <blockquote>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There must be an air of reality that the missing 
evidence would in fact and in a material way assist
the accused.</font></pre>
      </blockquote>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Counsel for the appellant took no issue with this test.
Having regard to R. v. La (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.),
she readily conceded that in order to succeed, the appellant bore
the onus of establishing actual prejudice to his right to make
full answer and defence.
[13] Having instructed himself correctly on the law, the trial
judge turned his attention to the evidence to determine whether
there was a real likelihood that the 1985 statements contained
material inconsistencies capable of impacting upon the
appellant’s right to make full answer and defence. To this end,
he tested the complainant’s trial testimony against all of the
surrounding background facts and circumstances, paying particular
attention to the following items of significance:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    any apparent or potential inconsistencies in her testimony;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    her fragile emotional and psychological state as a teenager;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    the fact that she had complained prior to the onset of her
  psychological difficulties and that her present allegations were
  not the product of recovered memory;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    her current psychological state;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    her present ability to recall the contents of the 1985
  statements;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    her inability to recall many of the peripheral details
  surrounding the various incidents of abuse; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    the fact that her evidence went basically unchallenged,
  apart from one incident which formed the basis of counts 7 and 8
  in the indictment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In the final analysis, it was the trial judge’s considered
opinion that, “there is little, if anything, in the complainant’s
testimony at trial capable of raising a serious suspicion  that
her earlier statements may have contained material
inconsistencies.” [Emphasis added.]
[15] In our view, it was open to the trial judge to make that
finding and we see no basis for interfering with it.
[16] Accordingly, we have not been persuaded that the trial judge
committed any reviewable error in refusing to grant the stay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">INEFFECTIVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The appellant filed fresh evidence on the appeal designed to
show that his trial counsel was incompetent and that the
incompetent representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
[18] Apart from the issues arising out of the April 12, 1995
letter from Dr. Moran, which we propose to address shortly, we
see no need to engage in a detailed analysis of the remainder of
the fresh evidence. In essence, we are asked to find that the
trial counsel was incompetent because he failed to cross-examine
and lead evidence on several matters that may have revealed
inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant and the
investigating officer. We are further asked to find that had
these possible inconsistencies been explored, they may have
affected the trial judge’s decision on the stay application or
his ultimate verdict.
[19] Before attending to the specifics of the Dr. Moran letter,
we wish to make it known from the outset that we see no merit in
this ground of appeal.
[20] With respect to the competence of counsel, we are far from
satisfied that the appellant received ineffective representation
at trial. Based upon trial counsel’s affidavit and his ensuing
cross-examination, it is apparent that in most instances, he
chose, for tactical reasons, not to explore the possible
inconsistencies which the appellant now claims he should have. It
does not lie with this court to second guess tactical decisions
made by trial counsel when, as in this case, it cannot be said
that the decisions were wholly unreasonable.
[21] Assuming, however, that trial counsel was less than
competent in failing to pursue some or all of the lines of
inquiry suggested, the fresh evidence fails to satisfy us that
such cross-examination would have revealed any inconsistencies,
let alone inconsistencies of a kind likely to have affected the
trial judge’s decision on the stay application or his ultimate
verdict.
[22] We now turn to the concerns arising out of the April 12,
1995 letter from Dr. Moran.
[23] By way of background, it is accepted that on February 25,
1991, after the complainant had made her mother aware of the
appellant’s misconduct, Dr. Moran conducted a physical
examination of the complainant in the presence of her mother. The
examination revealed that the complainant’s hymen was broken.
[24] The Crown planned to introduce the results of this
examination as part of its case at trial. For reasons which are
not entirely apparent but likely related to convenience, by
mutual agreement, counsel advised the trial judge that Dr. Moran
would not be called as a witness but instead, a letter under his
signature dated April 12, 1995, would be filed as an exhibit.
[25] Notably, as the record reveals, the letter was not tendered
under s. 655 of the Criminal Code as an admission of fact.
Rather, it was put forward on the basis that the letter
represented what the doctor would have said had he been called as
a witness.
[26] In terms of its content, the letter spoke to the issue of
the broken hymen, which, according to the doctor, although
consistent with penetration by an adult male penis, was also
consistent with penetration by any non-specific blunt object.
[27] The letter took on added significance however, because of
the contents of the introductory paragraph which read as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    I saw Wendy in my office on February 25, 1981, when she 
	was 13 years of age. At that time she told me that her 
	father had sexually assaulted her at age 7. She stated 
	that this had happened on more than one occasion. She 
	had just told her mother and her mother was in 
	attendance with her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] On its face, the introductory paragraph exposed one apparent
discrepancy and another possible one when compared with the
complainant’s trial testimony. The apparent inconsistency related
to the age of the complainant when she was first abused. At trial
and in her earlier statements, the complainant maintained that
the abuse began when she was 4 or 5 years old, not 7.
[29] The possible inconsistency related to the time frame within
which the abuse occurred. According to the complainant’s trial
testimony and her earlier statements, the abuse began in 1972 or
1973, when she was 4 or 5 years old and it continued until 1980
when she was 12. By contrast, it was open to interpret the
information in the introductory paragraph as indicating that the
complainant was only abused at the age of 7, albeit on more than
one occasion. While that interpretation was by no means the only
one available, if accurate, it would no doubt have had a dramatic
impact on the complainant’s overall credibility and the
reliability of her evidence.
[30] The significance of the introductory paragraph was not lost
on defence counsel. Indeed, he confronted the complainant with
the statements attributed to her by the doctor. The complainant
responded by saying that much as she recalled her mother speaking
to the doctor, she could not recall speaking to him herself.
[31] In his ruling on the stay application, the trial judge
addressed the statements attributed to the complainant in the
doctor’s letter and after summarizing the evidence, he concluded
as follows:</font></pre>
      <blockquote>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The doctor’s letter was filed on consent. He was not 
called as a witness. I cannot conclude that this 
possible inconsistency, in the circumstances, raises 
any real prejudice to the defence resulting from 
statements lost in 1985. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
      </blockquote>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In our view, the trial judge cannot be faulted for
describing the potential time frame discrepancy as a possible
inconsistency. Bearing in mind that the doctor was not called as
a witness, the trial judge had no way of assessing his
credibility or reliability, either in terms of his speaking to
the complainant or the accuracy of the statements attributed to
her.
[33] The remaining question, however, is whether, in the
circumstances, trial counsel can be said to have been incompetent
for failing to have the doctor called as a witness.
[34] In his cross-examination, trial counsel explained that much
as he considered calling the doctor, in the end, he chose not to
do so for tactical reasons. In short, his concern related to the
issue of causation. As it was, in the letter, the doctor's
opinion regarding the cause of the broken hymen was neutral.
Given the significance of this issue, trial counsel feared that
if called, the doctor might elaborate and opine that the breakage
was more likely due to penetration by a penis than a blunt
object. Upon reflection, trial counsel was not prepared to take
that risk. In our view, it cannot be said that his decision was
an unreasonable one.
[35] Moreover, we note that for the purposes of the appeal, no
order was sought compelling the doctor to submit to cross-
examination. Accordingly, we are left in the dark as to what the
doctor would say, if asked, about the statements attributed to
the complainant in the introductory paragraph.
[36] In sum, we have not been persuaded that trial counsel was
incompetent, nor have we been satisfied that the appellant
suffered any clear prejudice as a result of the tactical
decisions made by his counsel. In this regard, apart from the
uncontradicted evidence of the complainant, there was compelling
evidence of the guilt of the appellant, particularly the
complainant’s description of his penis, as confirmed by her
mother. It follows, in our opinion,  that the evidence which
trial counsel did not bring forward would not, in any event, have
affected the outcome.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] The appellant has failed to satisfy us that the trial judge
erred in refusing to stay the proceedings and we have not been
persuaded that he received ineffective legal representation.
Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</font></pre></td>
