    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                
[1]  This is a motion brought by Mrs. Airst to dismiss Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Airst's appeal from the order of Wein J. wherein, among other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">things, she ordered Mr. Airst to make an equalization payment to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his wife of an amount well in excess of $600,000. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative Mrs. Airst seeks security for costs of the appeal and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of trial. Two other proceedings between the parties which are the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject of appeal, namely the appeal of Mr. Airst from the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of costs made at trial and the appeal of Mr. Airst from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding of Wein J. that he was in contempt of her order, are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affected by this motion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The parties were married in 1952 and separated in 1982. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial respecting the amount of the wife's equalization payment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lasted twenty-three days and was completed in March 26,1998. Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Airst makes his living buying, owning and selling real estate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properties from which he also derives income through a numbered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company of which he is the sole shareholder.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  When Mr. Airst brought his appeal, Mrs. Airst brought a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion to lift the stay and requested that a portion of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equalization payment be paid to her. Doherty J.A. stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The Respondent concedes on appeal
          (contrary to the position that he took at
          trial ) that the Wife is entitled to an
          equalization payment of about $150,000. He
          contends, however, that it should be payable
          in instalments. Given that position, the
          Wife's circumstances, her need to make
          certain significant capital expenditures and
          the husband's determined resistance to
          anything even approaching a reasoned
          determination of these issues, I think the
          Applicant (Wife) is entitled to the benefit
          of at least part of her judgment immediately.
          The Respondent is a man of means and the
          documents suggest he can access significant
          funds on an as needed basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Doherty J.A. then ordered Mr. Airst to pay Mrs. Airst to pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$50,000 no later than 4:00 p.m. on Monday, October 26, 1998 by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certified cheque delivered to the office of her counsel and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further $50,000 payable in the same manner no later than Monday,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 9, 1998.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  When both amounts remained unpaid Mrs. Airst brought a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion that Mr. Airst be found in contempt and in the alternative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that his appeal be dismissed unless he complied with the order of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Doherty J.A. within 24 hours. On the return of the motion,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel for Mr. Airst asked that the motion be adjourned to give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him an opportunity to cross-examine Margaret Ventura (a person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employed in the wife's counsel's firm) on her affidavit in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support of the motion. On November 5, 1998 Austin J.A. granted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Airst's request and adjourned the motion sine die to enable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the cross-examination to held in court before a judge disposing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the motion as Austin J.A. had indicated this would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">preferable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Mr. Airst also moved to extend the time for moving to vary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the order of Doherty J.A. and to vary that order by extending the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time within which to make the payments totalling $100,000. With</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to that motion Austin J.A. held:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    A judge in chambers has no general
          power to vary the order of another judge in
          chambers. The above mentioned Rules (37.14(6)
          and 59.06(2)(a)) and facts do not give me any
          such power. Accordingly, the motion is
          dismissed with costs fixed at $1500 payable
          forthwith.



[7]  On November 26, 1998, Feldman J. indicated that Mr. Chhabra,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel for Mr. Airst, was requesting an adjournment due to ill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">health arising from epileptic seizures and was not in a position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to conduct a cross-examination or to argue the motion. Feldman J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">granted the adjournment to December 7, 1998 on the condition that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Airst deliver a certified cheque in the amount of $15,000 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mrs. Airst by 4 p.m. that day. In default the appeal was to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">struck. She further ordered that Mr. Chhabra retain an agent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">handle the matter and that the adjournment to Dec 7 was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">peremptory against Mr. Airst. In default of this term the appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was to be struck. Costs fixed at $ 700 were made payable to Mrs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Airst and were to be paid before December 7, 1998 as a condition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of proceeding on that date.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  On December 7, 1998, Mr. Chhabra appeared and advised that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had been unable to retain an agent and that as the matter was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">peremptory to his client he would proceed with the cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination and motion. At that time  he also tendered $700 in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cash to Mrs. Airst's counsel.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Mrs. Airst's counsel drew the court's attention to her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amended notice of motion, namely that she was now seeking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security for costs of the appeal and of trial, as alternative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief to a dismissal of the husband's appeal for failure to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comply with the order of Doherty J.A. and, following cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination of the witness by Mr. Chhabra, the motion then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeded.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] There is no dispute that Mr. Airst has not paid the amounts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was ordered to pay by Doherty J.A. Mr. Airst's position is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he ought not to have his appeal dismissed for failure to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make the $100,000 payment. His position is, essentially, that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is unable to pay. He states that he does not have sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liquid assets to make the payment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Pursuant to the order of Wein J., Mrs. Airst has a security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in Mr. Airst's real estate holdings and he is unable to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sell or mortgage them without her co-operation. She has refused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to co-operate. Mrs. Airst's position is that the husband would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have had sufficient liquid assets to make the payment in whole or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at least in part but, instead, he has dissipated his assets. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition, Mrs. Airst submits that, to the extent the properties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have increased in value since the date of separation, Mr. Airst</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could mortgage the  increased equity in the property. Mrs. Airst</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also points out that while claiming that he is unable to make the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payments ordered, Mr. Airst has steadfastly refused to provide a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recent audited financial statement for the company of which he is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the sole shareholder and which is the source of his rental income</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which is in excess of $300,000 a year.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] From the information available to me I cannot say whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the husband has sufficient liquid assets to meet the order of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Doherty J.A. I am informed that the security over the husband's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assets by Wein J. is in place. I do not have information as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the actual value of the properties or encumbrances on them prior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the wife's security being put in place. I would therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order that, if Mrs. Airst wishes to have the stay lifted, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she postpone her security only to the extent of money actually</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid over to her counsel at that time.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] With respect to the motion for security for costs, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appears to me that there is good reason security for costs should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be ordered pursuant to r. 61.06(1)(c). The trial judge gave full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and considered reasons as to the basis on which she accepted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expert evidence of the value of the properties in question. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are some sixty grounds of appeal advanced and the date of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separation, which was not challenged at trial, is raised as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ground of appeal. The appeal will be a long and expensive one.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The litigation has extended over many years. Over the course of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the proceedings Mrs. Airst brought motions or made requests at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case conferences on 16 occasions to compel Mr. Airst to produce</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial disclosure or to provide Mrs. Airst or her experts with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">access to information or properties and fourteen orders or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreements at case conferences were made for Mr. Airst to provide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such disclosure. Mr. Airst also changed counsel frequently. On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all of the evidence it appears to me that Mr. Airst should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to post security for the cost of this appeal and some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security for the costs of trial. I therefore order that the sum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of $40,000 be posted as security for costs of the appeal and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$60,000 be posted as security for the costs of the trial for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">total of $100,000. Payment of that security is to be made by 4</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p.m. on December 21. Mrs. Airst is to further postpone her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security only to the extent necessary to achieve this result.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Costs of this motion are payable to Mrs. Airst forthwith</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after assessment and in any event of the cause.</font></pre></td>
