  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In arriving at its conclusion that the 1996
    plans were invalid, the Divisional Court considered the phase-in provisions in
    Appendix VIII of the Manual and found them to be <i>ultra vires</i>. Accordingly,
    the court quashed the whole of Appendix VIII and declared that compliance with
    the full requirements of Part A of the Manual was necessary for the approval,
    amendment, or replacement of the 1996 plans in question.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In concluding that Appendix VIII of the Manual
    was <i>ultra vires</i>, the Divisional Court found, correctly in our view, that
    the statutory requirement of compliance with the standards of sustainability
    set out in the Manual is mandatory and that in order to approve the plans in
    question, the Minister had to be satisfied that the  plans complied with those
    standards. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In support of its contention that the 1996 plans
    were valid, one of the arguments advanced by the Minister was that in assessing
    whether the plans complied with the Manual, the Manual had to be considered as
    a whole, including the phase-in provisions contained in Appendix VIII. That
    being so, the Minister maintained that since the impugned plans did in fact
    comply with the phase-in provisions of s. 2.1 of Appendix VIII, the Minister
    was justified in approving them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court disagreed with this
    submission. In its opinion, apart from the grandfathering provisions found in
    s. 71 of the Act, the statute was otherwise silent on the issue of transition
    and it did not provide the Minister with authority to phase-in the Manual. Accordingly,
    as the following passages at p. 186 of the judgment reveal, the Divisional
    Court viewed Appendix VIII as an unauthorized attempt by the Minister to amend
    s. 71 of the Act by extending the statutory transition period beyond that
    contemplated by s. 71:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
    government by regulation through the manual took the phase-in enacted by the
    Legislative Assembly in s. 71 of the Act and purported, by deemed compliance
    provisions, to amend it to a much longer phase-in. Nothing in the statute even
    purported to delegate this power to the government. The effect of this
    regulation if permitted to stand, would be to suspend in part by executive
    action the application of a statute that is fully in force by operation of law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
    question is not whether or not it was wise or reasonable for the Ministry to
    choose to phase in the requirements of the manual. The question is whether it
    had the power, without any statutory authority, to delay the coming into force
    of the new forest sustainability provisions until a time later than the time
    prescribed by law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Neither
    the government nor the officials of the Ministry have power to suspend even in
    part the application of a statute duly enacted by the Legislative Assembly that
    is fully in force by operation  of law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
    deeming and phase-in provisions of the manual, except in respect of the 1995
    plans, are ultra vires the CFSA. Unauthorized by the statute, they have no
    legal force. They cannot save the impugned Elk Lake, Upper Spanish, and
    Temagami plans and work schedules.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>With respect, we are not persuaded that the
    Divisional Court was correct in concluding that the Minister lacked the
    necessary authority under the statute to phase in the provisions of the Manual.
    Our  concern stems primarily from the Divisional Court’s mischaracterization of
    the nature and purpose of s. 71 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court found that s. 71 of the Act
    occupied the field with respect to phasing in. We do not agree with this
    interpretation. Indeed, we do not read s. 71 as addressing the issue of phasing
    in at all. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Section 71 did not purport to validate forest
    management plans which failed to comply in every respect with the provisions of
    the Manual. Rather, it grandfathered certain plans which predated the Act,
    regardless of whether such plans conformed in whole, part or not at all with
    the provisions of the Manual.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Once this is understood, it becomes apparent
    that the Divisional Court acted upon a faulty premise in concluding that the
    Minister lacked authority under the statute to phase in the provisions of the
    Manual. Having concluded, incorrectly, that s. 71 constituted a complete code
    with respect to phasing in, the Divisional Court reasoned that Appendix VIII
    was in conflict with s. 71 and that absent statutory authority, the Minister
    had no warrant to extend the phase-in period beyond that contemplated by s. 71.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Given our conclusion that s. 71 does not address
    the issue of phase-in at all, we do not accept the Divisional Court’s finding
    that the phase-in provisions in Appendix VIII conflict with s. 71. Furthermore,
    we see nothing in the Act that would prevent the Minister from including an
    appendix in the Manual phasing in some of the sustainability directives
    contained in Part A of the Manual, so long as the phase-in provisions meet the
    sustainability requirements of the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Section 68(2) of the Act required the Minister
    to ensure that every plan complied with the Manual. Under ss. 68(3) and (5), the
    Legislature mandated that the Manual contain certain sustainability provisions
    which every forest management plan must adhere to.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In our opinion, these sections do not preclude
    the Minister from phasing in portions of Part A of the Manual. They do, however,
    prevent the Minister from enacting phase-in provisions which fall below the
    standards of sustainability required by ss. 68(3) and (5) of the Act. In other
    words, the Minister could not circumvent those provisions by including in the
    appendix to the Manual, phase-in provisions which, if complied with, would
    result in forest management plans falling below the statutory standards of
    sustainability. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Based upon the record, we have no way of knowing
    whether Part A of the Manual simply reflected the standards of sustainability
    required by ss. 68(3) and (5) or whether it went further. To the extent, if
    any, that Part A went further, there would be nothing to prevent the Minister
    from phasing in only those portions of the Manual which went beyond the statutory
    sustainability requirements. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It follows, in our view, that the Divisional
    Court erred in principle in concluding that the Minister could not, due to want
    of authority, phase in the provisions of Part A of the Manual. Since that was
    the basis upon which the Divisional Court found Appendix VIII to be <i>ultra
    vires</i>, that finding cannot stand; nor can we sustain the related
    declaration that the full requirements of the Manual must be complied with for
    the approval, amendment or replacement of the impugned plans. The declarations
    in question are found in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the judgment.  Those
    paragraphs cannot stand and an order will go deleting them from the judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle><b>Are the
    Plans Saved by Appendix VIII?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court’s error in striking down
    Appendix VIII as <i>ultra vires</i> does not, in our view, affect its ultimate
    conclusion regarding the invalidity of the 1996 plans. In this respect, we
    agree with the reasons for judgment of the Divisional Court in which the court
    addressed an alternative argument put forward by the Minister, namely, that the
    plans, prepared in accordance with s. 2.1 of Appendix VIII,  were salvageable
    because they complied with the statutory principles of sustainability embodied
    in ss. 68(3) and (5) of the Act. While the court recognized that they could
    have been salvageable on that basis, it went on to find that in this case, they
    did not comply.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court found that the three
    impugned plans did not meet the statutory standards required by the Act. At p.
    196, the court stated:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
    things missing from the plans are things at the heart of the new concept of
    sustainability introduced by the new Act. At the heart of the new statute is
    the introduction of measurement indicators by which the sustainability of the
    forest can be determined openly and publicly and objectively.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The court addressed the standards as they are
    reflected in Part A of the Manual. That approach may well have been appropriate
    in this case because there was no suggestion that Part A of the Manual in its
    current format does contain requirements which go beyond the sustainability
    provisions of ss. 68(3) and (5) of the Act. If it had been otherwise, then the
    court would have been required to look directly at those sections, presumably
    with the assistance of expert evidence, in order to determine if the plans,
    prepared in accordance with the phase-in provisions, did in fact comply with
    the s. 68 requirements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>We agree with the Divisional Court’s conclusion
    that the plans in question, prepared in accordance with s. 2.1 of Appendix
    VIII, clearly fell short of the sustainability standards required by the Act. In
    this regard, we have no reason to question the findings of the Divisional Court
    that the impugned plans failed to address issues such as Crown forest diversity
    objectives, landscape patterns, habitat for animal life and social and economic
    objectives, all of which were necessary to the requirements of s. 68(5) of the
    Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Three further matters remain to be addressed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle><b>            (i)        EAB
    Conditions</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court found that the 1996 plans
    failed to comply with certain conditions contained in the October 1995 decision
    of the Environmental Assessment Board. Although raised as a ground of appeal,
    in oral argument, counsel for the Minister did not press this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Bearing in mind the concession made on behalf of
    the Minister that compliance with these conditions does not pose a problem in
    rectifying the plans in issue and having regard to the fact that the Divisional
    Court did not rely upon the alleged breaches as a basis for declaring the
    impugned plans invalid, we see no need to resolve this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='page-break-after:
avoid'><b>            (ii)       Grace period</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant submitted that the Divisional
    Court erred in imposing too short a grace period. In oral argument, counsel for
    the Minister candidly admitted that the impugned plans could and would be
    rectified within the grace period allotted by the Divisional Court. At the same
    time, it was made clear that the grace period was not sufficient to rectify
    other 1996 plans which the Minister had approved and which were presently
    operational.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, we were asked to extend the grace
    period to avoid any potential problems that might arise with respect to
    outstanding 1996 plans that, to date, have not been challenged.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>We decline to do so. In our view, if, as and
    when the remaining 1996 plans are challenged, the question of the grace period,
    if any, and its length, is best left to the court hearing the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle style='page-break-after:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Minister contended that the Divisional Court
    erred in awarding solicitor and client costs against the Minister and in
    awarding costs to the junior solicitors  for the respondents. We see no merit
    in either submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In our view, it was open to the Divisional Court
    to make the award of costs it did and we have not been persuaded that the court
    erred in the exercise of its discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingsubsubtitle><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the result, an order will go vacating
    paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the judgment. In all other respects, the appeal is
    dismissed. </span></p>

    appellants, the respondents should have their costs of the appeal on a party
    and party basis payable by the Minister. </span></p>
