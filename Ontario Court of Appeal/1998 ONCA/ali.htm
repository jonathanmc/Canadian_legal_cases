[1]  This is an appeal against sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant was convicted of committing sexual assault and
of engaging in anal intercourse. The offences were committed in
June 1994, when the appellant was 25 and the female complainant
was 15. The complainant was intoxicated and unconscious at the
time and unable to resist the appellant's advances, which
included unprotected sexual intercourse resulting in ejaculation.
The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a term of five years
in respect of the sexual assault and to a further term of one
year in respect of the act of anal intercourse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Counsel for the Crown has fairly conceded that the term of
imprisonment imposed with respect to the conviction for anal
intercourse should be made to run concurrently with the term of
imprisonment imposed with respect to the conviction for sexual
assault. The effect would be to reduce the total term of
imprisonment of the appellant from six years to five years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant submits that a term of five years is harsh and
excessive and should be reduced to a term of three years. We do
not agree. Having regard to the nature and seriousness of the
offences, to the disparity in the ages of the offender and the
victim, to the impact of the offences upon the victim, to the
absence of remorse demonstrated by the appellant and to his
criminal record of ten convictions between 1989 and 1994, albeit
for different classes of offence, we are of the view that the
total sentence of five years was fit and should not be disturbed.
Such a sentence was within the appropriate range, and cannot be
characterized as clearly unreasonable or clearly or manifestly
excessive so as to justify intervention by this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Leave to appeal against sentence is granted. The appeal is
allowed to the extent that the term of imprisonment imposed with
respect to the conviction for anal intercourse is to run
concurrently with the sentence imposed with respect to the
conviction for sexual assault. The appeal is otherwise dismissed.</font></pre></td>
