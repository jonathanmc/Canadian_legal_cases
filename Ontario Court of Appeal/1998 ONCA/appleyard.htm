    </center></div><pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]	After the appellant’s extensive submissions, we called
upon the respondent on four issues.

1. <u>The R.R.S.P. Valuation</u>

In our view, it was open to the trial judge to rely upon
Exhibit 10 which set out a January 1, 1986 valuation date to
value the respondent’s R.R.S.P. We see no merit in this
ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2. <u>The Notional R.R.S.P. Disposition Costs</u>

[3]	The trial judge was entitled to credit the respondent with
some R.R.S.P. notional disposition costs. In light of the
respondent’s taxable income at relevant times and the
passage of time from the valuation date to the notional
disposition date, we think that the deduction credited to
the respondent was too high. Although we have been asked to
refer the calculation of the required adjustments to the
Master, we think that this litigation has gone on far too
long and must be brought to an end. For that purpose, in the
interests of finality, we would reduce the notional
disposition costs by $10,000 to $42,100. The equalization
payment will therefore be reduced to $7,500 and the judgment
will be varied accordingly.


3. <u>Deduction of Assets Brought into the Marriage by the Appellant</u>

[4]	On the evidence and having regard to the trial judge’s clear
adverse findings in respect of the appellant’s credibility,
we are not persuaded that this claim was properly
established. We would therefore not give effect to it.

4. <u>Post Separation Payment of Joint Debts</u>

[5]	With respect to the 27 Kingsbury mortgage, it was open to
the trial judge to treat this debt as the appellant’s, not
as a joint debt. As to the Bank of Nova Scotia debts, it was
open to the trial judge in all of these tangled
circumstances to treat these debts as having been jointly
paid.

5. <u>Costs</u>

[6]	Apart from the one relatively minor adjustment in the
required equalization payment, the appellant has been
unsuccessful on the many issues she raised on this appeal.
We are therefore of the view that the respondent is entitled
to costs of the appeal.

Conclusion

[7]	Subject to the variation referred to in these reasons, the
appeal will be dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
