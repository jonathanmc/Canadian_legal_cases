    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted by a jury presided over by
MacDougall J. in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)
of one count of sexual intercourse with a female person under the
age of 14 and one count of indecent assault. He was sentenced to
four years and six months in the penitentiary. He appeals both
conviction and sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant raised a number of objections on appeal that
were not made at trial. In fact, as to one of them, reasonable
doubt, trial counsel said he had no difficulty with the trial
judge's charge. He said further that it was appropriate. In the
circumstances of this appeal, I do not think it necessary to deal
with the arguments raised by the appellant against conviction,
save one. That relates to the refusal of the trial judge to give
effect to the appellant's submission that counsel should be
permitted to cross-examine the complainant on whether she had
been sexually assaulted by other persons and, in anticipation of
an affirmative answer, for permission to call evidence in
rebuttal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant and his wife lived in a small house, perhaps
20 feet by 40 feet, containing a living room, kitchen, three
bedrooms, a bathroom and a utility area off the kitchen. There
was a small barn adjacent to the house. The appellant and his
wife had one natural son, M. and adopted four other children,
including the female complainant and her twin brother.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The complainant testified as to a course of sexual abuse by
the appellant that commenced with touching and fondling on her
first visit to the appellant's home, progressing by age 8 to full
sexual intercourse, and continued until she left the home at the
age of 17 in 1975. She said that these sexual assaults occurred
essentially anywhere in the house and in the small barn.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The complainant had alleged, in statements to the police,
that, between the ages of about 12 and 17, she had been sexually
abused not only by the appellant, but also by M. and one of her
foster brothers, and, at their invitation, a number of their
friends. The abuse had started with the incident, referred to in
the evidence at trial, when the appellant had fondled her under a
blanket on the chesterfield in the living room while the other
children were present. The boys saw what was going on, and later
decided, in substance, that they could do it too. Thereafter,
they regularly visited the bedroom that the complainant shared
with her sister B., and had sexual intercourse and oral sex with
her while B. slept. They also invited two neighbourhood boys to
participate in incidents of abuse outside the house.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The complainant had also alleged that her twin brother, R.,
had told her that he had seen some of the incidents of sexual
abuse by his brothers, and that they had encouraged him to join
in. She also alleged that an adult cousin had raped her in the
same time frame.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  It is not apparent from this outline of the proposed
evidence that the appellant was compliant in the sexual
activities of persons other than himself or even that he knew of
them. As such, it is not part of the narrative of the evidence
that the Crown could lead against the appellant. In fact, it is
irrelevant to any issue relating to the culpability of the
appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Counsel for the appellant wished to examine the complainant
on the criminal conduct that she alleged of others in order to
permit him to call these persons to deny the allegations. I can
put his trial strategy no higher than the way he set it out in
his factum wherein he stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the case at bar, the complainant had
          made allegations that her older brothers, and
          others at their invitation, had sexually
          abused her as a result of having observed the
          Appellant's abuse. The abuse was alleged to
          have taken place in the same household,
          during the same time frame, under the same
          general circumstances as the Appellant's
          abuse. The case as actually presented at
          trial would be seen by the jury as a
          complaint of sexual abuse against the
          Appellant only, in which the credibility
          conflict was primarily between the
          complainant and the Appellant, with the other
          family members only able to say that they
          hadn't seen it, and disagree with the
          complainant about certain peripheral matters.
          If the defence had been permitted to bring
          out the allegations against the other family
          members and their friends, the case would
          have been fundamentally different B it would
          have appeared to the jury as a complaint that
          not only the Appellant but at least four
          other people had abused the complainant, and
          that all of them, and her own brother, had
          conspired to cover it up; and would have
          pitted the credibility of the complainant
          directly against not only the Appellant but
          also her adoptive and natural brothers, her
          sisters, and others not even members of the
          family. The complainant's allegations against
          the Appellant would have to be weighed as
          part of a sweeping allegation of familial
          abuse being alleged by the complainant.
          Accordingly, the fact that the complainant
          had made that sweeping allegation, and the
          evidence that such allegation was not and
          could not be true, would impact not just on
          the credibility of the complainant at large,
          but directly on the probability that her
          allegations against the Appellant, being part
          of that larger allegation, were true. The
          evidence was therefore not &quot;collateral&quot;, and
          the learned trial judge therefore erred in
          law in excluding it. Alternatively, even if
          the evidence was collateral, it should have
          been admitted on the basis that the case
          turned on credibility, and the evidence could
          have a potentially very significant impact on
          the jury's assessment of the credibility
          conflict.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Ordinarily, such a situation as this would be looked at in
two stages. The first is whether the question is proper and the
second is whether the questioner is bound to accept the answer.
In this case, counsel has made clear his intention not to accept
the answer, and by implication in his double barrelled request
for two rulings, that he would not ask the question unless he is
permitted to attempt to contradict the complainant by calling all
the other persons she said assaulted her and have them deny the
assaults.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Accordingly, we must look at the entire process that the
defence wished to introduce into this trial to determine if it is
collateral to the issues before the jury. In my opinion it is.
The fact that others had sexually assaulted the complainant is
irrelevant to the charges against the appellant and to any
defence he might have to the charges. It is an attempt to pit the
complainant against her whole family and others instead of simply
against her father. It is inimical to the spirit of the principle
underlying s. 276 of the Criminal Code prohibiting evidence that
the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the
sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge
against the appellant. While s. 276 contemplates sexual
activities by a consenting adult complainant, I am offended at
the prospect of this complainant having her entire pre-adult sex
life exposed to public scrutiny on the excuse of testing her
credibility: the same excuse that formally excused this type of
inquiry of adult complainants.  However, resort to s. 276 is not
necessary. I think that this is the ultimate collateral issue and
is excluded by the common law rules of evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] There is a rule of evidence in civil cases relating to
similar fact evidence that has considerable application to what
is proposed here. Where such evidence is offered, the court has a
discretion to reject it unless if accepted it would not merely
&quot;afford a reasonable presumption as to the matter in dispute but
would be reasonably conclusive, and would not raise a difficult
and doubtful controversy of precisely the same kind as that which
the jury have to determine&quot;: per Lord Watson in Metro District
Asylum v. Hill (1882), 47 L.T. 29 at 35. In Phipson on Evidence,
14th Edition (1990), at par. 17-25, p. 374, the author states
that: &quot;On principle the court should exercise the same discretion
in a criminal case, whether the evidence is tendered by the Crown
or a defendant&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In my opinion, in the case on appeal the trial judge
properly exercised his discretion and rejected the line of
evidence since the tactic of the defence is directed to creating
confusion by having the jury consider not one criminal case but
four or five in the hope that by discrediting at least one of her
allegations of sexual abuse, he can raise a reasonable doubt as
to the Crown's case on the charges on which it elected to
proceed. The tactic is to replace the credibility contest between
the complainant and her adoptive father with one in which the
complainant is in an adversarial position with all of her
siblings, two of their friends and a cousin. Instead of a
straightforward case of parental incest, it would become an
investigation into familial abuse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Furthermore, the general rule is that one cannot impugn a
witness's credibility by contradicting the witness on matters
which are collateral even in a case where the &quot;core&quot; issue is
credibility. As stated in Phipson, supra, at '12-33:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               A party may not, in general, impeach the
          credit of his opponent's witness by calling
          witnesses to contradict him as to matters of
          credit or other collateral matters, and his
          answers thereon will be conclusive. This rule
          is not absolute. The test whether a matter is
          collateral or not is this: &quot;if the answer of
          a witness is a matter which you would be
          allowed on your own to prove in evidence B if
          it had such a connection with the issues,
          that you would be allowed to give it in
          evidence B then it is a matter on which you
          may contradict him&quot;.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] There is no suggestion that the appellant in this case could
have led this evidence without laying the groundwork for it in
the cross-examination of the complainant. In Wigmore on Evidence,
Chad. Rev. Vol lllA at ss.1004 et seque, the authors set out two
classes of fact that are not collateral: A(1) facts relevant to
some issue in the case, and (2) facts relevant to the
discrediting of a witness&quot;. In the latter category the author
lists moral character, bias, corruption, skill, intoxication and
illness, opportunity of observing the events, recollection,
narration and prior statements. There is no provision for
rebutting accusations of criminal conduct against persons other
than the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In R. v. Riley (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 151 (C.A.), relied upon
by the trial judge in his ruling, this court appears to have
introduced another exception, albeit one too narrow to assist the
appellant. The defence wished to continue a line of cross-
examination of the complainant directed to a complaint of sexual
assault she had made against another person at a time much
removed from the assault under investigation. This court upheld
the trial judge who refused to permit the person accused and
charged as a result of that complaint to testify that he had been
acquitted after a trial. The court stated at p. 154:
               The only legal basis of which we are
          aware that would justify the cross-
          examination of this complainant along the
          lines suggested would be in order to lay the
          foundation for a pattern of fabrication by
          the complainant of similar allegations of
          sexual assault against other men. This should
          not be encouraged unless the defence is in a
          position to establish that the complainant
          has recanted her earlier accusations or that
          they are demonstrably false.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In my opinion, the trial judge properly excluded any
evidence proffered on the issue of whether or not the complainant
was sexually assaulted on other occasions by other persons. The
type of evidence proposed by the appellant engages the rule
against collateral facts and is subject to the general discretion
of a trial judge to exclude evidence where its probative value is
outweighed by its prejudicial effect. In this regard, prejudice
to the trial process is to be considered in addition to the
prejudice that might arise with respect to any party or witness
to the proceeding.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The exercise of such discretion is not a question of law and
the trial judge did not err in law by excluding the proposed
evidence. In R. v. B.A.W. (1991), 59 O.A.C. 323 (C.A.),   rev'd
[1992]  3 S.C.R.  811,   this court had ruled that the appellant
should   have been allowed to cross-examine a complainant to show
that she had lied in the statement she made to the police officer
investigating into the alleged assaults by her stepfather when
she told him that the appellant's sons and their friends had also
assaulted her. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal.
McLachlin J. for the court stated at p. 811:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               [2]  We are all of the view that the
          appeal should be allowed. It was for the
          trial judge to determine whether the
          evidence, which was tendered solely on the
          basis of credibility, demonstrated a degree
          of relevance which outweighed its prejudicial
          value. After considering the motion on record
          and the submissions of counsel, he concluded
          that it did not. In doing so, he committed no
          error of law.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               [3]  In the absence of an indication
          that the complainant's evidence on collateral
          matters might be false, the claim for its
          relevance was tenuous. On the other hand, its
          prejudice and its potential to mislead the
          jurors was significant. The words of this
          court in R. v. Meddoui, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 320,
          at pp. 320-321 are relevant. There Sopinka
          J., stated:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    With respect to the ground relating
               to cross-examination, the proposed line
               of questioning related to a collateral
               matter. Furthermore, its relevance was
               extremely tenuous and while wide
               latitude is permitted in cross-
               examination in a criminal case, the
               trial judge properly exercised his
               discretion in excluding the cross-
               examination.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Counsel for the appellant conceded that the sentence was
within the appropriate range suggested by this court but submits
it was at the high end of the range and should have been lower.
In my view, the sentence was more than appropriate for a pattern
of sexual assaults of this magnitude and duration by an adoptive
father against his daughter. I would not interfere with it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. I would grant
leave to appeal sentence but I would dismiss the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Released: September 9, 1998</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MOLDAVER J.A. (dissenting):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">20.   I  have  had  the  benefit of reading  the  reasons  of  my
colleague, Finlayson J.A., and like him, I see no merit in any of
the secondary grounds of appeal raised by the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21.   I  am,  however, unable to agree with my colleague  on  the
central  issue.  With respect, I do not share his view  that  the
evidence  concerning  the  complainant's  allegations  of   abuse
against her foster brothers and others, which the defence  sought
to  lead and then rebut, was collateral.  Rather, in my view, the
proposed  evidence involved a specific attack on the  credibility
of  the  complainant which bore directly on a live issue  in  the
case.   As  such,  it was relevant to a fact  in  issue  and  the
question  of  admissibility  depended  solely  upon  whether  the
prejudicial   effect  of  the  proposed  evidence   substantially
outweighed its probative value.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22.   My reasons for coming to this conclusion are fact specific.
They  depend  largely  upon  the  circumstances  surrounding  the
complainant's   allegations  against  the   appellant   and   the
appellant's  reliance  on those circumstances  to  discredit  her
allegations and show them to be false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">COMPLAINANT'S POSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">23.   The  complainant testified to a course of sexual misconduct
by  the appellant that began on her first visit to his home, when
she  was age 4, and continued on a regular basis until 1975, when
she  turned 17 and left home.  On her own estimate, the incidents
of   abuse,   which  ranged  from  improper  touching   to   full
intercourse,  numbered approximately 1,000.  For the  most  part,
the  complainant stated that the abuse occurred at night  and  it
generally took place in the family home and camper, as well as  a
small barn adjacent to the home.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">24.   Within  the home, the complainant claimed that the  illicit
sexual  activity  occurred in the living room, bedroom,  basement
and  kitchen.  When asked whether her foster brothers and  sister
were at home on these occasions, she stated that &quot;they could have
been&quot;, although she could not be sure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">APPELLANT'S POSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">25.   The  appellant's  defence was one of  general  denial.   He
testified  that at no time did he sexually abuse the  complainant
and that her allegations against him were false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">26.  In support of his position that he had been falsely accused,
the  appellant  placed considerable reliance on the  evidence  of
other family members who testified that over the years, they  had
not become aware of any sexual misconduct on his part towards the
complainant.  The importance of this evidence was underscored  by
the  living conditions that prevailed in the household throughout
the entire time frame when the abuse was said to have occurred.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">27.   By  all  accounts, including that of the  complainant,  the
family  of  seven lived in a very small home in which the  living
room, kitchen, three bedrooms, a bathroom and a utility room were
all  contained in a space measuring 20 x 40 feet.  The  household
was  described as a bee-hive of activity, with people  constantly
coming and going.  Living conditions were cramped and privacy was
in short supply.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">28.  Having acquainted the jury with the living conditions in his
home, and the fact that his alleged abuse had gone undetected  by
other  family members, the appellant quite properly  invited  the
jury  to  take  these  factors  into  account  in  assessing  the
complainant's credibility.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">29.   His  position  in  this  regard  was  straightforward.   It
involved  nothing  more than asking the jury to  use  its  common
sense in deciding whether, under the circumstances, it was at all
likely that he could have sexually abused the complainant in  the
family  home, as she claimed, on literally hundreds of occasions,
without  being detected by other family members.  To  the  extent
that the jury agreed with him and found the complainant's version
to  be  improbable, it would be but a short step for the jury  to
further  conclude that her allegations might well  be  false  and
that she ought not to be believed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE PROPOSED EVIDENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">30.   It  is  against this backdrop that the appellant sought  to
cross-examine the complainant on her allegations of sexual  abuse
against her foster brothers and others and, in anticipation of an
affirmative answer, to call rebuttal evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">31.   The  state of the record is such that very little is  known
about  the nature or extent of those allegations.  Clearly,  they
form  part  of the statement which the complainant  gave  to  the
police  in 1993.  Regrettably, that statement is not included  in
the  record  and the details of it remain sketchy.  Moreover,  as
the  record  reveals, the trial judge refused  defence  counsel's
request for a full voir dire.  In the opinion of the trial judge,
there  was no need to flesh out the complainant's allegations  of
abuse  against her foster brothers or others because the proposed
evidence  was collateral and the appellant was not in a  position
to  show  that the allegations were demonstrably false.  In  this
regard, the trial judge relied upon this court's decision  in  R.
v.  Riley  (1992),  11  O.R.  (3d) 151,  which  he  found  to  be
dispositive.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">32.   Accordingly,  defence counsel's submissions  are  the  only
source  from  which  the nature and extent of  the  complainant's
allegations  against  her  foster  brothers  and  others  can  be
gleaned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">33.   Those submissions reveal that according to the complainant,
for  a  five year period commencing in 1970 when she was  12  and
continuing  to  1975, she was sexually abused on  a  regular  and
persistent  basis by her foster brothers and others.   The  abuse
took  various forms, including oral sex and full intercourse  and
it occurred in the family home and elsewhere.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">34.   Within  the family home, the complainant claimed  that  her
foster  brothers  and others would regularly  visit  her  in  the
bedroom she shared with her foster sister B. and they would  take
turns  having  oral sex and full intercourse with  her  while  B.
slept.  In her statement, the complainant also claimed that in  a
conversation  with her natural brother R., R. told her  that  the
foster  brothers had encouraged him to participate in the  sexual
activity but he had declined.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">35.    The  defence  sought  to  put  these  allegations  to  the
complainant  and ask her if they were true.  In the event  of  an
affirmative response, it was the intention of the defence to call
rebuttal evidence.  That evidence took several forms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">36.  First, the foster brothers and others were prepared to state
that  the  allegations  against them were false.   Secondly,  the
complainant's  natural brother R. was willing to state  that  his
foster  brothers  never encouraged him to participate  in  sexual
misconduct  with  the  complainant and at  no  time  did  he  say
anything  that would have led her to believe otherwise.  Thirdly,
and  most  importantly, the complainant's foster mother  and  her
sister B. and brother R. were prepared to testify that at no time
did  they  ever  see  or hear anything that would  lead  them  to
suspect,  let  alone  conclude, that the  complainant  was  being
sexually abused by her foster brothers or their friends.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">37.   Significantly,  in  seeking to have the  proposed  evidence
admitted, defence counsel made it clear that the evidence was not
being  tendered  solely  or even primarily  for  the  purpose  of
attacking  the complainant's general character or her credibility
at  large.  To the contrary, it involved a specific attack on her
credibility  which  bore directly on the issue  that  formed  the
heart  of the appellant's defence, namely, that the complainant's
version  of  the events was so highly improbable that she  should
not be believed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">38.   Further,  without  this evidence, the  jury  would  have  a
distorted  picture  of the state of affairs  in  the  appellant's
household.   If  the  complainant were to be  believed,  she  was
regularly abused not only by the appellant but most of the  other
male  occupants  and  even visitors to the  home.   Although  the
complainant claimed that she had been sexually assaulted by  many
others  during the same time period and in the same location,  by
limiting the indictment to allegations against the appellant, the
Crown  was able to leave the jury with the false impression  that
since  the  appellant  alone assaulted the  complainant,  it  was
possible  that  her  story was true notwithstanding  the  cramped
living quarters and the lack of privacy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">39.   In  short, I am of the view that the proposed evidence  was
not  collateral because it was capable of resolving an  essential
element  of  the  case,  namely, the appellant's  opportunity  to
commit the offences under the living conditions that prevailed in
the household.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">40.    In   attempting  to  portray  the  proposed  evidence   as
collateral, I believe that the Crown takes too narrow a  view  of
the  facts in issue in this case.  The issues in the case are not
defined solely by the Crown's allegations or the elements of  the
offence  that the Crown must prove but by the facts.  As Cory  J.
said in R. v. Aalders (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 215 at 230 (S.C.C.):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                It  is true that the Crown cannot split
          its  case to obtain an unfair advantage.  Nor
          should  the Crown be able to put in  evidence
          in   reply  on  a  purely  collateral  issue.
          However,  it  is  fit and proper  that  reply
          evidence  be  called  which  relates  to   an
          integral and essential issue of the case.  In
          such  circumstances, it  would  be  wrong  to
          deprive   the  trier  of  fact  of  important
          evidence relating to an essential element  of
          the   case.    The   course   of   a   trial,
          particularly a criminal trial, must be  based
          upon  rules  of fairness so as to ensure  the
          protection   of   the   individual   accused.
          However, the rules should not go so far as to
          deprive   the  trier  of  fact  of  important
          evidence, that can be helpful in resolving an
          essential  element  of  the  case.  [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">41.  It is in this sense that the proposed evidence differed from
the  evidence which the defence sought to tender in Riley, supra,
and R. v. B.A.W., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 811 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">42.   In  Riley, the accused was charged with sexually assaulting
C.L.  and J.Z.  In his cross-examination of C.L., defence counsel
sought to lead evidence to show that she had falsely accused  one
Roswell of sexual assault on a prior occasion.1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">43.   The  trial judge refused to permit this evidence and  Riley
was  convicted.   On appeal, this court found that  the  evidence
relating  to  Roswell involved a collateral issue of  credibility
and  as  such,  it  was  inadmissible unless  the  defence  could
establish   that  the  complainant  had  recanted   her   earlier
accusations or that they were demonstrably false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">44.   That  is  precisely  the reasoning which  the  trial  judge
applied in the instant case for refusing to permit the defence to
lead and then rebut the evidence of the complainant's allegations
of  sexual abuse against her foster brothers and others.  Indeed,
in  the  opinion  of  the trial judge, the case  before  him  was
indistinguishable  from  Riley  and  he  accordingly  ruled   the
proposed evidence inadmissible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">45.   With  respect,  I  do  not agree  with  the  trial  judge's
analysis.  In my view, Riley is distinguishable from the case  at
hand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">46.  In Riley, the court had no difficulty in concluding that the
proposed evidence was collateral because the allegations  against
Roswell  were  entirely unrelated to those against Riley.   Apart
from  the  fact that each was alleged to have sexually  assaulted
the  same complainant, there was no nexus whatsoever between  the
incidents  giving  rise to the respective charges.   Accordingly,
the  court quite properly concluded at p. 155, &quot;that this  cross-
examination was on a collateral matter in that it was essentially
an  attack  on the general character of the complainant.&quot;   That,
however, is not this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">47.  Here the two sets of allegations were linked both temporally
and spatially and the proposed evidence was not being offered  as
a  general  attack on the complainant's character but a  specific
attack designed to show the improbability of her allegations  and
expose them as being false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">48.   Unquestionably, B.A.W. is closer on its facts to this  case
than  Riley.   Indeed, Crown counsel took the position  that  the
present case is indistinguishable from B.A.W.  With respect, I do
not agree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">49.   In  B.A.W.,  the accused was charged with  having  sexually
assaulted his three step-daughters.  In a statement given to  the
police,  one  of  the step-daughters alleged that  she  had  been
sexually abused not only by her step-father but also by  his  two
sons and several of their friends.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">50.   The defence sought to cross-examine the complainant to show
that her allegations against the sons and others were false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">51.   The record at trial reveals that upon being questioned, one
of  the  sons  admitted to having oral sex with the  complainant,
while the other denied her allegations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">52.   The  trial  judge  refused to permit  the  proposed  cross-
examination.  His reasons in this regard are brief  and  I  shall
reproduce  them shortly.  Before doing so, however, it is  useful
to  consider  the following exchange that took place between  the
trial judge and defence counsel in the course of argument:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  But how does the fact  that  she
          did  or did not have the experience which  is
          alleged with the step-brother and the  friend
          have  anything  to  do  with  the  legitimate
          defence  here  of the accused  for  instance,
          well  I did not do it.  I have nothing to  do
          with  it. How does it go to that issue  which
          is really the principle issue?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  REIMER:  Well the only way which it goes
          to the issue your honour, is as I say, if the
          jury  finds that she has untruthfully alleged
          sexual assaults in the past they may be  more
          prepared in this instance to believe that she
          is  making  an  untruthful  allegation  about
          sexual assaults in the context of this trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  But doesn't that rather relate to
          what  is  called  in some of those  cases  an
          overview,  or  an  attack  upon  her  general
          credibility    as   opposed    to    specific
          credibility, namely whether or  not  she  did
          have anything to do with the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR. REIMER:  Yes, your honour.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   And if it does then  aren't  we
          then faced with the issue which is raised  by
          Mr.  Barnes  that what we are  talking  about
          here seems that we are dealing with a general
          credibility.  That we are really dealing with
          a collateral issue completely as opposed to a
          specific.   Your  more concern  is  with  the
          credibility  as such.  We are  not  concerned
          with  the character or generally whether  she
          is a liar.  For even if you have a person who
          is a liar, lets say in the community at large
          that is known to be a liar, doesn't mean that
          in  that  particular  instance  that  she  is
          lying. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">53.   This  exchange  is important because it  reveals  that  the
proposed  evidence was being offered solely for  the  purpose  of
attacking  the  complainant's general  credibility.   It  had  no
bearing whatsoever on her specific credibility and there  was  no
attempt to link it to a live issue in the case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">54.   Bearing  in  mind the underlying purpose  of  the  proposed
evidence,  the  trial  judge ruled it  to  be  inadmissible.   He
stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                I have not been persuaded here that the
          proposed  evidence  of past  sexual  activity
          would further a legitimate defence.  I do not
          find the proposed evidence to be relevant  to
          the  issue before the court.  It has no  real
          probative value on the facts in issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                I  find that such evidence in any event
          would  only  go  to  the  collateral  matter,
          collateral  issue  and on  that  basis  alone
          should not be admitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">55.  B.A.W. was convicted at trial.  On appeal to this court,  he
successfully  challenged the trial judge's  ruling.   On  further
appeal  to  the Supreme Court of Canada, McLachlin  J.,  for  the
court, found that the trial judge had not erred in rejecting  the
proposed evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">56.   My colleague has reproduced the reasons of McLachlin J.  in
full  and they need not be repeated.  Notably, at p. 812  of  her
reasons,  McLachlin  J.  found that  the  proposed  evidence  was
collateral.   No doubt, that finding was premised on her  earlier
observation at p. 811 that the evidence &quot;was tendered  solely  on
the basis of credibility.&quot;  By this, I take it that McLachlin  J.
was  referring  to  the trial judge's finding that  the  proposed
evidence was being offered for the sole purpose of attacking  the
complainant's  general  credibility as opposed  to  her  specific
credibility and accordingly, it was not relevant to a live issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">57.   It is this feature of B.A.W. that distinguishes it from the
case  at  hand.  Unlike this case, in B.A.W. there was no attempt
to  link  the  proposed  evidence to  a  specific  issue  bearing
directly  on the complainant's credibility.  To the contrary,  as
was  the case in Riley, the evidence was designed to portray  the
complainant  as  the type of person who should  not  be  believed
because she had a propensity to make up false accusations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">58.   It follows, in my view, that B.A.W. is distinguishable from
the  case at hand and it does not assist in resolving the central
issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE PROPER TEST</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">59.   In view of my conclusion that the proposed evidence was not
collateral but relevant to a live issue, the trial judge  applied
the  wrong test in determining its admissibility.  The  test  for
admissibility depended solely upon whether the prejudicial effect
of  the  proposed evidence substantially outweighed its probative
value.   Regrettably,  the trial judge did  not  engage  in  this
analysis  and  I  am  not in a position  to  say  that  he  would
necessarily have arrived at the same conclusion had he done so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">60.  In this respect, my hands are tied to a large extent because
of  the  state  of the record.  As I have already  observed,  the
complainant's statement to the police containing the  allegations
against  her step-brothers and others does not form part  of  the
record.   More  importantly, having regard to the nature  of  the
proposed  evidence  and the number of witnesses  involved,  I  am
inclined  to  the  view  that a full voir dire  was  required  to
properly address the issue of admissibility.  It will be recalled
that the defence request for such a voir dire was rejected by the
trial judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">PREJUDICIAL EFFECT VS. PROBATIVE VALUE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">61.   While I agree with my colleague that the proposed  evidence
was  potentially  prejudicial to the trial  process  and  to  the
complainant,  I have no way of gauging the degree  or  extent  of
that prejudice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">62.   Clearly,  the admission of the evidence would  prolong  the
trial but to what extent, I cannot say.  Admissibility would also
result  in  a series of mini-trials within the main trial  but  I
have  no  way  of knowing to what extent this would  deflect  the
jury's  attention  from the main issue.   Any  concerns  in  this
regard  could probably be met by a limiting instruction from  the
trial judge, setting out in clear terms the purpose for which the
evidence  had  been  admitted and its relevance  to  the  central
issue.   In  this  respect, the principles are no different  from
those which govern the admissibility of similar fact evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">63.   With  respect to the complainant, while I  readily  concede
that  it  would  be  unpleasant for her to have  to  recount  her
experiences  with other family members, that is not a  basis  for
excluding  relevant  evidence, nor can it trump  the  appellant's
right to make full answer and defence.  Nor can I accept that the
proposed  evidence offended against the spirit of  the  principle
underlying s. 276 of the Criminal Code.  As Morden A.C.J.O.  held
in  R. v. Darragh (1988), 122 C.C.C. (2d) at 240 (Ont. C.A.),  s.
276 excludes evidence of prior sexual conduct where such evidence
is  tendered solely to support the inference that the complainant
is  by  reason of the sexual nature of the conduct less credible.
That was not the purpose for tendering the evidence in this case.
The sexual nature of the conduct was incidental.  It was the fact
that the complainant alleged repeated assaults by so many people,
including the appellant, without her mother, sister, brother,  or
any one else knowing, that made the evidence relevant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">64.   On  the  probative side of the ledger, I have attempted  to
show that the proposed evidence was significant because it played
directly into the central theme of the appellant's defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">65.   In  assessing the potential probative value,  I  have  also
taken   into   account  a  rather  disturbing  feature   of   the
complainant's evidence which the Crown led in-chief and which the
defence explored to a limited extent in cross-examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">66.  According to the complainant, in 1991, some two years before
she  complained  to the police and disclosed the  allegations  of
abuse  against not only the appellant but her foster brothers  as
well,  she attended a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of  one  of
her  foster brothers, where, in the presence of her two offending
foster brothers and their spouses, she proceeded to disclose  the
details of the appellant's abuse towards her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">67.   This evidence, led initially by the Crown in-chief to rebut
the  defence  of  recent  fabrication,  is,  to  say  the  least,
troublesome.  While the complainant may have had a valid  reason,
it  is  difficult to understand why she would choose to  disclose
the  appellant's abusive conduct to her foster brothers,  if,  as
she  claimed, they too had abused her on a regular  basis  for  a
period  of  five years.  The trial judge's ruling  precluded  the
appellant from bringing this potentially damaging evidence to the
jury's attention.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">68.   In sum, having regard to the whole of the circumstances,  I
am  not at all persuaded that the trial judge would have excluded
the proposed evidence had he applied the proper test.  Nor can  I
say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same had the
evidence been admitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">69.   Accordingly,  I  would  allow the  appeal,  set  aside  the
convictions and order a new trial.</font></pre>
