    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice  Sheard, dated June 27, 1996, in the amount  of  $900,220</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plus pre-judgment interest, for a total of $l,342,183.63.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant contracted with the respondent for repair of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transformer  from  the  Hydro Ontario  Darlington  Nuclear  Power</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Station.  It  had  originally  been  supplied  to  Hydro  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  Westinghouse  Canada  Inc.  under  warranty.  When  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffered electrical and mechanical failure on February 17,  1989,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hydro had it delivered to Westinghouse in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Hamilton, Ontario for repair. Because the transformer was still</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under warranty, there was a substantial dispute between Hydro and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Westinghouse as to which of them was responsible for the costs of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repair.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   Westinghouse  contracted with the  respondent,  Asea  Brown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Boveri, to perform the repairs. The case was argued before Sheard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.  as  a  bailment case. However, although there may  have  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aspects  of  bailment involved, this was actually  a  case  of  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">simple  contract between the respondent and Westinghouse, and  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was argued before us as such.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   After  the  respondent had performed  the  repairs  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transformer and loaded it on a rail car for delivery to Hydro, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received a letter from Westinghouse instructing it not to deliver</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  transformer to Hydro. By the time it received  that  letter,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some  of  the  accessories to the transformer  had  already  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shipped  to  Hydro. The respondent was aware that the transformer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was   for   the  Darlington  plant,  and  it  received   shipping</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions from Westinghouse, in December of 1989 stating  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the transformer was to be &quot;returned to site&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The letter of instruction not to return the transformer  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hydro  was  not sent by Westinghouse until all of the contractual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations  of  the respondent had been carried out  except  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actually instructing the railway company to move the transformer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It  was an attempt at a unilateral change in the contract for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledged sole purpose of giving Westinghouse leverage in  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dispute with Hydro.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Had Westinghouse performed the repairs itself, it could have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retained  the  transformer, but it would have had to  suffer  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequences of a possible law suit by Hydro for its  return  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages for its retention. In our view, it was encumbent  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  and  Hydro to resolve their own differences,  and  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">place the burden of their dispute on the respondent. It should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">noted  that  even when sued for the value of the  work  which  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorized the respondent to perform, Westinghouse did  not  join</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hydro in the action.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   It  was  completely  improper for Westinghouse,  after  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  had, in good faith, performed the repairs  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract,  to attempt to use the respondent to gain  leverage  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its dispute with Hydro.
