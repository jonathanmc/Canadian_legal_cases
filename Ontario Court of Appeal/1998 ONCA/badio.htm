[1]  Following a trial by a judge and jury, the appellant was

convicted of one count of exercising influence over the movements

of the complainant for purposes of gain in order to aid her to

carry on prostitution contrary to s. 212(1)(h) of the Criminal

Code. He appeals his conviction on this count. In the same

proceeding, the appellant pled guilty to one count of living on

the avails of prostitution contrary to s. 212(1)(j) of the

Criminal Code. The appellant was sentenced to a period of

incarceration of two years for living off the avails of

prostitution and three years consecutive for exercising

influence. The appellant submits that the totality of his

sentences is too long and that the sentences ought to be made

concurrent.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We are of the opinion that, having regard to the errors in

the trial judge's charge to the jury, the appellant's appeal from

conviction on the count of exercising influence must be allowed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge simply gave the pertinent section of the

Criminal Code to the jury. The members of the jury were not

instructed what the essential elements of the offence were and

what they specifically had to be satisfied of before they could

convict. Having given the jury the section of the Criminal Code,

it was incumbent on the trial judge to tell the members of the

jury that they must not interpret the section themselves, give

them the law in relation to the charge and tell the jury that

they must accept the law as given to them. The members of the

jury were also not told that passive acquiescence in the

complainant's prostituting herself was not exercising influence.

This was the core of the appellant's defence and the trial judge

failed to relate the defence to the evidence.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge also erred in his instruction to the jury

when he told them:
                    </font></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier New" size="3">L&#146;accusé a nié ces allégués de Karine. Vous devez donc en
          vous servant de votre jugement, votre sens commun, décider si vous allez croire
          l&#146;accusé ou la jeune Karine Ouellette dans ses dires.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  This instruction essentially told the members of the jury

that they must choose between the complainant's assertions and

the appellant's denial. This instruction was wrong. The members

of the jury must be told that even if they disbelieve the

evidence of the accused they must consider whether the evidence

raises a reasonable doubt and, if so, they must acquit: R. v.

W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (397) (S.C.C.).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge also failed to give a limiting instruction

to the members of the jury with respect to the use they could

make of the appellant's criminal record.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The cumulative effect of these errors leaves no doubt that

the conviction cannot stand and that there must be a new trial on

the charge of exercising influence. The Crown's case against the

appellant was not so overwhelming that the jury would inevitably

have convicted so as to enable the curative provisions of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">686(1)(b)(iii) to apply.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appeal relating to conviction on the charge of

exercising influence for the purposes of gain in relation to

prostitution is allowed, the verdict is set aside and a new trial

is ordered.


[9]  In light of our disposition on the conviction appeal, the

sentence appeal on the remaining charge of living off the avails

of prostitution is essentially moot because it is not argued

that, in and of itself, the two year sentence imposed in relation

to that offence was excessive. In any event, it is our view that

the sentence was fit. While leave to appeal sentence is given,

the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
