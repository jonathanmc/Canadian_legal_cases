  <h1>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO </h1>
  <p>FINLAYSON and CARTHY JJ.A. and THEN J. (ad hoc) </p>
  <p>BETWEEN:</p>
  <p>ALAN BANNISTER Plaintiff (Respondent)</p>
  <p>- and -</p>
  <p>GENERAL MOTORS OF CANADA LIMITED Defendant (Appellant)</p>
  <p>J. Brett Ledger, Deborah Glendinning and Laura Friz for the appellant</p>
  <p>Robert B. Reid and Michael McLachlan for the respondent </p>
  <p>Heard: May 21, 1998 </p>
  <p>CARTHY J.A.: </p>
  <p>[1] Sexual harassment in the workplace has been broadly defined by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284,
    per Dickson C.J. in the following terms: </p>
  <p class=indent>Without seeking to provide an exhaustive definition of the
    term, I am of the view that sexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly
    defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects
    the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the
    victims of the harassment. It is, as Adjudicator Shime observed in Bell v.
    Ladas, supra, and as has been widely accepted by other adjudicators and academic
    commentators, an abuse of power. When sexual harassment occurs in the workplace,
    it is an abuse of both economic and sexual power. Sexual harassment is a
    demeaning practice, one that constitutes a profound affront to the dignity
    of the employees forced to endure it. By requiring an employee to contend
    with unwelcome sexual actions or explicit sexual demands, sexual harassment
    in the workplace attacks the dignity and self- respect of the victim both
    as an employee and as a human being. </p>
  <p>[2] This appeal is about how that definition has application in the real
    life of a modern industrial plant and how, when incidents surface, it should
    be dealt with by management and, ultimately, the court. </p>
  <p>[3] The appeal by General Motors is from the judgment of Dandie J. (1994),
    8 C.C.E.L. (2d) 281, wherein he found that the respondent had been wrongfully
    dismissed from his employment and awarded damages in the amount of $119,510.41
    plus prejudgment interest and costs. </p>
  <p>[4] In 1970, the respondent commenced working as a patrol officer in the
    security department of General Motors at its St. Catharines plant and by
    1980 he had been promoted to management and the rank of Sergeant. As such,
    he was the senior person in the security department on duty during the afternoon
    and night shifts and had a direct roll in measuring the performance and disciplining
    those working under him in the department. Women entered the security department
    at General Motors in the late 1970s and the majority of the female staff
    were students employed to work in the summer. Most of the summer students,
    and most of the complainants who gave evidence against the respondent, were
    between the ages of 18 and 23. At the time that the first of the complaints
    as to his conduct was made, the respondent was 49 years old. </p>
  <p>[5] The original complainant was Trish Murray, a summer student who, upon
    leaving her employment in September 1990, registered a written complaint
    with the respondent's superior. The complaint listed these incidents: </p>
  <p class=indent>* In 1989, the respondent placed his hand on her waist and
    pressed his face toward her in an apparent attempt to obtain a kiss. She
    turned away and he subsequently indicated his embarrassment over the incident;
    * In the summer of 1990, she made a gratuitous comment about her weight and
    he said in front of another employee &quot;why don't you take your clothes
    off and we will be the judge of that&quot;; * At a later date in the summer
    of 1990, she was reporting a small box fire and heard over the radio the
    words &quot;whose box is on fire?&quot; When she complained about the sexual
    innuendo in this remark to the respondent, he laughed at her; * On another
    occasion in 1990, he told a story in her presence of watching sexual interplay
    between a couple at a hotel and acted out &quot;masturbation&quot; and &quot;giving
    head&quot;; * On a Christmas occasion, the respondent told her he was going
    to &quot;kiss you proper&quot; and then tilted her chair back and kissed
    her on the mouth.</p>
  <p>[6] This complaint prompted management to conduct other interviews of employees
    in the department, leading to the identification of further complaints, including
    the following: Kendra Snodden * On many occasions he asked her to sit on
    his knee and give him a kiss; * On other occasions he would give her a bear
    hug and make growling noises. She did not consider this sexual but she felt
    uncomfortable and intimidated; * He described pornographic movies using sexual
    gestures to portray the scenes. Laurie Jackson * While pretending to swab
    her eye to remove some dirt, he kissed her; * On another occasion she asked
    the respondent for a pencil and he said he would give it to her for a kiss.
    Kelly McNaughton * The respondent commented to co-workers on his ability
    to see her bra through a wet shirt; * On another occasion he placed his arm
    around her waist, squeezed her and said he would come to a party &quot;if
    we could get rid of everyone else and we could find a quiet place to go at
    it&quot;; * He typically stood close to her so that there was physical contact
    or he would position his face within two or three inches of hers. She felt
    uncomfortable and intimidated working for him. Iris Johnson * The respondent
    told her that he loved her and that his wife was sick and did not understand
    him; * He often stood too close and touched her back. She was uncomfortable
    in his presence.</p>
  <p>[7] In the course of this investigation, management interviewed approximately
    40 people, including male employees, and obtained further corroborating evidence
    of the specific allegations by the female employees set out above. The evidence
    was put before the respondent and he answered with a general denial and an
    allegation that the women were conspiring against him. Management decided
    that it had no alternative but to terminate the respondent's employment and
    he was given notice to that effect on October 24, 1990. </p>
  <p>[8] All of these allegations, together with some additional complaints,
    were elaborated upon at trial and the defendant essentially denied each of
    them. However, the trial judge, in his reasons, made no significant findings
    of credibility, observing that, even if all of the allegations were proved,
    they did not constitute sexual harassment justifying dismissal. He appears
    to focus blame upon General Motors for not properly asserting their anti-harassment
    policy, improperly investigating the complaints, and permitting an atmosphere
    to develop within the security department in which everyone joined voluntarily
    in the offensive interactions. In my view, he erred in these respects, particularly
    in overlooking the respondent's role as a supervisor who, as the agent of
    the company, was responsible for overseeing what was occurring around him,
    and, if the allegations were true, should certainly not be setting an example
    as a sexual predator of young females. The trial judge's reasons display
    to me a concerted effort to excuse and apologize for the respondent's conduct,
    while trivializing the offences which were said to be occurring under his
    supervision and in which he was said to be directly involved. He further
    erred in rejecting from consideration evidence of inappropriate conduct that
    did not come to light until trial and did not form a part of the company's
    reasons for termination. Yet another error which directed his conclusion
    is that &quot;wearing persistence&quot; is a necessary constituent of sexual
    harassment in the context of considering termination of employment; that
    is, that there is no sexual harassment if each individual complainant was
    not continuously pursued after rejection. </p>
  <p>[9] The essence of the trial judge's approach can be found at p. 287 of
    his reasons:</p>
  <p class=indent>I think it fair to say that an inference might be drawn from
    the evidence of many of the witnesses that the plaintiff could be described
    as a womanizer or, more accurately, as an aspiring womanizer because there
    is not any evidence that he had any success in this regard.</p>
  <p>[10] I will now elaborate upon each of these errors and then turn to the
    ultimate question of disposition. The absence of credibility findings suggests
    a new trial, but it is now eight years since these complaints were reported
    and a repetition of a trial extending over 16 days with 26 witnesses should
    be avoided if some other reasonable basis for concluding these proceedings
    is available. </p>
  <p>General Motors' Sexual Harassment Policy </p>
  <p>[11] A bulletin outlining General Motors' sexual harassment policy was permanently
    posted on the bulletin boards in the plant. That policy is reproduced below: </p>
  <p class=indent>March 10, 1989 </p>
  <p class=indent>TO: ALL GENERAL MOTORS EMPLOYEES </p>
  <p class=indent>GENERAL MOTORS OF CANADA LIMITED HAS HAD, FOR MANY YEARS, A
    WRITTEN AND WIDELY DISTRIBUTED POLICY ON NONDISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.
    SEXUAL HARASSMENT, AS IN THE CASE OF HARASSMENT BASED ON AGE, RACE, COLOUR,
    CREED, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN, HAS LONG BEEN REGARDED AS A VIOLATION OF THIS
    POLICY.</p>
  <p class=indent>ALL EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO DEAL FAIRLY AND HONESTLY WITH
    ONE ANOTHER TO ENSURE A WORK ENVIRONMENT FREE OF INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT.
    ABUSE OF THE DIGNITY OF ANYONE THROUGH ETHNIC, RACIST, OR SEXIST SLURS OR
    OTHER DEROGATORY OR OBJECTIONAL CONDUCT IS OFFENSIVE EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOUR.
    SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALSO INCLUDES UNWELCOME SEXUAL ADVANCES, REQUESTS FOR SEXUAL
    FAVOURS, AND OTHER VERBAL OR PHYSICAL CONDUCT OF A SEXUAL NATURE.</p>
  <p class=indent>AS IN THE CASE OF OTHER OBJECTIONABLE CONDUCT WHICH IS CONTRARY
    TO THIS NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY, IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO
    SEXUAL HARASSMENT, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CONCERNS TO THE ATTENTION OF EITHER
    YOUR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR, PERSONNEL DIRECTOR OR REPRESENTATIVE, OR YOU MAY
    UTILIZE APPROPRIATE AND EXISTING INTERNAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURES. </p>

  <p class=indent>(PERMANENT BULLETIN) </p>
  <p>[12] In addition to being aware of the posted policy, Bannister attended
    a course on sexual harassment for supervisors given by General Motors in
    March of 1981 and may have attended another in 1988. The presenter's speaking
    notes for the conference that Bannister attended pointed out that sexual
    harassment could result in termination. These notes were displayed during
    the presentation by way of overhead projector. Bannister testified that he
    was aware that, as a supervisor, it was his responsibility to ensure that
    his subordinates did not engage in sexual harassment. He further testified
    that he was aware that female summer students were particularly vulnerable
    to sexual harassment. </p>
  <p>[13] The trial judge's findings in this respect are at pp. 298- 299 of his
    reasons: </p>
  <p class=indent>Accordingly, I find that General Motors had a sexual harassment
    policy in principle which had not been implemented in fact. Termination of
    employment, especially of an employee with 23 years service, which an excellent
    evaluation record who is earning $75,000 a year including benefits is an
    extremely serious matter and although it is conceded that General Motors
    was entitled to terminate the plaintiff's employment, before I would conclude
    that any termination on the grounds of sexual harassment was justified on
    the grounds of slurs, inappropriate language or the telling of jokes of a
    sexual nature, I would require that it be clearly established that every
    female security officer was clearly informed that inappropriate language
    and jokes of a sexual nature could be expected in the workplace; that female
    security officers had the right to choose to participate and engage in such
    language or jokes or to choose to object to the language and jokes; that
    if any female security officer did complain or object that they would be
    assured that their jobs were not in jeopardy; that it was not expected of
    any of them to suffer the embarrassment of inappropriate language or jokes
    or slurs of a sexual nature from either their fellow male employees or from
    their supervisors. The point being is that I find in the present case that
    General Motors did not empower its female security officers by clearly informing
    them that they need not suffer any inappropriate language, slurs or jokes
    of a sexual nature and that any complaints received would be treated with
    confidence. The last thing in the world that any male security officer or
    supervisor would want would be to have any complaint of or even of a suggestion
    of sexual harassment, substantiated or not, lodged against them or appearing
    on their record.</p>
  <p class=indent>I find that it was not enough for General Motors to hold the
    sexual harassment seminars in 1980 and to post a bulletin on the notice board.
    I find the least that was required if the sexual harassment policy was to
    be policy in fact, not merely policy in principle, was to inform the female
    security officers as I have discussed and to have some sort of a structure
    to monitor the policy, whether that be monthly meetings of the supervisory
    staff to discuss the language and conduct of the members of the security
    staff or otherwise. In any event, I imagine that the atmosphere in the workplace
    at General Motors is very different at the present time than it was at the
    time of the termination of the plaintiff, that male employees are more circumspect
    and careful about what they do and say in the presence of female employees. </p>
  <p>[14] These findings are clearly not responsive to the evidence of the respondent
    himself, who acknowledged his responsibility as a supervisor and confirmed
    his awareness of the posted policy. In my view, General Motors met its responsibility
    throughout and was entitled to rely upon supervisors to implement the policy.
    To say that more should have been done in these circumstances is simply to
    ignore the respondent's supervisory capacity and to make irrelevant apologies
    for his failure to implement and enforce the policy within his department. </p>
  <p>The Investigation </p>
  <p>[15] In his reasons at p. 285 the trial judge says, in part: </p>
  <p>In the case of a supervisor, having regard to the nature of the complaint,
    the complaint can be of itself of as great importance and consequence to
    the future of a supervisor, hence a great deal of thought and effort needs
    to be devoted to searching out other alternatives to simply that of a full
    blown investigation involving approximately some 40 employees.</p>
  <p>[16] The trial judge then goes on to discuss an alternative approach which
    I do not completely understand, but which seems to suggest a form of investigation
    which, if it revealed further complaints, would lead to warnings. </p>
  <p>[17] The following is a description of the actual investigation. Bannister's
    supervisor, James David Wallace, testified that on September 11, 1990, Trish
    Murray contacted him to complain about Bannister. The next day, Murray met
    with Wallace and his superiors. Murray described Bannister's sexual conduct
    towards her. That same morning, Murray submitted a formal statement. Kendra
    Snodden was then interviewed, as her name had been mentioned by Murray. Snodden
    also described Bannister's sexual conduct towards her and provided a statement
    the next day. Their interviews led to interviews of other employees. Interviews
    were commenced by asking whether the person had any information to provide
    with respect to a human rights or sexual harassment complaint. Bannister's
    name was not raised first by the interviewers; rather, they waited to see
    if the employee would mention Bannister on their own. Notes were taken of
    the interviews and a number of witnesses provided statements. </p>
  <p>[18] At the time of his interviews during the investigation, and at trial,
    Bannister flatly denied having had sexual contact with any employee or of
    having attempted to have sexual contact. He denied having sexually harassed
    any employee. Although he denied any wrongdoing, he recalled some incidents
    mentioned by the complainants in a different light and did not feel that
    his conduct constituted sexual harassment. He was interviewed four times
    prior to being terminated by General Motors. Bannister testified that he
    had been given every opportunity to state his side of the story in the investigation
    and agreed that anyone he had asked to be interviewed had been interviewed.
    Bannister's superiors testified that they had not believed that he was being
    truthful in his interviews. They believed the complainants were telling the
    truth. Bannister's superiors concluded that termination for cause was the
    appropriate remedy given the information before them and Bannister's denials
    of his conduct. </p>
  <p>[19] Finally, following the notice of termination, the respondent was given
    a further opportunity to protest his termination under General Motors Open
    Door Policy. </p>
  <p>[20] In Robichaud v. R., [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, the Supreme Court of Canada
    confirmed the exposure of an employer to liability for a supervisor's actions
    under the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 1976-77, Chap. 33 and, in doing
    so, observed that an employer who responds quickly and effectively to a complaint
    may avoid liability or not be liable to the same extent as an employer who
    fails to take such steps. The exposure is the same under the provincial statute
    governing General Motors.</p>
  <p>[21] In my view, General Motors acted with care, responsibility and sensitivity
    to the initial complaint. When further complaints were unearthed and the
    respondent replied with a general denial, they were entitled, as they did,
    to make a credibility assessment. Having been satisfied that the complaints
    had substance, they could not meet the responsibility of an employer by keeping
    their agent in his employment as a supervisor. They had no reason to believe
    that his conduct would change and, on any alternative to termination, would
    be leaving the female employees exposed to the continued abuse. Of course,
    having arrived at the conclusion that termination was necessary, it remained
    necessary for General Motors to establish at trial that the complaints did
    have substance and justified the termination. The Failure to Make Credibility
    Findings </p>
  <p>[22] In my view, the trial judge seriously misdirected himself in establishing
    a formula for the resolution of the issues raised in this case. </p>
  <p>[23] At p.300-301 of his reasons, he says: </p>
  <p>Counsel for General Motors submitted that the issue before me to decide
    is simply one of credibility, whether I believe the evidence of the five
    women who testified on behalf of General Motors or I believe the defendant
    and his denials of their complaints. In other words, if I believe the five
    women then General Motors was justified in terminating the plaintiff's employment
    on the grounds of sexual harassment.</p>
  <p class=indent>I disagree! The issue is whether General Motors has established
    on the balance of the probabilities that it was justified in terminating
    the plaintiff's employment on the grounds of sexual harassment. Part of that
    determination involves scrutinizing the evidence of the five women and even
    accepting that all their evidence to be true, doing this against the back
    drop of the definition or of the component parts of sexual harassment. In
    other words, the evidence of the five women might reasonably be true and
    still not be sufficient to constitute sexual harassment as it is legally
    understood or defined. I intend to direct myself as I would a jury on the
    balance of probabilities using the illustration of the scales of justice
    with the evidence in favour of the proposition that General Motors was justified
    in terminating the plaintiff as it did being placed in one pan and the evidence
    contrary to the proposition being placed in the other pan. In the one pan
    is the evidence of the five women who testified and the other witnesses who
    may have in some aspect or respect supported the evidence of the five women.
    In the other pan is the evidence of the plaintiff and his general denial
    of the complaints against him, added to which are my findings on the evidence
    as it relates to the testimony of the five women; added to which is the atmosphere
    of the workplace or the conduct and language of the majority of security
    department employees as I have found it to be; added to which is the testimony
    of the employees such as Peter Douglas Allister and Quinn Salterelli who
    saw the plaintiff as a firm and decisive supervisor who was also fair and
    just and who would support a security officer in their interaction with employees
    of the plant; added to which are the excellent annual evaluation reports
    as to the plaintiff's performance. Considering all these factors I can only
    conclude that at the very least the scales of justice are evenly balanced
    if not weighted in favour of the plaintiff and accordingly I find that the
    defendant, General Motors, has not satisfied the onus upon it to establish
    it was justified in terminating the plaintiff's employment as it did without
    notice or payment in lieu thereof.</p>
  <p>[24] In approaching the matter in this way, the trial judge has created
    a pot of stew in which it is impossible to identify the ingredients. He should
    properly have determined the issue of credibility as between the evidence
    of the five women and the respondent and, if the complainants' evidence was
    believed, should then have considered other factors such as the circumstances
    in the workplace and the respondent's employment record to determine whether
    termination was justified in the face of the proven complaints and any alternative
    resolutions that might be available. If the complaints were not established,
    and one would infer the opposite from the trial judge's reasoning, then the
    termination could not be justified. In passing, it is significant to note
    that the trial judge again took no account of the respondent's supervisory
    role in the department in respect to the alleged misconduct. It was clearly
    an error of omission to treat the respondent as if he was just one of many
    employees in the department who may have joined with others in improper conduct. </p>
  <p>[25] The trial judge appears to have considered the matter as a contest
    between the supervisor and management, a simple matter of discipline. Accordingly,
    he was sympathetic to an employee of long standing with an exemplary work
    record. He suggested that he was unfairly singled out for a policy which
    had not been emphasized in the past. In doing so, the trial judge failed
    to recognize that management had two positive duties; first to members of
    the workforce who are entitled to protection from offensive conduct and second;
    to the corporation, to protect it against civil suits at the hands of individual
    complainants.</p>
  <p>After Discovered Evidence</p>
  <p>[26] At p. 288 of his reasons the trial judge states:</p>
  <p class=indent>The incidents involving the pornographic video, the shorts
    and the safety glasses and the expressions of the plaintiff being attracted
    to Miss Murray did not form part of the material that Dallas McLean relied
    upon in making his decision to terminate the plaintiff's employment, as this
    evidence only came to light at trial.</p>
  <p>And further at pp. 290-291:</p>
  <p class=indent>I now turn to the evidence Kendra Snodden. At trial Kendra
    Snodden could not remember anything and yet her statement is before the Court
    because plaintiff's counsel did not object to the statement going into evidence.
    Upon reflection I have determined that what is at issue relative to Kendra
    Snodden not being able to remember anything is what information did Dallas
    McLean have before him at the time he decided to terminate the plaintiff's
    employment. Of course, this comment would apply to Trish Murray and the number
    of incidents she added at trial. </p>
  <p>[27] This is a clear error of law. Justification for dismissal can be shown
    by proof of facts ascertained subsequent to the termination. See Lake Ontario
    Portland Cement v. Groner, [1969] S.C.R. 553 at p. 563. It is not necessary
    to go into the details of the evidence that was excluded from consideration.
    Suffice it to say that this evidence included significant additional incidents
    of what could be termed sexual harassment. Wearing Persistence </p>
  <p>[28] The learned trial judge seems to have concluded that, in order to constitute
    sexual harassment for purposes of terminating employment, the conduct with
    respect to each complainant must be persistent and repeated. At p. 294, he
    states: </p>
  <p class=indent>A stolen kiss in the medical examining room, if in fact it
    happened, is in the same category as the attempted kiss with Trish Murray
    in the computer room. Although totally inappropriate and worthy of rebuke,
    this behaviour was not followed by same or similar conduct. In fact, the
    plaintiff tended to stay away from Laurie Jackson following the incident
    and I find that this conduct did not constitute sexual harassment and that
    it did not have that element of wearing persistence generally associated
    with sexual harassment.</p>
  <p>Further, at p.296:</p>
  <p class=indent>I find that there is no evidence that the plaintiff withheld
    or delivered job related benefits such as preferred assignments, raises or
    promotions as a means to demand and receive sexual favours. I find that the
    plaintiff did not make persistent verbal propositions to any of the female
    security officers. </p>
  <p>And at p.300: </p>
  <p class=indent>In addition, I want to emphasize that there was no evidence
    of any behaviour on the part of the plaintiff wherein he persisted in unwanted
    social and intimate conduct when it was made clear to him that any such conduct
    was not wanted. I say this because a major component of the definition of
    sexual harassment is persistent, unwanted attempts at social or intimate
    contact. </p>
  <p>[29] The Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, s. 10(1) defines harassment
    as &quot;engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct that is known
    or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome.&quot; In the Ontario Human
    Rights Commission Policy Statement on sexual harassment, published October
    1993 by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, it is stated that there must
    be more than one event or a course of vexatious comment or conduct to meet
    the definition in the Code. It is further pointed out that a single instance
    of inappropriate conduct may be a violation of the Code if it creates a poisoned
    environment. </p>
  <p>[30] In the instant case, it is important to note that we are not dealing
    with a complaint by an individual against another individual before a tribunal
    dealing with potential remedies under the Ontario Human Rights Code. We are
    dealing with an assessment of conduct that either does or does not justify
    termination from employment. If persistence is a factor in weaning out cases
    which justify hearings before a tribunal, it is only one aspect of conduct,
    and not a controlling one, in assessing justification for termination of
    employment. Here, the conduct, even if not repeated in identical form with
    individual complainants, was, according to the complaints, pervasive in the
    department and, moreover, was the conduct of the supervisor directed to female
    subordinates generally and repeatedly. This could be a far greater concern
    to an employer than if the conduct was confined to one employee and was persistent.
    In the latter case, the problem might be able to be isolated and controlled
    and termination avoided. </p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p>[31] It is my conclusion that the trial judge demonstrates in his reasons
    a complete lack of appreciation of the modern concept of equality of the
    sexes. He uses such expressions as &quot;she gave as good as she got&quot; and &quot;it
    takes two to tango,&quot; both catch phrases from another era. He concluded
    that the plaintiff admitted demanding a kiss for a pencil and states: </p>
  <p class=indent>... as to the kiss for a pencil incident, I find that on no
    occasion was a kiss ever given, that this style of management, although offensive
    and inappropriate, did not amount to sexual harassment. </p>
  <p class=indent>Such conduct cannot be justified on the basis that a kiss was
    not actually given or, in the trial judge's words quoted earlier, that the
    respondent was only a &quot;would-be womanizer.&quot; The trial judge, no
    doubt, formed the view, from listening to the witnesses, that this plant
    was a rough environment with abuse and sexual innuendo flowing freely in
    all directions, and the female employees strong enough to handle the exchanges.
    This is probably an apt description of many industrial environments of the
    past but cannot be tolerated in today's cultural acceptance of gender equality.
    It is not a question of the strength or mettle of female employees, or their
    willingness to do battle. No female should be called upon to defend her dignity
    or to resist or turn away from unwanted approaches or comments which are
    gender or sexually oriented. It is an abuse of power for a supervisor to
    condone or participate in such conduct. </p>
  <p>[32] Despite the lack of credibility findings, if the trial judge had advised
    himself properly on the duties of a supervisor, the findings he did make
    fully justified dismissing the action.</p>
  <p>[33] At p. 298, he states:</p>
  <p class=indent>I have found that the every day interaction of the majority
    of the employees in the security department, both male and female, created
    an atmosphere where inappropriate language and jokes of a sexual nature were
    the order of the day. </p>
  <p>And at p. 299, he states: </p>
  <p class=indent>I find that the plaintiffs's behaviour and language in the
    workplace was no more and no less than that of the majority of the employees
    in the security department. I further find that profane language and slurs
    and jokes of a sexual nature which might in other circumstances be considered
    sexual harassment were common place occurrences in the security department,
    so much so that they were the norm rather than the exception. </p>
  <p>[34] In light of the respondent's general denial of the events complained
    of, these findings carry an implicit acceptance of the substance of the complainant's
    evidence and that of the other employee witnesses, coupled with a finding
    that the respondent was entitled to act as he did because everyone else conducted
    themselves in a similar fashion. A supervisor who permits such an atmosphere
    as the trial judge describes to develop, and then participates in the exchanges
    as much as anyone else, is a supervisor who is not performing his duties. </p>
  <p>[35] In an industrial plant, no one expects profanity or vulgarity to be
    eliminated, but unwelcome conduct or expressions based upon gender or race
    cannot be tolerated. Management was entitled to have a supervisor who would
    do his best to assure that the environment was clear of racist or sexist
    slurs or objectionable conduct. In respect of gender issues, the respondent
    failed management. Given the finding that he joined in these activities without
    later apology or acknowledgement, it is hard to imagine an alternative to
    termination which would not perpetuate the harassment which management was
    obligated to eliminate. In my view, the termination was fully justified. </p>
  <p>[36] I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgment below
    and dismiss the action with costs here and below. </p>
