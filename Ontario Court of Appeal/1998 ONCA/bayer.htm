Nature of Appeal:


[1]   This  is an appeal from the decision of the Honourable  Mr.

Justice  Lederman  of  the  Ontario  Court  of  Justice  (General

Division) dated January 30, 1995, in respect of his finding of  a

breach  of  Compulsory  License 790  and  791  issued  under  the

authority  of  the  Patents Act, R.S.C. 1970,  c.  P-4,  and  his

decision  on  costs.  Upon finding said breach, the  trial  judge

ordered  the  Appellant,  Apotex  Inc.  (&quot;Apotex&quot;),  to  pay  the

Respondents, Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (&quot;Bayer&quot;) and Miles  Canada

Inc.  (&quot;Miles&quot;)  royalties  on all Nifedipine  capsules  sold  by

Apotex  for  the fourth quarter of 1987 and up to  and  including

January  13,  1993, in conjunction with prejudgment interest  and

costs.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   The Appellant Apotex seeks to set aside that Judgment.  The

Respondents,  Bayer  and  Miles, cross-appeal,  asking  that  the

Judgment  concerning  the  finding of breach  of  the  Compulsory

License  be  varied  with respect to the appropriate  termination

date  of such breach and that an Order be made that the Appellant

pay damages reflecting such variation or an accounting of profits

as the Respondents elect.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   For  the  reasons that follow, I would dismiss  the  appeal

brought  by  Apotex.  I would allow the cross-appeal  brought  by

Bayer and Miles.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Parties:


[4]   The  Appellant [Defendant at first instance]  Apotex  is  a

Canadian manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceutical products.

The  Respondent [Plaintiff at first instance] Bayer is  a  German

pharmaceutical manufacturer.  The Respondent [Plaintiff at  first

instance] Miles is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Background:


[5]   In the 1950s and 1960s, Bayer directed its research efforts

towards  creating  compounds which  could  be  used  as  coronary

dilators in humans for treating cardiovascular diseases.  One  of

the  new  chemical derivatives which Bayer created was a compound

called  Nifedipine, which forms the subject matter of the  within

patent infringement dispute. Bayer was granted a patent for  such

invention  in  various  countries, including  Canada  (April  20,

1971).   As  a  result of significant drawbacks  soon  discovered

regarding  Nifedipine, the Bayer researchers continued  to  study

and  develop the compound with the intent of improving it.   Upon

making  certain discoveries concerning the storage and absorption

and  other  characteristics of the compound, Bayer was successful

in  overcoming  the drawbacks associated with the  new  chemical.

These developments ultimately led to a capsule formulation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compound. Bayer applied for a Canadian patent on August 22, 1972,

and  was  issued Patent Number 981582 [hereinafter '582] for  the

Nifedipine capsule on January 13, 1976.  This patent is  directed

to  a  new dosage unit form for the coronary dilator, Nifedipine,

being  an  instant oral-release compound, and  a  method  of  its

production.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   By virtue of the patent, Bayer was granted for a period  of

17  years  from January 13, 1976, the exclusive right,  privilege

and liberty of importing, making, using and selling to others  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  used  in Canada the invention therein claimed.  The drug  was

introduced  to  the  Canadian  market  in  1982.   Miles  had  an

exclusive non-compulsory licence in Canada under Bayer's  patent.

Under  such licence, Miles had the right to import, make  use  of

and sell to others to be used, the subject matter of '582.


[7]   In 1986, Apotex was granted Compulsory Licence 790 and  791

(pursuant  to  the  Patents Act, supra)  which  became  effective

January 21, 1987.  That Licence permitted Apotex to import,  make

and sell Nifedipine and its capsule in return for the payment  to

Bayer of a 4% royalty on net sales in respect of the '582 patent,

for  the  unexpired term of the patent, namely until January  13,

1993.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   On  January 11, 1988, Apotex informed Bayer that it was  of

the  view that the sales of its capsule, Apo-Nifed, were  not  in

fact  made pursuant to the Licence inasmuch as the Apotex capsule

was  intended only to be swallowed whole and not for instant oral

release.   Bayer informed Apotex that it disagreed with  Apotex's

interpretation on this point and requested royalty statements and

royalties.  These were refused by Apotex.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   On May 12, 1988, Bayer advised Apotex that Licence 790  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">791 was terminated for non-payment of royalties and breach of the

Licence.  On May 16, 1988, Apotex disputed the alleged breach.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nature of the proceedings before the trial judge:


[10] On February 15, 1990, Bayer and Miles brought an action  for

a  declaration that Compulsory Licence 790 and 791 was terminated

as  of  the date of breach by reason of Apotex's failure  to  pay

royalties  or,  alternatively, June 12, 1988,  (being  one  month</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after  Bayer  notified Apotex of its breach, as provided  for  in

Clause 9 of Compulsory Licence 790 and 791) and for a declaration

that  as between the parties, certain claims of Patent '582  were

valid  and  subsisting  and had been infringed  by  Apotex.   The

plaintiffs (Bayer and Miles) sought damages for breaches  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Compulsory Licence or an accounting of the profits made by Apotex

for  patent infringement and for an accounting for all Nifedipine

capsules  manufactured, imported, sold and otherwise  distributed

by Apotex during the relevant period.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Apotex defended by alleging that its product, Apo-Nifed, did

not fall within the claims of '582 and also attacked the validity

of  the  patent.   By  way  of  counterclaim,  Apotex  sought   a

declaration  that  the patent and claims were invalid  and  void;

however,  based  on the concession by both parties  that  such  a

declaration  could  only  be  made by  the  Federal  Court  Trial

Division, such counterclaim was not pursued.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Issues:


[12]  The grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant are that  the

trial  judge  erred  in  law  and  misapprehended  certain  facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established at trial and misapplied certain evidence in  arriving

at  his  findings.  The Apellant appeals the decision of Lederman

J.  with  respect to the finding of breach of Compulsory  Licence

790 and 791 and with respect to his decision on costs.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Review of Findings of Lederman J. at Trial


[13]  The learned trial judge found that there was ample evidence

enabling  the  court  to conclude that Apotex's  drug  does  fall

within the claims of '582.  On this issue, Apotex argued that the

product  and  process claims of '582 were restricted  to  use  by

biting for the treatment of angina pectoris whereas Apotex's drug

is intended to be swallowed.  The trial judge found that Claims 1

and 14 of '582 constitute product claims in that they describe  a

physical product, as opposed to addressing how the capsule is  to

be  used.  In preferred embodiments of the invention of '582, the

instant  oral release capsule of Nifedipine incorporates  in  the

gelatin shell an opacifier and/or a dye which absorbs light at  a

specified  wavelength.  At page 13 of his Reasons  for  Judgment,

Lederman  J.,  noted  the claims only provide  that  the  capsule

contain  a composition which &quot;can be released from the  shell  by

biting  and  breaking the latter&quot; [emphasis original].   On  this

note, the learned trial judge emphasized that what is relevant is

not how Apotex's capsules are intended to be used but rather what

Apotex's  capsules are in fact.  Lederman J. concluded  that  the

capsules  are formulated such that they are in fact suitable  for

perlingual  administration.   At  page  13  of  his  Reasons,  he

concluded  that whether the capsules are intended to  be  or  are

ultimately used in that manner is irrelevant.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  The main thrust of the Appellant's argument on the  present

appeal  is  that  Lederman J. erred on  this  issue,  namely  the

appropriate characterization of the Bayer patent.  The  Appellant

claimed that the Apo-Nifed capsules do not fall within the  scope

of  '582 and the Licence and therefore, no royalties are payable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I  agree  with the trial judge that claims 1 and  14 are  product

claims  or, at the least, the patent in question is a  mixed  use

and physical characteristic patent.   Accordingly, in my view, no

reversible error in law arises on this point.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  On  the basis of the evidence tendered at trial, the  trial

judge  found  that Apotex's product falls within  the  claims  of

Bayer's  '582  patent.  I agree with Lederman J.'s reasoning  and

conclusions on this issue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  On  the  issue of the appropriate termination date  of  the

Compulsory   License,  the  trial  judge   concluded   that   the

appropriate  construction of such Licence led to  the  conclusion

that  the effect of Clause 10 is that the Compulsory Licence  did

not  terminate  June 12, 1988, but continued  until  January  13,

1993,  whereupon the patent expired.  The date of termination  of

the  Licence is directly raised in Bayer and Miles' cross-appeal.

I  am are of the view that the learned trial judge did err in law

on  this issue.  The basis for my view on this point is addressed

separately in the reasons pertaining to the cross-appeal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  A  second  ground of appeal advanced is that the  Appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">need not pay Licence royalties because the underlying '582 patent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  invalid.  Apotex pleaded and argued that the '582 patent  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">invalid on numerous rounds, including ambiguity, insufficiency of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosure,  redundancy  of  the  claims,  inutility,   lack   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inventiveness or novelty, obviousness, that the invention was  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">essence nothing more than a method of treatment and that  it  has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an  illicit purpose which lies outside the proper subject  matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  a  patent.   Bayer submitted that as a licensee,  Apotex  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estopped  from denying the validity of the patent.   Accordingly,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  issue  of licencee estoppel was directly raised  before  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge.  On this point, Lederman J. emphasized that based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  finding  that  throughout the relevant  period  the  license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship  continued by reason of Clause 10 of the  Compulsory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Licence,   there  could  be  no  basis  for  Bayer's  claim   for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infringement.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Based on his finding that the Licence continued in existence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until  January 13, 1993, and that Apotex's drug fell  within  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms  of  the  patent  claims, Lederman J. awarded  judgment  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour  of Bayer against Apotex for royalties during that  period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  addition to prejudgment interest.  The trial judge  concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there was insufficient evidence or conduct meriting an award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  punitive  damages, and accordingly denied Bayer's  claim  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive  damages.  Having awarded Bayer judgment on such  basis,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  trial  judge  found it was unnecessary to  consider  Bayer's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative claim for infringement based on its position that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Licence  had  terminated June 12, 1988,  and  that  it  was  also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unnecessary to consider the defences raised by Apotex relating to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the invalidity of the patent.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  However, Lederman J. found that Apotex as a licensee  would

not  be  estopped from raising the validity of the  patent  as  a

defence  to an action for infringement of the patent.  The  trial

judge went on to give full consideration of the issues raised  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect  of  the question of the validity of the  patent  in  the

event  findings were necessary should his judgment  be  appealed.

The  trial  judge  carefully  considered  all  of  the  evidence,

including the testimony of the expert witnesses of Apotex, before

concluding  that  patent  '582  was  not  invalid.   Lederman  J.

considered at length all of the grounds asserted by Apotex as  to

why  the patent might be invalid.  He concluded at p. 57  of  his

Reasons  that  if  he was &quot;mistaken in concluding  that  Apotex's

compulsory  licence did not terminate June 12, 1988,  then  Bayer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has made out a case of infringement of its patent...&quot;.  I see  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis for interfering with Lederman J.'s findings of fact or  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion  that  the  patent is not  invalid  and  that  if  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">termination  date  is  June  12, 1988,  then  Apotex  would  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infringed Bayer's patent as of that date.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] The Appellants also appeal the order as to costs.  The trial

judge ordered that Apotex pay costs on a party and party basis up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  date of an Offer to Settle, August 10, 1994,  and  on  a

solicitor  and client basis thereafter.  Lederman J.  found  that

the  Offer  to  Settle  was a genuine compromise  and  that  Rule

49.10(1)  of the Rules of Civil Procedure applied.  I agree  with

the decision of the trial judge in respect of costs.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition:


[21]  The  Appellant has failed to show that  the  learned  trial

judge  erred in his findings of fact.  I agree with the  findings

of fact made by the trial judge.  I find there are not any errors

in law by the trial judge in respect of the matters raised by the

present appeal.   Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Cross-Appeal


[22] The Plaintiffs, Bayer and Miles, cross-appeal.  The contract

in  the case at hand is unusual, being a &quot;compulsory licence&quot; for

an invention intended or capable of being used for medicine.  The

terms  are  imposed  by  the Commissioner of  Patents  under  the

authority of s. 41(4) of the Patents Act, supra, (in force at the

relevant  time).  Such a licence is a contract; see:  Atkibolaget

Hassle  v.  Apotex  Inc.  (1987),  17  C.P.R.  (3d)  349  at  351

(F.C.T.D.).  The contact is to be interpreted in accordance  with

the  reasonable expectations of the parties.  Unfortunately,  the

wording   of  the  contract  is  somewhat  lacking  in   clarity.

Specifically,  Clauses  9 and 10, both of  which  relate  to  the

effect  of  breach  and  the relevant date of  termination  raise

ambiguity.


[23] Clause 9 of the licence reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If the Licensee commits any breach of a term
          of  this  licence, the Patentee may  at  its
          option   terminate  the  licence  by  giving
          thirty  (30)  days  notice  in  writing   by
          registered mail, stating the particulars  of
          the  breach on which termination  is  based,
          and   the   licence  shall   be   terminated
          automatically  upon the expiration  of  such
          period,  unless  the Licensee,  within  such
          period, has rectified the breach designated;
          but  such  termination shall not effect  the
          right of the Patentee to require a statement
          of  the  accounts and payment of accumulated
          royalties  as  of  the date  of  termination
          [emphasis added].

Clause  9  states  that the patentee, Bayer, has  the  option  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminating the licence when the licensee, Apotex, commits  &quot;any&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach  of  a  term  of the licence.  Apotex breached  paragraphs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1(a),  5  and 6 of the contract requiring it to report sales  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pay a royalty of 4%.  Bayer exercised its option to terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licence and so advised Apotex on or about May 12, 1988.   By  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strict  operation of Clause 9, the Licence would  then  terminate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automatically  on June 12, 1988, being the end  of  the  30-  day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period, the breach not being rectified.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Clause 10 reads:

          Notwithstanding paragraph 9, if the Licensee
          disputes  the  breach and  so  notifies  the
          Patentee  in writing within the said  thirty
          (30)  day  period,  the  licence  shall  not
          terminate  pending  adjudication   of   such
          dispute  by a Court of Justice, or  by  such
          arbitration procedure for the settlement  of
          such  dispute as may be agreed upon  by  the
          Licensee and the Patentee  [emphasis added].</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[25]  Apotex  notified  Bayer within the 30-day  period  that  it

disputed  the  breach.  Apotex took the position that  the  Bayer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">patent  was invalid or, if valid, the Apotex medicine, Apo-Nifed,

was outside of and not covered by the Bayer patent.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The thrust of the dispute raised in the cross-appeal is  the

appropriate  interpretation of Clause 10  of  the  contract,  and

specifically  its effect, if any, upon the date  of  termination.

An  ancillary issue which arises is whether the degree of  breach

committed by the licencee impacts the range of remedies available

to  the  patentee.  Specifically, while Clause 9 of the  contract

speaks  to  the patentee's ability to terminate the contract  for

&quot;any&quot;  breach committed by the licencee, at common law,  where  a

party commits only a minor breach of contract, the innocent party

may  well  be  entitled  to  damages  to  compensate  his  losses

consequent  to such breach, but would not ordinarily be  entitled

to terminate the contract.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  The  parties offer differing interpretations to Clause  10.

Bayer and Miles submit that the effect of Clause 10 is simply  to

suspend  the  finality  of  the termination  resulting  from  the

operation  of  Clause 9 until adjudication, without altering  the

recovering damages).  Consistent with this view, Bayer and  Miles

submit  that  in  the event that the adjudication determines  the

licensee  to  be  in  breach, the effective date  of  termination

remains  that as determined by Clause 9.  Accordingly,  if  Bayer

and  Miles'  construction  is  adopted,  having  found  that  the

licensee, Apotex, was in breach of the contract, Bayer  would  be

[31] In a compulsory licensing regime, common law remedies for  a

breach  of contract will remain unless clearly displaced  by  the

language of the licence.  Stated otherwise, a compulsory  licence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be interpreted, so far as reasonably possible, to preserve

common  law  remedies for breach of contract.   It  is  generally

presumed  that the legislature does not intend to change existing

law  or  to  depart  from  established principles,  policies,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practices, unless expressly indicated.  In other words, there  is

a general presumption against the implicit alteration of the law,

the converse being that it is presumed the common law will not be

displaced unless legislation provides an explicit instruction  to

that  effect;  see  generally:  R.  Sullivan,  Driedger  on   the

Construction  of Statutes, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Buttersworth,  1994)

at  289-290 and 368-369; Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of Canada  v.

T.  Eaton  Co.,  [1956]  S.C.R. 610 at  614.   At  common  law  a

repudiation  of a contract entitles the innocent party  to  treat

its  obligations as at an end; for instance, see: Mersey Steel  &amp;

Iron  Co. v. Naylor Benzon &amp; Co. (1994), 9 App. Cas. 434 at  443-

444 (H.L.); Yukon Gold Co. v. Canadian Klondyke Power Co. (1919),

47  D.L.R. 146 (B.C.C.A.).  The actions of Apotex in refusing  to

pay  royalties  and account therefor amounts to a repudiation  of

the  contract.  Clause 9 is not to be interpreted  as  denying  a

patentee its common law remedies consequential upon a repudiation

of the contract by the licensee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[32]  Aptotex  submits that a plain reading  means  that  upon  a

disputed breach  the licence does not terminate until the date of

a  final adjudication by the successful patentee.  Apotex submits

that  Clause 10 operates to modify the common law and  is  to  be

interpreted  as  meaning  that  the  termination  date  otherwise

established by Clause 9 is displaced and no longer operative once

notice  is  given  by the licensee that the breach  is  disputed.

Apotex submits that once Clause 10 becomes operative there is  no

termination  until the adjudication is completed.  That  is,  the

termination  date  is  the  date  of  final  adjudication.    The

adjudication process through the courts, including appeals, could

take  years.  Indeed, the 17-year patent of Bayer expired January

13,  1993, with the result that by the Apotex analysis that  date

became  the  effective date of termination of the Licence  within

the meaning of Clause 10.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[33]  Apotex  points out that Clause 9 says that  if  a  licensee

&quot;commits any breach&quot; (emphasis added) of the licence it &quot;shall be

terminated automatically&quot;.  Apotex submits that even a very minor

breach  would trigger the operation of Clause 9.  Apotex  submits

that to accept Bayer and Miles' asserted interpretation of Clause

10  would  mean  that,  upon an adjudication  in  favour  of  the

patentee in respect of even an insignificant breach, the  licence

would  be  considered  to have been terminated  as  of  the  date

stipulated in Clause 9.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bayer and Miles submit  that until an adjudication with success to the

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] The policy objectives of the compulsory licence are achieved

by   simply   suspending  the  termination  while  awaiting   the

adjudication.   This interpretation is also consistent  with  the

objective of the licensing regime.  If a licensee could breach  a

licence by appropriating the subject of the patent as its own and

not  be subject to any claim for damages for infringement of  the

patent  until the date of final adjudication, the licensee  would

not  be  subject to the normal remedies available to an  innocent

party  in  an  infringement of patent situation.  To  accept  the

meaning asserted by Apotex would have the effect of rendering  an

exemption  from  the common law remedies for an  infringement  of

patent  whenever the licensee disputes the claim by the  patentee

that the licensee is in breach.  By this argument, if the license

did  not  terminate  30 days following the  provision  of  notice

(pursuant to Clause 9), Clause 10 of the license in effect  would

act  as  an  exemption  clause in that  it  would  eliminate  the

licensor's (e.g. patentee/Bayer) right to terminate the  contract

for  a  repudiation  thereof.  It is  an  accepted  principle  of

statutory  interpretation that an exemption or limited  liability

clause  should be strictly construed.  Moreover, an ambiguity  is

to  be  construed  against the party seeking  to  rely  upon  the

exemption  clause.   For authorities supporting  these  rules  of

construction, see: Chitty on Contracts, 26th ed., 1989,  Vol.  1,

para.  943  at 570-571; cited with approval in Bauer v.  Bank  of

Montreal,   [1980]   2  S.C.R.  102  at   108.     If   construed

alternatively, as proposed by Apotex, the innocent patentee would

be  denied damages for the years that lapse between the notice of

termination  and  the  final adjudication.   The  licensee  could

continue to reap substantial profits notwithstanding the licensee

had  repudiated the licence.  The licensee would only be  exposed

to  a  4%  royalty  on net sales, an amount  far  less  than  the

reasonable  expectation interest of  the patentee  under  a  non-

compulsory  commercial licence; see: Unilever PLC  v.  Proctor  &amp;

Gamble (1995), 61 C.P.R. (3d) 499 (F.C.A.).  The effect would  be

that  the  licensee  who  denies that there  is  any  enforceable

licence  could rely upon a clause under that licence  which  that

party has repudiated to significantly limit the damages for which

it   would  otherwise  be  responsible  at  law.   This  asserted

interpretation  is inconsistent with the reasonable  expectations

of the parties to the contract.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[38]  In the absence of express and clear language, Clause 10  is

properly interpreted not to remove remedies at common law  for  a

breach  of  contract except to the extent necessary to effectuate

the  purpose of that provision.  Clause 10 maintains  the  common

law  principles applicable to a breach of contract.   As  I  have

said,  the  actions  of Apotex in refusing to pay  royalties  and

account  therefor  constituted a repudiation  of  the  Compulsory

Licence.   The  breach by Apotex was in respect of a  fundamental

term  and went to the essence of the Licence.  The innocent party

Bayer  was entitled to treat the Licence as repudiated and at  an

end; provided however, by reason of Clause 10, the termination of

the  Licence was suspended pending the adjudication.   Clause  10

gives  sustenance to the policy underlying the  granting  of  the

Compulsory Licence by suspending the termination and leaving  the

Licence in place pending adjudication of the disputed breach.  In

my  view,  Bayer's  interpretation of the  effect  of  Clause  10

provides  the more fair and reasonable result in accordance  with

promoting commercial efficacy; see: Consolidated Bathurst  Export

Limited  v.  Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance  Co.,  [1988]  1

S.C.R. 888 at 901.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[39]  If  Clause  10 were to operate to postpone the  termination

date,  there would be only a minimal incentive in a situation  as

the  one  at  hand  for a licensee to honour  the  license.   The

licensee would not be in any worse position for its breach.   The

licensee would know that a final adjudication would likely result

only  after the expiration of the patent.  A licensee  in  breach

would run only the risk of legal costs if taken to court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[40]  With respect, I am of the view that the learned trial judge

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Clause 10 .... provides that the licence  is
          to  continue...and the licensee is therefore
          immune from an infringement claim and should
          a  court  find a breach, then any continuing
          sales  of  its  product within  the  licence
          period will result in a payment of royalties
          to the patentee.</font></pre>
