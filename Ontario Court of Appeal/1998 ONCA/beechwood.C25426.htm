    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">OVERVIEW
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These are the reasons for the first of two related appeals.1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  only  appellant in this appeal, 942836 Ontario Inc. (“942”),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeals  the  judgment  of Doyle J. in which  he  set  aside  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer  of  225 shares of the respondent (“Beechwood”)  to  942</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because  the  directors  had not consented  to  the  transfer  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required  by  a by-law of Beechwood first passed  in  1873.   942</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raises  three  grounds of appeal:  first, that  the  1873  by-law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requiring the consent of the directors was not authorized by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">special Act incorporating Beechwood and was therefore ultra vires</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  company; in the alternative, 942 argues that the 1873 by-law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  repealed  by  a  by-law of Beechwood  passed  in  1941;  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thirdly,  in the further alternative, it is argued that  pursuant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  s.  56(3) of the Business Corporations Act, R.S.O.  1990,  c.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">B.16,  the  restriction  on  transfer  in  the  1873  by-law   is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ineffective  against 942 because 942 acquired the shares  without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actual  knowledge of the restriction.  For the  reasons  set  out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below, it is my view that the appeal should be dismissed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The By-laws
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   Beechwood  was incorporated by special Act of  the  Ontario</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Legislature  (the  “Beechwood Act”) on March  29,  1873  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes  of  owning  and operating a cemetery  in  the  City  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ottawa.  There are two sections in the Beechwood Act dealing with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  enactment of by-laws that are relevant to the issues  raised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this appeal.  Section 2 provides that shares are “transferable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the  books  of the company in such manner as the  corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shall  by its by-laws direct.”  Section 9 authorized the  company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  pass  by-laws  “for the management of  the  business  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company.”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The  original  by-law of the company was  passed  in  1873.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article XV provided:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          XV.   No  shares in the Capital Stock of  the
          Company  shall  be transferable  without  the
          consent of the Board of Directors.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In 1941, s. 56(2) of  the Companies Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 251</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  applied to Beechwood had a specific provision  prohibiting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions on the transfer of shares.2  On April 15, 1941,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">president  of  Beechwood presented a new by-law to the  directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advising that the solicitor of the company had been instructed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examine  the company’s by-laws and to suggest changes that  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">modernize  them. It appears that two by-laws were  enacted:  one,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dated  April 15, 1941; and the other, which is undated,  entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">By-law  B.   The provisions of the two by-laws are identical  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for convenience I will refer to them as the 1941 by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   Section  27 of the 1941 by-law which follows  the  heading,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Repeal, reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          27.  All by-laws of the Company inconsistent with the
               foregoing by-laws are hereby repealed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  1941  by-law does not refer to the transferability  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Before  approving the proposed new by-law at the  directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting  on  April  15,  1941,  the directors  consented  to  two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfers  of  shares.  During the period following that  meeting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until 1991, there were approximately 262 shares transferred which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were  recorded in the books of Beechwood.  The board of directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not consider, give consent or pass resolutions respecting any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  these  transfers.   Except for the  transfers  that  are  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject  to  this  appeal,  none  of  these  transfers  has  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenged by Beechwood for failure to obtain the consent of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   Prior  to  the  commencement of this  litigation  in  1992,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Timothy  Graham (no relation to the parties in this  appeal)  who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had  been  the secretary-treasurer of Beechwood since  1975,  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unaware  of  the  1873 by-law; he believed that the  1941  by-law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  did  not  contain a requirement for  the  consent  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors  to the transfer of shares was the operative  governing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by-law of Beechwood.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   The  trial judge found that none of the directors in  1991,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other than John Graham whose knowledge I will discuss below, knew</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the requirement for consent by the directors contained in the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  John  Graham,  who is an appellant in the  related  appeal,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became a director of Beechwood in 1972 and its president in 1974.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He  continued to hold both positions until the board of directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">removed him in November 1991.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  By  December of 1990, John Graham and his  brokerage  firm,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham and Company Limited, had acquired 225 shares of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorized  capital  of  387  shares  in  the  capital  stock  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood.   The  circumstances under which they acquired  88  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these  shares are the subject of the related appeal but  are  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant to the disposition of this appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] On December 14, 1990, John Graham made an urgent request  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  brother,  David  Graham, to borrow 3.2  million  dollars  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rectify  a capital shortfall in his brokerage company, which  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licensed under the Quebec Securities Act with the Montreal  Stock</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Exchange.   David Graham agreed to make the loan to  his  brother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  to  take  as  collateral,  a pledge  of  certain  securities</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including  the  225  shares of Beechwood  which  were  registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either in the name of John Graham or in the name of his brokerage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  David  Graham, who is an experienced businessman,  retained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors  to  complete  the  loan  and  security  transactions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Because  of  the deadline set by the Montreal Stock Exchange  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rectifying  the  capital shortfall there  was  considerable  time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pressure  in  completing the necessary searches and documentation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the transactions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  David  Graham  relied on his advisors, both  financial  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal, to advise him of the adequacy and validity of the security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he  was  to  receive.  On December 20, 1990, the loan transaction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  completed and the moneys were advanced by David Graham.   As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part of the transaction David Graham, through his solicitors, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided with a pledge agreement and share certificates  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">225  shares  of  Beechwood.  The certificates were  in  the  form</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Act incorporating the Company, and to the By-laws, Rules and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">David Graham’s solicitors prepared draft resolutions of the board</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approval of the transfers by the directors.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  After  the  loan moneys had been advanced,  David  Graham’s</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated  the  requirement  for  obtaining  consent  of   the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  By April 1991 David Graham was aware that his brother might</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">default  on  the  loan and that he might have to realize  on  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security.   On  May  15,  1991, he had 942 incorporated  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose  of receiving the 225 shares of Beechwood which had  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pledged  to  him  in  December of 1990.  Beechwood’s  shareholder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">register  records the transfer of 225 shares by John  Graham  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham  and Company Limited to 942 on May 30, 1991.   Share</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certificates reflecting these transfers were issued in  the  name</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  942  and were signed by John Graham as president, and Timothy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham  as secretary-treasurer.  The directors were not requested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either before or after May 30, 1991 to consent to the transfer of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the shares.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In October 1991, there were complaints made to the board  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors about John Graham.  An investigation revealed  that  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had  made  a  number of unauthorized investments  with  Beechwood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds  and  had  been  paid several improper  expense  claims  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood.  At about the same time the directors, other than John</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham,  learned for the first time of the transfer  of  the  225</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares to 942.  Prior to that time they were not aware that  John</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham  had  acquired voting control of Beechwood nor  were  they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aware  that  he  had  been  using his position  as  president  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surreptitiously acquire shares sold to Beechwood by  the  estates</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  deceased shareholders.  The directors were concerned  because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it  was their understanding that Beechwood which was incorporated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  provide burial services to the community would always operate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without a majority shareholder.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  On  November 4, 1991, the directors removed John Graham  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">president  of  Beechwood and early in 1992  caused  Beechwood  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bring  this  action seeking among other things to set  aside  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer  of  the 225 shares to 942.3  During the course  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation  the  directors learned for  the  first  time  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision  in the 1873 by-law requiring the consent of the  board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  transfer of shares.  Beechwood then advanced the failure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  directors  to consent to the transfer as  an  additional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ground for setting aside the transfer to 942.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] At trial, John Graham testified that he did not know whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or not he knew of the requirement for the consent of the transfer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  shares.  However, on July 10, 1991, he wrote a letter to  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawyer  which would indicate that he did know of the requirement.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The 1941 by-law Issue
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] 942 argues that s. 27 of the 1941 by-law repealed Article XV</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the 1873 by-law.  This is strictly an issue of interpreting s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">27 which reads as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          27.   Repeal.   All by-laws  of  the  Company
          inconsistent with the foregoing  by-laws  are
          hereby repealed.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to the transferability of shares.  The only two sections</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set  out  under  the heading “Shares” concern  the  allotment  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares and the content of share certificates.  Article XV of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1873 by-law which provides, “[n]o shares in the Capital Stock  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Company  shall be transferable without the  consent  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">board  of  directors”  is  not  inconsistent  with  any  of   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions of the 1941 by-law.  Therefore, I am of the view  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  ordinary meaning of the language in s. 27 would not have the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect of repealing Article XV.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  942  argues  that an examination of the circumstances  both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before  and  after the 1941 by-law was passed should  lead  to  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different interpretation.  In 1941, s. 56(2) of the Companies Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Ontario  prohibited restrictions on the transfer  of  shares.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This section had first been enacted in 1912 and was continued  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  1937 Revised Statutes of Ontario. In presenting the 1941 by-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law to a meeting of the directors of Beechwood, the president  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood  said  that changes were being made  to  modernize  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation’s by-laws.  This, it is argued, showed  an  intention</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  repeal Article XV of the 1873 by-law in order to conform with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what  was by then a basic principle in the companies law  statute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Ontario.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]  The appellant further relies on the fact that from 1941  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991  the board of directors of Beechwood did not consider,  give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent   to  or  pass  a  resolution  respecting  any   of   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately 262 share transfers that were recorded in the books</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the company.  The trial judge found that in 1991 the directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Beechwood,  other  than John Graham,  did  not  know  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement  in  the  1873 by-law and that  Timothy  Graham,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secretary-treasurer,  considered  the  1941  by-law  to  be   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operative by-law of the company.  It seems likely that if any one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had  inquired  of the company, other than of John  Graham,  about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions on the transfer of shares he would have been advised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there were none.  This it is argued shows that the intent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those who passed the 1941 by-law was to repeal Article XV of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1873 by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43]  The  issue, as I have said, is purely one of interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the words used in the 1941 by-law.  The principles that apply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are well settled; a court will not look to extrinsic evidence  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpret a by-law unless the wording is unclear or ambiguous and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  court  may  look to the whole of the document  in  order  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine if ambiguity or lack of clarity exists.  See Re  Donner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian  Foundation (1960), 26 D.L.R. (2d) 274 (P.E.I.C.A.)  and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties  rely  in  making commercial decisions is  obvious.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature  of this type of document requires that wherever possible,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation  be based solely on the ordinary  meaning  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">words  used in the document in order to bring certainty for those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who   rely  upon  the  document.   In  most  situations,  it   is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unrealistic  to expect that arms length parties will have  either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  means or the capability of ascertaining the types  of  facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extrinsic  to a document of the nature that 942 argues should  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered in interpreting the 1941 by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] I am satisfied that the ordinary meaning of the words in  s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">27  of  the  1941  by-law is clear and unambiguous  and  that  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination  of the whole of the by-law would lead  a  reader  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclude that there may be other by-laws dealing with matters not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to in the 1941 by-law which have not been repealed.  One</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of   those   other   matters  could  be   restrictions   on   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transferability of shares.  In my view, this is  not  a  case  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider  extrinsic matters when interpreting the by-law.   I  am</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore satisfied that Article XV was not repealed by the  1941</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by-law.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45]  If  David Graham or his advisors had inquired of  Beechwood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about restrictions on the transfer of shares, they would probably</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  this  appeal.   They made no such inquiry and  there  was  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence   that  they  relied  upon  statements  or  actions   of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Actual Knowledge Issue
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46]  942 argues that the trial judge erred in finding that David</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham  and  942 had actual knowledge of the restriction  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer  of  shares contained in Article XV of the 1873  by-law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As  a result, it is argued, he erred in finding that s. 56(3)  of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   shares  were  registered,  had  actual  knowledge  of   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restriction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50]  The trial judge approached this issue by first finding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">David Graham’s solicitors had actual knowledge of the restriction</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence  for  him to do so.  David Graham’s solicitors  prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">draft  resolutions  to  be  signed by  the  signing  officers  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood after approval by the board of directors.  John  Graham</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave  an undertaking on the closing to have the draft resolutions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executed.   He  never  did.  David Graham’s solicitors  persisted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">over  a  period  of  several months after  December  of  1990  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attempting to obtain the executed resolutions which could only be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  if the board consented to the transfers.   On  May  15,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991,  the  same solicitors advised David Graham that failure  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtain the completed resolutions would hamper enforcement of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pledge  because  the  board  might oppose  the  transfer.   David</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham’s solicitors did not testify at trial.  On these facts  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  open  to  the trial judge to draw the inference  that  David</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham’s solicitors knew of the restriction.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51]  The  trial  judge also found that John  Graham  had  actual</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his solicitors of July 10, 1991, makes it clear that he did.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial  judge’s  finding  in this respect  was  supported  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood.  Although it was not necessary for him to conclude how</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">David  Graham’s  solicitors became aware of the restriction,  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons  make clear that he drew the inference that they  learned</font></pre>

1 The other is appeal C26304 (reasons released contemporaneously).
2 The appellant did not pursue an argument that s. 56(2) operated
retrospectively to render invalid Article XV of the 1873  by-law.
In  my view it does not.  See s. 56(1) of the 1937 Companies  Act
and  also s. 16(9) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1937, c.  1.
Similarly s. 47(1) of the Business Corporation Act, R.S.O.  1970,
c. 53 did not operate retrospectively to invalidate Article XV of
the 1873 by-law.  See s. 272(1) of that Act. Finally s. 42(1)  of
the present Business Corporation Act of Ontario by its terms does
not apply to Article XV of the 1873 by-law.
3 In addition to setting aside the transfer of shares to 942, the
trial  judge  awarded substantial damages in favour of  Beechwood
against  John  Graham based on his breaches  of  fiduciary  duty.
After  setting aside the transfer of the 225 shares to  942,  the
trial  judge  also set aside the issuance of the 88  shares  that
John  Graham  had  acquired from Beechwood  during  his  term  as
president.  John Graham appealed that decision.  In my reasons in
the  related appeal, I conclude that John Graham’s appeal  should
be dismissed.
4  The doctrine of ultra vires has been abolished by statute  for
corporations   incorporated  under   the   Business   Corporation
legislation  in most Canadian jurisdictions.  This provision  was
not  introduced in Alberta until 1981, see Business  Corporations
Act,  S.A.  1981,  c.  B-15,  s.  15(1),  and  therefore  had  no
application  to the reasoning of the Supreme Court of  Canada  in
the Edmonton Country Club case.
5  Sections  45 and 80 of the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1906,  c.  79
read as follows:
    45.  The stock of the company shall be personal estate, and 
	shall be  transferable, in such manner and subject to  all
    such conditions and restrictions as are prescribed by this
    Part or by the letters patent or by the by-laws of the company.
    46.  The directors of the company may administer the affairs
    of the company in all things, and make or cause to be made
    for the company, any description of contract which the company
    may, by law, enter into; and may, from time to time, make by-
    laws not contrary to law, or to the letters patent of the
    company, or to this Part, as to the following matters:--
     (a)     The regulating of the allotment of stock, the making
       of  calls  thereon;  the payment thereof,  the  issue  and
       registration  of certificates of stock, the forfeiture  of
       stock  for  non-payment, the disposal of  forfeited  stock
       and   of  the  proceeds  thereof,  and  the  transfer   of
       stock;... [Emphasis added.]
6  Section 1 of the Business Corporations Act defines corporation
as  follows:  “’corporation’ means a body  corporate  with  share
capital to which this Act applies.”
Section 2(1) reads as follows:
     2.(1)   This  Act,  except where it is  otherwise  expressly
     provided,  applies  to  every  body  corporate  with   share
     capital, ...
      (c)   incorporated by or under a general or special Act  of
      the Legislature.
7  Section  53(1)  defines a purchaser as  follows:  “’purchaser’
means  a  person  who takes by sale, mortgage, hypothec,  pledge,
issue,  reissue, gift or any other voluntary transaction creating
an interest in a security. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre></td>
