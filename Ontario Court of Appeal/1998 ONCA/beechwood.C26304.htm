</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   The  appellants, John Graham and John  Graham  and  Company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Limited,  appeal the judgment of Doyle J. in which he  set  aside</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  issuance of 88 shares in the respondent (“Beechwood”) to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants.  The transactions were set aside because John Graham,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who  was  the  president  and a director  of  Beechwood  had  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained  the  consent  of  the  directors  as  required  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood by-laws.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Beechwood was incorporated by special Act of the Legislature</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Ontario in 1873.  Article XV of the by-laws passed  in  18731</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided, “[n]o shares in the capital stock of the Company  shall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  transferable  without the consent of the Board  of  Directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">...”.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   In  1941  Beechwood enacted a new by-law in which  art.  20</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  that “[s]hares in the Company’s capital stock shall  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allotted  by resolution of the board of directors on  such  terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  conditions and to such persons as the directors  shall  deem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advisable.”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   John Graham became a director of Beechwood in 1972 and  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">president  in  December  of  1974.  He  continued  to  hold  both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positions until the board of directors removed him from office in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November  1991.   Prior  to  his  appointment  as  president   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood,   John  Graham,  either  personally  or  through   his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brokerage company, John Graham and Company Limited, had purchased</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">137  shares  of Beechwood from other shareholders.  Although  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">board  of directors was not asked to consent to the transfers  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these shares, Beechwood has not sought to set them aside.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   In  1975 John Graham hired Timothy Graham (no relation)  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general manager of Beechwood.  Shortly afterwards, Timothy Graham</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  appointed secretary and treasurer.  Timothy Graham  reported</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly to John Graham, and as directed by John Graham,  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">board  of  directors.   Timothy  Graham  had  responsibility  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood’s  shareholder register and he  handled  correspondence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  shareholders  and their agents dealing with  redemption  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sale of shares held by deceased shareholders.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Within a week of being hired, Timothy Graham was instructed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  John  Graham  to  advise him if shares  of  Beechwood  became</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available because estates of deceased shareholders wished to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their  shares redeemed or sold. From 1975 to 1991, Timothy Graham</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complied with these instructions.  In each case the estate  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surrender  its  shares to Beechwood and Beechwood would  in  turn</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  a cheque, signed by John and Timothy Graham in the  amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  $100 per share.  Timothy Graham would then cause Beechwood to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  a  new share certificate to either John Graham or  to  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brokerage  company for a corresponding number  of  shares,  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certificate  would  also be signed by John  and  Timothy  Graham.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham  would  pay Beechwood $100 per share  by  issuing  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cheque  or by arranging for a reduction from his salary or  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlements.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   John  and  Timothy Graham did not tell the directors  about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham’s  instructions, nor about these share transactions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  trial  judge  found  that Timothy Graham  was  placed  in  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficult  position and that there was an implied direction  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham, his superior, not to tell the other directors about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what was occurring.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   In  this  manner,  John Graham and  his  brokerage  company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acquired  88 shares through 15 separate transactions,  increasing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their  shareholdings from 137 to 225 out of an authorized capital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of 387 shares.  This gave them voting control.  Until the Fall of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991, none of the other directors examined the share register  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became  aware  of  the fact that John Graham  and  his  brokerage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company were acquiring shares in this manner.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  The trial judge made a number of findings of fact regarding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the acquisition of the 88 shares.  He found:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·     John  Graham  breached his fiduciary  duty  by  failing to
  disclose that he was acquiring shares in this manner;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    John Graham acted in a conflict of interest;

·    the procedure created by John Graham did not allow the
directors to consider whether they should consent to the transfer
of shares pursuant to Article XV of the 1873 by-law;

·    the steps taken by John Graham removed the responsibility of
the directors to allot shares pursuant to art. 20 of the 1941 by-
law;

·    the procedure created by John Graham took away the
opportunity of the board of directors to prevent John Graham from
acquiring a majority of the shares of Beechwood unless steps were
taken to annul the transfers;

·    the issuance of the shares required the consent of the board
of directors under Article XV of the 1873 by-law;

·    even if the consent of the board of directors was not
required for these transactions as share transfers, such
transfers and purchases were illegal because only the directors
can allot shares under art. 20 of the 1941 by-law; and

·    John Graham knew of the requirement of the consent of the
board of directors to the transfer of shares.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  Although  the trial judge made a number  of  findings  upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  he could have based his judgment to set aside the issuance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  88 shares, he relied primarily upon the failure  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">board  of  directors to consent to the transfers as  required  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article XV of the 1873 by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  The  appellants challenge this judgment on  three  grounds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">First, they argue that the trial judge erred in finding that John</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham  breached  his  fiduciary  duty  by  not  disclosing   his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions  to  Timothy  Graham to  the  other  directors,  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second,  that the trial judge erred in relying on s. 248  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario  Business  Corporations Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.  B.16  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support his conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  The short answer to these arguments is that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did  not rely either on the breach of fiduciary duty or on s. 248</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the Ontario Business Corporations Act in making the order  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set  aside  the issuance of the shares.  Rather, the trial  judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied upon the provision in the by-laws requiring the consent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   board   of  directors  to  the  transfer  of   shares   or,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternatively, the provision requiring a resolution of the  board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  directors  for the allotment of shares.  In other  words,  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found  the  transactions were either transfers or  allotments  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possibly  both.  In either case, consent or approval was required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  the  Beechwood  by-laws and no  consent  or  approval  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  In any event, I am satisfied that the facts referred to  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs  5 to 8 above amply support the trial judge’s  finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  John  Graham  acted  in breach of  his  fiduciary  duty  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">president and a director of Beechwood.  He used those offices  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surreptitiously acquire control of the company.   The  submission</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there was no evidence that John Graham obtained a benefit is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without  merit.   He  obviously  considered  the  acquisition  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control to be a benefit, perhaps unquantifiable, but nevertheless</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a benefit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  The  appellants’ third argument is that  s.  56(3)  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario  Business Corporations Act rendered the  restrictions  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  by-laws ineffective.  There was no dispute that John  Graham</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knew  of  the 1941 by-law which required the directors to approve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  allotment of shares.  Further, the trial judge  found  as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact that John Graham knew of the requirement for consent of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">board  of directors to the transfer of shares. It is implicit  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   trial  judge’s  finding  that  John  Graham  knew  of  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement during the period of time when the shares were issued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  him.   In view of these findings, there is no basis to  argue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  issuance  of the shares was ineffective  because  John</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Graham or his brokerage company did not have actual knowledge  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  restrictions contained in the by-laws.  Section 56(3) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario Business Corporations Act therefore has no application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In my view, the trial judge was correct in setting aside the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issuance of the 88 shares.   I reject the appellants’ submissions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this aspect of the appeal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Other Grounds
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  The  appellants  raise  three  additional  complaints  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect  to  the proceeding below.  First it is argued  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial  judge  erred  in  failing  to  grant  the  appellants   an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjournment  in  order to obtain the assistance of  a  legal  aid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawyer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  This  argument  is without merit.  The appellants  did  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request  an adjournment.  To the contrary, John Graham  told  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge prior to trial that he was prepared to go forward.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  Next, the appellant John Graham and Company Limited  argues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  there  was  no  basis in law for  finding  it  jointly  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">severally  liable  with John Graham for the  losses  suffered  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beechwood  for  what  was referred to at trial  as  the  Triple-D</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investment.   John Graham and Company Limited was  the  financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adviser to Beechwood in connection with that investment.   Moneys</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owing  to  Beechwood were channeled through the bank  account  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham  and Company Limited rather than being deposited  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Beechwood  account and from there invested in  the  Triple-D</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">project.   John  Graham  was found liable personally  for  losses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incurred   in  connection  with  this  investment.    There   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial  evidence to support the trial judge’s  finding  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">John  Graham and Company Limited was jointly and severally liable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for these losses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Finally, the appellants argue that the trial judge erred  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  giving them credit for an amount in excess of $125,000 being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">held in a trust account at Canada Trust.  It was argued that this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount should be used to reduce the judgments holding them liable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for losses incurred by Beechwood.  The trial judge made it clear,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  his  additional reasons, that this issue remained open,  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence must still be heard and that it should be treated  as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new claim.  I see no merit in this ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
