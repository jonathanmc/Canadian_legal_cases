</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant appeals his convictions for aggravated
assault, assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon. He
argued three grounds of appeal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue One: Use of voluntary statements of the appellant
     in cross-examination by the Crown and in re-examination by
     appellant's counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  This was a trial by judge alone and had the trial judge
wanted to have the statement introduced into evidence, he could
readily have made such an order. We see no error of substance in
the treatment of the statement in either the cross-examination 
or in re-examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue Two: Trial judge's alleged misapprehension of the
     evidence.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The thrust of the complaint in this court with respect to
the reasons of the trial judge was his statement that the
evidence of the complainant was Asupported by the evidence of Mr.
Senior&quot;. While there are some minor variations in what the two
witnesses stated, the conclusion of the trial judge is correct.
Mr. Senior's evidence confirmed the evidence of the complainant
in a number of important respects. We can find no error in the
findings of the trial judge nor in the inferences he drew from
the evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue Three: Self-direction as to reasonable doubt
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  There is nothing in the reasons of the trial judge from
which we can conclude that he had misunderstood such a basic
concept as reasonable doubt or that he was unaware of the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. W. (D.) (1991),
63 C.C.C. (3d) 397. We are not persuaded that, read as a whole,
the reasons demonstrate that he made the error of choosing
between competing versions of events. In fact, the acquittal of
the appellant on the count in the indictment charging the offence
of knowingly uttering a death threat demonstrated that he did not
make such an error.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
