[1]    The appellant appeals from the refusal of the motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge to grant summary judgment enforcing a settlement reached</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the parties for lump sum child support. In oral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submissions counsel for the respondent argued that neither the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court below nor this court has jurisdiction to entertain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion because the proceeding was brought as an application to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vary an order of the Family Division of the Nova Scotia court,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsequently registered in the New Brunswick Court of Queen's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bench.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    We agree that the order in this case could not be varied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by an Ontario court. Section 37 of the Family Law Act, R.S.O.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1990, c.F.3 requires that in order to be eligible to be varied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the original order must be made or confirmed under the Act. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case the original order was neither made nor confirmed under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act but rather, was made in another jurisdiction. An order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made in another jurisdiction can be varied by an Ontario Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under s.7 of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Orders Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1990, c.R.7 if the original order is registered in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario. Section 2(1) of the Act requires that the respondent be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Ontario before an order made in another jurisdiction can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered here. The order in this case was not registered, nor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could it have been. The respondent husband was in Nova Scotia at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the time the application was brought.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    However, the court below did have jurisdiction under s. 33</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Family Law Act to make the alternative order requested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was a lump sum child support order in the amount of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$100,000. The judge who heard the motion for summary judgment on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the settlement denied the claim of the appellant mother, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggested that any further proceedings be brought in Nova Scotia</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because by that time both parties lived in that province as did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the children. However, the motions judge did not consider that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not have jurisdiction and dealt with the motion on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    In fact what occurred was that after the application was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">served on the respondent in Nova Scotia he retained counsel in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ottawa to represent him on the application. That counsel, upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent's instructions, negotiated a settlement with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant whereby he agreed to pay child support in a lump sum in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amount of $65,000 in full settlement of all of his future</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">child support obligations. This was acknowledged by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent in his affidavit material filed in the summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment motion to enforce the settlement. He, however, took the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view that because circumstances changed with one of the children</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shortly after the agreement, the underlying premise of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement was no longer the same and he did not need to abide by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The motions judge agreed with that analysis, but with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect we do not. A settlement agreed to by the parties is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enforceable as a contract and is routinely enforced by our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">courts. The fact that circumstances may have changed after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement would not normally affect the situation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    However, in the case of child support, clearly the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of the child must always be considered by the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before any lump sum settlement is approved. In this case there is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no evidence that the respondent father is financially incapable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of supporting either the son, who has moved in with him, or the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">daughter. After making no payments for years, the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became the beneficiary of good fortune when his father won</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">several million dollars in the Lotto 649.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    The material discloses that the daughter had lived with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the father for a period before the lump-sum agreement was made,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so that the finding of the motions judge that the underlying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premise of the lump-sum agreement was that both children would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessarily remain with the mother is not borne out. Older</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">children can always change their feelings and wishes and had done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so in this family. There is no suggestion in the decision of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge that in the particular circumstances of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties the lump-sum amount was not a reasonable arrangement for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the support of the children, and appropriate for these particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties given the history, nor is there any suggestion that after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">making that payment to the mother, the father would not be able</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to support the children if either or both of them came to live</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with him.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    In our view the appeal should be allowed and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settlement as agreed by the parties is to be implemented.
