</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant's claim against Allstate Insurance Company of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada (&quot;Allstate&quot;) under a residential fire policy was dismissed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at trial on the basis that she was a party to the intentional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">setting of the fire that caused damage to her home and its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contents. Judgment was granted against the appellant on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Allstate's counterclaim for recovery of monies paid to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee pursuant to the mortgage clause contained in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance policy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant argues that the trial judge's finding that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was involved in the setting of the fire is unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Therefore, she seeks an order setting aside both the dismissal of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her action and the judgment on the counterclaim and, instead,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeks judgment for the amount to which she would otherwise have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been entitled to at trial. In the alternative, the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submits that the trial judge made a number of errors that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessitate a new trial. Although the latter remedy is sought in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the alternative only, the appellant's contention that the verdict</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is unreasonable rests essentially on the alleged errors in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment. We will therefore address these additional grounds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before considering the reasonableness of the verdict.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Standard of proof
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant submits that a finding of complicity in arson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is akin to a finding of fraud in that it must be founded on clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and convincing proof. She states that the trial judge did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advert to this distinction and consequently erred in applying a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">simple balance of probabilities test.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In our view, the trial judge's reasons do not reflect any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error on the question of standard of proof. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quoted from the decision of this court in Rizzo v. Hanover</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Co. (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 98 at 105, where the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">states that &quot;[i]n such cases, the proper inquiry should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether, on all of the evidence inculpatory of the insured,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including motive and opportunity, the insurer has proven the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence of arson according  to the standard of proof appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the establishment of that defence in a civil case.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There is nothing in the lengthy judgment that would indicate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the trial judge failed to scrutinize the evidence in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manner commensurate with the gravity of the allegations.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Evidence of motive
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider those items of evidence showing that she did not have a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motive to set her house on fire. In her factum, she notes: this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a family home and not a business, no item of high cash or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentimental value had been removed from the home prior to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fire, her teenage children's belongings were in the house and she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had not given up on her attempts to find financing and regain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession of the house.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We see no basis for simply assuming that the trial judge did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not take those facts into consideration.  These matters were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obvious and were fully canvassed at trial. It was not incumbent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon the trial judge to review every single item of evidence and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to note the absence of other items of evidence in his reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">His reasons focused rather on the basis for his finding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had a motive. It is not contended that his finding in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that regard is unsupported by the evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Indeed the trial judge went further and found that no one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">else except the appellant would stand to benefit as a result of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fire. On this point, the appellant contends that the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge disregarded the evidence suggesting motive on the part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mortgagee. There is no basis for this latter argument. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee was called at trial by Allstate and denied complicity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the fire. The appellant did not take the position at trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the mortgagee had anything to do with the setting of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fire.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   Evidence of opportunity
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appellant concedes that exclusive opportunity of access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">need not be shown before complicity in arson can be found. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argues nonetheless that the trial judge failed to give sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration to the fact that the appellant, who had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evicted from her house, had no greater opportunity than the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public at large.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We see no merit to this ground of appeal. There is nothing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to indicate that the trial judge gave undue weight to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence of opportunity. He expressly considered the possibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the fire may have been set by vandals or others and rejected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it. In fact, this forms the basis of the next ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4.   Possibility of fire being set by vandals or others
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in accepting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the expert opinion that this fire was not set by vandals. In our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, it was clearly open to the trial judge to accept this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence to support his finding on this point.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant also argues that the trial judge failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider other possibilities such as &quot;a fire masking a theft or a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fire set by someone who enjoyed setting fires... or a fire set by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persons hostile to the [appellant's] family.&quot; There is no merit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to this argument. The trial judge adequately and fairly dealt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the evidence before him. It is not incumbent upon a trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge to rebut every speculative argument raised during the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">course of the trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5.   Misapprehension of evidence
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence as to the presence of &quot;timing devices&quot; on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises at the time of the fire. We do not accept this argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The nature of the devices in question was clear from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. They were not &quot;timing&quot; devices in the true sense but,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather, devices intended to delay the start of the fire. There is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no reason to believe that the trial judge misapprehended the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature of these delaying devices.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The appellant also contends that the trial judge failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider important evidence that showed she could not have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Sault Ste-Marie at the time the fire was set.  Although the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge did not review every item of evidence on this point,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we are satisfied, after having reviewed the excerpts referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by counsel for the appellant, that the trial judge did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misapprehend the overall effect of this evidence. There were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serious issues of credibility. It was within the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ambit to reject the appellant's evidence with respect to certain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">details of the journey to Leamington and to conclude that this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence did not &quot;preclude an attendance at the residence by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant or an involved accomplice.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">6.   Evidence exculpating the appellant
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider the evidence which showed her to be innocent of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complicity in the fire. In particular, counsel notes the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the appellant's dealings with Mr. and Mrs. Pokusa when she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attempting to refinance her debts. He submits that this evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is inconsistent with the actions of someone who was a guilty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">participant in a scheme to burn down her house.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] We do not agree with the submission that this evidence was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessarily inconsistent with the actions of someone involved in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the setting of the fire. The appellant's financial problems</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extended far beyond the family home. The probative value of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence was a matter for the trial judge to address.  Hence, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do not agree with counsel that this evidence was so cogent that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge was required to deal with it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">7.   Result of a finding that a member of the appellant's family
     was involved in the setting of the fire
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Given the trial judge's finding that the appellant herself</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was involved in the setting of the fire, directly or indirectly,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we do not find it necessary to deal with this issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8.   Reasonableness of the verdict
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] As set out above, we see no reason to interfere with any of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge's findings of fact. Consequently, given the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indisputable incendiary origin of the fire, the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings of motive, opportunity and lack of credibility of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's evidence, it is our view that the finding of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complicity can reasonably be supported by the evidence. It is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that was open to the trial judge on the totality of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence before him.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In light of these conclusions, it is not necessary to deal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the additional issue raised by the respondent. The appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
