                                </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant J. B., a young person, was convicted on
charges of sexual assault and sexual interference, contrary to
ss. 271 and 151 of the Criminal Code, respectively, before Judge
J. Kukurin in the Ontario Court (Provincial Division). He now
appeals his convictions. The complainant on both charges was the
appellant's step-sister. At the time of the acts alleged, she was
six years old and the appellant was thirteen years old. The
appellant was a regular visitor to the complainant's home, as he
would often spend weekends with his father and his second family,
which included the complainant. The complainant testified that
the appellant engaged in a number of sexual acts with her
including at least one act of sexual intercourse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Central to this appeal are certain discrepancies in the
allegations made by the complainant against the accused, and the
trial judge's self instruction on the issue of credibility.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Crown's first witness was the complainant's mother. She
testified as to various conversations she had with the
complainant. The Crown then called the complainant. Pursuant to
s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act, the complainant, who was seven
years old at the time of the trial, was not sworn as a witness,
but was permitted to testify as the trial judge was satisfied
that she could answer questions having promised to tell the
truth. Pursuant to s. 715.1 of the Code, the Crown then
introduced video tapes of two interviews conducted at the offices
of the Children's Aid Society on July 12, 1996, and August 16,
1996. Both were admitted by the trial judge, and their
admissibility is not at issue. A Children's Aid worker also
testified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant gave evidence and testified that on no
occasion had the complainant ever seen him naked, nor that he
ever bathed her, tickled her, or even physically played with her,
except by grabbing her arms and putting her on the couch. He
denied having ever touched the complainant in the manner alleged.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There are significant discrepancies in the testimony of
witnesses for the Crown, but because of the disposition that we
propose, we do not propose to analyse the evidence in any detail.
This appeal can be decided on the adequacy of the self-
instruction of the trial judge on the burden of proof. In our
view, it was unsatisfactory. The trial judge improperly
characterised the issue before him as a contest of credibility
when he said at the outset of his reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Not surprisingly, the issue reduces
          down primarily to credibility. Whom does one
          believe the complainants or the accused.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge did not charge himself in the language of R.
v. W. (D.)  (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 409-411 (S.C.C.). Had
he done so, he would have had to ask himself if the testimony of
the appellant, even if disbelieved, was sufficient to raise a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. Instead, the
trial judge reviewed the evidence of the appellant and commented
favourably on his demeanour. He referred to the fact of his
absolute denial of the allegations against himself, but at no
time stated that he disbelieved him or even that he preferred the
evidence of the complainant to his.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The complainant was seven years old at the time of the
trial. Her evidence was unsworn. She had earlier given a
videotape of her evidence which contained significant
discrepancies from what she said at trial. The trial judge did
not give himself any warning about her testimony even while
admitting that the discrepancies existed. Some of these
discrepancies, which were characterised by the trial judge as
&quot;incremental disclosures&quot;, were discounted by the trial judge
because &quot;they were not uncommon with children because they do not
think like adults&quot;. There is no expert testimony to support this
statement with respect to the substantial discrepancies of the
testimony of the complainant in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Further, the trial judge found support for the complainant's
testimony in her emotional behaviour at the time of the alleged
assaults, which behaviour subsided after disclosure. There is no
basis to support a connection between this conduct and the sexual
abuse complained of. It should not have been relied upon as
&quot;observed behaviour to support what [the complainant] has said
was taking place between her, particularly when considered
temporally&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, we are all of the view that the appeal must be
allowed, the conviction below set aside and a new trial ordered.</font></pre></td>
