    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  An unusual feature of this case is that while the offences
were committed over twenty years ago, the respondent since that
time engaged in threatening conduct towards the complainant in an
attempt to continue to suppress the complaint. This included
attempts to see the complainant and years later calling the
complainant at work and telling her to &quot;keep her mouth shut&quot;. As
well, the respondent uttered a death threat to his ex-wife, a
person he knew to be a Crown witness, after the charges were
laid. In his otherwise very complete reasons for sentence, the
trial judge made no reference to this conduct. This evidence was
crucial in determining whether the respondent represented a risk
to the community and whether a conditional sentence properly
reflected the principles of specific and general deterrence.

[2]  In our view the trial judge erred in principle in imposing a
conditional sentence in the circumstances. Bearing in mind that
the respondent has already completed the two hundred hours of
community service during the seven months he has been serving the
conditional sentence, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the
appeal and vary the conditional sentence of two years less one
day to fifteen months' incarceration.</font></pre></td>
