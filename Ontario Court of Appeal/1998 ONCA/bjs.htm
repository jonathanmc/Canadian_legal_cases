    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted, following his trial by judge
alone, of indecent assault, gross indecency and assault on his
young stepdaughter and was sentenced to concurrent terms of
imprisonment totalling two years less a day. He appeals against
conviction on several grounds and seeks leave to appeal against
sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We are of the view that the appeal must be dismissed. Each
ground of appeal can be disposed of in summary fashion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1. Incompetence of trial counsel: application for fresh evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant contends that he was not “adequately assisted
by competent counsel” at his trial. In support of this ground of
appeal, he brings an application to introduce fresh evidence. In
the event that the fresh evidence is admitted, the Crown seeks to
introduce fresh evidence in response. On consent of the parties,
the court reviewed the proposed fresh evidence for the purpose of
ruling on this application.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In summary, the gist of the appellant’s main argument on
this ground of appeal is as follows. The appellant argues that
his counsel at trial was incompetent in his handling of the
evidence of a counsellor for sexually abused children called by
the Crown. In particular, he submits that counsel should have
sought a voir dire to inquire into the admissibility of
statements made by the appellant to this witness. The appellant
also submits that his counsel did not fully cross-examine the
counsellor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant advances a dual argument in support of his
contention that his statements to the counsellor could
potentially have been ruled inadmissible First, he submits that
the statements were made in circumstances which gave rise to an
expectation of confidentiality such as to give rise to privilege.
Second, he submits that the statements were involuntary and
inadmissible because they were made by him in circumstances of
duress created by the counsellor whom he perceived to be  a
person in authority.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Quite apart from the very dubious merit of these arguments
on the issue of admissibility of the statements, we are of the
view that the appellant’s proposed fresh evidence is not
credible. It is internally contradictory in several respects and
simply outlandish in many other respects. Further, it is clear
from the proposed fresh evidence that defence counsel made sound
tactical choices which could only enure to the appellant’s
benefit at trial. It is also clear from the record that the
circumstances surrounding the making of the statements were
canvassed by counsel at trial. In our view, the appellant’s
argument with respect to defence counsel’s handling of the
evidence of the counsellor is totally devoid of merit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Counsel for the appellant also seeks to introduce fresh
evidence of a further allegation of the appellant’s wrongdoing
made by the complainant. This further allegation was disclosed
after the trial. This allegation was not the subject-matter of
any charge and was not explored at trial.  Counsel submits that
this evidence is probative on the issue of the complainant’s
credibility. He submits that, at a new trial, if defence had the
opportunity to canvass this additional allegation with a view of
proving it unfounded, it could potentially impact negatively on
the complainant’s credibility and affect the result.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  We are of the view that this argument is entirely
speculative. Indeed, this further evidence is more likely to
prejudice the appellant than assist him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  For these reasons, the application to introduce fresh
evidence is dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.  Cross-examination of the appellant on statements made by him
to
     complainant’s therapists</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
permitting the Crown to cross-examine him on statements that he
had allegedly made to certain therapists when the trial judge had
denied an earlier motion made by the Crown to introduce these
statements as part of its case. The appellant relies on  R. v.
Calder (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) in support of his
position.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In our view, the circumstances in this case are entirely
different from the facts in Calder. In Calder, the statements had
been ruled inadmissible on the basis that they had been obtained
in breach of the appellant’s Charter rights. In these
circumstances, the Court held that the statements were not only
inadmissible as part of the Crown’s case but also for the purpose
of impeaching the appellant’s credibility during cross-
examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In this case, the statements in themselves were not
inadmissible.  It was the proposed manner of proof which was
objectionable. The Crown proposed to introduce evidence of these
statements through a witness who had no actual memory of the
events and no original record. The trial judge correctly ruled
that the introduction of the statements in this form was
inadmissible as past recollection recorded and further that it
would severely prejudice the appellant in his capacity to cross-
examine on their accuracy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In our view, the trial judge’s ruling did not preclude the
Crown from cross-examining the appellant on these same
statements. The statements would only become evidence if adopted
by the appellant. If denied, they would not constitute evidence.
There was no resulting unfairness to the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3. Cross-examination of the appellant on sentence sought by the
Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In the context of this case, where the appellant’s stepson
had testified on statements made to him by the appellant with
respect to the sentence that may be imposed for the alleged
offences, it was open to Crown counsel to explore the matter with
the stepson in cross-examination. Crown counsel sought to elicit
from the stepson whether the appellant had gone on to say that he
was not prepared to serve such a sentence for something he had
not done. This cross-examination was proper.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] However, the question put by Crown counsel to the appellant
in cross-examination on this issue was irrelevant and improper.
It should not have been permitted. Notwithstanding this
conclusion, we are not persuaded that the appellant was
prejudiced by this improper question. The question and the answer
to it were clearly irrelevant and this lack of probative value
would have been appreciated by the trial judge. There was no jury
in this case. We do not believe that this improper question and
the appellant’s response to it could have had any impact on the
verdict.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4. Trial judge’s interference with the conduct of the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The appellant takes the position that the trial judge unduly
interfered in the conduct of the trial. He submits that the trial
judge, by his interventions, effectively assisted the Crown and
that this resulted in an unfair trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] We have reviewed every excerpt of transcript referred to in
the appellant’s factum and we have considered the additional
excerpts noted by the respondent in its factum with a view of
assessing the merits of this ground of appeal. In our view, this
ground of appeal also fails.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] While the appellant is correct in noting that the trial
judge made numerous interventions, we are not persuaded that his
participation in the trial exceeded permissible boundaries. This
is particularly so given the fact that this was a judge alone
trial. There was no risk of a jury misunderstanding the judge’s
interventions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5. Trial judge’s alleged mischaracterizing of inconsistencies and
discrepancies in the      complainant’s evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] We see no merit in this ground of appeal. We are satisfied
that, in considering the whole of the trial judge’s reasons in
the context of the evidence, there was no misapprehension of the
evidence as contended.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">6. Sentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The appellant submits that the sentence is harsh and
excessive. He submits that it should be reduced and that he
should be permitted to serve it in the community.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In our view, the total term of two years less a day was
entirely fit. Further, given the seriousness of the offences and
the particular circumstances of the offender as revealed in this
record, we are not persuaded that this is a proper case for a
conditional sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence is allowed and the
appeal against sentence is also dismissed.
