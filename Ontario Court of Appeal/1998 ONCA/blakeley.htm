    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The respondent pleaded guilty to charges of impaired driving
causing death and impaired driving causing bodily harm.  He was
sentenced to a conditional sentence of two years less a day and a
three-year driving prohibition was imposed.  The Crown seeks
leave to appeal.
[2]  The charges arose as a result of a single car accident in
which the respondent's four-year-old son was killed and his two-
year-old son was injured and left with permanent scarring.
[3]  The respondent is thirty-nine years old, separated from his
wife and employed as a molecular biologist.
[4]  There were mitigating circumstances which were reviewed by
the trial judge.  The respondent is a first offender.  He pleaded
guilty and demonstrated remorse for the death of his son.  Twenty-
four letters were filed on sentencing to speak to his remorse,
his good character and his love for his children.
[5]  These mitigating circumstances were far outweighed by the
aggravating circumstances.  The respondent has a lengthy history
of alcohol abuse for which he refused counselling and when he did
take counselling, it proved to be largely ineffective.  His
drinking problem was such a concern to his wife, the mother of
their two children, that in the separation agreement he was
obliged to undertake that he would not drink before or during
access visits with the children.
[6]  On September 27, 1997, the respondent exercised his first
overnight access with the children.  During the day, he concealed
his drinking.  While driving home with the children after
visiting friends, he lost control of the vehicle and smashed into
a rock face.  There was a bottle of liquor in the vehicle which
he attempted to conceal immediately after the accident.  He had a
blood alcohol reading of 304, more than three and one-half times
the legal limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres
of blood.
[7]  The tragic consequences of the accident have had a
devastating effect on the mother of the children.
[8]  At the time of sentencing the prognosis for recovery from
alcohol dependency was generally disappointing.
[9]  The trial judge saw this case as a unique case.  We
disagree.  This is not one of those rare cases that this court
was referring to in R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344
(Ont. C.A.).  There was nothing unusual or exceptional about this
case that would warrant the imposition of a conditional sentence.
The trial judge gave inadequate weight to the principle of
general deterrence, which is of paramount importance in this type
of case: (R. v. McVeigh) (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Ont. C.A.).
[10] The trial judge also over-emphasized the absence of a
pattern of bad driving.  This was not a mitigating factor.  A
person driving with a blood alcohol level of 304 represents an
unconscionable risk.  At best, it represented the absence of what
would otherwise have been an aggravating factor.
[11] The inadequate weight to the principle of general deterrence
and the over-emphasis on the absence of bad driving are both
errors of principle.  The respondent's entire conduct showed a
profound lack of responsibility to his children and a complete
indifference to the criminal nature of drinking and driving.  A
conditional sentence was manifestly inappropriate and
demonstrably unfit in the circumstances of this case.
[12] Fresh evidence was adduced which reveals that the respondent
has not consumed alcohol since the accident.  He has received
addiction and psychiatric counselling.  He has complied with the
terms of his conditional sentence.  While his efforts toward
rehabilitation are positive, these recent events do not change
the inappropriate sentence that was imposed.
[13] The respondent was sentenced to two years less a day.  While
the sentence was lenient we are not persuaded at this time to
interfere with the length of the sentence.  He has served
approximately five months of the conditional sentence.  Taking
that into consideration, a fit sentence is one of nineteen months
together with probation for a period of two years on the
statutory terms together with the conditions that he refrain from
the consumption of alcohol and continue with counselling as
directed by his probation officer.
[14] Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.  The
conditional sentence is set aside and a sentence of nineteen
months' incarceration is imposed together with probation for a
period of two years.   The period of driving prohibition remains
unchanged.</font></pre></td>
