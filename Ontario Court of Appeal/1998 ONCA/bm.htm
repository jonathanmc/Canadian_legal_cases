 COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h1>

<p>RE: BANK OF MONTREAL (Plaintiff/Defendant by Counterclaim/Respondent) and MINAKI 
  INTERNATIONAL RESORT CORP. (Defendant/Plaintiff by Counterclaim/Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE: FINLAYSON, GOUDGE AND FELDMAN JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL: Anne McNeely, for the appellant</p>
<p>Robert J. M. Janes, for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD: August 13, 1998 </p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p></p>
<p> [1] The only argument raised on this appeal from summary judgment was that 
  the respondent bank was under an obligation to insist that the appellant corporation 
  receive independent legal advice because the appellant was represented in its 
  negotiations with the bank by Donald Wing of Mancon International Inc. (&quot;Mancon&quot;). 
  Mancon had been retained by the sole shareholder of the appellant to manage 
  the corporation's one asset, Minaki Lodge. The shareholder is the Wabaseemoong 
  Independent Nations of One Man Lake, White Dog and Swan Lake (the &quot;Band&quot;). 
  Wing was also the principal of Wing Construction Limited (&quot;Wing Construction&quot;), 
  which had contracted to renovate the Lodge.</p>
<p>[2] The loan structure arranged by Wing with the respondent bank required that 
  the Band act as guarantor of the loan and deposit GIC's as security to the full 
  value of the loan of $3,500,000. Of this loan, $1,400,000 went to the Band to 
  repay advances it had made to the appellant corporation and this latter amount 
  became part of the security pledged by the Band. $750,000 went as a mortgage 
  payment to the Four Seasons Hotel, which had taken the mortgage back on its 
  sale of the Lodge to the Band, $500,000 was retained as an operating line of 
  credit and $850,000 went to Wing Construction in payment of its contract for 
  renovations.</p>
<p> [3] The argument in support of the premise that the appellant borrower should 
  receive independent legal advice was that there was conflict of interest between 
  the appellant and Donald Wing because of the two hats that Wing was wearing, 
  one as representing Mancon in negotiating the loan and the other as principal 
  of Wing construction which received a substantial benefit from the loan. However, 
  whatever merit this argument might have in the abstract, involving as it does 
  a commercial borrower and an established lending institution, there is no evidence 
  before us that raises a triable issue as to the need in this case for independent 
  advice. Whether the appellant had or did not have legal advice would not be 
  evident to the respondent bank, and in any event, the lack of it appears to 
  have created no prejudice to the appellant. There is no suggestion in the evidence 
  as to what a legal advisor could have drawn to the appellant's attention that 
  would have caused it to reconsider its lending requirements or the nature of 
  the loan it negotiated. </p>
<p>[4] It is clear that as manager of the Lodge, it was part of Mancon's area 
  of responsibility to arrange the loan that was intended to provide $2,250,000 
  for renovations, a payment on account of the purchase of the Lodge of $750,000 
  and the establishment of a line of credit of $500,000 . There is no suggestion 
  that the appellant and the Band were not fully aware of Wing's ownership of 
  Wing Construction and that as a contractor it would receive funds generated 
  by the loan.</p>
<p>[5] Moreover, on this record, there is no evidence that the appellant and the 
  Band did not understand the loan, the Band's guarantee and other obligations 
  thereunder. There is no suggestion that the Band did not fully appreciate the 
  nature of the security that was pledged or the consequence of a default in payment 
  of the loan. While the appellant had argued before the motions judge that the 
  respondent bank was under an obligation to insist that the appellant obtain 
  an independent analysis of the commercial viability of this project, there is 
  no evidence that such had not been obtained before the initial purchase of the 
  Lodge by the Band from Four Seasons Hotel.</p>
<p>[6] In our opinion, the motion judge's reasons on this issue and others referred 
  to in the appellant's factum indicate no error. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed 
  with costs.</p>
