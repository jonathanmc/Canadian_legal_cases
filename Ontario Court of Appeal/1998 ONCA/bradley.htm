    Bradley, after working for Carleton for 18 months, quiton short notice. Bradley
    and Carleton sued one another in breachof contract. The trial judge found
    that Bradley should have givenCarleton three months&#8217; notice that he
    was leaving and awarded Carleton $10,000 plus costs.</p>
  <p>[2] All that Carleton was entitled to from Bradley wasreasonable notice.
    The measure of damages was not therefore thecost of Carleton as a result
    of Bradley leaving the company, butthe cost of Carleton as a result of Bradley&#8217;s
    failure to givenotice.</p>
