[1]  The sentencing judge made no error in principle in
considering the appropriate sentence for this very serious crime.
The sentence imposed was not an unfit one. The whole thrust of
the appeal is to reduce the sentence to enable the appellant to
attend Stonehenge for treatment of his psychological problems. We
were informed that the appellant could attend Stonehenge either
on day parole, if granted, or after his statutory release date,
which is in the spring of 1999; thus, he will be able to obtain
the necessary treatment at that time, at the latest. Any early
release in this case is a matter for the parole board.</font></pre>
