</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by the Crown from the decision of His</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Honour Judge Laing, upholding the decision of His Worship Justice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Peace Stafford staying all charges against Brennan Paving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Construction Ltd. (“Brennan”) under the Occupational Health</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 0.1. The sole issue raised on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal is whether Judge Laing was correct in holding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice of the Peace did not err in law in staying the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The Justice of the Peace based his decision to grant the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stay on two grounds.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  First, he found that as a result of misconduct on the part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Ministry of Labour investigator, Brennan’s “right to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remain silent” had been breached, in consequence of which Brennan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had suffered “unrepairable” damage to its possible defences at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial. Second, he found that the Crown had failed in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation to disclose two memoranda, one being a summary of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence gathered from the investigation, which the chief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigator had prepared for the purpose of obtaining legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advice from Ministry counsel, the other being counsel’s response</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the legal advice being sought.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Misconduct of the Chief Investigator

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The charges against Brennan arose out of a Ministry of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Labour investigation into the death of a worker at a workplace</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operated by Brennan. Prior to charges being laid, a coroner’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inquest was conducted into the death of the worker.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Before the inquest commenced, counsel for Brennan (not Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Keith) asked the chief investigator on two occasions whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ministry was planning to lay charges against Brennan. On both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occasions, the chief investigator provided misleading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information. Knowing full well that charges were going to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">laid, he advised Brennan’s counsel that the matter of charges was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">still under consideration.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The Justice of the Peace characterized that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigator’s response as “an outright lie”, in consequence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which counsel for Brennan adopted a course of conduct at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inquest that he would not otherwise have adopted. Had counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">known the true state of affairs, he would have moved to adjourn</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inquest. As it is, Brennan sought and received standing at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inquest and its counsel led evidence from one of its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees presumably on the issue of Brennan’s liability.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The Justice of the Peace found that as a result of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigator’s duplicity, Brennan had given up its right to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remain silent and this in turn had “caused unrepairable damage to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the accused’s [Brennan’s] possible defences.”  It followed, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his opinion, that the investigator’s conduct amounted to an abuse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of process, which, in conjunction with the Crown’s failure to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclose the memoranda referred to earlier, warranted a stay of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  With respect, we are of the view that the Justice of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Peace erred in relying on the conduct of the investigator as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason for granting the stay.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  As indicated, His Worship found that the investigator’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation to Brennan’s counsel caused irreparable damage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Brennan’s possible defences. That finding was based on an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erroneous assumption that Brennan had been robbed of one of its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basic rights, namely, the right of an accused to remain silent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As a corporate accused, Brennan had no such right.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] On appeal, counsel for Brennan conceded that the Justice of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Peace erred in holding that Brennan’s right to silence had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been undermined. He did, however, maintain that as a result of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the investigator’s misstatements, Brennan had acted to its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prejudice by adopting a course of conduct at the inquest that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effectively deprived Brennan of its right to a fair trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In our view, there is nothing in the record to substantiate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this submission. The stay application was brought at the outset</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the trial proceedings, before any evidence was heard. Brennan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">led no evidence on the stay application to show that as a result</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the testimony led at the inquest, including that of its own</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness, that its right to a fair trial had been irreparably</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prejudiced.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] It follows in our view, that at the very least, the ruling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made by the Justice of the Peace was premature. To the extent, if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any, that prejudice is revealed as the evidence unfolds at trial,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Brennan may renew the stay application if it sees fit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The remaining question is whether the conduct of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigator constituted such an affront to the society’s sense</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of fair play and decency that the integrity of the judicial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process would be undermined if the prosecution against Brennan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were allowed to proceed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] As reprehensible as the investigator’s conduct was, on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">balance, we believe that society’s interest in having the charges</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjudicated on the merits outweighs any affront to society’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sense of fair play and decency stemming from the investigator’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misconduct.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In this respect, we note that the charges are serious,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arising as they do from the death of a worker at a workplace</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operated by Brennan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] As for the investigator’s misconduct, much as it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inexcusable, he did not go so far as to say that no charges would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be laid against Brennan. That was an assumption made by Brennan’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel which, in our view, was unfounded.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] But for this unfounded assumption, counsel for Brennan could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have protected his client’s interest by raising the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prospective charges before the coroner and seeking an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjournment. Had this been done, the true state of affairs would,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in all likelihood, have been revealed. As it is, counsel’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfounded assumption led him to adopt a course of conduct at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coroner’s inquest which, it is now alleged, was highly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prejudicial to Brennan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] We also note that there is no suggestion of oblique motive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the part of the investigator in misrepresenting the certainty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of impending charges. There were no spurious reasons for not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">laying the charges prior to the inquest. Moreover, it has not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been shown that the Ministry of Labour gleaned information from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inquest which it either needed or relied upon in deciding to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge Brennan. To the contrary, as the Justice of the Peace</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found, the decision to charge had been made before the inquest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commenced.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Accordingly, in granting the stay of proceedings, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice of the Peace erred in relying upon the misconduct of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigator and Judge Laing erred in law in concluding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">otherwise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Failure on the Part of the Crown to Disclose

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] After the investigator completed his investigation, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared a memorandum summarizing the evidence he had gathered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">His purpose in doing so was to obtain a legal opinion from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ministry counsel as to whether charges should be laid. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure accorded with Ministry of Labour policy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] There is no indication that the memorandum in question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contained material inconsistencies or additional facts not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">already disclosed to Brennan pursuant to the Crown’s disclosure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations. As such, the investigator’s memorandum did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitute the fruits of his investigation. Rather, it was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary of information which Brennan already possessed. Properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterized, the memorandum was work product which the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not ordinarily be obliged to disclose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Apart from Brennan’s unfounded submission that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">memorandum constituted the fruits of the investigation, no other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">head of relevance was suggested. Accordingly, the Crown was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obliged to disclose the memorandum and the Justice of the Peace</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Judge Laing erred in concluding otherwise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] With respect to the second memorandum, namely, the legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response prepared by Ministry counsel, on appeal, counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent conceded that the Justice of the Peace erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordering its production. We agree. There was no basis in fact or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law warranting the production of this document.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Additional Issues

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Evidence was led before the Justice of the Peace that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cousin of the deceased, who was employed by the Ministry of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Labour, had improperly attempted to influence the investigator to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lay charges against Brennan. While the Justice of the Peace found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the conduct of the deceased’s cousin may well have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contravened the conflict of interest guidelines set down by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ministry, he found that the evidence fell short of establishing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any real or perceived influence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The evidence supports this finding and we have not been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persuaded that there is any basis for interfering with it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Finally, it was submitted that because the Ministry had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken so long to perfect this appeal, we should take this into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account in deciding whether or not the stay of proceedings was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Counsel for the Ministry candidly conceded that there was no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">excuse for the unwarranted delay of more than two years in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perfecting the appeal. Much as we are troubled by the delay,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Brennan did not adduce any evidence on the appeal to show how, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to what extent, if any, it had been prejudiced by the delay. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows, in our view, that the matter of appellate delay is best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">left to the presiding judge at trial should Brennan assert a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach its s. 11(b) Charter rights.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] In the result, we are of the view that there was no basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for staying the proceedings against Brennan. Accordingly, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal is allowed, the order staying proceedings is set aside and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the matter is remitted to trial.</font></pre></td>
