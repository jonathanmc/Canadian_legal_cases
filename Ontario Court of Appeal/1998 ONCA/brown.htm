    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants1 are members of the Paradise Riders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Motorcycle Club. On four weekends in 1991 and 1992, they were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stopped by members of the Durham Regional Police at checkpoints</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established on public highways leading to a property owned by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Paradise Riders Motorcycle Club on Lake Scugog. The appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sued the Regional Municipality of Durham Police Service Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claiming that the stops violated their rights under s. 9 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter. After a three-week trial, Justice D.S. Ferguson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed the action without costs.2 The appellants appeal from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dismissal and the respondent seeks leave to cross-appeal the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order denying the respondent its costs at trial. I would dismiss</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge made a detailed review of the evidence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his careful and comprehensive reasons. I need outline only the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parts of the evidence relevant to the appeal. In 1990, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Paradise Riders Motorcycle Club purchased a marine property on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lake Scugog near the small town of Caesarea (population 700). The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">club used the property for recreational purposes and from time to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time hosted large weekend parties. Those parties were attended by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members, friends and associates of the Paradise Riders and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">invited motorcycle clubs. Over 300 people attended some of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">functions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The police in Durham region, where the Scugog property was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">located, believed that the Paradise Riders and other similar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;outlaw&quot; motorcycle gangs were criminal organizations whose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members regularly engaged in a wide variety of criminal activity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That belief was based partly on information relating to specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members of the Paradise Riders, but mainly on general police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intelligence concerning the conduct of various outlaw motorcycle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gangs in Canada and elsewhere. That intelligence had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gathered by various forces over many years. The police believed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the members of the Paradise Riders and other similar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motorcycle gangs had a total disregard for the law ranging from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an utter disdain for regulatory schemes such as that found in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Highway Traffic Act, to a ready willingness to engage in violent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and dangerous criminal activity. It was the consensus in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police community, a consensus shared by the Durham police force,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that these gangs posed a real and present danger to law-abiding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members of the community. That danger was thought to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particularly acute when large numbers of gang members, their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">friends and associates gathered to party in relatively remote</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">areas near small communities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Durham police learned that the Paradise Riders were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">planning to hold their first large function at the Scugog</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property on the weekend of May 19-20, 1991. After making a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;threat assessment&quot;, the police decided that some proactive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">measure on their part was necessary. Based on the experience of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other police forces in similar circumstances, the Durham police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided that checkpoints should be established on the two roads</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leading into the Scugog property. These checkpoints were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established and operated on Saturday, May 19, 1991. Similar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoints were set up on July 6-7, 1991, September 7, 1991 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">June 12-13, 1992 when it was learned that large parties were to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be held at the Scugog property.3 The appellant, Petersen was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stopped on all four weekends. The appellants, Rampanen and Brown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were stopped on the three weekends in 1991.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The checkpoints operated in a similar manner on each of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four occasions. They were large-scale operations involving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately 65 officers from various police forces. In addition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the uniformed officers who actually conducted the stops,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heavily armed officers from the tactical unit, members of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various police intelligence units, and members of the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">canine unit were present at the checkpoints. Roadside screening</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">devices were also available at the checkpoints.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The officers manning the checkpoints required anyone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believed to be travelling to or from the Scugog property to pull</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">off the highway into the checkpoint. Anyone driving a Harley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Davidson motorcycle was stopped as was anyone wearing the colours</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or insignia of the Paradise Riders or one of the invited gangs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">These markings were well known to the police and were prominently</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">displayed by those who wore them. There is no suggestion in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that the police had any difficulty identifying those who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were headed to and from the Scugog property. As the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pointed out, at p. 312:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The bikers themselves have taken great pains
          to create and advertise their own profile
          both in terms of their appearance and their
          activities.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Persons who were stopped were required to produce their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licence, ownership and insurance documentation. They were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detained at the checkpoint while the information drawn from those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">documents was checked through the Canadian Police Information</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Centre (CPIC) computer. While waiting for the CPIC results,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers checked the vehicles and equipment such as helmets for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mechanical fitness and compliance with applicable safety</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standards. Those stopped were videotaped by the police. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">videotapes were used principally to assist the police in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identifying persons who were associating with members of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various gangs. Most of the actual members were well known to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police. The drivers of the vehicles and sometimes their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passengers were questioned by the police while awaiting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results of the CPIC check. If the vehicle inspection and the CPIC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">check did not reveal any basis for further detention, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles were allowed to proceed on their way. The length of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular detention depended on the number of vehicles stopped</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at any time. While estimates varied, the trial judge found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the detentions lasted from 3 to 20 minutes.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The police prepared reports after the operation of each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoint. In those reports they identified persons stopped who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were believed to be members of the various motorcycle gangs or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">associates or friends of those members. The reports also detailed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charges which were laid at each checkpoint. Most of those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charges involved alleged violations of the Highway Traffic Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and many were eventually withdrawn when the charging officers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failed to attend court.  Some of the charges were still pending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the time of this trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              III.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appellants brought this lawsuit because they viewed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoints as a form of harassment and wanted them stopped.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Their focus was not on the personal harm done to them, but on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">propriety of the police use of checkpoints to control or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intimidate groups perceived to be outside the social mainstream.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This is evident from the declaratory and injunctive relief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimed by the appellants. The respondent also focussed on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">propriety of checkpoints as a law enforcement technique and not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the specific stops of the individual appellants. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent sought judicial confirmation of its position that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoints were a legitimate response to the dangers posed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the community by organizations such as the Paradise Riders.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] While the trial judge was alive to the broad perspectives</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advanced by both sides, he quite properly recognized that it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his duty to decide the validity of the claims as pleaded by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants. Apart from an abuse of process claim that was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected at trial and not pursued on appeal, the appellants'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim rested entirely on an allegation of unconstitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention arising out of the stops of the three appellants at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four checkpoints. That allegation is found in paragraphs 7 and 12</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the amended statement of claim:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          7.   Brown, Petersen and Rampanen state that
          in particular, between the dates of May 15,
          1991 and September 7, 1991, they were
          personally stopped by the Defendant's agents
          at the location described above on every
          occasion when they sought to either enter or
          leave the hamlet of Caesarea. These
          Plaintiffs state that at no time did the
          Defendant or its agents have reasonable and
          probable grounds to stop these Plaintiffs,
          who state that such stoppages constituted an
          unlawful detention, the legal aspects of
          which are described below.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          12.  Further, the Plaintiffs state that they
          and all other users of the marina property
          have a right to be free from illegal
          detention, pursuant to Section 9 of the
          Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
          Absent any reasonable and probable grounds to
          so detain the Plaintiffs, the Defendant and
          its agents acted in contravention of the
          Plaintiffs' Charter rights, so as to entitle
          these Plaintiffs to damages. [Emphasis
          added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The same allegation is made in respect of the June, 1992</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoint in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the amended statement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Very late in the trial, the appellants attempted to broaden</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their claim to include allegations of violations of ss. 7 and 8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Charter arising primarily out of the police videotaping of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persons detained at the road checks. The trial judge was prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to permit the amendment if the appellants would pay certain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">associated costs. Those terms were not acceptable to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants who decided to proceed on the allegation as framed in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amended statement of claim. The appellants formally abandoned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any claim under s. 7 or s. 8 arising out of the police conduct at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the checkpoints. Consequently, the sole issue for the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was whether the appellants were unconstitutionally detained when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stopped at the road checks.4

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The evidence describing the stops of the appellants at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">checkpoints in 1991 and 1992 came primarily from Mr. Petersen and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Rampanen. Mr. Brown did not testify and apart from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indications in the police reports that he was stopped in 1991</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there is no evidence to support his claim. Mr. Paul Braybrook, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member of Paradise Riders also testified. With the exception of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the events leading to the arrest of Mr. Rampanen in September,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991 on a charge of disturbing the peace, the respondent did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenge Mr. Petersen's and Mr. Rampanen's descriptions of what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">happened when they were stopped at the checkpoints.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Mr. Petersen was stopped at all four checkpoints referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the statement of claim. He was stopped going to and coming</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the Scugog property. According to him, the length of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detentions varied from as long as 25 minutes on one occasion to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as brief as 1 or 2 minutes on another occasion. Each time Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Petersen was stopped, he was required to produce his licence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ownership and insurance. A CPIC check was conducted. While</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">awaiting the results of that check, he was surrounded by a number</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of officers and his motorcycle and helmet were examined to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine if they met applicable safety standards. Mr. Petersen</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said that he was questioned by the police but gave no evidence as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the substance of those questions. He said he was intimidated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the presence of so many police officers, some of whom were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heavily armed, and felt the stops significantly interfered with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his ability to enjoy the use of the Scugog property. Mr. Petersen</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was charged with violations of the Highway Traffic Act on two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occasions. According to him, one charge was outstanding at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time of trial and the other had been withdrawn because of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawsuit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Mr. Rampanen was not certain how many times he was stopped.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Like Mr. Petersen, he was required to produce his licence and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">related documentation and wait while a CPIC check was conducted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He said that while he was waiting he was questioned by one of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of officers who surrounded his motorcycle. He described</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these questions as &quot;benign&quot; and said they did not involve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questions about criminal activity or specific investigations. Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rampanen was detained for 10 to 20 minutes on each occasion. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">July, 1991, he was charged with three violations of the Highway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Traffic Act.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] At the September, 1991 road check, Mr. Rampanen became fed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">up with what he regarded as police harassment and refused to give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his licence and other documentation to the police, but would only</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... I think such a conclusion would be
          unreasonable because it would remove the
          authority of the police to stop motorists
          where they had an unrelated purpose which
          might not lawfully justify a stop but also
          had highway traffic concerns which would
          alone justify a stop. It would mean that
          where a police officer has other reasons to
          want to stop a motorist he is thereby
          deprived of the right under the Highway
          Traffic Act to use his established right to
          stop a motorist in order to investigate
          highway traffic matters.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It seems to me that where the police have
          highway traffic concerns and other unrelated
          concerns, then the limit on their conduct
          should be imposed by limiting their conduct
          after the stop. ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] I agree with this conclusion as long as the other purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motivating the stop are not themselves improper. For example, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police are entitled on a s. 216(1) stop to require drivers to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">produce their licences. That requirement is consistent with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">highway safety concerns which underlie the power granted by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">section. In addition to ensuring that the driver is properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licensed, the police may wish to identify the driver for other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes. It may be, as in this case, that the police are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interested in knowing the identity of all those who are connected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with what they believe to be organized criminal activity. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gathering of police intelligence is well within the ongoing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police duty to investigate criminal activity. As long as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional police purpose is not improper and does not entail an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infringement on the liberty or security of the detained person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beyond that contemplated by the purpose animating s. 216(1) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the HTA, I see no reason for declaring that a legitimate police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest beyond highway safety concerns should taint the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawfulness of the stop and detention. As the trial judge pointed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out, known criminals should not be more immune from s. 216(1)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stops than law abiding citizens who are not known to the police.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this position. Storrey argued that even if the police had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him, his arrest was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unlawful because the police intended to use Storrey's detention</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to further their investigation by placing him in a line-up.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Storrey maintained that the ulterior purpose of furthering the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ongoing investigation rendered his arrest and subsequent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention contrary to s. 9 of the Charter. Cory J., for an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unanimous court, found that the officer had reasonable and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">probable grounds to arrest Storrey. He went on to hold that their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention to pursue the investigation after the arrest was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">improper but was necessary if the police were to properly perform</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their &quot;essential role&quot; of investigating crime. He concluded, at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p. 327:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          An arrest which is lawfully made does not
          become unlawful simply because the police
          intend to continue their investigation after
          the arrest. To repeat, in the case at bar the
          police had reasonable and probable grounds on
          which to base their decision to arrest the
          appellant. Further, there was nothing
          improper about the police intention to
          continue their investigation of the crime
          after they had made the arrest. Neither that
          intention nor the continued investigation
          made the arrest unlawful. The circumstances
          of the arrest of the appellant did not
          constitute an infringement of s. 9 of the
          Charter.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The reasoning in Storrey is equally applicable where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police intend, within the confines of the stop and detention</font></pre>

          nothing to indicate that there was anything
          in the circumstances of the arrest which
          would make it suspect on any other ground.
          That is to say, there is no indication that
          the arrest was made because a police officer
          was biased towards a person of a different
          race, nationality or colour, or that there
          was a personal enmity between a police
          officer directed toward the person arrested.

          aimed at reducing the terrible toll of death
          and injury so often occasioned by impaired
          drivers or by dangerous vehicles. The primary
          aim of the program is thus to check for
          sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and
          the mechanical fitness of cars. The police
          use of check stops should not be extended
          beyond those aims. Random stop programs must
          not be turned into a means of conducting
          either an unfounded general inquisition or an
          unreasonable search. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which is in itself improper, e.g. to conduct an unconstitutional</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">powers to stop motorists. He was alive to the potential abuse of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that power and sought to minimize that potential by limiting the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I do see strong policy reasons for invalidating a stop where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police have an additional improper purpose. Highway safety</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not, in my view, authorize discriminatory stops even where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there is a highway safety purpose behind those stops.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] When I refer to improper police purposes, I include purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which are illegal, purposes which involve the infringement of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person's constitutional rights and purposes which have nothing to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who stop persons intending to conduct unauthorized searches, or</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 216(1) of the HTA even if they also have highway safety</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerns when making the stop.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] The police purposes, when effecting a stop and detention,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the persons detained, and other evidence concerning the conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the stops. If the police routinely searched every vehicle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stopped it would be easy to infer that one of the purposes behind</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Similarly, if only people of colour were stopped at a checkpoint,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inference could be made that the stop was discriminatory and,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore, improper.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Stops which are selective in the sense that a certain person</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be improper and not authorized by s. 216(1) of the HTA. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria used to establish the &quot;target&quot; groups may be germane to</font></pre>

          a road check would probably turn up evidence
          of highway traffic offences. I have already
          mentioned the police information concerning
          offences discovered at other biker road

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to highway safety concerns which the trial judge found also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motivated the stops. The trial judge listed some 9 purposes for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stops (pp. 323-24). I would place them in four groups:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">!    highway safety concerns;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">!    maintenance of the public peace;
!    investigation of other criminal activity; and
!    intelligence gathering.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] None of these purposes are per se improper and all fall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the duties assigned to a police officer under the Police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P.15 s. 42(1)(a)(b) and (d). The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact that none of the additional police purposes were per se</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">improper, only partially determines whether any of these purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can be said to taint an otherwise lawful stop. If the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended to pursue a lawful purpose through improper means, then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in my view their purpose would be an improper one. For example,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">while the investigation of crime is a legitimate police purpose,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an intention to pursue that purpose by way of unconstitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">searches would render the police purpose improper. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge made no finding that the police intended to go beyond the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limits of the detention allowed by s. 216(1) of the HTA in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuit of their legitimate purposes. He also made no finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the police intended to conduct improper searches of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles while they were stopped. He did find that on some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occasions the police went beyond the limits of s. 216(1) (e.g.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some passengers were asked for identification and one officer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">looked into the saddlebags of one of the detained motorcycles).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">While these occurrences could offer some evidence of the use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">improper means to pursue a proper police purpose, they did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lead the trial judge to conclude that the use of those improper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">means were part and parcel of purposes for the stops.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The police videotaping of those detained at the checkpoints</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires separate consideration. The videotaping was clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">planned and intended to assist the police in gathering</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intelligence. It is fair to say that one of the purposes in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operating the checkpoints was to videotape detained persons so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they could be identified as members or associates of one or more</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge's conclusion, at p. 326, that the videotaping by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police was not relevant to the appellants' claim that they were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subjected to an unconstitutional detention.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notes that even the appellants saw the advantage of videotaping</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analysis required at the second stage of the Waterfield approach</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the justifiability of an officer's

          including the duty being performed, the
          extent to which some interference with
          individual liberty is necessitated in order
          to perform that duty, the importance of the
          performance of that duty to the public good,

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case, I am concerned only with the police exercise of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">peacekeeping and crime prevention duties. Nothing in these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons should be taken as determinative of the scope of police</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] In the criminal law context, police and individual interests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">typically intersect after the alleged commission of a crime. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police power to interfere with individual liberty or security is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tied to their ability to link the individual to the event or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">events under investigation. This societal harm done by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commission of the crime and the suspect's connection to that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">event provide the justification for state action which interferes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with individual freedoms.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] According to this paradigm, the police conduct is reactive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, in so far as it interferes with individual liberty or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security, is circumscribed by the police ability to meet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">preestablished standards which are said to forge a sufficiently</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strong connection between the past event and the individual to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">warrant interference with constitutional rights. For example, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrest power is typically triggered when the police have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">committed an indictable offence: Criminal Code, s. 495(1)(a). The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual's constitutional right under s. 9 yields only when the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police can meet that standard. Similarly, the &quot;investigative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention&quot; power recognized in Simpson, supra, is a reactive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">power dependent upon a reasonable belief that the detained person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is implicated in a prior criminal act. The protection against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police excess rests not only in the standard itself, but in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retrospective application. It is self-evident that assessments of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what has happened and an individual's involvement in those past</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">events are much more likely to be reliable than are assessments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of what may happen in the future and the involvement that an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual may have in those events should they occur.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] Not all law enforcement is reactive. The police duty to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prevent crime and maintain the public peace commands proactive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">measures on their part. Often those measures do not conflict with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any individual rights and do not raise constitutional issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Many facets of community based policing involve proactive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">measures taken with the full support and cooperation of those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affected by the measures. Similarly, a significant police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presence does not, without more, interfere with individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights. In many situations, that presence without further police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">activity, will maintain the public peace and prevent crime.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, there is much to be said for the appellants' submission</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the large police presence in the vicinity of the Scugog</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property would have maintained the public peace without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interfering with the appellants' ability to travel to and from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] Proactive policing is in many ways more efficient and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effective than reactive policing. Where proactive steps do not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collide with individual rights, that increased efficiency and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effectiveness comes at no constitutional cost. Even where there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is interference with individual rights, the societal gains are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sometimes worth the interference. This is most often the case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the proactive measures are taken in the context of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regulatory scheme such as the Highway Traffic Act. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justification under s. 1 of the Charter for the arbitrary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention allowed by s. 216(1) of the HTA is premised on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">realization that preventative steps taken by the police,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including ones which interfere with individual liberties, are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">essential to the maintenance of an acceptable level of safety on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public thoroughfares. It must be stressed, however, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual rights which are interfered with when the police act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proactively in a regulated area are qualified rights (e.g. the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;right&quot; to drive). It is easier to justify state interference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a qualified right than it is to justify interference with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct which is not subject to government regulation. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's claim that the detentions were authorized under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common law ancillary doctrine in no way depends on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants' status as motorists at the time of the detention. On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this argument, the appellants could have been stopped if they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were merely walking down the road.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] Preventative policing which limits an individual's liberty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is not, however, limited to the regulatory sphere. There are at</font></pre>

          therefore, the right to arrest a person who
          he reasonably believes is about to breach the
          peace would be to disable him from preventing
          that which might cause serious injury to
          someone or even to many people or to
          property. The common law, we believe, whilst
          recognizing that a wrongful arrest is a
          serious invasion of a person's liberty,
          provides the police with this power in the
          public interest.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Lavin, [1982] A.C. 546 at 565, where Lord Diplock said:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Every citizen in whose presence a breach
          of the peace is being or reasonably appears
          to be about to be, committed has the right to
          take reasonable steps to make the person who
          is breaking or threatening to break the peace
          refrain from doing so; and those reasonable
          steps in appropriate cases will include
          detaining him against his will. At common law
          this is not only the right of every citizen,
          it is also his duty, although, except in the
          case of a citizen who is a constable, it is a
          duty of imperfect obligation.

          to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal
          law. It is sufficient if its natural

          provoke others to violence, and so some

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] Two features of the common law power to arrest or detain to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prevent an apprehended breach of the peace merit emphasis. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apprehended breach must be imminent and the risk that the breach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will occur must be substantial. The mere possibility of some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unspecified breach at some unknown point in time will not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffice. These features of the power to arrest or detain to avoid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a breach of the peace place that power on the same footing as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statutory power to arrest in anticipation of the commission of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indictable offence. That is not to say that the two powers are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coextensive. Many indictable offences do not involve a breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the peace and, as indicated above, conduct resulting in an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apprehended breach of the peace need not involve the commission</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognition that intervention is needed to avoid the harm which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is likely to flow in the immediate future if no intervention is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made. To properly invoke either power, the police officer must</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct, be it a breach of the peace or the commission of an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation which led to the roadside detentions, I am not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied that the detentions were a justifiable intrusion on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants' rights and, therefore, a proper exercise of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ancillary powers. In arriving at the conclusion, I have in mind</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    Any apprehended harm was not imminent;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    There was no specific identifiable harm which the detentions
sought to prevent. The police had a general concern that the
situation could get out of hand unless it was made clear to the
appellants, their friends and associates that the police were in
control;
    The police concern that some harm could occur rested not on
what those detained had done, but rather on what others who
shared a similar lifestyle with those who were detained had done
at other places and at other times;
    The liberty interfered with was not a qualified liberty like
the right to drive, but rather the fundamental right to move
about in the community;
    The interference with individual liberty resulting from the
police conduct was substantial in terms of the number of persons
detained, the number of times individuals were detained and the
length of the detentions; and
    The detentions could not be said to be necessary to the
maintenance of the public peace. A large police presence without
detention would have served that purpose. In fact, it is arguable
that the confrontational nature of the detentions served to put
the public peace at risk.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] In this case, the police chose to detain the appellants and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their friends and associates in the belief that the detentions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would diminish the risk that a situation would develop in which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there would be an imminent risk of harm. In effect, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent would extend the common law power to arrest or detain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to prevent an imminent breach of the peace to a power to detain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whenever the detention would assist in keeping the public peace.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent would equate the police duty to keep the peace and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the police power to take steps to keep the peace. This equation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ignores the importance attached to individual liberties in our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">society. The common law ancillary power doctrine has never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equated the scope of the police duties with the breach of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police powers to interfere with individual liberty in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance of those duties: R. v. Simpson, supra, at p. 493. Any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interference with individual liberty must be justified as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary:  R. v. Dedman, supra. When taking proactive measures</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to maintain the public peace, the requisite necessity arises only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when there is a real risk of imminent harm. Before that point is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reached, proactive policing must be limited to steps which do not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interfere with individual freedoms.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] The balance struck between common law police powers and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">real risk of imminent harm before the police can interfere with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual rights will leave the police powerless to prevent</font></pre>

     1    The trial judge found that the corporate appellant had
no claim and this finding was not challenged on appeal. No
further reference need be made to the corporate appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2    The trial judge's reasons are reported at (1996), 106
C.C.C. (3d) 302, 134 D.L.R. (4th) 177. References in these
reasons are to the report in the Canadian Criminal Cases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3    The police continued to use checkpoints whenever the
Paradise Riders had large weekend functions up until the trial
early in 1996. Much of the evidence dealt with stops subsequent
to those alleged in the statement of claim. It was agreed that
the later stops were conducted in a manner which was very similar
to those referred to in the statement of claim.
     4    In their factum, the appellants tried to revive their
s. 7 claim without challenging the trial judge's ruling on their
motion to amend their statement of claim. That position was not
pursued in oral argument and, in my view, could not be pursued
successfully given the conduct of the trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     5    Although he found that the alleged assault could not
provide a basis for relief on the claim as framed, the trial
judge did find that if Mr. Rampanen was arbitrarily detained, the
police conduct during that detention would be relevant in
determining the appropriate remedy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     6    This issue was left open by the Supreme Court of Canada
in R. v. Latimer (1997), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 204. It also
remains an open question in New Zealand, where s. 22 of the New
Zealand Bill of Rights provides for a right to be free of
arbitrary detention in language which is identical to s. 9: see
R. v. Goodwin (No. 2) [1993] 3 N.Z.L.R. 390 at 393-94 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     7    I include a parking lot adjacent to the road as the
part of the roadside for present purposes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     8    For example, the appellants argued that there was no
evidence that the manner in which they customized their vehicles
made them unsafe and the trial judge erred in finding that the
customizing of the motorcycles provided a basis for suspecting
that the vehicles were unsafe.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     9    The trial judge, having found that the stops were
lawful under s. 216(1), quite properly declined to consider
whether the common law power justified the stops (p. 240).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     10    The recently enacted s. 810.01 of the Criminal Code
gives special peace bond powers exercisable only with the consent
of the Attorney General, in connection with the apprehended
commission of criminal organization offences. That power did not
exist when these road checks were instituted, however, the
respondent did not suggest that it could have acted under s.
810.01 had it been available.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     11    It is worthy of note that although Parliament recently
enacted specific provisions dealing with organized crime, some of
which give the police enhanced investigative powers, none of
those provisions could justify these detentions. The new Criminal
Code provisions are discussed by Professor Stuart in &quot;Politically
Expedient But Potentially Unjust Legislation Against Gangs&quot;
(1988), 2 Can. Crim. L.R. 208. I, of course, do not intend to
pass upon the constitutionality of any of the statutory
provisions which authorize proactive police measures.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     12    Sections 30 and 31 of the Criminal Code authorize
arrest and detention after or during a breach of the peace, but
do not authorize arrest or detention for an apprehended breach of
the public peace.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     13    In R. v. Howell, supra, the court also recognized that
the threat of harm could be to the property of a person present
when harm was threatened to the property. Presumably, this
extension of the concept of public peace recognized that violence
to a person would be a likely consequence should damage be done
to the property of a person who was present when that damage was
done.</font></pre></td>
