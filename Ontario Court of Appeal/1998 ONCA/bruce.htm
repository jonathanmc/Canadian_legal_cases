</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This is an appeal, with leave, from the January 30, 1998 judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Dambrot J. dismissing the appellants' application for judicial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review of the decision of the Bruce County Council to adopt a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">county-wide municipal restructuring plan. Under the proposed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructuring, 30 existing municipal corporations in the County</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Bruce (the &quot;County&quot;) would be reduced to eight.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants are two small local municipalities,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(amalgamated into one municipality as of January 1, 1998), in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bruce County. They have about 3.6 per cent of the County</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">population and 3.4 per cent of the total electors in the County.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">They opposed the restructuring option adopted by County Council</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on October 21, 1997, because their representation in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructured Bruce County would be reduced.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On their application for judicial review, the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contend that before approving the restructuring proposal in issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this appeal, County Council failed to comply with statutorily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required pre-conditions to the exercise of its jurisdiction to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make a restructuring proposal to the Minister. In particular,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bruce Township and Tiverton submit that County Council failed to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, as amended, with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result that its decision to adopt the restructuring proposal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">void in law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The motions judge dismissed the appellants' application for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicial review of County Council's decision to make the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructuring proposal it did. In his analysis, he assumed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the &quot;principles&quot; contained in a Guide circulated by the Minister</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to be considered by County Council in developing its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructuring proposal. He found that there was nothing in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record from which he could conclude that members of County</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Council failed in their assumed duty to consider the principles.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellants contend that the motions judge misapprehended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence and that he failed to consider relevant evidence and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the absence of conflicting evidence in reaching that conclusion.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Although there is a significant factual element to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal in respect of what the County Council, and its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Restructuring Committee, did in developing the restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal that County Council submitted to the Minister of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Municipal Affairs and Housing (the &quot;Minister&quot;) for approval,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there is a major underlying issue in this case. This issue is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">role of the courts in reviewing decisions of a validly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constituted elected body, not on the basis of what the elected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">body did, but rather on the basis of an assessment of what the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elected body considered in developing that proposal.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MUNICIPAL RESTRUCTURING
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On January 30, 1996, by a statute entitled the Savings and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Restructuring Act, S.O. 1996, c. 1, the Municipal Act was amended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to streamline the process for municipal restructuring.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Before 1996, municipal restructuring took place by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application to the Ontario Municipal Board under the Municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, through the process established by the Municipal Boundary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Negotiations Act, 1981, or by special Act of the Legislature. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1996 Municipal Act amendments substantially changed the process</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for municipal restructuring.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Section 25.4 of the Municipal Act (as amended by the Savings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Restructuring Act) provides:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          25.4 The Minister may establish restructuring
          principles that shall be considered,
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  by municipalities and local bodies when
               developing a restructuring proposal to
               be submitted to the Minister under
               subsection 25.2(2); and
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  by a commission when developing
               restructuring proposals under section
               25.3(1).


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  As can be seen, s. 25.4 does not require the Minister to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establish restructuring &quot;principles.&quot; However, if the Minister</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does establish such principles, s. 25.4 requires a municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation to consider them in developing a restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal to be submitted to the Minister under s. 25.2(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Under the scheme established by the Municipal Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amendments, a municipal corporation's restructuring proposal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made to the Minister in the form of a &quot;restructuring report.&quot; If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the restructuring report contains the necessary information the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Minister shall, by order, implement the restructuring proposal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Minister does not pass judgment on the substantive merits of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the restructuring proposal or apply the &quot;principles&quot; referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in s. 25.4. The &quot;principles&quot; are to be considered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipality, if the restructuring is by a municipality under s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">25.4(a). The degree of political support required for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructuring is set out in the regulations passed under the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Manifestly, the legislative intent is that municipalities develop</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;made in the municipality&quot; restructuring proposals.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Neither the Act nor the regulations impose any particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process for the development of a restructuring proposal by a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipality such as Bruce County. Nor do the Act or the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regulations prescribe when in the restructuring process the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Minister's &quot;principles&quot; are to be considered. The process leading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a restructuring report, for the most part, has been left to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the discretion of local politicians.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In August 1996, the Minister established the restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles contemplated by s. 25.4 of the Municipal Act. These</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles were contained in a published document entitled, &quot;A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Guide to Municipal Restructuring&quot; (the &quot;Guide&quot;). The Guide also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contained suggestions about whether and how municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructurings might be considered and undertaken.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The principles published in the Guide are as follows:

          the minister under section 25.4 of the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">BRUCE COUNTY RESTRUCTURING

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] County Council established a Restructuring Committee (the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Committee&quot;) in September 1996. According to Stuart Reavie, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chair of the Restructuring Committee, the composition of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee took into account the need to reflect &quot;... the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rural/urban, north/south and large/small characteristics of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">local municipalities within the County.&quot; Apparently no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">councillors from Bruce Township or Tiverton volunteered to sit on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Committee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] At that time, there were 30 local municipalities (towns,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">villages and townships) in Bruce County, including the two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants. As well, restructuring was not new to Bruce County.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, the County restructuring process had been ongoing, at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">least on an intermittent basis, since 1974.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Comprehensive studies concerning the impact of county-wide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal restructuring had been published in November 1975 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">March 1991. These studies were made available to members of Bruce</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">County Council and to the Committee. The 1975 report is not in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence, however, the 1991 report is in evidence. I will refer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to it in more detail shortly.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] From December 1996 to April 1997, the Committee reviewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">previous restructuring studies and conducted a survey of local</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal councils to determine their views on restructuring. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee was of the view that, in light of the uncertainty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">associated with provincial downloading of services to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipalities, it was sensible to resort to the 1991 data as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those data were as accurate as anything that could be produced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">currently in respect of the impact of restructuring on municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">spending. Thus, the Committee did not commission a similar study.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In May 1997 the Committee decided to recommend to Council a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">county-wide restructuring proposal consisting of a two tiered, 8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal unit system (the &quot;May proposal&quot;).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] On May 20, 1997, County Council approved the May proposal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When the May proposal was approved by County Council neither of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants raised any concerns about its contents, or about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the failure of the Committee, or Council, to consider the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles set out in the Guide in developing the proposal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The Minister refused to approve the May proposal because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lack of detail. Thus, the Committee had to continue its work. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided to consider other restructuring options for presentation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at its July 17, 1997 meeting.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] At the July 17, 1997 meeting, the Committee decided to</font></pre>

               Alternative B. This assumes that, under

               A (Bruce-Tiv.-N.K. Twp.). Option 1 (May
               1997) and Alternative B (3 S.W. County
               units) introduce more variation in the

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Following the provincial decision to deny our
          request to proceed with the May proposal,
          Council once again confirmed the need to
          develop a made in Bruce County solution to
          the restructuring issue and directed this
          committee to develop, with local input, this
          final draft proposal. We recognize that
          because this proposal contains more detail
          than the May proposal, it may provide more
          opportunity to find a reason for not
          supporting it. We understand that there are a
          number of municipalities that do not agree
          with one or two aspects of the proposal. We
          ask that you consider the previous support
          shown this year to proceed with
          restructuring. This proposal, with one
          boundary adjustment, is basically the same
          proposal that received majority support in
          May. It will create a stronger system of
          local government based on eight local
          municipalities large enough to provide
          efficient services to the taxpayer yet small
          enough to ensure accessibility and reflect
          local communities of interest.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Over the past year this committee has
          repeatedly challenged this Council to grasp
          the opportunity to create a made in Bruce
          local government structure that will position
          us to provide the required services to
          residents in a cost effective and responsive
          manner. We are confident that you will once
          again meet that challenge by approving the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Council did not consider are, to say the least, general and it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seems to me that it would be difficult for anyone, who gave the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter any consideration at all, not to take these principles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into account when considering the structural reorganization of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">county, as happened here. In summary form they require</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration of:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     *    the cost efficiencies to be generated by &quot;less government&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and in the provision of municipal services;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     *    an efficient, fair, accessible and accountable system of

          political representation at the local and county level;
     
     *    the financial capacity to provide municipal services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          from municipal resources;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     *    a municipal governmental structure that would foster job

          creation, investment and economic growth.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The appellants, in their submissions, emphasize that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria used to assess the merits, or otherwise, of the two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">options placed before County Council in October 1997, including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the expected impact of each proposal, do not appear in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposals and were not set out in writing in any document</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared by or on behalf of the Committee or County Council. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants submit that the absence of any paper trail in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee and Council minutes must lead to the conclusion that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">County Council did not &quot;consider&quot; the Minister's principles as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set out in the Guide.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] County Council was required by s. 25.4 of the Municipal Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to do no more than &quot;consider&quot; the Minister's principles. In my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion, that imposes no greater requirement on County Council</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than to take the principles into account when developing a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restructuring proposal to be submitted to the Minister. Section</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">25.4 does not state how or when the principles are to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered. Moreover, to &quot;consider&quot; is a somewhat conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement in the sense that it does not imply that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles must be followed in the development of a restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Although consideration of the very broad principles to which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I have referred is required, there is no requirement that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be specific evidence that each principle was considered each time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a particular step was taken in what was an extended restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Considerable deference must be extended to elected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representatives undertaking what is essentially a legislative</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">my opinion, courts are not equipped to micro-manage a process</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such as the restructuring process undertaken in Bruce County. To</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do so would result in the judicialization of what was intended to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be a political process. The courts should only interfere in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">egregious circumstances where it is manifest that statutorily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed pre-conditions have not been met. Here, the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have not established that the principles were not considered.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] In any case, a review of the record supports Dambrot J.'s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion that the County Council did consider the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles. There was ample evidence to support his conclusion in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that regard and I see no basis upon which to interfere with it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It is not for the courts to second guess the restructuring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision made by County Council.
