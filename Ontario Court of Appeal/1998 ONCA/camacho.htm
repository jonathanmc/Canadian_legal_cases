    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant appeals his convictions, by a court composed

of Crossland J. and a jury, of conspiracy to import narcotics and

conspiracy to traffic in narcotics.  Both conspiracies result

from the same incident.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  At a first trial, the appellant was jointly tried with

Benedicta Rojas, the appellant's common-law spouse.  Rojas was

acquitted of both charges after the trial judge (not the trial

judge in this case) directed the jury to enter an acquittal

against her.  The jury was unable to agree on a verdict for the

appellant and a mistrial was declared.  At the second trial, the

appellant was found guilty on both charges.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in ruling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Rojas' acquittal was not admissible at his second trial.  In

our view, there was no error.  As a general rule, the evidence of

a witness' acquittal is not relevant to the accused's guilt or

innocence and is inadmissible at the accused's trial.  This case

does not fall within the exception to this rule that evidence of

a witness' acquittal may be admitted for the limited purpose of

showing that the witness has no personal interest in the outcome

of the case.  See R. v. Martin (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 425 (Ont.

C.A.).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In the present case, there was no evidentiary foundation

implicating the witness Rojas in the commission of the offences

charged, either as a perpetrator or accomplice.  There was no

suggestion (or inference) that Rojas was criminally liable, nor

was there any evidence suggesting she had been charged.

Accordingly, evidence of her acquittal was not required to rebut

any inference that her testimony was aimed at absolving herself

from criminal liability.  Moreover, her personal interest in the

outcome of the case was obvious: she was the appellant's common-

law spouse and the mother of their young child.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Rojas' acquittal, given that it was the result of a directed

verdict, established nothing more than that the evidence adduced

against her was insufficient to justify her conviction.  The

acquittal did not enhance her credibility nor reflect adversely

on the credibility of Detective Caravella, the Crown's main

witness.  As such, the evidence of the acquittal was not relevant

to the  innocence or guilt of the appellant  and was inadmissible

at the second trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in

failing to properly edit the appellant's criminal record.  The

defence attacked the credibility of Detective Caravella.  The

trial judge recognized the necessity of presenting a fair picture

to the jury.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  In these circumstances, the trial judge properly exercised

his discretion (see R. v. Corbett (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385

(S.C.C.).  He gave the jury a clear and correct direction as to

the limited use it could make of the criminal record.  We see no

error in the exercise of his discretion.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Finally, the appellant appeals the sentence of twelve years'

imprisonment imposed by the trial judge.  In light of the nature

(cocaine) and quantity of the drug involved (2.5 kg), the role of

the appellant in the conspiracies, and his criminal record which

included previous drug convictions, a substantial sentence was

warranted.  However, having regard to the appellant's age and

counsel's account of his good behaviour since his conviction and

release pending appeal, we think a custodial term of nine years

would meet the requirements of general and specific deterrence.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.

Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed to

the extent of reducing the sentence to nine years.</font></pre></td>
