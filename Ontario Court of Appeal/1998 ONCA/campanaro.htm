</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   Section  258(1)  of the Insurance Act, R.S.O.  1990,  c.  I.8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permits an injured plaintiff, who has recovered judgment against  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligent  driver, to sue the driver's automobile insurer.  Section</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">258(5)  limits the insurer's defence in such an action. It prevents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  insurer  from  alleging in its defence that an  instrument  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issued  as  a motor vehicle liability policy is not such a  policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  relevant provisions of s. 258 (particulary s-ss. (4) and  (5))</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have  come to be known as the absolute liability provisions of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Act.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   These two appeals, which were argued together, raise the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  --  can  the  insurer defend the action contemplated  by  s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">258(1)  on the basis of its insured's misrepresentation as  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ownership of the insured automobile, notwithstanding the provisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  s.  258(5). Put another way, the issue is whether the  defence-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limiting  provisions of s. 258(5) apply when the  misrepresentation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  issue is a misrepresentation as to the ownership of the insured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The resolution of this issue requires the court to reconsider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  judgment in Minister of Transport et al. v. London  &amp;  Midland</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">General Insurance Co., [1971] 3 O.R. 147. In London &amp; Midland, Gale</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.J.O.  held  that, notwithstanding what is now s.  258(5)  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Act, the insurer may defend the plaintiff's action on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis  that  the  policy  that  it issued  is  void  because  of  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation  as to the ownership of the  insured  automobile.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellants contend that the &quot;absolute liability&quot; provisions  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Insurance  Act, particularly s. 258(5), preclude  the  insurer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  defending  a judgment creditor's claim on the  basis  of  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation, including a misrepresentation as to ownership of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the insured vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   In  the two actions before us, on motions brought under  Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22,  the motions judges both concluded that they were bound by this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court's  judgment  in  London &amp; Midland with the  result  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongdoers' automobile insurer, State Farm, in both cases, was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required  to pay the plaintiffs' claims. It was accepted  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">named  insured,  in  each case, was not the  actual  owner  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured automobiles. Zurich Indemnity Company of Canada (&quot;Zurich&quot;),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the Campanaro action, and Royal Insurance Canada (&quot;Royal&quot;),  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Truelove action, provided uninsured motorist coverage  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs.  The result of the orders appealed from is that  Zurich</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  Royal,  not State Farm, had to pay the Campanaro and  Truelove</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   Zurich and Royal appeal. Both insurers take the position that</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions of the Insurance Act, it was wrongly decided.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  facts  in  both  cases are not in  dispute  and  can  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summarized briefly.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  The Campanaro Action (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 274
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Ki-Jin Kim bought a Dodge station wagon in 1985 with his  own</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">money. Shortly after the purchase, he transferred the ownership  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Dodge to his brother, Ki-Suk Kim, for no consideration. Only Ki-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jin Kim drove the Dodge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  After the ownership transfer, Ki-Suk Kim applied to State Farm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for insurance on the Dodge. In his application, he represented that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was the Dodge's actual and registered owner. In fact, he was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered  owner; his representation that he was the actual  owner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was false. State Farm issued a policy to Ki-Suk Kim.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   On September 8, 1987, the Dodge, negligently driven by Ki-Jin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kim, its actual, but not registered, owner collided with a GMC  van</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">driven  by  the  plaintiff, Romualdo Campanaro. Mr.  Campanaro  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injured.  The  GMC  van  driven by Mr.  Campanaro  was  insured  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Travelers.  Mr.  Campanaro's policy included  statutorily  required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uninsured motorist coverage.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  On May 30, 1988, State Farm took the position that its policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the  Dodge  station  wagon was void  because  of  Ki-Suk  Kim's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation  that he owned it. State Farm returned  the  full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premium that it had received.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] On August 4, 1989, Campanaro sued Travelers and Zurich. Zurich</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  a  successor  company  to  Travelers  and  is  responsible  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Travelers' liabilities. Thus, Zurich is the only appellant involved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the Campanaro appeal. Campanaro's claim against Zurich was made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  the  uninsured motorist coverage in his automobile insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy.  On  December 4, 1990, Zurich added State Farm as  a  third</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party.  On  March  5,  1991,  Ki-Jin  Kim  and  Ki-Suk  Kim  sought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contribution  or  indemnity  from  State  Farm  in  a  third  party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding.  On  December  21,  1991,  Zurich  added  Ki-Jin  Kim's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer, Carpet Clearance Warehouse, as a third party.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] When pleadings were completed, State Farm moved under Rule  22</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  a  declaration that it was not required to pay  the  Campanaro</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim  because  of  the named insured's misrepresentation  that  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owned  the  insured  automobile.  The  motions  judge,  Gotlib  J.,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that she was bound by this court's judgment in  London  &amp;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Midland and dismissed the third party action against State Farm.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  Truelove Action, [unreported, May 9, 1996]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  Duane  Thompson was the registered owner of two  all  terrain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles (&quot;ATVs&quot;), one being an 1984 Honda. The ATVs were kept at a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hunting  camp  owned by Duane Thompson and were regularly  used  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members  of  the  Thompson  family, including  the  defendant  Alan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hamilton,   Duane  Thompson's  son-in-law.  The  defendant,   Scott</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Thompson, Duane Thompson's son, was the ATVs' most frequent driver.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  Duane Thompson obtained insurance on the ATVs with Royal from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1984 until some time in 1988, when he asked Alan Hamilton to obtain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance  on them. The purpose was to secure coverage at  a  lower</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premium.  In November 1988, Alan Hamilton went to the office  of  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">State Farm agent and completed an application for insurance on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two  ATVs.  The application stated that Alan Hamilton was both  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actual and registered owner of the ATVs. State Farm relied upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representations  in  the  application,  including   the   ownership</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation, and issued a policy insuring both  ATVs.  In  fact,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alan  Hamilton was not the registered owner, the actual  owner,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the principal driver of the ATVs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  On  August 20, 1989, Scott Thompson was driving  one  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ATVs.  The  plaintiff,  Carla Truelove was  a  passenger.  She  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injured in an accident caused by Scott Thompson's negligence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  After  State  Farm  was informed of the  accident  and  Carla</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Truelove's claim, it rescinded the policy and returned the premium.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In  taking  these  steps, State Farm relied  upon  Alan  Hamilton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation as to the ownership of the ATV  involved  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  In  due  course, Carla Truelove and others  (Family  Law  Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs) sued Scott Thompson, Duane Thompson and Alan  Hamilton.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">They  also sued Royal which provided applicable uninsured  motorist</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage  in  the  circumstances.1 Royal  settled  the  plaintiffs'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims  and moved under Rule 22 to determine whether it,  or  State</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Farm,  was  required  to pay the plaintiffs'  claims.  The  motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge,  Rosenberg  J.,  noted  in  his  endorsement  that  it   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledged that there was no basis upon which to distinguish this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court's judgment in London &amp; Midland. Thus, he held that State Farm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not have to pay the plaintiff's claims.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE ACT
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  The  net effect of s. 233 of the Insurance Act is that  false</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representations by an applicant for insurance may render  a  policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  automobile  insurance void and cause  the  insured  to  forfeit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his/her right to indemnity under the policy. The provisions  of  s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">233 make it clear that the misrepresentation must be made knowingly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  that  it  must be contained in the signed written  application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before  the insurer can rely upon the misrepresentation in  defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  a  claim  made  under the contract (the  policy).  Section  233</font></pre>

          Seaman,  by  withholding  consent,  could  have
          prevented the driving of the car by Kowaluk. It

          under  a  statutory provision  giving  a  third

          there must be a valid policy in existence, and,

          entitled  to rely upon all defences  under  the
          terms  of the policy which are not specifically
          taken away. In my opinion, s. 183 gives a third
          party   a  right  to  sue  upon  the  insurance
          contract,  if any; and, as the policy  here  is

          resulted  in the applicant never being actually

     1    Royal issued an owner's policy to Clara Truelove's
father. Carla Truelove was an insured under that policy. Thus,
she had access to the uninsured motorist coverage in her father's
policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2    For convenience and consistency, for the most part I
will refer to the 1990 R.S.O. sections of the Insurance Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3    Because of the provisions of s. 258(9), the insurer's
liability is limited to the minimum limit of liability, now
$200,000.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     4    While the wording of s. 258 (R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8)
varies slightly from s. 226 (R.S.O. 1980, c. 218), the substance
is the same.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     5    The s. 183(3)(ii) referred to by Harrison J. was the
New Brunswick equivalent of s. 258(4)(b).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     6    In London &amp; Midland there was some evidence to suggest
that B.'s consent (that is the named insured's consent) to D.
driving the insured automobile was obtained by fraud. As I have
said, D. falsely told B. that he had transferred the ownership
and insurance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     7    State Farm provided uninsured motorist coverage to the
injured plaintiff. The question was whether the tortfeasor's
insurer or the injured claimant's insurer had to pay the
claimant's claim. The same issue arises in these cases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     8    This conclusion was central to the court's conclusion
in Bourgeois and Comer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     9    In Ontario s. 241 provides for coverage in a non-
owner's policy. Section 244 deals with unnamed insureds in
owner's and non-owner's policies. It provides that an unnamed
insured under an owner's or non-owner's policy &quot;may recover
indemnity in the same manner and to the same extent as if named
therein as the insured.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     10    The Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. C.25 provides that a motor vehicle cannot be driven on a
highway &quot;...unless the motor vehicle is insured under a contract
of automobile insurance.&quot; Automobile insurance is defined to mean
insurance against liability arising out of bodily injury or
death, or damage to property. There is no reference in that Act
to any particular form of policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     11    The same definition (with minor changes in wording)
appears in the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 218, s. 1, para.
40.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     12    Section 240 of the Insurance Act deals with the
insurer's liability when the driver is an &quot;excluded driver&quot;. This
is not an issue in these appeals.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     13    This is what happened in both cases before us and, in
State Farm v. General Accident, supra.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     14    This is what caused the ownership misrepresentation in
London &amp; Midland.</font></pre></td>
