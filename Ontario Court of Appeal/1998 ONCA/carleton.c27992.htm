</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]       The appellant is a condominium corporation created in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1988 as a result of the registration by the declarant, Financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trustco Properties Ltd., of the declaration and description under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Condominium Act. The condominium is a high rise building</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">containing 221 residential units. The building is situated on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">large tract of land, known as Brittany Park, that was owned by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FTP and on which FTP intended to erect a number of other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominiums. At the time of registration of the appellant, there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was one other condominium on the lands, Carleton Condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation No. 16.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       In May 1989, FTP sold the uncompleted project to Thomas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C. Assaly Corporation Ltd. and Assaly thereby became the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">successor declarant. The project, as envisaged by FTP and Assaly,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was that a number of condominiums would share a common stand-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alone recreation facility. It would appear that the developers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expected that by 1996, if not earlier, they would have completed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the various buildings and legal ownership in the recreation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities would be transferred to the condominium corporations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In the interim, the declarant was to manage the facilities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       Four other buildings were ultimately erected on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assaly lands after the appellant was registered. Three of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are also condominiums; the other is co-op housing. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents, Carleton Condominium Corporation No. 507 and No.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">510, are two of the condominiums that were subsequently erected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the tract of land. There is one undeveloped piece of land.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       The dispute in this case concerns the provisions in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s declaration relating to recreational amenities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Similar provisions are found in the declarations of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents. The recreational amenities consist of two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">components:  (1) the recreational facilities and lands, being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landscaped parkland, a pond and an outdoor pool and (2) the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreational centre and lands, which were built after the sale to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assaly and include an indoor swimming pool, sauna, meeting rooms,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">racquet facilities, and tennis courts. Assaly owns 80 percent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the recreational facilities and lands and 100 percent of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreational centre and lands. Carleton Condominium Corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">No. 16 owns the remaining 20 percent of the recreational</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities and lands.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       The appellant objects to the inclusion, in Article IV</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the declaration, of the provisions respecting the recreational</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amenities. The declaration uses the term “co-tenants” to refer to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the interest of the condominium corporations, including the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and the two respondents, in the recreational amenities</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and I will adopt the same terminology. The provisions of Article</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">IV to which the appellant objects may be summarized as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          (1)  The recreational facility and lands are
          declared to be owned 80 percent by the
          declarant and 20 percent by Carleton
          Condominium Corporation No. 16. The
          declarant’s 80 percent will ultimately be
          shared between the appellant, the declarant
          and the owners of the adjacent lands as
          tenants in common in accordance with their
          respective proportionate shares;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  The recreational centre and lands are
          owned solely by the declarant but it shall
          ultimately be shared between the appellant,
          the declarant and the owners of the adjacent
          lands as tenants in common in accordance with
          their respective proportionate shares;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)  The actual transfer of ownership shall
          take place upon the development of the
          adjacent lands or no later than December 30,
          1996 and the appellant shall accept a
          transfer of title from the declarant. Once
          ownership of the recreational amenities has
          been transferred, any further sale, transfer
          or other conveyance or encumbrance cannot be
          made without the prior written consent of the
          remaining co-tenants;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (4)  Until the date of transfer, the
          declarant has the unilateral right to
          operate, control, manage, establish hours of
          use of the recreational amenities and shall
          also prepare a recreational budget. The
          appellant is obliged to adopt and be bound by
          the budget as part of its own budget and to
          pay its proportionate share. The appellant is
          also obliged to enter into a cost-sharing
          agreement with the other co-tenants relating
          to sharing the costs of the operation,
          repair, and replacement of the shared
          recreational amenities;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (5)  After the date of transfer, a committee
          will govern the use and maintenance of the
          recreational amenities and the preparation of
          the budget. The committee will consist of
          representatives from each of the co-tenants.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]       As required by the Condominium Act, the declaration is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered on title. A “common access agreement” between the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declarant and the appellant is also registered on title. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement confirms the provisions of Article IV of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration. For example, it confirms the proposed date of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer of ownership and the sharing of expenses as set out in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article IV. There is no such agreement, however, between the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declarant and the two respondents. Accordingly, they argue that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they must rely entirely upon the provisions of their declarations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to assert their right to ownership and use of the recreational</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amenities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]       Almost immediately after the appellant was registered,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">problems arose with respect to the use of the recreational</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amenities. As I understand it, the root of the problems is that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assaly has not fulfilled its obligations in terms of managing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amenities and contributing to the expenses. In oral argument, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was suggested that Assaly might now be in receivership. In any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">event, the condominium owners have had difficulty making use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some of the facilities and a number of legal actions have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">initiated by and against the co-tenants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE ISSUE

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       The issue in the case is a narrow one. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submits that the provisions of Article IV of the declaration</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summarized above are inconsistent with the provisions of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Condominium Act. The appellant therefore seeks an order amending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the declaration to delete those provisions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] This appeal engages ss. 3 and 12 of the Condominium Act.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficial interest in the recreational amenities is an asset of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The appellant argues that the provisions of Article IV</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actually interfere with the control and management of the assets</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the corporation because those provisions require it to enter</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mercy of those third parties that may not carry out their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations. The appellant argues that the problems with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article IV's requirements are highlighted in a case such as this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the declarant is not available to enter into the cost</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with neither the objects of the corporation nor the purpose of</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] I do not agree. Undoubtedly, problems can arise where a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominium corporation is required to share facilities with a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s unit owners have over the use and management of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreational amenities. However, the Act gives the declarant the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">right to include in the declaration provisions respecting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">management of the assets of the corporation. There is nothing in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act that prohibits the sharing of facilities among different</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominiums or prohibits a declarant from giving the corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an ownership interest in the shared facility. Such an arrangement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may, in fact, be beneficial to the unit owners by giving them</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">access to, and an interest in, a facility that could not be</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of it. The impugned provisions attempt to set up a reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">structure for the management of the shared facility. Those</font></pre>
