</strong>                              </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The parties entered into a unanimous shareholders'
agreement which provided that the advances of money made by
the respondents &quot;shall... be for an indefinite period&quot;. This
appeal turns on the meaning of these words.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In our view, the motions judge was correct in rejecting
the appellants' contention that the loans were subject to a
condition that they were not to be repaid until the
commencement of operations under the parties' venture. Had
the parties intended to be bound by such a condition, it
would have been easy to include this term in the contract.
In the absence of such a provision, the court cannot rewrite
the agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The words &quot;for an indefinite period&quot; can only mean that
the loans were repayable either on demand or after the
passage of a reasonable time. Whether they are to be
interpreted as providing for repayment &quot;on demand&quot;, as found
by the motions judge, or &quot;at the expiry of a reasonable
time&quot;, we are of the view that the motions judge was correct
in the result. He declared that &quot;the loans are demand loans
and are enforceable as such.&quot; Based on the findings of fact
made by the motions judge, there can be no other conclusion
but that the passage of a reasonable time had expired at the
time the demand for payment was made in this case. Hence,
even if it can be argued that the loans were not payable on
demand made at any time, they were payable pursuant to the
demand which was made in the circumstances of this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The motions judge was also correct in declaring that
the general security agreement constituted a valid and
enforceable obligation of the corporation in favour of the
respondents as it was contemplated by the terms of the
shareholders' agreement that this form of security be
provided. However, the promissory notes were not provided
for in the shareholders= agreement and should be declared
null and void.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The judgment is amended to delete the reference to the
promissory notes in paragraph 3. The appeal is otherwise
dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
