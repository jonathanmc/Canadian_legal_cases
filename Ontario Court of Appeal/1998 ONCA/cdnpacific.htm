    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">BORINS J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by Canadian Pacific Limited (&quot;CP&quot;) from
a judgment of Blenus Wright J. dismissing CP's appeal from re-
assessments made by the Minister of Revenue (the &quot;Minister&quot;)
for the taxation years 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984. The re-
assessments related to deductions from income made by CP in
each year with respect to awards it was required to pay to
permanently disabled workers under the provisions of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 539.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The basic facts are not in dispute. CP was a Schedule 2
employer under the Act. As such, it was individually liable to
reimburse the Workmen's Compensation Board (the &quot;Board&quot;) for
benefits payable to its workers, or their dependants, as a
consequence of injuries, or death, sustained by workers
arising out of, and in the course of, their employment. Under
the Act, CP's workers, depending on the nature and extent of
their injuries, were entitled, in addition to health care
costs, to compensation by way of periodic payments, or by way
of a lump sum, for permanent partial disability or survivor
benefits. Upon the claim of an injured worker, the Board would
make an appropriate award. This appeal is concerned with
permanently disabled workers who were the recipients of
permanent disability awards by the Board during the relevant
taxation years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In the typical situation, the Board made a permanent
disability award and forwarded it to the worker and CP. The
award contained its effective date, the amount of the monthly
payment and the degree of the worker's permanent disability,
and informed the worker that the monthly payment would
continue for the duration of his or her disability. However,
under the Act the Board was given the power to review periodic
payments to a worker and to increase, decrease, suspend or
cancel them. For example, the amount of a periodic payment
could be varied upon the re-evaluation of the degree of a
worker's disability. As well, the amount could be varied if
the Act were to be amended to increase the stipulated minimum
amount of compensation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  To satisfy its liability to the Board, on the advice of
its accountants CP established and maintained an account
identified as &quot;Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's Compensation&quot;
(the &quot;account&quot;). Upon receipt of a notice of an award, CP
calculated the amount of the award on the basis of the life
expectancy of the worker (obtained from actuarial tables),
added that amount to the account, charged the amount as an
expense against income for the year in which it was paid into
the account and credited its liability account for the like
amount. The account was reduced as payments were made to
reimburse the Board for payments it made to disabled workers,
and was increased as CP received notice of awards from the
Board. In addition, from time to time, the Board advised CP of
a cost of living increase in respect to outstanding awards.
When this occurred, using the same method of calculation, CP
added the appropriate amount to the account. Further, if an
injured worker died before his or her life expectancy, so that
no further periodic payments were required, the balance
allocated to that worker in the account was deducted from it
and also deducted from CP's operating expenses for that year.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  For example, suppose the Board awarded a permanently
disabled worker, whose life expectancy was 25 years, permanent
disability of $500 per month effective January 1, 1981. CP
would calculate that it would be liable to the Board for
$150,000 over the life expectancy of the worker, add this
amount to the account and charge it as an expense against
income for 1981. When invoiced by the Board on a monthly basis
for the payments it made to the worker, CP would reimburse the
Board. In this example, CP would have reimbursed the Board for
$6,000 in 1981.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  CP charged the following amounts as expenses, and, thus,
as deductions from income, in the years in which they were
paid to the account:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             1981-    $4,350,422
             1982-    $5,628,310
             1983-    $2,553,083
             1984-    $2,271,833
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In respect to each year, the amount was the total sum of all
awards made by the Board for each disabled worker which CP
calculated each worker would receive during his or her
estimated life expectancy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Before Wright J., the uncontradicted testimony of CP's
accounting expert, Mr. Hawkins, was that the liabilities
recognized by CP in its financial statements for the relevant
taxation years in respect of awards made by the Board in each
of these years to permanently disabled employees, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(&quot;GAAP&quot;), constituted current liabilities, and not contingent
liabilities. He also testified that the amounts reflected as
liabilities did not constitute reserves for accounting
purposes. It was Mr. Hawkins' opinion, based on the accrual
basis of accounting which prevails in Canada, that, because
the Board's awards did not generate any revenues for CP in the
future, the charges reflected by the awards as added to the
account had to be deducted from income in the year in which
they were added. Mr. Hawkins opined that for CP to deduct the
amount of the periodic payments made to a worker in the year
in which they were actually paid, would be to apply the
unacceptable cash basis of accounting. Lastly, it was Mr.
Hawkins' opinion that CP's method of determining the amount of
its liability to the Board, based its calculation of the
injured worker's life expectancy, was reasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In summary, the apellant's uncontradicted expert evidence
was that its methodology of computing its income for tax
purposes was consistent with well-accepted accounting
principles. From an accounting perspective, the awards were
current liabilities in the years in which they were
communicated to CP by the Board. Since these awards, which
represented liabilities of CP to the Board, could not be
linked to any future revenues, GAAP required them to be fully
deducted in, or charged to, the year in which they first
arose, and that it would not be in accordance with GAAP to
spread the deduction of such amounts over the lifetime of the
injured worker. Indeed, it is common ground in this appeal
that CP's practice conformed with GAAP.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The Minister reassessed, or varied, the returns submitted
by CP pursuant to the Corporations Tax Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.
97, on the basis that, for any given award, the only amounts
that could be deducted in a taxation year were actual payments
made to a worker during the year. It would appear that the
Minister considered that the deductions were additions to
reserves in each of the taxation years and acted on the
assumption that the amounts added to the account were in the
nature of a reserve, or a contingent, account. Wright J. held
that the Minister's assessments were correctly made.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] As the assessments were made in respect to the taxation
years 1981-1984, the legislation which determined the
appellant's tax liability was s. 12(1) of the Corporations Tax
Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 97, which incorporated for provincial tax
purposes the provisions of s. 18(1)(e) of the federal Income
Tax Act, S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63. This legislation,
respectively, stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           12. (1) Except as hereinafter provided,
          the income or loss of a corporation for a
          taxation year from a business or property
          shall for the purposes of this Act be
          determined in accordance with the
          subdivisions a and b of Division B of Part
          I of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the
          said subdivisions a and b are applicable
          to this Act in so far as the said
          subdivisions apply to corporations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                             ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           18. (1) In computing the income of a

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (e)an amount transferred or credited to a
             reserve, contingent account or sinking
             fund except as expressly permitted by
             this Part.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE ISSUE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The issue before Wright J., which remains the issue
before this court, was whether CP was entitled to deduct as an
expense from its annual income monies which it transferred to
its Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's Compensation account for
the purpose of reimbursing the Board for the total payments to
be made to CP's injured workers, pursuant to permanent
disability awards made to the workers, calculated on the
estimated life expectancy of each worker. To resolve this
issue, it was necessary for the appeal judge to determine
whether these capitalized amounts &quot;were transferred or
credited to a ... contingent account&quot; within the meaning of s.
18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and, therefore, not deductible
from income. If the amounts transferred to the account came
within s. 18(1)(e), CP was limited to deducting as an expense
from income, in each of the four taxation years, the amount
which it in fact paid each year to reimburse the Board for the
compensation which it paid to CP's disabled workers.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">REASONS OF THE APPEAL JUDGE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Before Wright J., and this court, the Minister took the
position that, although CP's addition of the capitalized
amounts of the payments to its Deferred Liabilities C
Workmen's Compensation account was appropriate for the
computation of its annual profit for accounting purposes, it
was not appropriate for taxation purposes. The Minister
submitted that the payments were non-deductible for tax
purposes because the payments were subject to uncertainties
which rendered the account a contingent account within the
meaning of s. 18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] It was, and remains, the appellant's position that the
account was not a contingent account within the meaning of s.
18(1)(e). It submitted that GAAP should normally be applied
for taxation purposes because it presents a truer picture of
the profit and loss of a corporation for any given taxation
year and, in the circumstances of this appeal, more accurately
portrayed CP's income and best matched revenues and expenses.
In this regard, CP submitted that its accrual accounting
practices, which required expenses to be matched against
income in the same period, were appropriate for determining
the expenses that it incurred for taxation purposes in any
given year. CP submitted further that s. 18(1)(e) is to be
interpreted by reference to GAAP proper to the business which
it conducted. It relied on the decision of the Supreme Court
of Canada in Time Motors Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1969] S.C.R. 501 for
the proposition that the language of s. 18(1)(e) refers to
accounting practice and, therefore, is to be interpreted by
reference to GAAP in a business of the kind it conducted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Wright J. characterized the issue before him as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             This is the question to be decided: Is
          the CP calculated amount of an award which
          is placed in the Deferred Liabilities C
          Workmen's Compensation account an amount
          transferred or credited to a reserve or
          contingent account as stated in Section
          18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] After reviewing the stated facts, the appeal judge
concluded that the appeal must fail for two reasons. The first
reason, which was neither advanced before him nor this court
by the Minister, was that the amounts added to the account
were not deductible under s. 18(1)(a) of the Act, which
precluded the deduction of expenses that were not incurred by
a taxpayer for the purpose of producing income from its
business. The second reason was that they were not deductible
under s. 18(1)(e) on the basis of the following analysis:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Secondly, it is my view that the
          amounts added to the Deferred Liabilities
          C Workmen's Compensation account are
          amounts credited to a reserve or
          contingent account within the meaning of
          Section 18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and
          therefore cannot be deducted in computing
          CP's business income. WCB payments to
          injured workers which are reimbursed by CP
          in a taxation year are proper operating
          expenses but not the total estimated
          amounts as calculated by CP which in fact
          may never be paid.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Wright J. reviewed the discussion of s. 12(1)(e) of the
Income Tax Act, which later became s. 18(1)(e), in Day and
Ross Ltd. v. The Queen (1977), 76 D.T.C. 6433 (Fed. Ct. T.D.),
and distinguished that case on the facts. He went on to
conclude:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             In CP's case, the only thing that is
          certain is WCB awards for specific amounts
          of monthly payments for each injured
          worker who is given a permanent disability
          award. It is uncertain as to what the
          succeeding month's payment might be
          because the amount could change by reason
          of a cost of living increase, by an
          increase or decrease in the percentage of
          disability of the worker, or the worker
          may die without survivors on which no
          further payments would be made.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             In my view, the Deferred Liabilities C
          Workmen's Compensation account is a
          contingent account because the liability
          to pay the amounts credited to the account
          is contingent. As stated, in Samuel F.
          Investments Limited v. The Minister of
          National Revenue, [88 DTC 1106] at 1108:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                  &quot;... a liability to make a
                  payment is contingent if the
                  terms of its creation include
                  uncertainty in respect of any of
                  these three things: (1) whether
                  the payment will be made; (2) the
                  amount payable; or (3) the time
                  by which payment shall be made.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             When CP calculates an estimated award
          amount over the life expectancy of an
          injured worker and credits that amount to
          the deferred liabilities account, it is
          uncertain whether that amount will
          actually be paid, whether that amount is
          the correct amount which will be paid or
          over what period of time payments will
          actually be made. (Emphasis added.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Wright J. did not consider Time Motors, supra, on which
the appellant placed significant reliance. As well, it does
not appear that he took into consideration the evidence of Mr.
Hawkins, who presented expert testimony on behalf of the
appellant.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DISCUSSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In my view, Wright J. erred in the interpretation of
&quot;contingent account&quot; in s. 18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and
his finding that CP's Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's
Compensation account was &quot;a contingent account because the
liability to pay the amounts credited to it [was] contingent.&quot;
In doing so, he applied the test stated by Christie A.C.J.T.C.
in Samuel F. Investments Limited v. The Minister of National
Revenue (1988), 88 D.T.C. 1106 at 1108 (T.C.C.) relating to
when the liability to make a payment is a contingent
liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Three distinct accounts are specified in s. 18(1)(e) and
&quot;contingent account&quot; is the description of one of them:
Dominion Telegraph Securities Limited v. The Minister of
National Revenue, [1947] S.C.R. 45 per Kerwin and Rand JJ. at
49. The other accounts are a reserve account and a sinking
fund.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The starting point, in my view, is to determine the
purpose of CP's Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's Compensation
account. As the evidence disclosed, the purpose of the account
was to establish a fund to be used by CP to enable it to
fulfill its obligation under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
in particular ss. 3 and 5, to compensate its disabled workers.
On the day CP transferred a given amount to the account in
respect of a disabled worker to fulfill this obligation, CP
was aware of its statutory obligation, the monthly payment
awarded by the Board to the disabled worker and that the
worker was entitled to receive the monthly payment for the
duration of his or her disability. Because the worker was
permanently disabled, CP capitalized the amount of the award
based on the worker's life expectancy. As I will explain, on
the basis of the evidence and the definitions and authorities
to which I will refer, the Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's
Compensation account was not a contingent account within the
meaning of s. 18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Section 18(1)(e) lists three different types of account
which a taxpayer may create, and prohibits the taxpayer from
subtracting the amount paid into each account from its gross
income in arriving at its taxable income for the taxation year
in which the amount was paid. Generally speaking, determining
which expenses a taxpayer can deduct is a matter of matching
them to the deduction-granting provisions of the governing tax
legislation. This issue does not arise in this appeal as it is
implicit in the position of the Minister that, but for the
application of s. 18(1)(e), the annual sums which CP
transferred to its account to meet its statutory liability
were deductible from its annual income as a business expense.
This follows from the accepted purpose of an income tax, which
is to impose a tax only on annual accretions in wealth. Thus,
as I have stated, the narrow issue is whether the amounts
transferred annually by CP to its account were non-deductible
from income because the account was a &quot;contingent account&quot;
within the meaning of s. 18(1)(e).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The common feature of each of the three accounts is that
the purpose of the account is to make provision for some event
that may occur in the future. This is apparent from the words
used to describe each account.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In Black's Law Dictionary (abridged 6th ed., West
Publishing Co., 1991), at p. 906 &quot;reserve&quot; is defined as
follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Funds set aside to cover future expenses,
          losses, claims, or liabilities.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">And at p. 222 &quot;contingency reserve (or fund)&quot; is defined as
follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In accounting, a reserve set up to cover
          possible or potential losses; e.g.
          possible judgment against company.
             A fund created in anticipation of
          incidental or unforeseen expenditures.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">At p. 965 &quot;sinking fund&quot; is given several meanings:
          Sinking fund. Assets and their earnings
          earmarked for the retirement of bonds or
          other long-term obligations. An obligation
          sometimes imposed pursuant to the issuance
          of debt securities or preferred shares by
          which the issuer is required each year to
          set aside a certain amount to enable the
          issuer to retire the securities when they
          mature. A sinking fund may be allowed to
          accumulate or may be used each year to
          redeem a portion of the outstanding
          securities.
             A fund (usually invested), which will
          be used to replace improvements as needed.
          Most commonly set aside from the income of
          income producing property.
             A fund arising from particular taxes,
          imposts or duties, which is appropriated
          toward the payment of the interest due on
          a public loan, and for the payment of the
          principal.
             In general accounting, segregated
          assets that are being accumulated for a
          specific purpose. In governmental
          accounting, a fund established to
          accumulate resources for the retirement of
          bonds but not for the payment of interest,
          which is handled through the general fund
          or a special revenue fund.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Although &quot;contingent account&quot; is not defined in Black's
Law Dictionary, the terms &quot;contingent,&quot; &quot;contingent debt&quot; and
&quot;contingent liability&quot; are defined, as well as &quot;contingency
reserve (or fund).&quot; At p. 222 &quot;contingent&quot; is defined as

          with provisional. This term, when applied
          to a use, remainder, devise, bequest, or
          other legal right or interest, implies
          that no present interest exists, and that
          whether such interest or right ever will
          exist depends upon a future uncertain
          event.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">At p. 223 &quot;contingent debt&quot; is defined, in part, as follows:

          but which will become so in case of the

          event. A potential liability; e.g. pending

          appealed, possible tax deficiency.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] On the basis of this analysis of the three different
types of accounts referred to in s. 18(1)(e) and the meaning
of &quot;contingent&quot; and related terms, it is my opinion that a
contingent account is an account set up by a taxpayer to be
used to pay debts, or other obligations, neither fixed nor
absolute when the fund is set up but which may become so with
the occurrence of some future and uncertain event. This
description conforms with the few cases which have considered
the meaning of &quot;contingent account&quot; in s. 18(1)(e). As pointed
out in P.W. Hogg and J.E. Magee, Principles of Canadian Income
Tax Law, (2nd ed., 1997, Carswell) at 239:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             A liability of any kind is deductible
          only if the liability is a legal
          obligation at the end of the taxation
          year. The Income Tax Act generally
          prohibits the deduction of liabilities
          that are merely contingent, or of
          &quot;reserves&quot; to provide for expected future
          liabilities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In Harlequin Enterprises Limited v. The Queen, [1977] 2
F.C. 579 (C.A.), the taxpayer was a book publisher which had
an agreement with its distributors to provide them with a full
credit for any books which were returned to it unsold. For the
purpose of making provision for giving credits for the unsold
books, the taxpayer deducted $335,000 in computing its income
for the 1969 taxation year. The Minister disallowed the
deduction on the basis that it constituted a contingent
account within the meaning of s. 18(1)(e). The taxpayer
contended, inter alia, that the deduction was a current
liability. The taxpayer's appeal before Mahoney J. of the
Federal Court Trial Division failed, as did its appeal to the
Federal Court of Appeal. In dismissing the appeal, Urie J.
quoted from the reasons of Mahoney J., and then went on to say
at pp. 583-84:
                                             
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             An account set up to provide for those
             contingent liabilities whether by way
             of a provision for returns and
             allowances on its balance sheet or a
             deduction from earnings in the
             calculation of its taxable income was
             a contingent account within the
             meaning of section 12(1)(e).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             I agree with this conclusion and the
          reasoning of the learned Trial Judge in
          reaching it. No useful purpose would be
          served, in my view, in reviewing and
          restating that reasoning particularly
          since the appellant did not quarrel with
          the findings of fact of the Trial Judge
          but only with the application of the law
          to those findings. Specifically, I agree
          with him that, on the evidence of the
          expert witness called by the appellant,
          the appellant's practice of making
          provision for book returns was in
          conformity with generally accepted
          accounting principles. However, the fact
          of its acceptability in accounting
          practice does not of itself make it a
          proper deduction from income for tax
          purposes. Whether or not it is must be
          found in some provision of the Act. I
          agree that the provision for returns is
          contingent, because in any fiscal period,
          although it was known from experience that
          there would be returns, the number and
          actual value thereof could not be fully
          known until all returns on sales made
          within that fiscal period had actually
          been received which might not be until
          some considerable period of time had
          elapsed after the end of the fiscal
          period. Therefore, the provision falls
          within the prohibition contained in
          section 12(1)(e).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Mahoney J. interpreted &quot;contingent account&quot; in his
reasons for judgment, reported in [1974] 2 F.C. 877 at 892:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The adjective &quot;contingent&quot; means &quot;liable
          to happen or not; of uncertain occurrence
          or incidence&quot; (The Oxford English
          Dictionary). The term &quot;contingent account&quot;
          [in the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
          148, s. 18(1)(e)] taken literally would
          appear to be nonsense. An account, once
          set up is itself not contingent; it has,
          so to speak, happened and is not
          uncertain. It exists. The term must be
          taken to mean &quot;account for a contingency&quot;.
          In other words, it is not the account that
          must be found to be contingent but rather
          the thing in respect of which it was set
          up: in this case the liability to pay or
          give credit for the refunds and rebates.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Mahoney J. examined the purpose of the account and
concluded that it was a contingent account in the following
passage at p. 894:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Certain as it was that the plaintiff
          would, in due course, be obliged to give
          rebates on royalties or on returns of
          books, the fact is the plaintiff's
          liability to do so, under the terms of the
          agreements which were, in practice,
          observed, did not arise until the
          plaintiff was presented with a demand for
          the credit. The plaintiff's obligation to
          the distributors in respect of credits for
          returns was a contingent liability. So was
          its obligation to rebate royalties to
          Simon &amp; Shuster. An account set up to
          provide for those contingent liabilities
          whether by way of a provision for returns
          and allowances on its balance sheet or a
          deduction from earnings in the calculation
          of its taxable income was a contingent
          account within the meaning of section
          12(1)(e). No deduction in respect of that
          account, even to the extent that generally
          accepted accounting principles required it
          to be made, is permitted in the
          calculation of the plaintiff's taxable
          income.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Mahoney J. then distinguished the case before him from
Time Motors where, he stated, the uncertainty did not pertain
to the coming into existence of the liability, which came into
existence when the credit note was issued, but rather
pertained to whether the creditors would do what was necessary
to enforce the existing liability. Similarly, Urie J., on
behalf of the Federal Court of Appeal, stated at p. 587:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             I agree, too, with the learned Trial
          Judge that the decisions of the Supreme
          Court in M.N.R. v. Atlantic Engine
          Rebuilders Limited and Time Motors Limited
          v. M.N.R. are also distinguishable on
          their facts. In each of those cases there
          were existing, ascertained current
          liabilities in contra-distinction to the
          case at bar where no such ascertained
          liability existed unless and until the
          retailers exercised their right to return
          unsold books. (Emphasis in original.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] This brings me to a consideration of Time Motors. In this
case, Pigeon J., on behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada,
also focused on the purpose of the account set up by the
taxpayer which the Minister of National Revenue contended did
not consist of existing liabilities and should be disallowed
for tax purposes as being contingent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The taxpayer, a used car dealer, gave credit notes in
partial payment for cars acquired for resale. A credit note
could be applied by the holder within a stipulated time
against the purchase price of another car of stated minimum
value. In the taxpayer's accounts, credit notes outstanding
were treated as current liabilities. If they were not redeemed
before their expiration, the amount of the note was removed
from accounts payable and treated as a profit. The Tax Appeal
Board allowed the taxpayer's appeal, but was reversed by the
Exchequer Court. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed a further
appeal by the taxpayer and restored the judgment of the Board.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] At p. 504, Pigeon J. recognized the need to consider the
reason the taxpayer treated the credit notes as current
liabilities:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... The credit note should not be
          considered apart from the transaction out
          of which it arises. It is part of the
          consideration for an executed contract,
          the purchase of a used car. Under that
          contract, appellant became obliged to pay
          a stated sum of money, a part only of that
          sum was paid in cash, the balance
          remaining due was stipulated payable in
          merchandise of a stated kind. While the
          contract is spelled out in two separate
          documents, the bill of sale and the credit
          note, the latter cannot be considered
          otherwise than as evidence of the
          conditions of the obligation to pay the
          balance of the purchase price. That
          obligation must be considered as
          subsisting until satisfied or expired. No
          special reason was advanced, no authority
          was cited to support the contention that
          the credit note should be considered
          otherwise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] At pp. 505-06, Pigeon J. discussed the Minister's
contention that the credit notes constituted a contingent
account:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Respondent's second contention is that
          because appellant's obligation was
          conditional it should not, until the
          condition was realized, be treated for
          purposes of income tax as a current
          liability but as an amount properly to be
          entered in a contingent account. As a
          result, the deduction would be prohibited
          by s. 12(1)(e) [which became s. 18(1)(e)]
          of the Income Tax Act:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             12 (1)   In computing income, no
                  deduction shall be made in

                             ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             (e)  an amount transferred or credited

                  expressly permitted by this Part,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The wording of that provision clearly
          refers to accounting practice. The only
          expression applicable to the present case
          is not &quot;contingent liability&quot; but
          &quot;contingent account&quot;. This means that the
          provision is to be construed by reference
          to proper accounting practice in a
          business of the kind with which one is
          concerned. In the present case, the only
          evidence of accounting practice is that of
          appellant's auditor, a chartered
          accountant. His testimony shows that in
          appellant's accounts credit notes are
          treated according to standard practice as
          current liabilities until they are
          redeemed or expired. They are not classed
          as contingent liabilities. When asked why
          he considered the obligation under a
          credit note as current liability and the
          obligation under a warranty as contingent,
          he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the credit note, while it is a
          liability, is also an existing obligation
          today. A warranty may be a liability in
          the future. It may be determinable in the
          future but isn't an existing obligation
          until the future. At least, this is my
          interpretation of the difference.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             With respect, Gibson J. was in error
          in holding that whether or not appellant's
          financial statements were drawn up
          according to generally accepted accounting
          principles could be disregarded. On the
          contrary, the wording of the relevant
          provision of the Income Tax Act implies
          that this is the essential question.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Following the reasoning of Pigeon J. in Time Motors, the
annual amounts which CP added to its account should not be
considered apart from its statutory liability under the
Workmen's Compensation Act. Under that Act, CP was obligated
to reimburse the Workmen's Compensation Board for awards made
by the Board to its disabled workers. At the time CP added the
capitalized amount to the account, in respect to a disabled
worker, it did so pursuant to a statutory obligation. Thus, as
in Time Motors, each time an amount was added to the account,
it was on the basis of an existing liability, or obligation.
That liability was not contingent, in the sense that, at the
relevant time, it was a liability that was not fixed and
absolute, but one which may become so in the future with the
occurrence of some uncertain event. Rather, at the time of
transfer to the account, there was an existing, ascertained
liability; and not a liability which would arise only upon the
happening of a future event. At the time a payment was made to
the account, the following facts were ascertained: CP's
statutory liability to pay the award made to its disabled
worker; the monthly amount of the award; the effective date of
the award; and that monthly payments would be paid to the
worker for the duration of his or her disability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Wright J. found that the only fact that was certain was
the amount of monthly payments for each injured worker who had
received a permanent disability award. However, after taking
into consideration the Board's powers under the Workmen's
Compensation Act to vary the amount in the circumstances
provided by the Act, and the circumstances which render the
liability to make a payment contingent, stated by Christie
A.C.J.T.C. in Samuel F. Investments, he found that CP's
account was &quot;a contingent account because the liability to pay
the amount credited to the account [was] contingent.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In my view, Wright J. erred in reaching this conclusion
for a number of reasons. As I have indicated, the
determination whether an account is a contingent account
within the meaning of s. 18(1)(e) is to be made at the time
payment is added to the account based on the purpose for which
the taxpayer established the account. Although it was true
that the amount to which a disabled worker might ultimately be
entitled was subject to variation in accordance with the
Workmen's Compensation Act, this did not affect CP's statutory
liability to make good the award. It affected only the amount
of the award which, as I have said, was fixed when CP added
the capitalized amount to the account. Thus, at that moment,
CP's statutory obligation was to be considered as subsisting
until satisfied, or an event occurred which resulted in its
termination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] In my view, Wright J.'s concerns were of an accounting
nature. He confused CP's statutory liability to pay an award
with events that might occur that could affect the amount of
the liability. However, the liability remained throughout the
lifetime of the disabled worker, subject only to the possible
variation of its amount, or the unlikely event of the worker's
condition improving. As the evidence disclosed, when there was
a variation affecting the quantum of a worker's disability
payments, CP made the necessary accounting adjustment. For
example, on the death of a worker before he or she achieved
life expectancy, the excess in the account was removed and
allocated to income. Similarly, in Time Motors, if a credit
note was not redeemed before its expiration, the amount of the
note was removed from accounts payable and treated as a
profit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] In my view, the appeal judge also erred in the way he
applied the definition of contingent liability in Samuel F.
Investments stated by Christie A.C.J.T.C. at p. 1108 where he
said that &quot;a liability to make a payment is contingent if the
terms of its creation include uncertainty&quot; in respect of any
of the three factors he discussed. As I have pointed out,
there was nothing in the terms of the creation of CP's
statutory liability to pay awards to its disabled workers that
contained any uncertainty. As well, Wright J. ignored the
interpretation placed on s. 18(1)(e) by Pigeon J. in Time
Motors where he stated at p. 506: &quot;The wording of that
provision clearly refers to accounting practice. The only
expression applicable ... is not 'contingent liability' but
'contingent account.'&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] As I stated earlier, the only evidence of the accounting
practice followed by CP was given by Mr. Hawkins, who provided
expert testimony on its behalf. He was not cross-examined by
counsel for the Minister, nor did the Minister provide any
testimony to refute Mr. Hawkins' opinion. Wright J. made no
reference to Mr. Hawkins' testimony in his reasons for
judgment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] It is helpful to summarize Mr. Hawkins' testimony. He
stated that because CP was obligated to make future payments
with respect to a disabled worker, but would not have the
services of the worker, the capitalized amount added to the
account was a liability in the year it was added.
Consequently, he testified, CP &quot;should book a liability and
take the charge as soon as it's known.&quot; Another reason for
taking the charge as soon as the liability is known was based
on principles of accounting which match revenues and expenses.
Because the worker was disabled, the amount added to the
account, based on the expected future life of the worker, was
not going to generate any future income. Although Mr. Hawkins
agreed that the amount added in respect to a disabled worker
was an estimate, he said that estimates are common in many
areas of financial statements, particularly when it is
necessary to book a liability. He opined that it was
reasonable for CP to estimate the amount of its liability on
the basis of the expected future life of the disabled worker
as determined by actuarial tables. He gave as a further reason
for booking the payment when it was transferred to the account
&quot;the high degree of probability&quot; that it would be paid.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] In Mr. Hawkins' opinion, were CP to charge the payments
only in the year in which they were actually paid to a
disabled worker as contended by the Minister, would be to
apply the cash method of accounting. He testified that to
employ this method would be inappropriate as the Canada
Business Corporations Act requires companies to keep their
books of account in accordance with GAAP, which require that
it follow the accrual method of accounting. Moreover, as I
have stated, the decision in Time Motors holds that s.
18(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act is to be construed by reference
to proper accounting practice in the business being conducted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] From Mr. Hawkins' testimony, it is clear, according to
proper accounting practice, that the fact that an estimate is
involved will not, in itself, lead to a finding that an
account is contingent within the meaning of s. 18(1)(e). In
this respect, it is relevant to note that s. 3290.04 of the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook states
the following, under the heading &quot;Contingencies&quot;:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the preparation of the financial
          statements of an enterprise, estimates are
          required for many on-going and recurring
          activities. However, the mere fact that an
          estimate is involved does not of itself
          constitute the type of uncertainty which
          characterizes a contingency. For example,
          amounts owed for goods or services
          received but not billed are not
          contingencies, even though the amounts may
          be estimated. There is nothing uncertain
          about the fact that these obligations have
          been incurred; any uncertainty is related
          solely to the amounts thereof.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] To conclude this part of my reasons, where a taxpayer has
incurred a liability in a taxation year, and has placed money
into an account to enable it to fulfill the liability,
uncertainties surrounding the amount which will ultimately be
paid will not per se result in the liabilities being classed
as contingent, nor the account being classed as a contingent
account. In this appeal, I would hold that CP's Deferred
Liabilities C Workmen's Compensation account was not a
contingent account within the meaning of s. 18(1)(e),
notwithstanding the lack of complete certainty as to the
amount which CP would ultimately have to pay to disabled
workers. In my view, although the amount of the award may vary
due to the premature death of a worker, a cost of living
increase, or an improvement in the condition of a disabled
worker, there was reasonably sufficient certainty in respect
to the amount of the award at the time of its inclusion in the
account. Any change in the amount arising as a result of these
factors, generally speaking, should be relatively
inconsequential, and is easily and adequately accounted for by
prompt and proper accounting entries at the relevant time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Subsequent to the argument of this appeal, the Supreme
Court of Canada released a trilogy of decisions which
considered, inter alia, the extent to which interpretive aids,
such as GAAP, may assist in determining a taxpayer's income:
Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (1998), 155 D.L.R. (4th) 257; Toronto
College Park Ltd. v. Canada (1998), 155 D.L.R. (4th) 285; Ikea
Ltd. v. Canada (1998), 155 D.L.R. (4th) 295. Since the court
thought these decisions might have application to the
resolution of this appeal, the parties were asked to provide
written submissions in this regard. The submissions were not
completed until April 1998 which, in part, accounts for the
delay in the preparation of these reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] It is my view that these decisions, particularly the
Canderel case, lend support to the conclusion which I have
reached. In Canderel, Iacobucci J., on behalf of the Supreme
Court of Canada, provided a detailed and helpful analysis of
the principles which apply, and the factors which a court is
permitted to consider in ascertaining the most accurate
picture of a taxpayer's profit for income tax purposes. This
analysis was conducted in the context of whether a taxpayer
could deduct as a business expense, in the taxation year in
which it was paid, the entire amount of tenant inducement
payments to various prospective tenants to induce them to
enter into leases of premises in a new office building, or
whether, as the Minister of National Revenue contended, the
matching principle required the taxpayer to deduct the
inducement payments over the terms of the leases to which the
payments related.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] Before conducting the analysis, Iacobucci J. discussed
the concept of &quot;profit&quot; in s. 9(1) of the Income Tax Act at p.
269:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             It is appropriate to begin the
          consideration of profit with s. 9(1) of
          the Act, which defines a taxpayer's income
          for a taxation year from a business or
          property source as &quot;his profit therefrom
          for the year&quot;. Significantly, &quot;profit&quot; is
          not defined in s. 9(1) or anywhere else in
          the Act. It seems to me that this approach
          was a deliberate legislative choice,
          particularly given that the Act contains
          exhaustive definitions of numerous other
          concepts and terms with which it deals.
          This choice reflects the reality that no
          single definition can adequately apply to
          the millions of different taxpayers bound
          by the Act. Under our self-assessment
          system, each taxpayer must be able to
          compute his or her income in such a way as
          to constitute an accurate picture of his
          or her income situation, subject, of
          course, to express provisions in the Act
          which require specific treatment of
          certain types of expenses or receipts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Subsequently, he stated the interpretive goal at p. 275:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [T]he goal of the legal test of &quot;profit&quot;
          should be to determine which method of
          accounting best depicts the reality of the
          financial situation of the particular
          taxpayer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] After a detailed analysis of the principles to be used in
determining profit for income tax purposes, Iacobucci J.
summarized them at pp. 278-89:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1)The determination of profit is a
             question of law.
          (2)The profit of a business for a
             taxation year is to be determined by
             setting against the revenues from the
             business for that year the expenses
             incurred in earning said income.
          (3)In seeking to ascertain profit, the
             goal is to obtain an accurate picture
             of the taxpayer's profit for the given
             year.
          (4)In ascertaining profit, the taxpayer
             is free to adopt any method which is
             not inconsistent with
             (a)  the provisions of the Income Tax
                  Act;
             (b)  established case law principles
                  or &quot;rules of law&quot;; and
             (c)  well-accepted business
                  principles.
          (5)Well-accepted business principles,
             which include but are not limited to
             the formal codification found in
             G.A.A.P., are not rules of law but
             interpretive aids. To the extent that
             they may influence the calculation of
             income, they will do so only on a case-
             by-case basis, depending on the facts
             of the taxpayer's financial situation.
          (6)On reassessment, once the taxpayer has
             shown that he has provided an accurate
             picture of income for the year, which
             is consistent with the Act, the case
             law, and well-accepted business
             principles, the onus shifts to the
             Minister to show either that the
             figure provided does not represent an
             accurate picture, or that another
             method of computation would provide a
             more accurate picture. (Emphasis in
             original.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] In elaborating on the sixth principle, Iacobucci J. had
earlier stated at p. 278:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... In so doing, however, I emphasize that
          the Minister is not entitled to rely on
          particular well-accepted business
          principles as being inherently preferable
          over others. If the method chosen by the
          taxpayer is otherwise acceptable by law
          and in accordance with such well-accepted
          principles, then it is no answer for the
          Minister to say that other principles
          should have been employed unless to do so
          would have yielded a more accurate picture
          of income. (Emphasis in original.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] All three of the cases affirm that, whether the subject
matter is an expense or an item of income, any dispute
regarding the timing of its deduction, in the case of an
expense, or its inclusion, in the case of an item of income,
is to be resolved by a single overriding objective, namely,
the treatment of the expense or item of income which gives the
more accurate picture of the taxpayer's income.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] In my view, the quest for the more accurate picture of
the appellant's income leads to the conclusion that the
deduction of the totality of the payments made to its account
in the year in which the award of the Workmen's Compensation
Board was made provides that picture. To the appellant, who
stood to receive no corresponding benefit from the payment in
years subsequent to that in which the award was made, the
liability imposed by the Workmen's Compensation Act
represented a very real liability in its current financial
statements. Moreover, deducting the expense at that point was
consistent with the well-established principle that expenses
should be recognized in the same period as the revenue to
which they relate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] In ascertaining its profit, the method adopted by CP was
not inconsistent with the provisions of the Income Tax Act
because, as I have found, its Deferred Liabilities C Workmen's
Compensation account was not a &quot;contingent account&quot; within the
meaning of s. 18(1)(e) of the Act. Nor was it inconsistent
with established case law. In Time Motors, Pigeon J., by
distinguishing a &quot;contingent liability&quot; from a &quot;contingent
account,&quot; was clearly of the view that, for the purposes of s.
18(1)(e), if an amount was not contingent from an accounting
perspective, its deduction was not precluded by s. 18(1)(e).
Thus, for the taxation years 1981 through 1984, s. 18(1)(e)
specifically precluded the deduction only of amounts that
constituted contingent amounts for accounting purposes. In
addition, as Mr. Hawkins testified, the method adopted by the
appellant was not inconsistent with well-accepted business
principles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] Lastly, as stated by Iacobucci J. in the Canderel case,
where the taxpayer has determined its profit for a particular
year in accordance with the principles of profit determination
described in that case, the onus shifts to the Minister to
prove that, either the taxpayer's methodology of computing
profit did not produce an accurate picture of the taxpayer's
profit, or the Minister has an alternative method of computing
the taxpayer's profit which produces a more accurate picture
of profit than that adopted by the taxpayer. In this appeal,
the Minister did not lead any evidence to prove that the
method of computing profit adopted by the appellant did not
produce an accurate picture of profit, nor did the Minister
lead any evidence to establish that there is an alternative
method of computing profit that would have produced a more
accurate picture of profit than that used by the appellant.
Where the Minister fails to satisfy this onus of proof, the
appellant is entitled to succeed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] On the basis of the foregoing analysis, it is my opinion
that s. 18(1)(e) did not preclude the appellant from deducting
from income in the taxation years 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 the
capitalized amounts pursuant to the awards made in those years
to its disabled workers by the Workmen's Compensation Board.
It follows that the Minister's reassessments were incorrect.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] In the result, I would allow the appeal with costs, set
aside the judgment of Wright J. and substitute an order that
the appellant's computation of tax payable be varied as
requested by the appellant and that refunds issue to the
appellant in the following amounts: $169,915, $217,147,
$103,187 and $92,824 in respect of the taxation years 1981,
1982, 1983 and 1984, respectively.
