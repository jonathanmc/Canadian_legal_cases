    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is a cross-appeal by Kevin Ronald Choquette from a
judgment made under the Divorce Act R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.) c. 3
awarding spousal support to Yvonne Elizabeth Choquette in the
amount of $4,750.00 per month for an indefinite period of time.
The appeal against the order for custody of the children has been
abandoned. For the sake of convenience, the parties will be
referred to as the husband and the wife.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The husband cross-appeals from the spousal support award on
the ground that the trial judge erred in not making a time-
limited order, a “review order” or “drop down order” in order to
promote the self-sufficiency of the wife. At the hearing, the
husband abandoned his request for a time-limited order and asked
that the judgment be varied so as to provide for a reduction from
$4,750.00 to $2,350.00 a month on January 1, 1999 and then a
further reduction to $1.00 a month on January 1, 2001, or in the
alternative, an order that the spousal support award be subject
to an automatic review no later than January 1, 1999.

[3]  Counsel for the husband confined his oral argument to the
question of the review order. He urged this court to consider a
review order as the most appropriate vehicle in the circumstances
of this case to give effect to the objective set out in
s.15(7)(d) of the Divorce Act:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s.15(7) An order made under this section that
          provides for the support of a spouse should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d) in so far as practicable, promote the
          economic self-sufficiency of each spouse
          within a reasonable period of time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
The review order was defined by counsel in terms described by
Professor James G. McLeod in his annotation to the case of Trewin
v. Jones (1997), 26 R.F.L. (4th ) 419 at 420 as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Under a review order, either party may return
          the matter to court at a fixed time. On the
          return, a court will review support
          entitlement, form, duration and quantum on
          the facts as they exist on the return date.
          The issue of support is determined afresh on
          the facts and the original onus of proof
          applies. Neither party has to prove a
          material change in circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Although there is no express legislative authority to make a
review order, the husband relies on s.15(4) of the Divorce Act
for the making of such an order:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s.15(4) The court may make an order under
          this section [for support] for a definite or
          indefinite period or until the happening of a
          specified event and may impose such other
          terms, conditions or restrictions in
          connection therewith as it thinks fit and
          just. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In our view, this is not an appropriate case to consider the
propriety of making a review order as part of a final judgment.
It is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that he fully
considered the objectives set out in s.15(7)(a) through (d) of
the Divorce Act as they applied to the facts of this case. In
particular, he specifically addressed the issue of self-
sufficiency and was satisfied on the evidence that the wife would
&quot;return to the workplace and move relatively quickly toward self-
sufficiency&quot;.  It is not our role to decide the issue afresh. In
the absence of a material error, this court should not intervene.

[5]  In our view, the husband’s concerns that the wife may not
become self-sufficient as quickly as anticipated by the trial
judge are better dealt with on a variation application brought in
that eventuality. The non-happening of an anticipated event can
constitute a material change in circumstances within the meaning
of the Divorce Act: Trewin v. Jones (1997), 26 R.F.L. (4th) 418
(Ont. C.A.).  Counsel for the wife conceded that proof of
malingering by the wife could be the basis for a variation
application.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appeal is dismissed as abandoned without costs. The
cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
