    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant, the Corporation of the Canadian Civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Liberties Association, was granted standing to bring an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application challenging the constitutional validity of certain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigative powers contained in the Canadian Security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Intelligence Service Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-23 (the &quot;Act&quot;), and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeking injunctive relief. The issue of standing was determined</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior to the hearing as a preliminary matter. The decision is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reported at (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 609 (H.C.J.) [References are to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this decision unless otherwise stated.]. Following a hearing, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application was dismissed: (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 289 (Gen. Div.).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant appeals from the dismissal of the application.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent, the Attorney General of Canada, cross-appeals on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue of standing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  I have come to the conclusion that the issue of standing is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determinative in this case. The main issues argued by counsel in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relation to the appeal on the substantive merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application are more properly directed to the question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing. In my view, the motions judge erred in granting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant standing to bring its application. In the result, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would allow the cross-appeal and dismiss the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application on the ground of no standing. Consequently, I would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also dismiss the appeal on the same ground.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.   The Applicant

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant is a non-profit corporation, established</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant to the laws of Canada, the objects of which are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identical to those of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(the &quot;Association&quot;).  In its material, the appellant states that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its governance is closely linked to that of the Association. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant essentially relies on the status of the Association in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support of its application for standing in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant describes the Association in its factum as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Association is a national organization
          with more than sixty-five hundred (6,500)
          individual members. The Association's major
          objectives include the promotion of legal
          protection of the freedom and dignity of the
          individual against unreasonable invasion of
          public authority and the advancement of fair
          procedures for the determination of
          individual rights and obligations. The
          Association has long had a serious concern
          with the powers accorded the police and
          national security agencies in Canada. It has
          publicly addressed how far the powers of a
          national security agency may impinge on basic
          civil liberties such as those of speech,
          freedom of association and reasonable
          expectation of privacy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The motions judge recognized the Association's Along history</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of involvement in the public debate over the constitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">validity of the CSIS legislation&quot; (at p. 617) and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contributions to the debate of its General Counsel, Alan Borovoy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It would appear from the reasons of the motions judge that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and the Association were treated as one and the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the purpose of the application for standing. The parties on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal have chosen to confine their argument to their respective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facta on the issue of standing and no issue is raised on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question in either factum. In these circumstances, I am prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to adopt the same approach as the motions judge and consider the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's interest to be the same as that of the Association.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">B.   Nature and Scope of the Application

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The appellant seeks a declaration that ss.12 and 21 to 26</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inclusive of the Act are unconstitutional and of no force and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect to the extent that they authorize the use of intrusive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surveillance techniques of lawful activities of Canadian citizens</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and permanent residents. It is contended that the impugned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislative provisions violate the freedoms of speech, assembly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and association and the right to be secure against unreasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">searches or seizures as guaranteed under ss. 2(b), (c), (d) and 8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(U.K.), 1982, c. 11.  The appellant has abandoned its claim that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act violated s. 7 Charter rights. The appellant also relies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act. The relevant constitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions read as follows:

          against unreasonable search or seizure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               52  (1)  The Constitution of Canada is
          the supreme law of Canada, and any law that
          is inconsistent with the provisions of the
          Constitution is, to the extent of the
          inconsistency, of no force or effect.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant is also seeking injunctive relief restraining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (&quot;CSIS&quot;) from acting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the impugned provisions of the Act. Specifically, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant seeks the following relief:

               effect to the extent that it authorizes
               CSIS to use the intrusive surveillance
               techniques of electronic bugging,
               surreptitious search, mail opening,
               invasion of confidential records, and
               the deployment of covert informants,
               against Canadian citizens and permanent
               residents, in the course of
               investigating &quot;activities&quot; that are not

               provide for the issuance of warrants

               &quot;threats to the security of Canada&quot; in

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  CSIS is mandated, pursuant to ss.12 and 21 to 26 of the Act,</font></pre>

               the purpose of achieving a political

          paragraphs (a) to (d). [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellant argues that certain key components of that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition, when combined with some of the enabling provisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found in ss.12 and 21 to 26 of the Act, in effect permit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">techniques of intrusive surveillance for use against Canadian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">citizens and permanent residents which exceed any clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demonstrated need. The appellant therefore relies on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overbreadth of the legislative provisions as a basis for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishing a violation of Charter rights and freedoms.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impugned provisions of the Act are appended to this decision for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ease of reference.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant concedes that there is a need for the creation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a government intelligence service. However, it is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's position that the powers of surveillance available to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CSIS against Canadian citizens and permanent residents in regard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to their lawful activities are &quot;excessive and needlessly broad.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant does not take issue with CSIS surveillance in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relation to unlawful activities of Canadian citizens and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permanent residents, or in relation to activities, lawful or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unlawful, of foreign visitors.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant further restricts its application to the use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of intrusive techniques of surveillance authorized under the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It takes issue with the express authority under the Act for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">use by CSIS, pursuant to judicial warrant, of powers such as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">electronic surveillance, mail opening, surreptitious searches and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the invasion of confidential records. The appellant also takes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue with the deployment of covert informants, a surveillance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">technique CSIS can use without judicial authorization. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant does not take issue with the use of overt surveillance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">techniques.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In short, the appellant contends that the very existence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intrusive surveillance techniques under the Act inhibit and deter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individuals from expressing themselves freely and participating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in legitimate activities. The appellant expresses concern that,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">due to the surreptitious nature of the impugned CSIS surveillance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">techniques, its members and other Canadian citizens and permanent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">residents will not be able to gather satisfactory proof that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their constitutional rights have been threatened or violated by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CSIS and will therefore be unable to seek judicial protection of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their rights and freedoms. Hence, it argues that it is in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">best position to bring these issues before the court. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant states that it brings this application in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secure and promote the constitutionally guaranteed rights of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the right to be secure against unreasonable searches or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seizures.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In support of its application, the appellant relies on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged overbreadth of the impugned provisions themselves and on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence which purports to show the adverse effects of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation. This evidence consists of four affidavits and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of excerpts of reports prepared by the Security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Intelligence Review Committee (&quot;SIRC&quot;). SIRC is an independent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">body established under the Act for the purpose of reviewing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance of CSIS; ensuring that its activities are carried out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in accordance with the Act and that the activities do not involve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any unreasonable or unnecessary exercise by CSIS of its powers;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and conducting investigations into complaints and other matters</font></pre>

          other such powers have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on
          the willingness of citizens to exercise their
          right to engage in lawful advocacy, protest
          or dissent. The applicant submits that since
          individuals proposing to do no more than
          engage in advocacy and dissent do not always
          know whether their lawful activities will be
          monitored, the cautious among them may, and
          do, choose to refrain from engaging in
          legitimate political activities for fear of
          becoming objects of CSIS surveillance. This
          assertion is supported somewhat by the
          affidavit evidence of three members of three
          different lawful advocacy groups who feel
          that they, their organizations and their
          membership have been the subject of CSIS
          surveillance. The fear of intrusion into
          their lives by CSIS, through the use of
          covert surveillance or actual interference in
          their affairs, is alleged by the applicant to
          be an infringement of the Charter rights of
          freedom of expression, assembly, association,
          the right to privacy and the right to be free
          from unreasonable search and seizure.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria set out in the earlier cases, it clearly opted for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictive approach in their application. Cory J., in writing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the court, stated as follows (at pp. 252-53):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The increasing recognition of the
          importance of public rights in our society
          confirms the need to extend the right to
          standing from the private law tradition which
          limited party status to those who possessed a
          private interest.  In addition some extension
          of standing beyond the traditional parties
          accords with the provisions of the
          Constitution Act, 1982. However, I would
          stress that the recognition of the need to
          grant public interest standing in some
          circumstances does not amount to a blanket
          approval to grant standing to all who wish to
          litigate an issue.  It is essential that a
          balance be struck between ensuring access to
          the courts and preserving judicial resources.
          It would be disastrous if the courts were
          allowed to become hopelessly overburdened as
          a result of the unnecessary proliferation of
          marginal or redundant suits brought by well-
          meaning organizations pursuing their own
          particular cases certain in the knowledge
          that their cause is all important.  It would
          be detrimental, if not devastating, to our
          system of justice and unfair to private
          litigants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The whole purpose of granting status is
          to prevent the immunization of legislation or
          public acts from any challenge. The granting
          of public interest standing is not required
          when, on a balance of probabilities, it can
          be shown that the measure will be subject to
          attack by a private litigant. The principles
          for granting public standing set forth by
          this Court need not and should not be
          expanded. The decision whether to grant
          status is a discretionary one with all that
          that designation implies. Thus undeserving
          applications may be refused. Nonetheless,
          when exercising the discretion the applicable
          principles should be interpreted in a liberal
          and generous manner. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The Canadian Council of Churches (the &quot;Council&quot;), a federal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation which represents the interests of a broad group of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member churches including the protection and resettlement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refugees, was denied standing to challenge the constitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">validity of a number of provisions contained in the amended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Immigration Act, 1976. Although the court was satisfied that the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demonstrated a genuine interest, it failed on the third</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criterion. The court concluded as follows (at pp. 255-56):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               From the material presented, it is clear
          that individual claimants for refugee status,
          who have every right to challenge the
          legislation, have in fact done so. There are,
          therefore, other reasonable methods of
          bringing the matter before the Court. On this
          ground the applicant Council must fail. I
          would hasten to add that this should not be
          interpreted as a mechanistic application of a
          technical requirement. Rather it must be
          remembered that the basic purpose for
          allowing public interest standing is to
          ensure that legislation is not immunized from
          challenge. Here there is no such immunization
          as plaintiff refugee claimants are
          challenging the legislation. Thus the very
          rationale for the public interest litigation
          party disappears. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support of their claim&quot; (at p. 692). The court stated as follows</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(at pp. 693-94):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As this Court stated in MacKay v. Manitoba,
          [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at pp.361-62:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Charter decisions should not and
               must not be made in a factual vacuum. To
               attempt to do so would trivialize the
               Charter and inevitably result in ill-
               considered opinions. The presentation of
               facts is not, as stated by the
               respondent, a mere technicality; rather,
               it is essential to a proper
               consideration of Charter issues. A
               respondent cannot, by simply consenting
               to dispense with the factual background,
               require or expect a court to deal with
               an issue such as this in a factual void.
               Charter decisions cannot be based upon
               the unsupported hypotheses of
               enthusiastic counsel.</font></pre>

          challenges to the impugned rules by parties
          with specific and factually established
          complaints&quot;. This mirrors the Court's
          vigilance in ensuring that it hears the
          arguments of the parties most directly
          affected by a matter. In the absence of facts
          specific to the appellants, both the Court's
          ability to ensure that it hears from those
          most directly affected and that Charter
          issues are decided in a proper factual
          context are compromised.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing. In considering the latter as an alternative basis for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing, she indicated her disagreement with the majority</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion on the relevance of the evidentiary basis to the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing (at p. 720):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This Court's decisions MacKay and
          Danson, which dealt with the need to avoid
          deciding Charter issues in a factual vacuum,
          are not at all relevant to the question of
          standing. If anything, they lend support to
          the notion that standing is an issue separate
          and apart from the question of the
          sufficiency of the evidence and, furthermore,
          that an appellant's standing can be
          unassailable even when there is not a shred
          of evidence to support a Charter claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In support of this statement, she notes that in MacKay, the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated that there was not one particle of evidence before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court, yet there was no suggestion that the appellants lacked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing. Similarly, with respect to Danson, she noted that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a complete absence of adjudicative facts, yet the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expressly stated that standing of the appellant was not an issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] With respect, I have some difficulty with this reasoning</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since public interest standing was not in issue in either MacKay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or Danson. In MacKay, the appellants were claiming that their own</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights were violated, hence the traditional rules of standing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would apply. However, the issue was never raised. In Danson, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts could have given rise to a question of public interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing but the only issue before the court was a narrow one,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is whether it was appropriate to seek constitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declarations by way of application without alleging facts in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support of the relief claimed. In answering this question in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negative, the court indeed expressly noted that standing of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was not an issue before the court. I interpret this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reference as a caution that the court's decision should not be</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Three major concerns are typically
          identified: the proper allocation of judicial
          resources; the prevention of vexatious suits
          brought at the behest of mere &quot;busybodies&quot;;
          and the particular requirements of the
          adversary system. The first category includes
          such concerns as fears about a multiplicity
          of suits, otherwise known as the &quot;floodgates&quot;
          argument. Within the second category, courts
          have employed standing restrictions to ensure
          that issues are fully canvassed by promoting
          the use of the judicial process to decide
          live disputes between parties as opposed to
          hypothetical ones. Under the latter category
          are subsumed such matters as the
          &quot;justiciability&quot; of the issue before the
          courts, whether the full dimensions of the
          issue can be expected to be aired before the
          court and limits on the exercise of judicial
          power.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] I would agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that the issue of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as of right. They do not depend on a discretionary grant of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims which may be made under the rules of procedure on the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The motions judge correctly instructed himself as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three criteria which must be met before public interest standing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will be granted. He did not, however, have the benefit of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court in Canadian Council of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Churches and Hy and Zel's which assist in further defining these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria. His decision with respect to each of the criteria is as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   Serious issue of invalidity

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] The motions judge addressed the question whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seriousness of an issue relates to its general public importance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or to its substantive merits. He reviewed some of the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisprudence and concluded that this requirement could not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equated to &quot;a reasonable cause of action&quot; and, hence, that this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criterion related to the general importance of the issue. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated as follows (at p. 618):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the case before me, the parties have
          agreed to have the issue of standing
          determined as a preliminary issue. While the
          nature of the applicant's interest in the
          substantive issues raised by the application
          is set out by the allegations and contentions
          in the application record and in the factums
          and authorities brief filed by the parties, I
          do not think it prudent to rule on the
          substantive merits of the application.
          Rather, the appropriate inquiry at this stage
          of the proceedings is to ask whether or not
          the application raises issues of general
          public importance which deserve the
          consideration of this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In applying this standard as to whether
          or not the applicant has raised a &quot;serious
          issue&quot; as to the validity of the legislation,
          I do not wish to be seen as injecting another
          verbal formula into the process of
          determining the applicant's standing. Rather,
          interpreting the &quot;serious issue&quot; criterion to
          mean that the issue be one of general public
          importance is to indicate that by granting
          standing, the court is prepared to place a
          certain societal value on an interest and
          protect it by allowing it to be the subject
          of litigation, thus recognizing that the
          individual or group seeking to litigate is
          not disputing something of merely
          idiosyncratic interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The motions judge then reviewed the issues raised by the

appellant in its application and concluded as follows (at p. 619):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Without ruling on the adequacy of the
          applicant's evidence, or on the substantive
          merits of the issues of law presented, the
          applicant has raised issues of general public
          importance that ought to be the subject of a
          full and complete judicial examination. There
          may well be a nexus between the impugned
          provisions of the CSIS Act and the legitimate
          imposition of a &quot;chill&quot; on a citizen's
          ability to express a thought, belief or
          opinion. It is in the public interest for a
          court to address the merits of this
          application.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The respondent, in its cross-appeal, submits that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge erred in relating the seriousness of the issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised by the application to their general importance rather than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the substantive merits of the application. It is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's position that the application has no substantive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merit because it is unsupported by any evidentiary basis. Rather,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is based on hypothetical consequences which, it is argued,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot form the basis for granting declaratory and injunctive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief.  Consequently, the respondent submits that standing ought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to have been denied for failure to raise a serious issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">invalidity.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] It is clear from the above-noted review of the jurisprudence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the motions judge erred in refusing to consider the merits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the application. In particular, Canadian Council of Churches</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Hy and Zel's establish beyond controversy that the merits of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the application are a relevant consideration, and indeed can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">become determinative, on the issue of standing. This court is in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as good a position as the motions judge to assess this factor and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I will address it later in these reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   Appellant's genuine interest in the validity of the Act

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] No issue is raised on appeal on this criterion. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent concedes that the appellant has demonstrated a genuine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in the validity of the Act.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In my view, this concession is properly made with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Association. As stated earlier, the parties appear to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been content throughout to have the appellant's interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered as being the same as that of the Association.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3.   Another reasonable and effective way to bring the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues before the court

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] The motions judge's decision on this issue summarizes well</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the position of the parties and it is useful to set out the full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">text of his reasons on this point (at pp. 619-21):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The respondent's last objection to the
          granting of standing to the applicant is that
          the applicant has not shown that there is no
          other effective manner in which this issue
          may be brought before the court.  The
          respondent cites Le Dain J.'s concern in
          Finlay, at p. 633 S.C.R., that the &quot;court
          should have the benefit of the contending
          views of the persons most directly affected
          by the issue&quot;.  It is submitted that the
          applicant is not among those &quot;most directly
          affected&quot; by the legislation.  Thus, the
          respondent argues, the court will not have
          the contending views of those most directly
          affected by the legislation.  Given the
          scarcity of judicial resources, the court
          should deal with these issues when they are
          raised by persons whose rights have actually
          been infringed or are actually threatened.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The applicant, on the other hand, argues
          that it is particularly well suited to bring
          an application under the circumstances of
          this case.  It argues that unless it is
          allowed to challenge the constitutional
          validity of CSIS's intrusive surveillance
          powers, these powers will likely remain
          unchallenged.  Because many of the activities
          of CSIS are surreptitious and are undertaken
          essentially to gather and analyze certain
          kinds of information, but not to collect
          evidence for prosecution in court, it is
          unlikely that the individuals whose rights
          are most seriously and directly violated will
          have sufficient proof that they are the
          subjects of unconstitutional investigation,
          nor would they have a real opportunity to
          challenge the activities in court.  The
          applicant further submits that, even where a
          group or individual may be aware of an
          investigation, the chilling effect of the Act
          and CSIS's activities will certainly serve to
          discourage directly affected parties from
          initiating litigation.  Lastly, the applicant
          submits that its expertise in matters
          relating to security intelligence activities
          and the advocacy of civil liberties issues in
          Canada strongly suggested that a grant of
          standing in this case is not only practical
          but will also put before the court the most
          informed and competent arguments in relation
          to the issues before the court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I tend to agree with the position taken
          by the applicant.  I place little weight on
          the respondent's concern that, if the
          applicant is granted standing, the court will
          not have the contending views of the persons
          most directly affected by the issues raised.
          The CCLA and the federal Department of
          Justice have undoubted knowledge and
          expertise with respect to the issues at hand,
          and both sides have the resources to ensure
          that every relevant factual and legal
          argument is put before the court.  While it
          is preferable for constitutional issues to be
          brought before the courts by those whose
          rights are most directly infringed (as it is
          also with other issues raised under private
          law), under the circumstances of this case,
          where the &quot;group&quot; most directly affected
          could be said to be the public at large (in
          that, if we accept the arguments of the
          applicant, the very processes of our
          political democracy could conceivably be
          threatened by a chill on s. 2 Charter
          rights), the most reasonable and effective
          manner in which the issues can be brought
          before the court is to grant the applicant
          standing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The respondent submits that the motions judge erred in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion. Persons whose activities are actually targeted by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation and who can claim that CSIS has actually violated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their rights can, and do, challenge the constitutionality of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation. By way of example, the respondent notes the case of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R. v. Atwal (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (F.C.A.) where, by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority decision, the Federal Court of Appeal held that s. 21 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act met the constitutional requirements set out in s. 8 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Charter. The respondent argues that those persons directly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affected by the Act are the ones who can bring the issues before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the court in the most reasonable and effective manner. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted that, because the court did not have before it those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persons who are most directly affected by the legislation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application proceeded without a proper factual foundation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] As seen in Hy and Zel's, the sufficiency of the evidence can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have some bearing on the application of this criterion. I will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore return to it after my review and assessment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence and the merits of the application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">E.   The merits of the application

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] As stated earlier, the respondent contends that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application is without merit because it is without any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidentiary basis. I will review the evidence in some detail in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order to assess this factor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   The evidence

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] In reviewing and assessing the evidence, it may be useful to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recall the nature and scope of the application. What is brought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in issue is the deleterious effect of the intrusive techniques of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CSIS surveillance, (this is electronic surveillance, mail</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opening, surreptitious searches, the invasion of confidential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records and the deployment of covert informants), as they relate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the lawful activities of Canadians and permanent residents. No</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue is taken with the constitutional scope of overt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surveillance techniques.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] It is also important to review the distinction between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjudicative facts and legislative facts. Sopinka J. in Danson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refers to this distinction (at p. 1099):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It is necessary to draw a distinction at
          the outset between two categories of facts in
          constitutional litigation: &quot;adjudicative
          facts&quot; and &quot;legislative facts&quot;. These terms
          derive from Davis, Administrative Law
          Treatise (1958), vol. 2, para. 15.03, p.353.
          (See also Morgan, &quot;Proof of Facts in Charter
          Litigation&quot;, in Sharpe, ed., Charter
          Litigation (1987).) Adjudicative facts are
          those that concern the immediate parties: in
          Davis' words, &quot;who did what, where, when,
          how, and with what motive or intent...&quot;. Such
          facts are specific, and must be proved by
          admissible evidence. Legislative facts are
          those that establish the purpose and
          background of legislation, including its
          social, economic and cultural context. Such
          facts are of a more general nature, and are
          subject to less stringent admissibility
          requirements: see e.g., Re Anti-Inflation
          Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, per Laskin C.J., at
          p.391; Re Residential Tenancies Act 1979,
          [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714, per Dickson J. (as he
          then was), at p. 723; and Reference re Upper
          Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984]
          1 S.C.R. 297, per McIntyre J., at p.318.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] As noted earlier, the applicant filed four affidavits and

various excerpts of reports from SIRC. The contents of this

material can be summarized as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     a) affidavit by A. Alan Borovoy

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Mr. Borovoy identifies himself as General Counsel of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian Civil Liberties Association and states that, as such, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has authority to speak on behalf of the appellant. He states that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the corporate objects of the appellant are identical to those of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Association. He then describes the Association, its objects</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and its extensive involvement in the litigation of civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liberties issues over the years.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] This part of the affidavit, which consists of approximately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one half of it, is of relevance to show that the Association (and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presumably, the appellant ) has a genuine interest in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">validity of the Act.  It is of no relevance to the substantive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits of the application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] In the second half of the affidavit, Mr. Borovoy describes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some of the contents of the SIRC reports and refers to the other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affidavits filed in support of the application. He then expresses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following belief with respect to the activities of CSIS:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... it is very difficult to conduct such
          pervasive intelligence operations without
          casting a chill over political liberty and
          personal privacy. At the very least, many
          people are likely to feel that they are under
          surveillance. This will particularly apply to
          those who have unconventional beliefs and
          ideologies. If such people think their
          organizations are infested with spies, they
          will not speak freely at their meetings. If
          they think they are being followed, they will

          prosecution in court, it is unlikely that the
          individuals whose rights are most seriously
          violated would have satisfactory proof that

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern. In the spring of 1987, shortly after Mr. Aitken appeared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at a press conference as spokesperson for the Coalition, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received a call from a person (whose name she cannot recall) who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identified himself as an agent for CSIS and who asked her to meet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him to discuss the Coalition. She agreed to meet him.  She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">described the encounter as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the spring of 1987, shortly after
          Mr. Aitken appeared at a press conference as
          spokesperson for the Coalition, I received a
          telephone call from an agent of the Canadian
          Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) asking
          that I meet with him at the Westin Hotel in
          Edmonton in order to discuss the Coalition.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I met with the CSIS official in the
          lounge of the Westin Hotel.  The CSIS
          officer, whose name I do not recall, asked me
          several questions about the Coalition.  For
          example, he asked me to identify the members
          of the Coalition.  I cooperated fully by
          answering all of his questions but suggested
          that he attend a Coalition meeting which is
          open to the public and which would likely
          answer most of his questions.  The CSIS
          official also offered, more than once during
          the course of the conversation, to buy me a
          drink.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               After I answered a number of his
          questions, the CSIS official then expressed
          concern about the participation of one of the
          members in the Coalition.  He advised me that
          the Coalition should be particularly careful
          as such groups can be influenced and taken
          over by foreign powers.  He commented that
          one group was involving itself as a member of
          the Coalition when it had never been involved
          in immigration and refugee matters before.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Near the end of the conversation, the
          CSIS official intimated that he was concerned
          that the AFL was a member of the Coalition.
          However, he did not expressly say that this
          was the group that was being directed by, or
          could be influencing or taking over the
          Coalition on behalf of, a foreign power.
          However he mentioned the names of no other
          members of the Coalition during the whole of
          our meeting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] Ms. Third-Tsushima then describes the effect this encounter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had on her. First, it caused her to contact Mr. Aitken to advise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him about the meeting with the CSIS official. She states that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Aitken volunteered, on behalf of the AFL, to drop out of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Coalition or to &quot;take a back seat in the affairs of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Coalition&quot;. She states that, on behalf of the Coalition, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused his offer and insisted that the AFL continue on as a full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member as before. Secondly, she describes her subjective concerns</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I am concerned that CSIS was attempting
          to cause dissension between members by
          questioning the motives of certain members
          and/or to cause certain members to be
          excluded or limited in participation, thus
          limiting the effectiveness of the Coalition.
          I am also concerned that, if CSIS has shown
          an interest in the internal affairs of the
          Coalition, it might have used, or might be
          willing to use, techniques of intrusive
          surveillance against me or other members of
          the Coalition, such as wiretapping and the
          use of covert informants.  I am particularly
          concerned about a wiretap at the offices of
          the St. Barnabas Refugee Society as it speaks
          with refugees who may be escaping persecution
          by foreign governments.  Some of those
          conversations deal with information which, if
          passed on by CSIS to such a foreign
          government, could go so far as to endanger
          the lives of potential refugee claimants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] It is difficult to see how this evidence can assist the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant in establishing an infringement of Charter rights and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">freedoms as alleged. Quite clearly the incident described by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affiant is an overt act of surveillance, a technique which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant concedes is constitutionally permissible. Any effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the described CSIS intervention may have had on Mr. Aitken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(assuming this evidence can be admitted through this affiant) can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hardly be said to constitute evidence of the adverse effects of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the impugned provisions, that is those provisions which permit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intrusive techniques. In any event, it is not clear what adverse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect this constitutionally permissible intervention has had on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anyone's Charter rights or freedoms. The suggestion appears to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that this overt act of surveillance almost caused Mr. Aitken to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">curtail his freedom to associate with the Coalition. But, in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">end result, it would appear that he carried on as before.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] At best, this affidavit can be said to show that, once this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affiant was armed with the knowledge that an organisation which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whom she is associated was a source of interest to CSIS, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">developed a subjective fear that the organisation may have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or may become the target of intrusive surveillance techniques and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hence, presumably a possible victim of s. 8 violations. In my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, this evidence adds nothing more to the simple reliance on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the overbreadth of a legislative provision on its face to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establish a Charter infringement. Whether this argument raises a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serious issue of invalidity is a matter I will address later.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] In any event, this evidence is so weak that it is difficult</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to see how it has any probative value at all. A few questions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which come to mind are the following:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Is the subjective fear at all linked to the
          impugned provisions of the Act? Does Ms.
          Third-Tsushima even have knowledge of the
          existence of the Act or of the tenor of any
          of its provisions? Would she have the same
          fear if the Act didn't exist or if some of
          its provisions were struck down?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Is her fear reasonable? Is it perhaps based
          on an ignorance of the fact that, except for
          the deployment of covert informants, all
          forms of intrusive surveillance are subject
          to judicial control under the Act? Or is it
          based rather on a general distrust of the
          judicial system's efficiency in protecting
          her Charter rights?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          How does this evidence connect the subjective
          fear (presumably related to the impugned
          provisions) to the alleged Charter
          violations? In other words, as the result of
          this fear, has any of the freedoms of speech,
          assembly and association or the right to be
          secure against unreasonable searches and
          seizures been curtailed for anyone?</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] This information about the attendance of the RCMP officer at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the meeting prompted Mr. Zander to write to the Honourable Perrin</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Mr. Zander then expresses his concerns as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As a result of CSIS involvement in the
          internal democratic process of Local 452, the
          reputation of the British Columbia Provincial
          Council of Carpenters has been harmed.
          Concerns about CSIS involvement have been
          expressed directly to me by union members.
          They have asked me what it is that the union
          is doing that could trigger CSIS involvement.
          If our union is so open, they asked, why
          should CSIS be interested in local union
          affairs.  Similar concerns have been
          intimated to me by other union members.  It
          is my belief that some of the union members
          are concerned that if they become involved in
          union politics they could become targets of
          CSIS surveillance.  As a result, they may be
          less likely to get involved in union affairs
          by running for election for union office.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As a result of the CSIS involvement in
          the internal democratic process of Local 452,
          I am now concerned that CSIS may be using
          some of its other techniques of intrusive
          surveillance that are available to it, such
          as wiretapping and the use of covert
          informants, against the union.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] This affidavit also describes the effect of overt techniques</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] Ms. Wright also expressed the belief that TDN has been the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">object of surreptitious surveillance by CSIS because of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;illegal break and enter&quot; which occurred on August 6, 1988.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Wright describes how the state of the office after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intrusion was discovered  led her to believe that the intruders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were looking for information on TDN's sources of funding and its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">connection with the Soviet Union and how this inference, in turn,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">led her to believe that the intrusion was the result of CSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surveillance. She relies on the following facts in support of her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">belief:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    Shortly before the intrusion, a Co-ordinator of the TDN had
     travelled to the Soviet Union on invitation by the
     government of the Soviet Union to view the destruction of a
     nuclear missile and this trip received media attention.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    Some cash boxes had not been touched by the intruders.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    The financial records were neatly stacked on a different
     shelf while material unrelated to the internal affairs of
     TDN was strewn across the floor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    The minute books were not found on the floor and &quot;appeared
     to have been scrutinized&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Wright does not indicate whether anything was taken at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time of the break and enter. She states that police investigated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the occurrence and, to her knowledge, the intruders were never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] She states that &quot;[t]he intensity and regularity of CSIS</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to this intense and regular CSIS surveillance.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and to what extent TDN activities have been curtailed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] Finally she expressed the view that this fear of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislative facts in support of its application. The excerpts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied upon by the appellant include the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    recommendations on CSIS policies and practices</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  the August 6, 1988 incident at TDN headquarters;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  some legislative facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">F.   Application of the Test for Public Interest Standing
     to the Appellant's Application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] As I have indicated at the outset, it is my view that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge erred in granting standing in this case. As it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">turns out, his reasons for dismissing the application on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits lend support to the conclusion that this is not a proper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case to grant public interest standing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] First, the motions judge's ultimate conclusion on the s. 2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged infringements was  in essence a finding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had not raised an issue recognized in Canadian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutional jurisprudence. In these circumstances, it could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hardly be said that a serious issue of invalidity had been raised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and standing ought to have been refused on that basis. In fact,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant argued that the motions judge's decision on s. 2 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Charter was inconsistent with his decision to grant standing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Second, on the s. 8 alleged infringement, the issue was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimately resolved on the basis of stare decisis. The motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge held that the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Atwal was authoritative on the constitutional question before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him. As seen earlier, when the impugned legislative provision is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or will be subject to attack by a private litigant, the purpose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for granting public interest standing disappears. Standing ought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to have been refused on the basis that there was another</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the court.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] It therefore becomes quite apparent that the motions judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fundamental error was in refusing to consider the merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application on the issue of standing. Had he considered the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits on the preliminary motion, he would likely have refused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standing. I will review the issues raised on standing in light of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the merits of the application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   Serious issue of invalidity

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] What will constitute a serious issue of invalidity is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">easy to ascertain with any precision from the case law. It would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be unwise to attempt to answer this question in any exhaustive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manner in this case because the full scope of this question was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not argued. I will limit my consideration of the question to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues raised by the parties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] One question raised is whether it is sufficient for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant to raise issues of &quot;general public importance&quot; in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">abstract without regard to the substantive merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application.  This question has already been answered in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negative. It is now beyond controversy that the substantive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits of the application are relevant to a consideration of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criterion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] Of course, the consideration of the merits for the purpose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of determining standing is  not a determination of the ultimate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merits of the case. It is more akin to the question whether there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is a reasonable cause of action. Depending on the facts of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular case, the issues of standing and reasonable cause of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action tend to merge: see Finlay, at p. 636, Canadian Council of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Churches, at p. 253, Energy Probe v. Canada (1989), 68 O.R. (2d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">449 (C.A.) at 465. In this case as well, the two issues tend to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     a)  Alleged infringement of s. 2(b), (c) and (d) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] A consideration of the merits of the application leads to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the conclusion that the appellant cannot succeed in its challenge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the constitutionality of the impugned provisions on the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the alleged infringements of s.2 (b), (c), and (d) because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lack of an evidentiary basis. As set out above, the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presents no relevant adjudicative facts. The application is based</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entirely on the argument that the legislation is overbroad and,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequently, creates a &quot;chill&quot; or an adverse effect on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">freedoms of speech, assembly and association.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[84] In support of this argument, the appellant cited a number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">American cases for their persuasive value. The motions judge, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his decision on the merits of the application, rejected the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's argument. With respect to each of the alleged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 2(b), (c) and (d) infringement, the motions judge held that no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach had been established on the following basis (8 O.R. (3d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at 319):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In conclusion, as previously determined with
          respect to s. 2(b) [and s. 2(c)] of the
          Charter, current Canadian law has not adopted
          the chilling effect doctrine in determining
          the sphere of conduct to be protected under
          s. 2 of the Charter, nor will this court
          adopt the American chilling effect doctrine
          in determining the scope of the s. 2(d)
          freedom. Therefore the applicant has not
          established that the purpose or the effect of
          the Act restricts the freedom of association.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[85] The argument was put to this court, not in terms of the

American &quot;chilling effect doctrine&quot; but in terms of &quot;overbreadth&quot;

as a basis for establishing an infringement. I do not find it

necessary to review any of the American authorities cited to us.

Following the hearing in this matter, the case of R. v. Nova

Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606 was decided

and, in my view, it is determinative on this point.  The

following passage fully answers the appellant's argument (at p.

628):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Overbreadth in American law is tied to
          the First Amendment.  It is grounds to obtain
          what is termed &quot;facial invalidation&quot; of a
          statute, as opposed to a declaration that the
          statute is unconstitutional in the case of
          the particular plaintiff, which is the usual
          remedy.  Village of Hoffman Estates v.
          Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489
          (1982), indicates how overbreadth interacts
          with vagueness in First Amendment cases.  The
          court wrote at pp. 494-95:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In a facial challenge to the
               overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a
               court's first task is to determine
               whether the enactment reaches a
               substantial amount of constitutionally
               protected conduct.  If it does not, then
               the overbreadth challenge must fail.
               The court should then examine the facial
               vagueness challenge and, assuming the
               enactment implicates no constitutionally
               protected conduct, should uphold the
               challenge only if the enactment is
               impermissibly vague in all of its
               applications.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Overbreadth ties in to the taxonomy of
          protected and unprotected conduct and
          expression developed by American courts under
          the First Amendment.  Some conduct or
          expression receives First Amendment
          protection and some does not, and to the
          extent that a statute substantially touches
          upon protected conduct and cannot be severed
          or read down, it will be declared void (see
          L. H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2nd
          ed. 1988), at p. 1022).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This distinction between protected and
          unprotected conduct or expression is typical
          of American law, since the American
          Constitution does not contain a general
          balancing clause similar to s. 1 of the
          Charter.  Balancing must be done within the
          First Amendment itself.  In this respect, it
          can be seen that the doctrine of overbreadth
          in American law involves an element of
          balancing, since the aims and scope of the
          statute must be compared with the range of
          protection of the First Amendment.
          C. Rogerson, &quot;The Judicial Search for
          Appropriate Remedies Under the Charter: The
          Examples of Overbreadth and Vagueness&quot;, in R.
          J. Sharpe, ed., Charter Litigation (1987), at
          pp. 261-62, traces this element of balancing
          to Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601
          (1973).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This Court has repeatedly emphasized the
          numerous differences which exist between the
          Charter and the American Constitution.  In
          particular, in the interpretation of s. 2 of
          the Charter, this Court has taken a route
          completely different from that of U.S.
          courts.  In cases starting with Irwin Toy up
          to Butler, including the Prostitution
          Reference and Keegstra, this Court has given
          a wide ambit to the freedoms guaranteed by
          s. 2 of the Charter, on the basis that
          balancing between the objectives of the State
          and the violation of a right or freedom
          should occur at the s. 1 stage.  Other
          sections of the Charter, such as ss. 7 and 8,
          do however incorporate some element of
          balancing, as a limitation within the
          definition of the protected right, with
          respect to other notions such as principles
          of fundamental justice or reasonableness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               A notion tied to balancing such as
          overbreadth finds its proper place in
          sections of the Charter which involve a
          balancing process.  Consequently, I cannot
          but agree with the opinion expressed by
          L'Heureux-Dubé J. in Committee for the
          Commonwealth of Canada that overbreadth is
          subsumed under the &quot;minimal impairment
          branch&quot; of the Oakes test, under s. 1 of the
          Charter.  This is also in accordance with the
          trend evidenced in Osborne and Butler.
          Furthermore, in determining whether s. 12 of
          the Charter has been infringed, for instance,
          a court, if it finds the punishment not
          grossly disproportionate for the accused,
          will typically examine reasonable hypotheses
          and assess whether the punishment is grossly
          disproportionate in these situations (R. v.
          Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, and R. v. Goltz,
          [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485).  This inquiry also
          resembles the sort of balancing process
          associated with the notion of overbreadth.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In all these cases, however, overbreadth
          remains no more than an analytical tool.  The
          alleged overbreadth is always related to some
          limitation under the Charter.  It is always
          established by comparing the ambit of the
          provision touching upon a protected right
          with such concepts as the objectives of the
          State, the principles of fundamental justice,
          the proportionality of punishment or the
          reasonableness of searches and seizures, to
          name a few.  There is no such thing as
          overbreadth in the abstract.  Overbreadth has
          no autonomous value under the Charter.  As
          will be seen below, overbreadth is not at the
          heart of this case, although it has been
          invoked in argument.  [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] In my view, it is clear from the above that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot simply rely on &quot;overbreadth&quot; as proof of an infringement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of s. 2 freedoms. I also find the cases in MacKay and Danson,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which emphasize the importance of a factual basis in Charter</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">above in the passage quoted from Canadian Council of Churches. I</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This Court has been vigilant to ensure
          that a proper factual foundation exists
          before measuring legislation against the
          provisions of the Charter, particularly where
          the effects of impugned legislation are the
          subject of the attack.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the present case, the appellant
          contends that he ought to be entitled to
          proceed with his application under Rule
          14.05(3)(h) in the complete absence of
          adjudicative facts, and, moreover, that it is
          sufficient that he present in argument (but
          not prove by affidavit or otherwise)
          legislative &quot;facts&quot;, in the form of textbooks
          and academic material about the prevailing
          understanding of the concept of the
          independence of the bar, and material
          concerning the legislative history of the
          impugned rules.  In the view I take of this
          matter, the appellant is not entitled to
          proceed with the application as presently
          constituted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the time between the granting of
          leave to appeal in this matter and the
          hearing of the appeal, this Court heard and
          decided MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R.
          357, a case concerning an action for a
          declaration that certain provisions of The
          Elections Finances Act, S.M. 1982-83-84,
          c. 45, violated the guarantee of freedom of
          expression contained in s. 2(b) of the
          Charter.  Cory J., speaking for a unanimous
          Court, stated, at pp. 361-62:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Charter decisions should not and
               must not be made in a factual vacuum.
               To attempt to do so would trivialize the
               Charter and inevitably result in ill-
               considered opinions.  The presentation
               of facts is not, as stated by the
               respondent, a mere technicality; rather,
               it is essential to a proper
               consideration of Charter issues....
               Charter decisions cannot be based upon
               the unsupported hypotheses of
               enthusiastic counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Later [in the MacKay v. Manitoba case],
          Cory J. stated, at p. 366:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    A factual foundation is of
               fundamental importance on this appeal.
               It is not the purpose of the legislation
               which is said to infringe the Charter
               but its effects.  If the deleterious
               effects are not established there can be
               no Charter violation and no case has
               been made out.  Thus the absence of a
               factual base is not just a technicality
               that could be overlooked, but rather it
               is a flaw that is fatal to the
               appellant's position.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This is not to say that such facts must
          be established in all Charter challenges.
          Each case must be considered on its own facts
          (or lack thereof).  As Beetz J. pointed out
          in Manitoba (Attorney General) v.
          Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110
          at 133:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               There may be rare cases where the
               question of constitutionality will
               present itself as a simple question of
               law alone which can be finally settled
               by a motion judge.  A theoretical
               example which comes to mind is one where
               Parliament or a legislature would
               purport to pass a law imposing the
               beliefs of a state religion.  Such a law
               would violate s. 2(a) of the Canadian
               Charter of Rights and Freedoms, could
               not possibly be saved under s. 1 of the
               Charter, and might perhaps be struck
               down right away; see Attorney General of
               Quebec v. Quebec Association of
               Protestant School Boards, [1984] 2
               S.C.R. 66, at p. 88.  It is trite to say
               that these cases are exceptional.
               [Emphasis is Cory J.'s.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The unconstitutional purpose of
          Beetz J.'s hypothetical law is found on the
          face of the legislation, and requires no
          extraneous evidence to flesh it out.  It is
          obvious that this is not one of those
          exceptional cases.  In general, any Charter
          challenge based upon allegations of the
          unconstitutional effects of impugned
          legislation must be accompanied by admissible
          evidence of the alleged effects.  In the
          absence of such evidence, the courts are left
          to proceed in a vacuum, which, in
          constitutional cases as in nature, has always
          been abhorred.  As Morgan put it, op. cit.,
          at p. 162: &quot;... the process of constitutional
          litigation remains firmly grounded in the
          discipline of the common law methodology.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This case is not one of these exceptional cases where the law, on

its face, violates one of the fundamental freedoms.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[87] It therefore becomes clear upon considering the merits of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the application that the appellant has failed to present a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serious issue of invalidity in so far as it is based on s. 2 of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the s. 8 claim are so weak that the same result should probably</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant has succeeded in raising a serious issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">invalidity with respect to that aspect of the application since I</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[89] As discussed above, standing should be granted in those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situations where it is necessary to ensure that the legislation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is not immune from constitutional challenge. To repeat the words</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Cory J. in Canadian Council of Churches, &quot;The granting of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public interest standing is not required when, on a balance of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to attack by a private litigant&quot; (at p. 252).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[90] In this case, a challenge to the impugned provisions was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made on the basis of s. 8 of the Charter in R. v. Atwal. By</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority decision, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutional validity of the legislation. In fact, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant on appeal urged this court to adopt the reasoning of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dissenting judge in Atwal and the respondent urged this court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to follow the majority.  It would appear from the motions judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons that the argument followed essentially the same course in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first instance. He ultimately ruled as follows (8 O.R. (3d) at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">327-28):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is the respondent's position that Atwal v.
          Canada, supra, is binding on all designated
          judges and therefore there is no need for
          this court to entertain a similar challenge
          to this Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In summation, the object of this Act is
          not law enforcement, and therefore the
          standard set out in Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
          supra, with respect to statute-authorized
          searches does not necessarily apply; yet,
          upon reviewing ss. 21 through 26, the statute
          meets the four minimum criteria set out in
          Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra. Moreover, the
          Federal Court of Appeal in Atwal v.Canada has
          held that the Act meets the criteria set out
          in Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra. It is to be
          concluded that a statute-authorized search
          under the Act would be reasonable. Therefore,
          the Act does not infringe the right to be
          free from unreasonable search and seizure.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">To grant standing in this case is to create a duplication which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can hardly be said to be a wise allocation of limited judicial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resources.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[91] Further, the scant evidentiary basis in this case raises</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other concerns referred to by L'Heureux-Dubé J. in Hy and Zel's.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A comparison of the factual basis in Atwal with the scant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjudicative facts alleged in this case confirms that better use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can usually be made of the judicial process to decide live issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between parties as opposed to hypothetical ones. In Atwal, CSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involvement was clearly established. An actual warrant had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained and executed pursuant to the Act. Clearly, the impugned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions of the Act were engaged. In this case, a mere</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suspicion was raised that CSIS was involved. Many facts would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have to be presumed before an intelligible debate on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutionality of the section could be engaged in. The scant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidentiary basis does not allow the issues to be fully</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">canvassed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[92] Hence, again here, a consideration of the merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application makes it clear that, in so far as the application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged a s. 8 violation, the motions judge erred in finding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Amost reasonable and effective manner in which the issues can</font></pre>
