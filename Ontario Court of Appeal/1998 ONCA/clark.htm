    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>OSBORNE J.A.:</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants Debbie Clark and John Baker, by application
under Rule 22, sought to be relieved from the City of
Peterborough Public Utilities Commission's (&quot;PUC&quot;) requirements
that they post security deposits, failing which their supply of
electrical power would be disconnected. Their application was
heard by Howden J. and Ms. Clark and Mr. Baker now appeal from
his order. In my opinion, their appeal should be quashed as moot.
My reasons for reaching that conclusion are set out below.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellants were recipients of social assistance in June
1991 when they each were required, as tenants, to provide the
City of Peterborough PUC with security deposits. In Ms. Clark's
case, the PUC required a security deposit of $312 by June 26,
1991. In June of 1991, Ms. Clark's utility bill was not in
arrears. In Mr. Baker's case, the PUC required a security deposit
of $573. One-half of it had to be paid by the end of September
1991, and the other one-half by the end of October 1991. Mr.
Baker asked for more time to pay the security deposit, however,
his request was denied. Mr. Baker had on one occasion not paid a
PUC account of $112. When informed of this unpaid account, he
paid it immediately. The debt, however, became an official part
of his PUC-related payment history.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In September 1991, Ms. Clark applied for relief from payment
of the PUC security deposit and in November 1991 Mr. Baker
brought a similar application. Both appellants sought and
obtained an interim injunction to restrain the PUC from
disconnecting their services for failure to pay the security
deposit that the Peterborough PUC had demanded of them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Before Howden J., the appellants attacked the PUC security
deposit policy on two fronts. First, they contended that it was
not authorized by s. 50(4) of the Public Utilities Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. P.52. The appellants did not mount a Charter challenge
in respect of the security deposit provisions of the Public
Utilities Act. They simply took the position that the security
deposit required of Ms. Clark and Mr. Baker was not authorized by
s. 50(4) of the Public Utilities Act. Section 50(4) provided:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             (4) Any corporation before supplying any
          public utility to any person or to any
          building or premises, or as a condition of
          continuing to supply the utility, may require
          any consumer to give reasonable security for
          the payment of the proper charges therefor or
          for carrying the public utility into the
          building or premises.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  Second, the appellants contended that the applicable
security deposit policy violated their constitutional rights
under ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The
appellants contend that extracting a PUC security deposit from
three classes of consumers -- recipients of social assistance,
single mothers and the &quot;poor&quot; -- constitutes a breach of ss. 7
and 15 of the Charter. The appellants were recipients of social
assistance at relevant times.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Howden J. concluded that the appellant's Charter claims were
without merit. He concluded that the PUC's security deposit
policy and the PUC's request for a security deposit from Ms.
Clark and Mr. Baker were not authorized by s. 50(4) of the Public
Utilities Act. He granted Mr. Baker an injunction restraining the
PUC from cutting off the supply of hydro to his premises for non-
payment of the requested security deposit, until the PUC
developed a new security deposit policy. In his extensive
reasons, Howden J. set out the factors that he thought should
inform a security deposit policy that would meet the requirements
of s. 50(4) of the Public Utilities Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Ms. Clark's application was dismissed since she had moved
from the City of Peterborough before the application was heard
and she was, therefore, no longer affected, in any way, by the
PUC's security deposit policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Howden J. considered the issue of mootness of the
appellants' application because of amendments to provincial and
municipal social assistance programs known as Community Start-Up
Benefits and the changed situation of both appellants. When
dealing with this issue he noted that Ms. Clark had moved from
the City of Peterborough and that she had stated in her cross-
examination on her affidavit that she had no intention of
returning to Peterborough. He also took account of the fact that
the evidence that Mr. Baker had moved from the house he was
renting when the security deposit was demanded of him and when
the PUC was enjoined from disconnecting his service for non-
payment of the requested deposit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The motions judge held that Ms. Clark's application was moot
since there was an absence of any controversy between her and the
PUC. He held that Mr. Baker's application was not moot. His
conclusion was based on evidence that, although Mr. Baker was not
subject to the Peterborough PUC security deposit policy, on some
subsequent move he might be subject to the policy once again.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In addition, the motions judge concluded that he should
exercise his discretion in hearing &quot;these applications&quot; (although
he dismissed Ms. Clark's application and granted relief only to
Mr. Baker) because of the importance of the issue to those of
whom security deposits are requested, the various suppliers of
public utilities in Ontario and consumers who generally have to
subsidize those who do not pay public utility accounts leaving
uncollectible bad debts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] It is not necessary to consider whether Howden J. was
correct in concluding that Mr. Baker's appeal was not moot, and
whether he correctly exercised his discretion in hearing it. The
issue of mootness to which I direct my comments is not whether
the application was moot, but whether the appeal is moot. In my
view, it is.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The core issue raised in the application and dealt with by
the motions judge was the validity of the PUC's security deposit
policy and its application to the appellants. Howden J. concluded
that the relevant security deposit policy was not valid. The PUC
was restrained from discontinuing the supply of electricity to
the appellant Baker's household because of non-payment of the
security deposit &quot;... until the respondent, Peterborough
Utilities Commission, adopts criteria to give necessary policy
direction to its staff to determine what is satisfactory payment
history and what forms of security are reasonable.&quot; The motions
judge went on to declare that, &quot;... new security deposits may not
be required by the respondent, Peterborough Utilities Commission,
until such time as it adopts criteria as aforesaid.&quot;  Thus, Mr.
Baker was successful on his application. He succeeded in
obtaining an effective remedy. See Nanoose Indian Band et al. v.
British Columbia et al. (1995), 57 B.C.A.C. 117 (B.C.C.A.).
Ms. Clark was not successful since she had moved from
Peterborough after her proceeding began, but before her
application was heard. In result, the PUC security deposit policy
in issue had no application to her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Mr. Anand, in his forceful submissions on the mootness
issue, emphasized that the dismissal of Ms. Clark's application
affords a basis to raise the s. 7 and s. 15 Charter issues on
appeal. I see no merit in this submission. As I have said, Ms.
Clark's application was correctly dismissed because it was moot.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The PUC accepted the motions judge's judgment and quickly
prepared a new security deposit policy. In doing so it intended
to comply with the directions contained in Howden J.'s judgment.
Whether the new security deposit policy is valid is not an issue
before us. It has been in existence since July 25, 1995, and we
were told during oral argument that it has not been challenged.
In any case, its validity must be determined, if it is going to
be determined, in another proceeding where there is a factual
basis for any attack made upon it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] This appeal is from Howden J.'s judgment, not his reasons.
See Fountain v. Parsons (1994), 92 B.C.L.R. (2d) 358 at 365
(B.C.C.A.) and Minielly et al. v. Kristjanson et al. (1990), 82
Sask. R. 298 at 299, 301-303 (Sask. Q.B.) and Canadian Express
Ltd. v. Blair (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 212 (Div. Ct.). What Mr. Baker
purports to do is to appeal, notwithstanding the fact that he was
successful below in his attack upon the PUC's security deposit
policy. He seeks to appeal because he would have preferred to
succeed for different reasons, that is on Charter grounds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Both appellants had moved away from Peterborough by the time
their application was heard. Thus, the new PUC security deposit
policy is not relevant to either of them. Moreover, courts should
only rule on constitutional issues when it is necessary to do so.
Sopinka J. made this clear in Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission
of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97 at
111:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This court has said on numerous occasions
          that it should not decide issues of law that
          are not necessary to a resolution of an
          appeal. This is particularly true with
          respect to constitutional issues and the
          principle applies with even greater emphasis
          in circumstances in which the foundation upon
          which the proceedings were launched has
          ceased to exist. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
See also The Queen in Right of Manitoba v. Air Canada, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 303; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1
S.C.R. 357 at 383.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] For these reasons, I would quash the appeal without costs.
