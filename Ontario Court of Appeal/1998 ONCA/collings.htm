    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  We heard submissions on one point only and that was the
propriety of the trial judge's instruction to the jury with
respect to the issue of reasonable doubt. She told them in her
original charge that a reasonable doubt was &quot;one that if you ask
yourself 'Why do I doubt?' you can formulate an answer based on
reason.&quot; The jury was clearly troubled by the expression for
after deliberating for some time they asked to be reinstructed on
its meaning. In complying with their request the trial judge
repeated her original explanation. That explanation, this court
has ruled in Ford, Jenkins and other cases, is reversible error.
As we read the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Lifchus, these decisions have not been overruled or even
disapproved of. The authority of this court's decisions on this
issue is thus unaffected by Lifchus. The charge was erroneous
and, on authority, fatally so.</font></pre>
