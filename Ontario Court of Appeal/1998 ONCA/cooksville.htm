    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  On the state of the record, there is, in our view, a genuine
issue of credibility with respect to the appellant's claim that
his cheque for $22,000, dated September 20, 1991, was given and
accepted in full satisfaction of his debt to the respondent. This
was not an issue which could properly be determined, as the
motions judge purported to do, on the state of the material
before the court. There was evidence in the record that, if
believed, supported the appellant's position and the material did
not justify an adverse finding of credibility against him that
had the effect of foreclosing him from asserting that position.

[2]  The appeal is allowed, the order under appeal is set aside,
and an order will go setting aside the default judgment against
the appellant and permitting him to deliver a statement of
defence by not later than September 29, 1998. The appellant will
pay to the respondent the costs thrown away, up to and including
the motion to set aside the default judgment, forthwith after the
assessment of such costs. There will be no costs of the appeal,
for or against either of the parties.</font></pre></td>
