</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal from the decision of Farley J. with

respect to his answer to one of the questions asked of the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the respondent, the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Olympia &amp; York Developments Limited (“OYDL”). The question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned the effect of what is referred to as a “principal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debtor clause” in two agreements of guarantee. The issue is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether Farley J. correctly interpreted and applied the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Cory J. in Manulife Bank of Canada v. Conlin (1996), 139</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">D.L.R. (4th) 426 (S.C.C.).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The background is that OYDL required credit and banking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities. It arranged this by guaranteeing loans to a wholly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owned subsidiary company which were also secured by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee of another wholly owned subsidiary company, Olympia &amp;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">York Resources Corporation (“Resources”), which also pledged the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlling shares of Abitibi-Price Inc. (“Abitibi”) and Gulf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada Resources Corp. (“Gulf”), which it owned.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Briefly, the facts were that the borrower, Olympia &amp; York</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Resources Credit Corp., borrowed 2.5 billion US dollars from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Euro-lenders (the “lenders”), represented in this application by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Credit Lyonais (“CL”). The borrower was a company wholly owned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by OYDL. OYDL guaranteed the loan, as did Resources, a company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wholly owned by the borrower.  The Resources guarantee was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secured by a pledge of the controlling shares in Abitibi  &amp;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Gulf. The OYDL guarantee was unsecured. When the borrower</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defaulted, Resources delivered the shares pledged as security to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lenders. The lenders sold some of the shares and realized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about 1.5 billion US dollars. The sum realized was applied to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reduce the debt. It was less than one half of the amount then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owing. OYDL subsequently went bankrupt. CL, for the lenders,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimed in the estate, relying on OYDL’s guarantee of the debt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The question asked by the Trustee was: in filing their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proof of claim in the estate of OYDL, were the lenders required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to deduct the sum they had actually received from the sale of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stock pledged to secure the Resources guarantee prior to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proof of claim? The answer to the question affects the recovery</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the unsecured creditors of OYDL. We were told that, if the

proceeds from the sale of the shares constituted a payment made

by a principal debtor, then it must be taken into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account for the purpose of the claim and participation in any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dividend paid by the estate OYDL. On the other hand, if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds constituted payment by a guarantor, then, for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose of the claim, it is not taken into account, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results in the creditor being entitled to a larger participation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in any dividend, provided that the creditor’s recovery is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited to the amount of the debt that is outstanding -- one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hundred cents on the dollar. See Re Houlder, [1929] 1 Ch. 205.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  After considering the relevant provisions of the agreements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and following the judgment Cory J. in Manulife v. Conlin, supra,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Farley J. held that the lenders were obligated to deduct</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of claim in the estate of OYDL because Resources was a party</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2. Guarantees: The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
          and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual
          payment to the Lenders of all present and future
          obligations now or at any time or from time to time
          hereafter due or owing to the Lenders by or from the
          Borrower arising under the Loan Agreement including,
          without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
          principal amount of the Advance from time to time
          outstanding thereunder, interest thereon and any and
          all other amounts payable by the Borrower to the
          Lenders in connection therewith (such obligations
          being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
          “Obligations”). Without prejudice to the Agent or any
          Lenders’ rights against the Borrower as principal
          debtor, the Guarantor shall, as between the Agent and
          each of the Lenders on the one hand and the Guarantor
          on the other, be deemed principal debtor in respect of
          its obligations hereunder and not merely surety.
          Accordingly, the Guarantor shall not be discharged nor
          shall its liability be affected by any act, thing,
          omission or means whatsoever which would not have
          discharged it or affected its liability if it had been
          principal debtor. The Guarantor also agrees to pay all
          reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lenders
          in enforcing their rights hereunder. The Guarantor
          hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand
          of payment on the Borrower, protest or other notice or
          formalities to the Borrower of any kind whatsoever.

[7]  The agreement entitled “Guarantee”, between OYDL, as</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant’s position is that where there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are co-guarantors for the same principal debt, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditor is not required in its claim against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estate of one of them to give credit for any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amounts paid by the other. It is entitled to claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the full amount of the debt guaranteed, provided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that no more than one hundred cents on the dollar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is recovered. It concedes that payments made by or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on behalf of the principal debtor must be taken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into account, but contends that neither Resources,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nor OYDL, was intended to be considered a principal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debtor for this purpose.  The appellant submits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Farley J. erred in concluding that the effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of language used in the Resources Guarantee was to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal purposes as principal debtors rather than as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantors or sureties. It contends that the true</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regard to the use of words of limitation in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement and considering the principal debtor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clause in the context of the agreement as a whole.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant submits that, when viewed in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way, it is clear that the true purpose of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clause was to ensure the lenders’ recovery by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precluding the co-guarantor from any defence that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">might be available to it as a guarantor or mere</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surety. The appellant’s submission is that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are other words in the agreement that must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered in determining the relationship between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties. They contend that these words show</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the characterization of Resources as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal debtor was for a limited purpose, and was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not intended to benefit either OYDL or Resources in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances of bankruptcy.


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The respondent submits that the motions judge construed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clause correctly. Thus, since the lender received payment from a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party whom it agreed to treat as a principal debtor, it must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">give credit for the amount so received in its proof of claim,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">even though the agreement provides that the lender may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate the payment as it sees fit. Similarly, a creditor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must deduct what is received from one of two principal debtors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from its claim against the other.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The respondent relies on the judgment in Manulife v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conlin, supra.  In that case, the issue was whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantors were bound by their guarantee where an extension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement had been entered into without their knowledge. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court held that they were not so bound and an appeal from that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision failed.   The bank made a loan by way of mortgage. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantees were contained in, and were a part of, the mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">document, which had been drawn by the bank.  In the guarantee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clause, the guarantors covenanted to pay as principal debtors.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The relevant portion of the clause provided as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          … in consideration of the making of the said loan
          by the mortgagee do hereby Y covenant, promise and
          agree as principal debtors and not as sureties, 
          that we and each of us shall well and truly pay or
          cause to be paid to the mortgagee, the principal 
          sum and all other moneys hereby secured, together 
          with interest -- in the manner set forth in this
          mortgage.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Cory J. commented upon the principal debtor clause as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Patel (1990),
72 O.R. (2d) 109 (H.C.), at 119, it was held that a principal
debtor clause converts a guarantor into a full-fledged principal
debtor. If the guarantor is to be treated as a principal debtor
and not as a guarantor, then the failure of the bank to notify
the respondent of the renewal agreement and the new terms of the
contract must release him from his obligations since he is not a
party to the renewal. This conclusion does not require recourse
to equitable rules regarding material variation of contracts of
surety. It is simply apparent from the contract that a principal
debtor must have notice of material changes and consent to them.
Of course, a guarantor who, by virtue of a principal debtor
clause, has a right to notice of material changes, may, by the
terms of the contract, waive these rights. However, in the
absence of a clear waiver of these rights, such a guarantor must
be given notice of the material changes and, if he is to be
bound, consent to them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant contended that the words in clause 34 which
provide “the said guarantors Y covenant, promise and agree as
principal debtors and not as sureties” indicate that the
respondent is bound as a principal debtor yet without any of the
usual rights and benefits of a principal debtor such as notice
with regard to renewal, and the opportunity to negotiate and
consent to its terms. To take this position seems to be unfair
and unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The mortgagor as a principal debtor must be given notice of the
renewal agreement. This is evident from the requirement that the
mortgagor sign the renewal agreement. The principal debtor
clause converts the guarantor into a full-fledged principal
debtor with all the duties and obligations which that term
implies. If the guarantor is to be responsible to the lending
institution as a “full-fledged principal debtor” then he or she
is entitled to the same notice of a renewal agreement as the
principal debtor mortgagor. That is undoubtedly the reason the
standard form of the renewal agreement provides a place for the
guarantor to sign. Not just fairness and equity but the
designation of the guarantor as a principal debtor leads to the
conclusion that the guarantor must have notice of and agree to
the renewal before he is bound by its terms. A guarantor reading
clause 34 would be led to believe that as a principal debtor he
would have the same notice of a renewal agreement as would the
principal debtor mortgagor. If a lending institution wishes to
have the guarantor obligated as a principal debtor, then the
guarantor must be entitled to the same rights as the principal
debtor which would include both notice and agreement as a party
to renewal. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The words of each clause of the agreement must be given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their ordinary meaning. However, the meaning and effect of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal debtor clause must be considered in the context of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement and in the context of the intentions of the parties as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">revealed by the documents; that is, the intention of OYDL to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtain the use of monies and credit, and the intention of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lenders to ensure the liability of, and payment by, OYDL and its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">companies of the debt. We do not interpret anything said by Cory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. as being to the contrary.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The submission of the appellant seems to come down to this.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Resources’ agreement is called &quot;Resources Guarantee&quot;. Resources</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is referred to throughout the agreement as &quot;the Guarantor&quot; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">signed it as such. Having regard to these facts and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenants, the substance of the agreement was a guarantee, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the principal debtor clause does not change this, or change the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general character of the guarantor. The parties agreed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited purpose of the principal debtor clause when they agreed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the clause was without prejudice to the lenders’ rights</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against others. Furthermore, the principal debtor clause is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different than the one found in the case dealt with by Cory J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In that case, the appellants expressly covenanted to pay as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal debtors. In this case, the guarantor is deemed to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal debtor, but for a limited purpose -- the performance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if its obligations. It is as though there is another or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional character, which is the deemed one. In these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, particularly if there is any ambiguity, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clause should be interpreted so as to be most consistent with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the substance of the agreement and the respective characters of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties. If this approach is followed, then Resources’</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterization as principal debtor -- for the purpose of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance of its obligations -- is merely to ensure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance may be enforced and that Resources would have no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence available to it as guarantor, just as is provided in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence following the principal debtor clause.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] However, in my opinion, the specific wording of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal debtor clause is unambiguous. In the performance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its obligations, Resources is deemed a principal debtor. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deemed characterization of Resources as principal debtor defined</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relationship between the parties for the stated purpose. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances, performance by Resources of its obligations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the guarantee and the realization on the sale of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares should be regarded as payment by a principal debtor to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lender and treated accordingly by the lender when claiming</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the estate of OYDL. Resources’ liability to the lenders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was real and substantial and there is no reason to permit the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lender to treat Resources other than as principal debtor as they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had agreed to do. Nor should there be any limitation inferred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of the word “accordingly” in the sentence which follows.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It simply indicated an important consequence of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterization and was not exclusive of any other possible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequence. While the words of the clause differ from those in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the clause in the case before Cory J., there was no reason to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinguish this case on this issue. In the circumstances, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think Farley J. was right in following and applying the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Cory J.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In disposing of the matter, Farley J. said, after referring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the above passage from the judgment of Cory J.:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It would seem to me that this treatment of their being
a principal debtor means that A&amp;G and OYDL cannot be regarded as
a guarantor or surety within the analysis of In Re Houlder,
[1929] 1 Ch. 205 and the analysis of Houlden &amp; Morawetz,
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (3rd ed. Looseleaf,
para. G-29-1). Rather they are to be treated as principal
debtors.


[16] I think that I should add that, as the case was put to us,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this result is fair. It is dictated by the language of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement. Moreover, the result that flows will not adversely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affect the interests of third parties, the unsecured creditors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of OYDL.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] I would dismiss the appeal. As no submissions were made as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to costs, the parties are to make submissions in writing within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">15 days of the date of release of these reasons.
