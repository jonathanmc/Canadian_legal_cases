GOUDGE J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  For many years the Town of Ajax contracted with Charterways
Transportation Limited to provide it with the skilled drivers and
the limited number of mechanics and cleaners needed to operate
the town transit system.  These people were employees of
Charterways and were represented in their collective bargaining
with their employer by the appellant Union, CAW - Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  As of January 1, 1993 the Town determined that it would take
back the operation of its transit system.  It cancelled its
contract with Charterways and hired its own drivers, mechanics
and cleaners.  The vast majority of those hired by the Town came
from that group of Charterways employees who had previously been
operating the transit system for the Town.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Union sought to preserve its bargaining rights by
seeking a declaration that these circumstances constituted the
sale of a business within the meaning of s. 64, the successor
rights provision of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. L.2, as amended.  The Ontario Labour Relations Board granted
the declaration.  On the judicial review application brought by
the Town,  the Divisional Court quashed the Board's decision
finding it to be patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  For the reasons that follow I disagree.  In my opinion the
Board's decision cannot be said to be patently unreasonable.  I
would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the application for
judicial review.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Like all provincial labour acts the Ontario Labour Relations
Act contains a successorship provision whose purpose is to
protect the permanence of bargaining rights when a business or a
part of a business is sold or transferred from one employer to
another.1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  That provision is s. 64.  For the purposes of this appeal
the relevant parts of that section are as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          64(1)  In this section,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                 &quot;business&quot; includes one or more parts
                 of a business;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                 &quot;predecessor employer&quot; means an
                 employer who sells his, her or its
                 business;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                 &quot;sells&quot; includes leases, transfers
                 and any other manner of disposition;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                 &quot;successor employer&quot; means an
                 employer to whom the predecessor
                 employer sells the business.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          64(1.1)This section applies when a
          predecessor employer sells a business
                 to a successor employer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          64(2)  If the predecessor employer is bound
                 by a collective agreement, the
                 successor employer is bound by it as
                 if the successor employer were the
                 predecessor employer, until the Board
                 declares otherwise.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The task faced by the Board in this case was to determine
whether on the facts as it found them there had been a &quot;sale&quot; of
a &quot;business&quot; for the purposes of this section.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The parties to this litigation all agree that in reviewing
the decision of the Board the court should apply the standard of
patent unreasonableness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In my opinion, this is clearly the appropriate standard of
review.  The Act provides two privative clauses that apply to all
Board decisions.  They are ss. 108(1) and 110:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               108.(1) The Board has exclusive
          jurisdiction to exercise the powers conferred
          upon it by or under this Act and to determine
          all questions of fact or law that arise in
          any matter before it, and the action or
          decision of the Board thereon is final and
          conclusive for all purposes, but nevertheless
          the Board may at any time, if it considers it
          advisable to do so, reconsider any decision,
          order, direction, declaration or ruling made
          by it and vary or revoke any such decision,
          order, direction, declaration or ruling.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               110.   No decision, order, direction,
          declaration or ruling of the Board shall be
          questioned or reviewed in any court, and no
          order shall be made or process entered, or
          proceedings taken in any court, whether by
          way of injunction, declaratory judgment,
          certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo
          warranto, or otherwise, to question, review,
          prohibit or restrain the Board or any of its
          proceedings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In addition, the legislature has seen fit to provide a
privative clause specifically applicable to the kind of decision
rendered by the Board in this case.  It is found in s. 64(12):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (12)  Where, on any application under
          this section or in any other proceeding
          before the Board, a question arises as to
          whether a business has been sold by one
          employer to another, the Board shall
          determine the question and its decision is
          final and conclusive for the purposes of this
          Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In interpreting and applying s. 64 the Board is engaged in
one of those tasks that most obviously engages its specialized
expertise, namely the determination of whether the labour
relations obligations of one employer pass to another employer.
It is appropriate that a reviewing court approach the Board's
decision on such a question with firm curial deference.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Hence, a reviewing court must ask itself no more than
whether the Board's decision is patently unreasonable.  In Canada
(Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, [1993] 1
S.C.R. 941 at 963-64, Cory J. elaborated this test as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It is said that it is difficult to know
          what &quot;patently unreasonable&quot; means.  What is
          patently unreasonable to one judge may be
          eminently reasonable to another.  Yet any
          test can only be defined by words, the
          building blocks of all reasons.  Obviously,
          the patently unreasonable test sets a high
          standard of review.  In the Shorter Oxford
          English Dictionary &quot;patently&quot;, an adverb, is
          defined as &quot;openly, evidently, clearly&quot;.
          &quot;Unreasonable&quot; is defined as &quot;[n]ot having
          the faculty of reason; irrational. ... Not
          acting in accordance with reason or good
          sense&quot;.  Thus, based on the dictionary
          definition of the words &quot;patently
          unreasonable&quot;, it is apparent that if the
          decision the Board reached, acting within its
          jurisdiction, is not clearly irrational, that
          is to say evidently not in accordance with
          reason, then it cannot be said that there was
          a loss of jurisdiction.  This is clearly a
          very strict test.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] If the approach taken by the Board is a reasonable one, that
is if it is rationally supportable, and if the decision gives to
the section of the Act a meaning which the words of the statute
can reasonably bear, that decision will not be disturbed on
review.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE BOARD'S DECISION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] I turn then to the principal findings made by the Board in
the decision that is to be subjected to this standard of review.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The Board found that from 1977 to the end of 1992
Charterways contracted to supply the Town with the skilled
workforce needed to operate its transit system.  Charterways
recruited, hired, trained, disciplined, scheduled and deployed
the team of drivers and the small number of mechanics and
cleaners needed by the transit system.  The appellant Union held
collective bargaining rights for this group of Charterways
employees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The contract between Charterways and the Town made clear the
importance of the continuity and stability of this workforce.
Among other things, this helped make the drivers familiar and
identifiable to the riding public.  In the language of the
contract, Charterways undertook that &quot;the same vehicle operators
will be regularly assigned to the Transit System to ensure route
familiarity, system continuity, and allow passenger recognition&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] When Ajax terminated this contract as of December 31, 1992
Charterways had no comparable employment to offer the group of
employees who had been working on the Ajax transit contract.
However, in taking back this operation the Town conducted its
hiring so as to achieve substantial continuity in the workforce
operating its transit system.  Twenty-three of the thirty drivers
hired and three of the four cleaner and maintenance personnel
hired had previously performed that work for Charterways on its
Ajax contract.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Given these circumstances the Board concluded as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...[T]he business [of Charterways] was
          primarily carried on through the utilization
          of an identifiable employee complement
          skilled in the operation of the Ajax Transit
          System that, through its efforts over the
          years, it had recruited, trained and co-
          ordinated.  Particularly bearing in mind the
          operational requirement that the employee
          complement remain stable, the work force
          engaged by Charterways can be considered its
          most valuable asset.  Given its centrality to
          its operation, then, we conclude it
          constitutes a distinguishing &quot;part&quot; of its
          business.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In summary, we are satisfied that by
          acquiring the substantial part of the work
          force previously employed by Charterways to
          perform its obligations under its contract
          with the Town, the Town transferred to itself
          an essential element of that business.
          Consequently, we conclude that in so doing,
          Charterways and the Town have transacted a
          sale of part of a business within the meaning
          of section 64 of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The issue on this appeal is whether the Divisional Court was
correct in finding this conclusion to be patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Before the Divisional Court, the Town attempted to introduce
an affidavit designed to demonstrate that there was no evidence
before the Board that this skilled work force could be considered
the most valuable asset of Charterways' business for Ajax or that
it was essential to the continued operation of the transit
system.  The Divisional Court declined to admit the affidavit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] On appeal, the Town renewed its request.  In my view, the
Divisional Court was right to reject the affidavit.  The factual
inferences drawn by the Board were amply supported by the
evidence adduced, particularly the history of the dealings
between Charterways and Ajax, the language of the contract
between them, and the hiring carried out by the Town.  This is
not a &quot;no evidence&quot; case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] However, the Divisional Court did conclude that the Board's
decision was patently unreasonable in two respects.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] First, the Divisional Court found that it was patently
unreasonable to conclude that in the circumstances of this case
there was a sale or transfer.  The Court put its point this way:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...[O]ther than terminating their employment
          because, as the Board found, Charterways had
          &quot;no comparable employment to offer&quot; to the
          employees in question, nothing occurred
          between Ajax and Charterways which can be
          reasonably said to have caused a &quot;sale,
          transfer or other disposition&quot; of
          Charterways' &quot;business or a part thereof&quot;.
          Specifically there was no &quot;nexus&quot;, &quot;legal
          act&quot; or &quot;legal relations&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The fact that those employees whose
          employment was terminated by Charterways were
          &quot;convenient&quot; for the purposes of Ajax is not
          sufficient, in my view, to support a
          conclusion that Charterways &quot;relinquished&quot; or
          &quot;conveyed&quot; those employees to Ajax.  It is my
          opinion that the decision of the Board that
          the acquisition by those former employees of
          Charterways constituted a transaction of sale
          between them within the meaning of s. 64 of
          the Act, is &quot;so patently unreasonable that
          its construction cannot be rationally
          supported by the relevant legislation and
          demands intervention by the Court upon
          review&quot;, to adopt the words of Chief Justice
          Dickson.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In my opinion, the Divisional Court erred in this finding.
The conclusion that these facts constitute a sale as defined by
s. 64 is not &quot;clearly irrational&quot;.  It does not give the section
a patently unreasonable interpretation.  The statutory definition
is inclusive: &quot; 'sells' includes leases, transfers and any other
manner of disposition&quot;.  Because of the remedial purpose of
s. 64, namely the preservation of bargaining rights, this
definition is to be given a broad and liberal interpretation.
Moreover, it is not required that the transfer take any
particular legal form nor take place by way of a legal
transaction.  In W. W. Lester, supra, at 674-75, McLachlin J. put
it this way:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Ten of the labour acts have provisions
          similarly worded to s. 89 of the Newfoundland
          Act, referring to transactions such as sale,
          lease, transfer or disposition.  (The Quebec
          Act also contains a successorship provision
          but the section uses the phrase &quot;alienation
          or operation&quot;.)  Although the terms &quot;sale&quot;
          and &quot;lease&quot; may have restricted meanings, the
          words &quot;transfer&quot; and &quot;other disposition&quot; have
          been broadly interpreted to include several
          types of transactions, including exchange,
          gift, trust, take overs, mergers, and
          amalgamation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In keeping with the purpose of
          successorship provisionsCto protect the
          permanence of bargaining rightsClabour boards
          have interpreted &quot;disposition&quot; broadly to
          include almost any mode of transfer and have
          not relied on technical legal forms of
          business transactions.  As explained by the
          Ontario Board in United Steelworkers of
          America v. Thorco Manufacturing Ltd. (1965),
          65 CLLC &amp; 16,052, an expansive definition
          accords with the purpose of the sectionCto
          preserve bargaining rights regardless of the
          legal form of the transaction which puts
          bargaining rights in jeopardy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Notwithstanding the broad discretion in
          labour boards to determine whether or not the
          mode of disposition constitutes
          successorship, the fact remains that in
          virtually all jurisdictions something must be
          relinquished by the predecessor business on
          the one hand and obtained by the successor on
          the other to bring a case within the section.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Here, as a result of its contractual relationship with Ajax,
Charterways had developed a skilled and experienced group of
employees which operated the transit system for the Town.  This
was the business which Charterways carried on for Ajax.  When
Ajax terminated the contract, Charterways relinquished this work
force, most of which was then acquired by Ajax.  The nexus
between Charterways and the Town is the commercial history
without which the Town's acquisition of the work force would not
have occurred.  This acquisition represents a &quot;transfer&quot; to the
Town of that work force.  In my opinion, these factors provide a
reasonable basis for concluding that what happened here was a
sale or transfer within the meaning of s. 64 of the Act.  The
Board's conclusion to this effect is not patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Second, the Divisional Court found clearly irrational the
Board's conclusion that in taking on the employees in question
Ajax acquired a &quot;part&quot; of the business of Charterways within the
meaning of s. 64 of the Act.  It put its finding this way:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Quite apart from my own view of the
          effect or meaning of those provisions in the
          contract I cannot conclude in any event that
          they can reasonably lead to a finding that
          the employees hired by Ajax constituted a
          &quot;crucial&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; element of
          Charterways' business so as to constitute
          them as a &quot;part&quot; of Charterways' business in
          accordance with the gloss which has been
          placed on the provisions of s. 64 of the Act
          by the various decided cases, ....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] This conclusion is also in error in my view.  The Board
found that the scope of the business engaged in by Charterways
for Ajax consisted primarily of the provision of this skilled
work force to the Town and that therefore this work force could
be considered the most valuable asset of that business.  The
importance to the Town of the continuity and stability of this
work force is reflected in the terms of the contract between the
parties and in the results of the hiring done by the Town when it
took back the operation of the transit system.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] In essence, the Board found that what was transferred was
not just the work formerly done by the Charterways employees nor
the employees themselves.  There was the added value that came
with the continuity, experience and stability of this work force.
Hence, there was a reasonable basis for the finding that what was
transferred to Ajax was a significant part of the business which
Charterways conducted for Ajax.  This finding was not patently
unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Beyond the reasons offered by the Divisional Court, the
respondent argued that the result it reached was supported and
perhaps compelled by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
in U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048
[hereinafter &quot;Bibeault&quot;].  In my opinion, Bibeault springs from a
factual and legal context that is quite different from this case.
In Bibeault, the alleged successor employer acquired nothing more
than the work done by its predecessor.  It did not acquire any
employees, let alone a work force that had special value due to
its continuity.  The relevant legal provision did not have the
expansive definition of &quot;sells&quot; that appears in s. 64 of the Act.
Hence, the finding of the Supreme Court that, on the facts before
it, there was no successorship is of little use in this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] In summary, I conclude that the decision of the Divisional
Court cannot stand.  The conclusion of the Board that on the
facts before it there was the sale of a part of a business within
the meaning of s. 64 of the Act is a finding that is rationally
defensible.  Its decision cannot be said to be clearly irrational
or patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] I would allow the appeal and dismiss the application for
judicial review with costs to the appellant here and below
payable by the respondent Ajax.
