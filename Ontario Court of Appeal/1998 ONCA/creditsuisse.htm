    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Honourable Mr. Justice Day dated April 16, 1996.1 Day J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave judgment declaring that the respondent, Credit Suisse</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid to Credit Suisse.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Construction of the commercial premises at 1133 Yonge St.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been financed through a $7 million loan facility arranged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between Holdings, as Borrower, and Credit Suisse, as Lender. The</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Assignment&quot;) B was one of several security instruments executed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in connection with the loan transaction. The Assignment was duly</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">c. 375 (&quot;PPSA&quot;)2.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Under the Loan Commitment and the related security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">documentation, Holdings (the Borrower) was to make monthly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payments of $60,000 to Credit Suisse (the Lender) and the Lender</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was to hold these payments in an interest bearing account and was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to pay interest and principal payments out of that account. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lender had the right to call for an increase in such monthly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payments (although it never did). The excess funds in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account were called &quot;the Cash Collateral Account&quot;, and were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secured by a separate security interest in that account in favour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Credit Suisse. As well as this security, and the Assignment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mentioned above, Credit Suisse also held a first collateral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage on the Property.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Under the Assignment, Holdings assigned to Credit Suisse the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">full benefit and advantage of all existing and future leases,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including all rents. The Assignment was acknowledged to be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effective, present assignment. Paragraph 11 stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          11.  The Mortgagor (Holdings) acknowledges
          and agrees with the Mortgagee (Credit Suisse)
          that this assignment is an effective, present
          assignment, provided and it is expressly
          understood and agreed, anything herein
          contained to the contrary notwithstanding,
          that the Mortgagee shall not exercise any of
          the rights or powers herein conferred upon it

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Default under the Assignment was defined to include not only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defaults of varying kinds under the Assignment itself, but also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any default under the Property Mortgage or the Commitment Letter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Paragraph 7 of the Assignment is of central importance to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this proceeding. The pertinent part provides as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          7.   Until notified to the contrary in
          writing, the Mortgagor shall be entitled to,
          and the lessee under any lease shall pay to
          the Mortgagor, all rents and other amounts
          then due under such lease and thereafter
          accruing. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  From the inception of the transaction until the end of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November, 1994, all requisite payments of principal and interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were made. The parties operated on a pattern whereby all rents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were paid into a separate account from which expenses (and monies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to freshen up the Cash Collateral Account) were paid,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the surpluses were then paid out to accounts for the benefit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Holdings or its Owners.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The Loan matured on November 30, 1994 without being paid. On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 1, 1994 Credit Suisse made written demand for payment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and served notice of its intention to enforce its security, under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 244(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3, as amended. The Loan has been in default since that date.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  As at November 30, 1994, the approximate sum of $550,000 was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposited in accounts which could be traced from such net rental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds. The monies are held in trust either for Holdings or for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its several Owners (as some payments have been made to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders who, in turn have given directions as to the funds).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It is these amounts, plus interest, which are at issue on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal. A December 1994 Surplus of approximately $100,000 is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">longer at issue, since it is conceded that it represented monies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid after default had occurred.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] On the argument before Day J. much attention was paid to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question whether the concept of crystallization continues to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apply to securities granted under the PPSA.  Credit Suisse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argued, as it does here, that crystallization has no application,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that their security interest B having attached and been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perfected under the PPSA legislation B was fully enforceable,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, further, that the security extended not simply to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original collateral (the rents) but also to the proceeds of that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collateral (its various traceable forms in other bank accounts).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Day J. reviewed the law regarding the crystallization question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and concluded, correctly, that the concept of crystallization is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant under the PPSA regime. Appellate jurisprudence has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmed the correctness of that decision: see, Canadian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Otto Timm Enterprises Ltd. (1995),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">26 O.R. (3d) 724 (C.A.); Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corp. (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Subsection 11(2) of the PPSA stipulates that attachment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occurs under the Act when the three elements set out in that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsection have been satisfied &quot;unless the parties have agreed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">postpone the time for attachment&quot;. Having concluded that Credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Suisse had an attached and perfected security interest in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rents following registration of the Assignment on January 22,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1987, Day J. commented3 that in his view the portion of clause 7</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Assignment which allows Holdings to deal with the rents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until default was not sufficient to establish a contrary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention that attachment would take place at another time. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided that Credit Suisse's statutory right to the rental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds existed &quot;independently of any entitlement Holdings had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to deal with the original rents&quot;4. In speaking of an entitlement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to deal with rents, it may be that Day J. also had in mind the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">language of subsection 25(1) of the PPSA, which was relied upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by counsel for Credit Suisse, too, and which states:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s. 25(1)  Where collateral gives rise to
          proceeds, the security interest therein,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  continues as to the collateral, unless
               the secured party expressly or impliedly
               authorized the dealing with the
               collateral (emphasis added); and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  extends to the proceeds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In my respectful view, Day J. erred in coming to these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusions. He misapprehended the combined effect of that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">portion of paragraph 7 of the Assignment cited above, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsection 9(1) of the PPSA.  Subsection 9(1) specifies:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          9(1) Except as otherwise provided by this or
          any other Act, a security agreement is
          effective according to its terms between the
          parties to it and against third parties.
          [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] By these provisions, the PPSA has preserved the principle of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">freedom of contract as between the parties in securities</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions, subject to any restrictions appearing in the PPSA</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There is nothing to override the freedom of contract principle in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Here, the parties have agreed by their contract that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Holdings &quot;shall be entitled to . . . the rents . . . due [under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Leases]&quot;, until notified to the contrary in writing, and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Credit Suisse &quot;shall not exercise any of the rights or powers . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">. conferred upon it until a default shall occur&quot;. The security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement itself, therefore, not only entitles the Borrower,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Holdings, to deal with the security prior to default B the rents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are the &quot;security&quot; in question under the Assignment B but it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitles Holdings to the security prior to such event.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The word &quot;entitlement&quot; must be given its plain and ordinary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning, namely, &quot;to give a rightful claim&quot;, or &quot;to give a right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or legal title&quot;. Black's Law Dictionary, (West Publishing Co.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Entitle. In its usual sense, to entitle is to
          give a right or legal title to.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Entitlement. Right to benefits, income or
          property which may not be abridged without
          due process.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Maxwell, 1959) says this with respect to &quot;entitle&quot; (p. 718):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In its usual sense, to entitle is to give a
          right; therefore a person is said to be
          entitled to property when he has a right to
          it.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Thus, in my view, to be &quot;effective in accordance with its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms&quot; the Assignment is to be interpreted in a fashion which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognizes the right of Holdings B during the currency of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Loan term and provided that the Borrower is not in default B to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">take for its own use and benefit the net rental proceeds from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leases. The effect of this is to discharge and release the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lender's security in such proceeds, i.e., with respect to that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;collateral&quot; and the &quot;proceeds&quot; of that collateral. The security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is discharged, however, only with respect to those amounts which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are paid over prior to default. It continues to be attached and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enforceable under the PPSA, and &quot;effective according to its terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the parties&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Day J. concluded that because Credit Suisse had an attached</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and perfected security interest in the rents as at January 22,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1987, that security interest extended to the proceeds of those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds, and to successive generations of proceeds, by virtue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsection 25(1)(b) of the PPSA, and that the Lender was entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to claim the funds which constitute the Surplus provided the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds were identifiable or traceable as proceeds of the rents.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In the end, he was satisfied that the funds could be traced, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he granted judgment accordingly.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The real question in these proceedings, however, is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Assignment by its terms enables the Lender retrospectively to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reach the net rental proceeds paid to Holdings during the loan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period but prior to default. For the reasons I have indicated, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do not think it does. While the security interest &quot;attaches&quot;,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the meaning of the PPSA, its &quot;effect&quot; is to permit the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Borrower to deal with the net rents for its own account until</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">default occurs and it is &quot;notified to the contrary in writing&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In short, the security interest of the Lender, insofar as it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attaches to the net rental proceeds, is released or discharged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to such proceeds once they are paid out to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Borrower in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Consequently, to the extent that the net rentals are discharged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon payment to the Borrower, the issue of whether attachment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perfection of the security causes the security to extend to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds of the collateral B which is what subsection 25(1) is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about B is not engaged, and the matter of identifying or tracing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the proceeds does not arise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Counsel for the respondent submitted that to interpret the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assignment in this fashion would be tantamount to re-introducing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the concepts of the floating charge and crystallization to PPSA</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collateral in various fashions B including dealing with it on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their own account B notwithstanding that the creditor's security</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not the purpose of the PPSA to render security transactions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inflexible or, indeed, to prevent the parties from agreeing to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security structures which may well accomplish the same kind of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protection that older forms of security B such as floating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charges B seek to provide. The purpose of the PPSA is to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establish and clarify priorities and notions of attachment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perfection which relate to the registration and operation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security instruments. What academics have suggested, and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">courts have confirmed, is that attempts to interpret the PPSA and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the regime it establishes in terms of the old forms of security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are not helpful, and that those old forms and their concepts do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not govern how the PPSA regime should unfold.  Professor McLaren</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">captures the tension between these two concepts in the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passage of his text, Secured Transactions in Personal Property in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada, 2nd ed. (Carswell), at pp. 2-37 and 2-38:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is no historical need or justification
          for carrying the concept (i.e. the floating
          charge concept) forward into the Act. The Act
          has created a flexible single security
          interest which can meet the needs of the
          business community as they arise. It should
          not be burdened with a concept designed to
          serve the needs of the financial community of
          the nineteenth century. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In each case, it is a matter of examining the terms of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security interest in question to determine what precisely are its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms as between the parties, because subsection 9(1) of the PPSA</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">makes it clear that the security instrument is only effective in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordance with those terms. There is nothing which prevents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial parties from negotiating terms which may, in practical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms, have similar commercial consequences to those encompassed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in older forms of security. Such flexibility is required.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  Indeed, to interpret the Assignment of Leases and Rents in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case in the fashion sought by the respondent might well lead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to commercial instability, in my view. Debtors who are entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under security instruments to take the collateral and deal with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it as their own pending default or notification to the contrary B</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and who do so B should not be subjected to the risk and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uncertainty of the funds representing the collateral or its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds being taken from them retrospectively at some time in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the future in the event that such a default occurs or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notification is given. Relying upon their right to utilize the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds, to take but one example, they might in turn have used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those funds B assuming they are not otherwise encumbered B as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security for other commercial transactions, or to purchase other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identifiable assets. I do not think that such authorized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions should be placed in jeopardy simply because of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">happenstance that the funds or proceeds remain in some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identifiable or traceable form and remain within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction. The situation becomes even less tenable when, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">here, the debtor pays out the funds to shareholders or other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">third parties but they, in turn, utilize the funds in a fashion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in which they remain identifiable or traceable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] I do not mean to suggest by these remarks that the nature of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a security instrument can be determined by the use which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debtor makes of the collateral. Collateral, or the proceeds of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collateral, which the security instrument is &quot;effective&quot; to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reach, continue to be caught by the security instrument and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be utilised by the debtor in a way that ignores the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security interest. Where, as here, however, the debtor is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to the collateral itself, subject to certain events</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occurring, and where the parties conduct themselves over the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period of the loan transaction in a fashion which acknowledges</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the debtor's right to use the funds representing the collateral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on its own account, circumstances of great commercial ambivalence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would exist if the lender were able at the end of the day to undo</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what had been done. At the very least, Credit Suisse is estopped</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from taking such a position in the circumstances of this case:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">PPSA, s. 72.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and vary the judgment</font></pre>
