    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge assessed the credibility of the appellant
based on what appears to have been his view that he was a bad
parent. The appellant permitted his daughter and his step-
daughter to spend unsupervised time with M.M., the father of his
step-daughter, when M.M. was precluded by a bail order from
associating with young persons. There was also evidence that the
appellant disciplined the two girls in a way that could be
considered as abusive. Having thus decided that the appellant was
a bad parent, he came to the conclusion that his evidence was not
believable. The use of this evidence to discredit the appellant
is, in our view, erroneous. The error is of such importance that
we consider a new trial to be warranted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appeal is allowed, the guilty verdict is set aside, and
a new trial is ordered.</font></pre></td>
