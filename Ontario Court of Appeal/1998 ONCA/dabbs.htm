    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">O'CONNOR J.A.</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These reasons deal with two motions. The first is a motion
by the representative plaintiff in this class proceeding, Paul
Dabbs, to quash an appeal brought by a class member, Jack
Maclean. The second is a motion by Maclean for leave to appeal.
THE MOTION TO QUASH</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Maclean seeks to appeal the judgment of Sharpe J. dated July
3, 1998 in which he ordered that this action be certified as a
class proceeding and that a settlement agreement entered into
between Dabbs and others as proposed representatives of the
plaintiff class and the defendant Sun Life Assurance Company of
Canada (&quot;Sun Life&quot;) be approved under s. 29 of the Class
Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the &quot;Act&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Maclean is a member of the class and had been permitted
under s. 14 of the Act to participate in the settlement approval
proceedings. He did not ask for and was not granted party status.
Maclean objected to the approval of the settlement, raising
essentially the same arguments as he makes in the material filed
with this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Sharpe J. rejected those arguments, approved the settlement
and found it to be fair, reasonable and in the best interest of
those affected by it. The courts in British Columbia and Quebec
have also approved the settlement agreement. In all, it affects
the interests of an estimated 400,000 class members across
Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Maclean's notice of appeal raises issues relating to
procedural rulings made by Sharpe J. and to the fairness and
adequacy of the settlement agreement. Dabbs moves under s. 134 of
the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, as amended, to
quash the appeal primarily on the basis that Maclean is not a
party to the proceeding and therefore has no standing to bring
the appeal. Sun Life supports the motion. For the reasons set out
below, I agree with their position.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  One of the objects of the Act is to achieve the efficient
handling of potentially complex cases of mass wrongs. See Abdool
et al. v. Anaheim Management Limited et al. (1995), 21 O.R. (3d)
453 (Div. Ct.), per O'Brien J. at p.455. This efficiency is
accomplished, in part, by the court appointment of one or more
class members under s. 5 to be representative plaintiffs or
defendants as the case may be. The criteria for appointment
include the ability to fairly and adequately represent the
interests of the class. A representative plaintiff or defendant
is a party to the proceeding and has the specific rights and
responsibilities for the carriage of the litigation on behalf of
the class that are set out in the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The Act makes a clear distinction between the role of a
party and that of a class member.1 Section 14 gives the court a
broad discretion to permit class members to participate in a
proceeding and to provide for the manner and terms upon which the
participation is permitted. Not surprisingly, s. 14 does not
provide that class members who are permitted to participate
thereby become parties to the proceeding. The section does not
restrict participation to those class members who are able to
fairly and adequately represent the class. Indeed, the court may
permit participation by those who oppose the manner in which the
party representing the class is conducting the proceeding and who
assert positions that differ from those of the majority of the
class. While the court may consider it useful to hear from these
class members and to permit them to participate in a limited
manner, it could frustrate the orderly and efficient management
of the proceeding if they became parties simply because of their
participation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  If class members are dissatisfied with the conduct of a
proceeding or do not wish to be bound by the result, they may opt
out under s. 9 and pursue their claims or defences in a personal
capacity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal in class
proceedings are set out in s. 30(3) of the Act. It provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          30.  (3) A party may appeal to the Court of
          Appeal from a judgment on common issues and
          from an order under section 24, other than an
          order that determines individual claims made
          by class members.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] These rights are conferred on parties. Section 30(5) permits
class members in certain circumstances to move for leave to act
as representative parties for purposes of bringing an appeal
under s. 30(3). It provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (5) If a representative party does not
          apapeal as permitted by subsection(3), or if
          a representative party abandons an appeal
          under subsection (3), any class member may
          make a motion to the Court of Appeal for
          leave to act as a representative party for
          the purposes of subsection 3.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Absent leave, class members have no standing to bring an appeal
to this court under the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Maclean is not a party to this proceeding. He did not apply
to be a representative plaintiff nor did he apply to intervene as
an added party under Rule 13.2 He participated in the settlement
approval proceedings as a class member not as a party. He
therefore has no right of appeal under s. 30(3).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Maclean argues that because Sharpe J.'s judgment is a final
order of the Ontario Court (General Division), he has a right of
appeal under s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C.4. Section 6(1)(b) provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          6(1) An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal
          from,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  a final order of a judge of the Ontario
               Court (General Division), except an
               order referred to in clause 19(1)(a) or
               an order from which an appeal lies to
               the Divisional Court under another Act.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He argues that if the Act does not provide him with a right of
appeal, either because he is not a party to the class proceeding
or because s. 30(3) does not provide for a right of appeal from a
judgment approving a settlement3, then s. 6(1)(b) operates to
confer a right where the Act has failed to do so. I do not accept
that argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In my view, s. 30(3), which grants specific rights of appeal
to this court in class proceedings, takes precedence over and
excludes provisions of general application such as s. 6(1)(b) of
the Courts of Justice Act. Two rules of statutory interpretation
assist in determining the intention of the Legislature. First, a
&quot;general statute is made to 'yield' by regarding the special
statute as an exception to the general.&quot;4 Second, a more recent
statute takes precedence over prior legislation because &quot;the more
recent expression of the will of the legislature should be
retained.&quot;5 In this case, the Act is the more recent enactment
and specifically addresses the rights of appeal in class
proceedings. The Courts of Justice Act was enacted earlier and is
of more general ambit. These rules support the conclusion that
the appeal provisions in s. 30(3) of the Act take precedence over
s. 6(1)(b).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] This conclusion is consistent with the dicta of Doherty J.A.
in 792266 Ontario Ltd. v. Monarch Trust Co. (Liquidation) (1996),
94 O.A.C. 384 (C.A.). At p. 389, he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...I would, however, observe that this court
          has held that statutory provisions granting a
          specific right of appeal take precedence over
          and exclude provisions of more general
          application: Overseas Missionary Fellowship
          v. 578369 Ontario Ltd. (1990), 73 O.R. (2d)
          73 at 75 (C.A.). that conclusion is
          consistent with the well-recognized principle
          of statutory interpretation which provides
          that where a statutory provision in specific
          legislation appears to conflict with a
          provision in a general statutory scheme, the
          former is seen as an exception to the latter:
          R. v. Greenwood (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 1 at 6-7
          (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
          [1992] 1 S.C.R. viii.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I agree with that statement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The logic of this interpretation is apparent in this case.
The intent of the Act is clear that the rights of appeal to this
court are conferred on parties, not class members. A class member
requires leave under s. 30(5) to act as a representative party
for the purpose of bringing an appeal under s. 30(3). If, as
Maclean argues, a class member has a right of appeal under s.
6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, that intent would be
defeated. Further, assuming, as Dabbs and Sun Life argue, that s.
30(3) does not confer a right to appeal a judgment approving a
settlement, it would make no sense for the Legislature to have
provided for specific limited rights of appeal in s. 30(3) if the
general right of appeal in s. 6(1)(b) was also to apply. Section
30(3) would be redundant and whatever limits result from its
specific wording would be frustrated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Relying upon the case of Re O'Donohue and Silva et al.
(1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 162 (C.A.), Maclean argues that the right of
appeal in s. 6(1)(b) can only be excluded by express statutory
provision. In that case, the court considered appeal rights under
the Municipal Elections Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.53, as amended,
which provides for an appeal from a judicial recount to a judge
of the Ontario Court (General Division). The Municipal Elections
Act does not provide for a further appeal. The court found that
in the absence of an express statutory exclusion of an appeal
from a final order of a General Division judge, the Legislature
could not be deemed to have limited the jurisdiction granted to
the Court of Appeal by s. 6(1)(b). Significantly, there was no
right of appeal to the Court of Appeal set out in the Municipal
Elections Act. It is the inclusion of the specific appeal
provisions in the Act which, in my view, operate to exclude the
jurisdiction under s. 6(1)(b) for proceedings under the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In summary I am of the view that s. 30(3) of the Act
provides the rights of appeal to this court for class proceedings
and that s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act does not
supplement those rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MACLEAN'S MOTION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Maclean brought a motion for leave, if necessary, to appeal
the judgment of Sharpe J. During the course of argument he
requested that the court consider this motion as a motion for
leave under s. 30(5) of the Act to permit him to act as a
representative party for purposes of bringing his appeal under s.
30(3). The court indicated that it was prepared to deal with the
motion on this basis. In my view, this is not an appropriate case
for leave.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The court's discretion to grant leave under s. 30(5) is
guided by the best interests of the class and in particular by a
consideration whether the class member applying would fairly and
adequately represent the interests of the class. There is nothing
in the record which indicates that Maclean would adequately
represent the interests of this class by bringing an appeal which
seeks to set aside the settlement agreement. Courts in three
jurisdictions have approved the agreement. Maclean is the only
class member of an estimated 400,000 who now seeks to set it
aside. The wishes of one class member ought not to govern the
interests of the entire class.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Importantly, if Maclean is dissatisfied with this
settlement, he has the opportunity under the terms of Sharpe J.'s
judgment and s. 9 of the Act to opt out of the class and pursue
his claim against Sun Life in his personal capacity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] I would therefore dismiss the motion brought by Maclean
under s. 30(5) of the Act. For the reasons above, I would allow
the motion under s. 134 of the Courts of Justice Act and quash
the appeal. Because the motions involved a novel point raised by
an individual class member, I would make no order as to costs.
