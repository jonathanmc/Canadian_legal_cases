</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  A friend of the appellant was involved in an altercation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outside of a Yorkville nightclub. The appellant left his car to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assist his friend. He assumed the role of peacemaker and he and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his friend eventually made their way back to the car which was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parked in front of the nightclub. Contrary to the wishes of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, the altercation continued. One person struck the car</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a pole, while others taunted the appellant’s friend, urging</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him to get out of the car and fight. The appellant backed up and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then drove forward on to the sidewalk in front of the nightclub,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">striking three pedestrians. Two suffered bodily harm and one was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">killed. The appellant then struck a parked car before leaving the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scene. A passenger in the parked vehicle suffered bodily harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant was charged with criminal negligence causing death,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">count of failing to remain at the scene of an accident. He was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convicted on all counts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant testified that he believed that one of the men</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved in the altercation had a gun and said something which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated he was about to use it. No one else testified about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this comment, but there was considerable evidence that the people</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outside the car were in a most combative mood. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that he intended to drive away from the scene, but that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his car jumped the sidewalk and struck the victims. He contended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the fear and panic of the moment caused him to lose control</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the vehicle momentarily. He further said that he left the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scene because of his fear and panic and not with the intention of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">avoiding civil or criminal liability. It was the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position that he did not know that he had struck any of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pedestrians, although he was aware that he had hit the parked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant's version of events was capable of affording a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence to all of the charges. His position was supported to some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent by the expert evidence of an accident reconstructionist</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">called by the defence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  It was the Crown's position that the appellant reacted out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of anger as a result of the altercation and drove his car in an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggressive and retaliatory manner whereupon he lost control and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drove on to the crowded sidewalk. The Crown's position was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supported to some extent by its expert in accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reconstruction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge properly instructed the jury as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning and application of the doctrine of reasonable doubt in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the general part of his instructions. He also properly instructed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury as to the application of that doctrine to the charge of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failing to remain and the defence raised to that charge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In his recharge, in response to a question from the jury,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge's instructions left the impression that the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to accept the appellant's contention that he acted out of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fear and panic when he drove on to the sidewalk before that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explanation could leave the jury with a reasonable doubt. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction was directed at the criminal negligence charges.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Counsel for the appellant objected to the recharge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Considering the entirety of the charge and the importance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any instruction following a jury's question, the appellant has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied us that there was misdirection as to the application of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the doctrine of reasonable doubt to the defence put forward on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the criminal negligence charges.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In most cases, error in the instruction as to reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt necessitates a new trial. In the unusual circumstances of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case, however, we would apply the curative proviso. The jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was properly instructed on the fail to remain count. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convicting on that count, they were clearly satisfied beyond a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable doubt that the appellant did not act out of fear or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">panic when he left the scene. As that finding is not tainted by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any error in the instruction, we are obliged to take that finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into account in deciding whether the curative proviso can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied to the error made in relation to the other counts. We</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think that the jury, having decided beyond a reasonable doubt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that fear and panic did not precipitate the flight from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scene, would have inevitably concluded beyond a reasonable doubt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the same fear and panic did not cause the appellant to lose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control of the vehicle. The events underlying the charges were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part and parcel of the same occurrence. We would not give effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to this ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The instructions to the jury on the approach to be taken to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expert evidence, while by no means perfect, did not constitute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misdirection. The trial judge in effect told the jury that in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessing the weight to be given to opinion evidence, they should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider the extent to which the factual assumptions underlying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those opinions were or were not borne out by the evidence. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was an appropriate instruction and unlike the impugned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction in R. v. Travers (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 34</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(N.S.C.A.), it did not effectively remove the expert evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the jury’s consideration.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In the course of listing several &quot;common sense&quot; factors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which should be considered by the jury in assessing credibility,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge cautioned the jury against accepting the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of anyone who had previously lied about a &quot;significant matter.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant admitted he had lied to his girlfriend the night of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the accident and it was open to the jury to find that he had also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lied to the body shop owner and the first police officer he spoke</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to about the incident. No other witness fell into this category.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The trial judge is entitled to assist the jury by itemizing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors relevant to credibility arising out of the evidence. A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lie with respect to a significant matter is potentially an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">important consideration in assessing credibility. We cannot say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the trial judge went beyond his assigned function in drawing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury's attention to the potential significance of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's lies in their assessment of his credibility.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant led character evidence. That evidence was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">potentially significant to the assessment of his credibility but,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in our view, had little probative value as circumstantial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence given the nature of the allegation made against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and the substance of the character evidence. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge emphasized the connection between the character evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the appellant's credibility in his brief instructions on that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. We see no error in that approach.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant also appeals against sentence. The sentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposed was one of 3½ years’ imprisonment, consisting of three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years for the offence of criminal negligence causing death, two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years concurrent on each of the criminal negligence causing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bodily harm counts and six months consecutive for the offence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The offences in question were very serious. They resulted in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grave and tragic consequences. Three pedestrians were seriously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injured and a young woman with great promise was killed. Victim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impact statements from family members of the deceased, filed on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the sentence hearing, attest to the enormity of the tragedy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Bearing in mind the seriousness and gravity of the offences,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge emphasized the need for general deterrence and he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded, correctly in our view, that despite the appellant’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positive background and good character, a substantial period of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incarceration was warranted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In determining the length of the sentence, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">placed considerable emphasis on the degree of culpability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attributable to the appellant. He rejected the notion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s conduct represented a momentary lapse of attention or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error in judgment. Rather, he found it to be blatant and a highly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, he ascribed a high degree of moral culpability to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] With respect, we are of the view that in assessing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s level of moral culpability, the trial judge erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle by failing to take into account several important</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mitigating factors which bore directly on this issue. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular, he failed to recognize that the appellant’s conduct,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">though highly reprehensible, represented a single isolated act by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an otherwise responsible, law-abiding and productive individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in circumstances of severe provocation. The trial judge’s failure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to take these factors into account led him to ascribe a higher</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">degree of moral culpability to the appellant than warranted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] A second error in principle arises from the trial judge’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure to take into account the two months of pre-trial custody</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">served by the appellant. In the circumstances of this case, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believe that the appellant should have been credited with four</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] As a result of the combined effect of these two errors, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believe that the sentence of 3½ was too high. Under all of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, we think a fit and just sentence would be one of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two years less one day imprisonment. To give effect to this, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would reduce the sentence on the charge of criminal negligence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">causing death from three years to 18 months less one day. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentences imposed on the criminal negligence causing bodily harm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts will also be reduced from two years to 18 months less one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">day concurrent. In all other respects, the sentence will remain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unchanged.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is varied in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordance with these reasons.</font></pre></td>
