    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are  asked to deal with the same matter.  In October of 1993, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Ministry  of   Labour,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment  Standards  Branch regarding unpaid  wages,  including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlement  to a very large commission. An employment  standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer was assigned to investigate the appellant’s complaint.  A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">year  later,  the officer determined that the appellant  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled  to  the  commission.  Rather than appeal  this  finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within  the  administrative structure, the appellant  decided  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursue  a  claim in the courts for damages for wrongful dismissal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and for unpaid wages and commissions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]        In  the  civil action, the respondent employer  argued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  claim for entitlement to commissions and unpaid  wages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  barred  by issue estoppel.  The motions judge,  McCombs  J.,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreed and struck out those paragraphs of the statement of  claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting unpaid wages and commissions.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]        The doctrine of issue estoppel precludes a party  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relitigating  any  issues that have been determined  in  a  prior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding.  There are three requirements of issue estoppel1:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          (1)  the same question has been decided;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)   the judicial decision which is said  to
          create the estoppel was final; and,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)  the parties to the judicial decision  or
          their  privies were the same persons  as  the
          parties  to  the  proceedings  in  which  the
          estoppel is raised or their privies.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]        This appeal concerns only the second requirement.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  concedes  that the first and third  requirements  have</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment standards officer was neither judicial nor  final  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thus issue estoppel cannot operate.  I agree with McCombs J. that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  estoppel  does  apply and would  accordingly  dismiss  the</font></pre>

          THE FACTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]        The  respondents brought the motion before McCombs  J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  rule  21.01(3)(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis  that the parts of the appellant’s claim relating to unpaid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wages  and commissions were frivolous, vexatious and an abuse  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  court’s process.  In addition to the pleadings, the  parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">filed   affidavits.   This  material  discloses   the   following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">chronology: in the fall of 1993, the appellant became involved in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  dispute with her employer,2 Ainsworth Technologies Inc.,  over</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unpaid  commissions.  The appellant met with  her  superiors  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sent  various  letters  outlining her  position.   Her  principal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complaint   concerned  an  alleged  entitlement  to   commissions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exceeding  $200,000 in respect of a project referred  to  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">material as the CIBC Lan project.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]        The appellant rejected a proposed settlement from  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer  and  on  October 4, 1993 filed a  complaint  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.14.  On October  5th,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  employer  wrote  to the appellant rejecting  her  claim  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commissions.  The following week the appellant attended for work.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  employer  took the position that she had  resigned  and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was escorted off the premises.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]        An  employment standards officer, Caroline Burke,  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assigned  to  investigate the appellant’s complaint.   She  spoke</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  the  appellant by telephone and met with her for one  hour.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  appellant  gave  Ms  Burke various documents  including  her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correspondence  with  the  employer.   On  March  21,  1994,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  commenced an action in which she claimed  damages  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongful dismissal and also claimed unpaid wages and commissions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">On  June  1, 1994, solicitors for the employer wrote to Ms  Burke</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">responding  to  the  appellant’s claim.   The  employer's  letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">included a number of documents to substantiate its position.   Ms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burke did not provide this material to the appellant nor did  she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ask the appellant to respond to it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]        On  September  23,  1994, Ms Burke  ordered  Ainsworth</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weeks'  pay  in lieu of notice.  Ms Burke advised Ainsworth  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she had rejected the appellant’s claim for unpaid commissions  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  CIBC  project.   On October 3, 1994, Ms  Burke  advised  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, in writing, of the order made against the company  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two  weeks'  termination  pay but which rejected  her  claim  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commission  on the CIBC project.  The letter explained  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  had  a  right to apply to the Director  of  Employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Standards for a review of this decision.  Ms Burke repeated  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advice in a subsequent telephone conversation with the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  appellant did not apply to the Director for a review  of  Ms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burke’s  decision; instead, she pursued her claim  in  the  civil</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]        This  case  concerns the second requirement  of  issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estoppel, that the decision which is said to create the  estoppel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  a  final judicial decision.  The appellant submits  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision  of an employment standards officer is neither  judicial</font></pre>

          THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEME

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislative  scheme as it existed at the time of the  appellant’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complaint.   I note that there have been extensive amendments  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Act  since  the  appellant's complaint: see  especially  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment  Standards Improvement Act, 1996, S.O.  1996,  c.  23.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Among other things the amendments affect the jurisdiction of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment  standards officer (see, for example, new s.  65(1.3))</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  the appeal procedure.  These new provisions do not apply  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  case  and their impact on the issues before this court  was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  The  leading  case  on issue estoppel  as  applied  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment  Standards  Act  is Rasanen v.  Rosemount  Instruments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Limited (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 267 (C.A.), leave to appeal  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme  Court of Canada refused (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) xvi (note).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In  Rasanen, the plaintiff’s position in the company  had  become</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">redundant  as a result of corporate restructuring.  The  employer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offered  the plaintiff two alternative positions.  He refused  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accept either position and the company terminated his employment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  plaintiff  filed a complaint under the Employment  Standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 137 alleging entitlement to termination pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  Act  requires  an employer to pay to an  employee  specified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amounts  of  termination pay.  An employer is exempt from  paying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  amount if, among other things, the employee has refused  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer of reasonable alternate work.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  The  plaintiff’s complaint was initially considered  by  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment  standards  officer.  The officer  found  against  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff.  The plaintiff requested a review of that decision  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  second  employment  standards  officer  as  permitted  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation at the time.  This second officer found in favour  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff.  At this stage, the employer requested a review by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way  of  a hearing before a referee.  The referee considered  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  to  be  whether  the terms of employment  offered  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  constituted  reasonable  alternate  employment  or   a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fundamental breach of the contract of employment.  In considering</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this question, the referee applied tests similar to those used by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">courts  in  determining  claims of constructive  dismissal.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referee  found that one of the two offers constituted  reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternate employment and the plaintiff was therefore not entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to termination pay under the Act.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  In  the meantime, the plaintiff had brought an  action  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongful  dismissal. The trial judge held that  in  view  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referee's  findings issue estoppel applied.  In the  alternative,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  trial  judge  held  there was no breach  of  the  employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract and that the plaintiff should have accepted one  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternate  positions.   The  plaintiff’s  submission   that   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reassignment  constituted constructive  dismissal  was  rejected.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The plaintiff appealed to this court.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The plaintiff argued that none of the three requirements for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue estoppel applied. In separate reasons, Morden A.C.J.O.  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Abella  J.A. held that issue estoppel did apply by reason of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier  decision of the referee.  Carthy J.A.  held  that  issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estoppel  did not apply because its third requirement  (that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties  to  the  earlier decision were the same)  was  not  met.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, he dismissed the appeal because he agreed with the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge’s alternative conclusion with respect to liability.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]  The  majority reasons in Rasanen are crucial for  resolving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  issues in this case.  In Rasanen, the principal argument  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant was that the procedure before the referee was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficiently  judicial. In extensive reasons,  Abella  J.A.  held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that,  in principle, there is no reason not to treat the decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  an  administrative  tribunal with the  same  deference  as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision  of  a  court for the purposes of issue  estoppel.   She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pointed  out  that  the  application of  the  doctrine  of  issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estoppel  involves a significant policy component and that  these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy    considerations   favour   recognizing   decisions    of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administrative  tribunals.   As  Abella  J.A.  said  at  p.  279,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administrative tribunals were created as “independent bodies  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  purpose  of  being an alternative to the  judicial  process,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including  its  procedural  panoplies&quot;.   Designed  to  be  “less</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cumbersome,  less expensive, less formal and less delayed,  these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impartial  decision-making bodies were  to  resolve  disputes  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their   area  of  specialization  more  expeditiously  and   more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accessibly, but no less effectively or credibly…”.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  With  respect to whether the proceeding before the  referee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a judicial one, Abella J.A. concluded at p. 281:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          There   is  no  basis  for  restricting   the
          application  of issue estoppel  to  decisions
          made  by  judges  in the ordinary  course  of
          litigation.  By analogy, the hearing  by  the
          referee,  if  not technically “judicial”,  is
          designed   to   be   an  independent,   fair,
          impartial  and binding adjudicative  process,
          and  therefore  satisfies the spirit  of  the
          requirement.   It was a decision  made  in  a
          hearing in which the appellant knew the  case
          he  had to meet, had a chance to meet it, and
          lost.   Had  he won, the decision would  have
          been no less binding.  [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  As  to  the requirement that the first decision  be  final,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Abella  J.A.  referred to [now] s. 68(7), which provides  that  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of a referee is final and binding upon the parties.  She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">held  that  the  referee’s decision is subject only  to  judicial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review  and,  since judicial review was not sought, the  decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was final.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Abella J.A. also considered the impact of s. 6(1) of the Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which,  as  I  have noted, provides that no civil  remedy  of  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee is suspended or affected by the Act.  She held that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact  that  an  employee  is  not prevented  from  seeking  civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedies does not preclude the application of issue estoppel in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proper  case.3   She found assistance in the case law  respecting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   scope   of   judicial  review  of  tribunal  decisions   in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpreting s. 6(1) and concluded at p. 285:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          It  would  be anomalous if the courts,  while
          deferring to the final and binding nature  of
          tribunal   decisions  for   judicial   review
          purposes,  did not treat these same decisions
          as binding in subsequent judicial proceedings
          where  the  same issues arise.  While  it  is
          certainly true, therefore, that the appellant
          was  free to pursue his remedies in either  a
          court  or at the Employment Standards Branch,
          he was not free to presume that he was immune
          from  being  bound  by a  final  decision  of
          either forum on the same issue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25]   Abella  J.A.  also  resolved  the  other  issue   estoppel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirements  against the plaintiff.  She  found  that  the  same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question  had been decided in the proceeding before  the  referee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that the parties or their privies were the same.





</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  Morden  A.C.J.O. also held that issue estoppel  applied  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  case.   As to s. 6(1) he held, at p. 293, that its  purpose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  to  make  it  clear  that the “minimum employment  standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  for  in  the Act are not to stand  in  the  way  of  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee  seeking  and  obtaining  more  favourable  common   law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief.”   So interpreted, there is still room for the  operation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  issue  estoppel if the requirements of the doctrine are  met.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nevertheless, Morden A.C.J.O. cautioned that issue estoppel  must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be applied with circumspection.  Particularly with respect to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement that the decision be judicial, he advised the  courts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  proceed  with  care  in applying issue estoppel  to  tribunal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decisions.  He stated at p. 295:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          I   do   not  exclude  the  possibility  that
          deficiencies in the procedure relating to the
          first decision could properly be a factor  in
          deciding  whether  or  not  to  apply   issue
          estoppel.   However, in this  case,  whatever
          the procedure was that governed the statutory
          proceeding,  the  appellant frankly  admitted
          that it placed him at no disadvantage in  the
          presentation  of his case and  so  I  do  not
          think  that the procedural aspect is relevant
          in this case.  [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  The  majority  decision  in  Rasanen  thus  determines  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following matters that are of assistance in resolving the  issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this case:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          1.     The   decision  of  an  administrative
          tribunal  may give rise to issue estoppel  in
          subsequent court proceedings.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.     Section  6(1)  of  the  Act  does  not
          preclude the operation of issue estoppel.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.    Although not strictly “judicial” in the
          sense of a formal court hearing, a proceeding
          before   a  referee  results  in  a  judicial
          decision for the purposes of issue estoppel.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.    Under the Act, a referee’s decision  is
          final and binding on the parties subject only
          to  judicial review and is therefore a  final
          decision for the purposes of issue estoppel.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  In the present case, counsel for the appellant, Mr. Levitt,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought  to  distinguish  Rasanen by  pointing  out  a  number  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">differences  between the facts of this case and  its  facts.   He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">noted  that  this  decision was made by an  employment  standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer  rather  than  a  referee as in Rasanen.   Moreover,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure  employed by the officer was considerably  less  formal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  bore  even  less  resemblance to a court  hearing  than  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding before the referee.  In Rasanen, both the employee and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  representative of the employer testified at a  hearing  before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the referee.  The employee was, in effect, represented by counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the Ministry of Labour.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]  In contrast, Ms Burke did not hold a hearing involving both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties  and she did not receive oral testimony from the parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  appellant  presented her case to Ms Burke through  telephone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calls,  a  meeting and by providing various documents.   Although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant  was represented by counsel in the  civil  action,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  counsel  does  not  appear  to  have  participated  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings before Ms Burke.  Lastly, Mr. Levitt argued that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  was  not  treated fairly by the  employment  standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer; in Rasanen there was no complaint of unfairness  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process  before the referee.  The appellant submits that she  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  provided with an opportunity to respond to the June 1,  1994</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correspondence  from the employer to Ms Burke.  In  essence,  her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern is that she did not know the case against her and have an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opportunity to meet it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]   Mr.  Levitt  also  relies  upon  the  different  statutory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions  involved  in this case as opposed  to  Rasanen.   For</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instance,  under s. 59 of the Act, employment standards  officers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are civil servants appointed under the Public Service Act whereas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referees are appointed by the Minister pursuant to s. 60.   There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has  also  been a change in the legislative scheme since Rasanen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Under  the former legislation, an employee dissatisfied with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision could only seek a review by another employment standards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer,  whereas  an employer could apply  for  a  review  by  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referee.   Under  s. 67 of the present legislation,  however,  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee  can  apply  for  a  review  by  an  adjudicator.   Like</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referees,  adjudicators are appointed by the Minister.   We  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">informed  that  notwithstanding the  different  terminology,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Minister  will  appoint  the  same persons  to  be  referees  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjudicators  and the present practice is to appoint  vice-chairs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  Ontario  Labour Relations Board.   Finally,  Mr.  Levitt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">points  out  that s. 67 does not expressly state that  employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standards  officers'  decisions are &quot;final and  binding&quot;  whereas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ss.  67  and 68 state that decisions of adjudicators and referees</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rasanen  and  the  circumstances  of  this  case  have  no  legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significance for the purposes of applying issue estoppel.   As  a</font></pre>

          (1)  A Final Decision
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]  A  decision  is final for the purposes  of  issue  estoppel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notwithstanding  that it may be subject to  appeal.   It  follows</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the decision of the employment standards officer is a final</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision even though it is subject to review by an adjudicator or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referee.  The  law in this respect is summarized  in  G.  Spencer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bower  and  A.K.  Turner, The Doctrine of Res Judicata,  2nd  ed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(London: Butterworths, 1969) at p. 143:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          A  judicial decision, otherwise final, is not
          the  less so merely because it is appealable.
          If  it  is incapable of revision by the court
          which  pronounced  it, it is  final  in  that
          court,  which is all that is required  to  be
          shown, and it is wholly immaterial that it is
          capable of being rescinded or varied by  some
          other    court   invested   with    competent
          jurisdiction   in   that  behalf.   [Emphasis

          hold him precluded from raising that issue in
          subsequent  litigation …  All  estoppels  are
          not  odious but must be applied so as to work
          justice  and not injustice, and I think  that

          applied   to   the   circumstances   of   the

1    Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung v. Rayner and Keeler, Ltd. and Others
(No. 2), [1966] 2 All E.R. 536 (H.L.).
2    The appellant actually claims to have an employment
relationship with more than one employer even though her contract
of employment appears to be with Ainsworth Technologies Inc.  It
is unnecessary to resolve the question of the identity of the
employer for the purposes of this appeal.  As indicated, the
appellant concedes that the parties to the proceedings are the
same for the purposes of the third requirement for issue
estoppel.
3    As I have already noted, the Employment Standards Act has
now been amended.  Sections 64.3 and 64.4 limit the employee’s
ability to pursue alternative remedies.  Subject to certain
exceptions, an employee is not entitled to commence a civil
action if he or she has filed a complaint under the Act for,
inter alia, wages owing to the employee.  Likewise, the employee
is not entitled to file a complaint under the Act if he or she
has commenced a civil action for wages owing.  These provisions,
however, do not apply in this appeal as the action was commenced
before the provisions came into force.
4    The Alberta Court of Appeal has also held that the decision
of an employment standards officer under the Employment Standards
Code, S.A. 1988, c. E10.2 is final in Wong v. Shell Canada Ltd.
(1995), C.C.E.L. (2d) 182, application for leave to appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada dismissed September 12, 1996.
5    For example, in Canada (Minister of National Revenue) v.
Coopers and Lybrand, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 495 the court was required
to make that determination because the jurisdiction of the
Federal Court of Appeal under former s. 28 of the Federal Court
Act, R.S.C. 1970, 2nd Supp., c. 10 depended on whether the
decision to be reviewed was of an administrative nature “not
required by law to be made on a judicial or quasi-judicial
basis.”
6    Section 2(3).
7 See paragraph 29 above.
8    I appreciate that s. 67(3) provides that the Director “may”
appoint an adjudicator who shall hold a hearing and thus that the
appeal may not be as of right.  However, there was no suggestion
that the Director could refuse to appoint an adjudicator where
the employee has complied with the statutory procedure set out in
s. 67(2).  I did not understand the appellant to argue that she
had no right of appeal under s. 67(3) because the director’s
power is stated in discretionary terms.</font></pre></td>
