    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault and invitation
to sexual touching by a jury presided over by J.R. MacKinnon J.
of the Ontario Court (General Division). The trial judge imposed
a sentence of fifteen months followed by three years probation
for the sexual assault and stayed the conviction for invitation
to sexual touching. The appellant appeals conviction and
sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The complainant was 10 years old at the time of the trial.
She testified to some four to ten sexual encounters with the
appellant in which he directed her to fondle his penis. On one
occasion, the appellant ?pee?d? as a result of the fondling. At
the time these incidents occurred, the appellant was involved in
a relationship with the complainant’s mother and was living with
the mother, the complainant and her two brothers. The
relationship began in June of 1991 and was terminated by the
mother in September of 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Because of the legal issues raised by the appellant and the
disposition that I propose, it is unnecessary to engage in any
detailed examination of the facts. Suffice it to say that the
principal concern of the defence at trial related to the lateness
and inconclusive nature of the disclosure by the complainant
about the conduct of the appellant. The disclosure occurred more
than two years after the last incident and arose out of a story
telling session she had with a school friend. The friend repeated
the disclosure to a teacher who referred the matter the school
principal, who in turn referred the matter to the Childrens? Aid
Society. The complainant was interviewed by a C.A.S. worker in
the presence of a police officer. During this interview, the
complainant at first stated to the social worker that she was
unable to remember any sexual touching. Later on, however, she
did say that she recalled the incidents involving the accused.
There is a suggestion by the defence that the complainant was
coached by the social worker as to what she should say.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Since there is no supporting evidence of the complainant?s
testimony and the allegations were denied in their entirety by
the appellant, the credibility of the complainant was vital to
the deliberations of the jury. The appellant in this court raised
a number of issues, but it is necessary to deal with only two of
them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1)  Did the trial judge err in his response to a
request from the jury to read back certain portions of the
complainant?s testimony in chief?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  Did the trial judge err in admitting the evidence
of the psychologist Dr. Marshall in relation to the issue of late
disclosure of the complaint?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue (1): Did the trial judge err in his response to a
request from the jury to read back certain portions of the
complainant?s testimony in chief?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  About seven hours after the jury had retired to begin its
deliberations, it submitted the following request:
                    We feel it would be advantageous to
          have certain segments of R.’s examination-in-
          chief re-read for clarification by the Court
          Reporter. We would like to hear who she
          accused of this offence and how she accused
          him. We would like to hear where this alleged
          offence took place in her words.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  All of the evidence of the complainant had been recorded.
Because of a problem in the recording device, a portion of her
evidence in chief was reduced to transcript form. The trial judge
had the printed portion read to the jury and the balance of her
examination in chief replayed to the jury. Defence counsel had
submitted that if the jury were to re-hear portions of the
complainant?s examination-in-chief, then the corresponding
portions of the cross-examination ought to be re-heard as well.
However, the trial judge held that because the jury had requested
only the examination-in-chief, the cross-examination would not be
replayed. The jury then returned and re-heard the entire
examination-in-chief of the complainant. Twenty-two minutes
later, the jury convicted the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  It is well recognised that there is a duty on a trial judge
to ensure that any evidence read back to the jury as a result of
a jury question should be read back together with any other
portions of the evidence that qualify or contextualize it. In
Olbey v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (S.C.C.), McIntyre
J., writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated
at pp. 272-3:
                    Counsel for the appellant contended
          that the trial judge was in error in allowing
          only part of the evidence of Dwyer to be read
          back. He contended that when part of a
          witness?s evidence is re-read all the cross-
          examination or qualifying evidence should
          also be read so that the evidence will be put
          in its proper relation to the whole of the
          case and so that the evidence will not be
          isolated and given more emphasis and
          significance than it should have.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    I am in agreement with this
          proposition, as was Martin J.A., in the Court
          of Appeal [reported at (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d)
          390]. He said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              I accept, of course, the
               proposition that where the jury requests
               that the evidence of a witness be read
               back, it is incumbent on the trial judge
               not to allow the jury to hear a part
               only of the evidence of the witness
               without also hearing those portions of
               the evidence of the witness, whether
               given in-chief or in cross-examination,
               which weaken or qualify the part read,
               even though the jury indicates that it
               does not wish to hear any more of the
               witness?s evidence. Otherwise, the jury
               is not hearing the evidence of the
               witness, but only an incomplete, or even
               an inaccurate account of his or her
               testimony. [Emphasis added.]
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In this case, it is noteworthy that the jury had requested
only segments of the complainant?s examination-in-chief be
reheard and yet the trial judge had no hesitation in having all
of her testimony in chief replayed. Given that the Crown?s case
was limited to the unsupported testimony of the complainant, this
replay amounted to having the jury rehear the Crown?s case in its
entirety without the benefit of a cross-examination that
significantly amplified and qualified what the complainant had
said in chief, particularly with respect to her reasons for not
making a more timely disclosure. Of additional importance is the
question of the jury relating to where the offence took place.
The problems inherent in this issue only took on significance
during the cross-examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In my opinion, the failure to re-read the cross-examination
was highly prejudicial to the appellant. Given that there
appeared to be no logistical impediments to having all the
complainant?s evidence replayed for the benefit of the jury, it
is inexcusable. I do not think that this is a case such as R. v.
Shortreed (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 292 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 308 where
it can be said that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice. Given that a new trial will be necessary, it is still
necessary to deal with the second issue on appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue (2):     Did the trial judge err in admitting the
evidence of the psychologist Dr. Marshall in relation to the
issue of late disclosure of the complaint?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Dr. Peter Marshall, a psychologist, was qualified as an
expert in child sexual abuse and the manner in which children
disclose sexual abuse. He had significant experience in working
with abused children, although he had never conducted research or
published in this area. He had been qualified as an expert at all
levels of court. He was familiar with the literature on
disclosure of child sexual abuse, suggestibility in interviewing,
and children?s memory. However, because he did not investigate
allegations of abuse, he did not follow the research in these
areas as closely as he did research related to his usual work.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Dr. Marshall testified that most people, including both
children and adults, will tell, or decline to tell, certain
things to some people and not to others. A decision not to tell
others can be due to a variety of factors, including whether the
subject in question is uninteresting, embarrassing or hurtful.
These same general principles apply to children who have been
sexually abused. Sexual abuse is, for most children, a negative
experience. Some children who have been abused will feel guilty
about it. Consequently, according to Dr. Marshall, some children
who have been abused will immediately disclose this fact to
others whereas others will not.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Dr. Marshall cited several studies which concluded that many
victims of sexual abuse never disclosed the abuse. According to
Dr. Marshall, one cannot make assumptions about when disclosure
will occur, if at all. The factors that would influence a child
to disclose or not to disclose are normal human experiences. A
child is less likely to disclose if he or she is embarrassed, is
worried about hurting somebody or getting the perpetrator into
trouble, is worried about not being believed, or has been
threatened. Some children who have been abused by a parent?s
partner will not disclose out of fear that the parent will not
believe them and may punish them. Some children who have been
abused still like and respect the perpetrator and do not wish to
destroy what they see as positive aspects of the relationship
which may still exist notwithstanding the abuse. Such children
sometimes make disclosure at a later point in life if the
perpetrator is no longer around. Dr. Marshall testified that some
children disclose abuse once they become older because they gain
an understanding that what had occurred was wrong. Some children
disclose after seeing a television program or hearing a lecture
about abuse. Children might be less likely to disclose less
serious abuse. Dr. Marshall?s conclusion was that disclosure is
influenced by a number of factors, including the severity of the
abuse and the nature of the relationship with the perpetrator.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] According to Dr. Marshall, the length of time it takes a
child to disclose in no way correlates to the truth of the
disclosed information. The fact that disclosure has occurred a
long period after the alleged incident does not assist one in
determining whether the allegations are true.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Crown counsel presented Dr. Marshall with a hypothetical
situation that paralleled the events testified to by the
complainant and asked him whether such a situation was consistent
with sexual abuse having taken place. Dr. Marshall responded that
such a situation was consistent with abuse having taken place but
was equally consistent with abuse not having taken place.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Dr. Marshall had not interviewed the complainant and his
testimony was limited to generalities. The Crown conceded that
his testimony was intended to counteract the intuitive concern of
members of the jury as to why the complainant did not complain
about her abuse to her mother or to some other person in whom she
might be expected to confide. Specifically, the Crown anticipated
that the core attack of the defence on the credibility of the
complainant would highlight the two to three year delay in
disclosing the sexual abuse. As that delay supported the defence
concept of a ?common sense? view that the complainant?s testimony
was likely fabricated, the Crown submitted that it was entitled
to call a psychologist to give an expert opinion to dispel what
counsel described as this contrafactual concept.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] There are a number of reasons why this evidence should not
have been admitted. They are all supported by the authority of R.
v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.). First of all, it is
not evidence directed to establishing a fact in issue. It is
designed to rebut an argument by suggesting that what the defence
counsel regarded as a common sense concern of the jury is a
misplaced stereotypical misconception that has no support in the
behavioural sciences. It is an attempt to argue the Crown?s case
under the umbrella of an expert opinion in order to give it an
air of scientific validity. It is intended to discourage the jury
from relying upon their own experience on this issue and thus
remove, through an expert, an argument pertinent to the facts of
this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Secondly, it fails the test of relevancy in that even if it
is technically admissible, its probative value is outweighed by
its prejudicial impact on the trial process. As indicated above,
one of the propositions put forward by this expert is that on the
hypothetical question that paralleled the events testified to by
the appellant, he was of the opinion that the conduct of the
complainant was consistent with sexual abuse having taken place.
In fairness, he also said that it was equally consistent with
abuse not having taken place, but in either event, the underlying
theme of his testimony was that late disclosure is irrelevant and
that fact should be disregarded by the jury in determining the
credibility of the complainant. In so testifying, the witness is
simply arguing the theory of the Crown from the witness box and
clothing it with the aura of infallibility that jurors associate
with scientific principles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Thirdly, it is a blatant attempt to bolster the credibility
of the only witness the Crown had to the alleged assault. As such
it is not the proper subject matter of expert testimony. In
support of the admissibility of the opinion of Dr. Marshall, the
Crown relies upon R. v. Marquard (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 193 and
the following passage from the judgment of McLachlin J., at 228-
29:
                    On the other hand, there may be
          features of a witness?s evidence which go
          beyond the ability of a lay person to
          understand, and hence which may justify
          expert evidence. This is particularly the
          case in the evidence of children. For
          example, the ordinary inference from failure
          to complain promptly about a sexual assault
          might be that the story is a fabricated
          afterthought, born of malice or some other
          calculated stratagem. Expert evidence has
          been properly led to explain the reasons why
          young victims of sexual abuse often do not
          complain immediately. Such evidence is
          helpful; indeed it may be essential to a just
          verdict.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] However, Marquard does not support the Crown?s position. The
quotation is obiter and is taken out of context. McLachlin J. had
ruled that the evidence of the expert in her case was
inadmissible. The witness had expressed an opinion as to the
credibility of a youthful complainant based on her observations
as an expert in child abuse as to the reaction of the complainant
to a burn that she had received. The witness testified that the
child had been lying when she said she inflicted the burn upon
herself and made clear, at least by implication, that she was
telling the truth at trial when she told her second story
implicating the accused. McLachlin J. said that this opinion on
the credibility of the witness should not have been the subject
matter of expert testimony. Her words, immediately preceding the
above quotation, are particularly well suited to this case. She
said at p. 228:
                    It is a fundamental axiom of our
          trial process that the ultimate conclusion as
          to the credibility or truthfulness of a
          particular witness is for the trier of fact,
          and is not the proper subject of expert
          opinion. This court affirmed that proposition
          in R. v. Beland, [(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 481,
          43 D.L.R. (4th) 641], at p. 489 C.C.C., p.
          649 D.L.R., in rejecting the use of polygraph
          examinations as a tool to determine the
          credibility of witnesses:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              From the foregoing
               comments, it will be seen that the rule
               against oath-helping, that is, adducing
               evidence solely for the purpose of
               bolstering a witness?s credibility, is
               well grounded in authority.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    A judge or jury who simply accepts
          an expert?s opinion on the credibility of a
          witness would be abandoning its duty to
          itself determine the credibility of the
          witness. Credibility must always be the
          product of the judge or jury?s view of the
          diverse ingredients it has perceived at
          trial, combined with experience, logic and an
          intuitive sense of the matter: see R. v. B.
          (G.) (1988), 65 Sask. R. 134 at p. 149, 4
          W.C.B. (2d) 280 (C.A.), per Wakeling J.A.;
          affirmed 56 C.C.C. (3d) 161, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
          3, 77 C.R. (3d) 327. Credibility is a matter
          within the competence of lay people. Ordinary
          people draw conclusions about whether someone
          is lying or telling the truth on a daily
          basis. The expert who testifies on
          credibility is not sworn to the heavy duty of
          a judge or juror. Moreover, the expert?s
          opinion may be founded on factors which are
          not in the evidence upon which the judge and
          juror are duty-bound to render a true
          verdict. Finally, credibility is a
          notoriously difficult problem, and the
          expert?s opinion may be all too readily
          accepted by a frustrated jury as a convenient
          basis upon which to resolve its difficulties.
          All these considerations have contributed to
          the wise policy of the law in rejecting
          expert evidence on the truthfulness of
          witnesses.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] This brings me to the fourth, and perhaps the most
compelling, reason for rejecting Dr. Marshall?s evidence:
necessity. Once the expert concedes that delays in making
disclosure about unpleasant matters, including the fact of the
commission of a crime, are not restricted to children and can
apply with equal force to adults, the question naturally arises:
what does his testimony supply that is outside the normal
experience? This is not a case like R. v. Norman (1993), 87
C.C.C. (3d) 153 (Ont. C.A.) which dealt with a syndrome unique to
the complainant in that case known as child abuse accommodation
syndrome. This testimony could apply to any complainant and not
just in a sexual assault case. It is not necessary to assist the
trier of fact in deciding any material fact. In permitting Dr.
Marshall to testify, the trial judge did a disservice to the
jury. He underestimated its capacity to understand this behaviour
and to make a judgment based on the jurors? collective knowledge
of the behaviour of children and adults. I adopt what was said by
Hill J., in R. v. George Chisolm (1997), 8 C.R. (5th) 21 (Ont.
Gen. Div.), at para. 59:
                    [59] I commence from the point of
          view that today?s jurors bring intelligence
          and plain common sense to their task: The
          Queen v. Hill (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 322
          (S.C.C.) at 337-8 per Dickson C.J.C.; Corbett
          v. The Queen (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385
          (S.C.C.) at 400-401, 403 per Dickson C.J.C.
          As such, we must, as a general rule, credit
          jurors with knowledge of human affairs
          sufficient to the discharge of their oath and
          in particular to the fact-finding and
          credibility assessments necessary in a
          particular case.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] This ruling by Hill J. was made in a pre-trial motion
rejecting the admissibility of a report by a clinical
psychologist where the expert canvassed what he referred to as
the dynamics of immediate and non-immediate disclosure in sexual
assault cases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The quotation from McLachlin J. in Marquard, supra,
contemplates a need for an explanation as to why young victims of
sexual abuse do not complain immediately. In this case, there was
such an explanation offered by the complainant that had nothing
to do with any psychological disorder and fell well within the
normal experience of the jurors. She testified that she did not
disclose the assaults to her mother because she was concerned
that her mother might ?ground her?. For her part, the mother said
that she believed that her relationship with her daughter was
such that her daughter would confide in her. Her mother also
testified that her daughter?s behaviour was normal up until she
made disclosure, after which she became withdrawn. In the
circumstances, I believe that it was open to the jury to consider
these factors in assessing the reliability of the complainant?s
testimony. Any concerns about its members not being sensitive to
the fact that they were dealing with a complainant of tender
years and not with an adult could be brought to their attention
by an appropriate instruction from the trial judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The case in appeal is reminiscent of R. v. McIntosh and
McCarthy (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.). Here the
counsel for one of the accused tendered the evidence of a
professor of psychology on the issues of the admissibility of ?in
dock? identification evidence and later as defence witness on the
difficulties of identification evidence generally. Writing the
judgment of the court, I stated at p. 394:
                    [20] In the case in appeal, I think
          I can deal with relevance and necessity
          together because they appear to overlap. This
          opinion evidence is noteworthy in that,
          unlike most psychological or psychiatric
          testimony, it is not directed to making the
          testimony of a particular witness more
          understandable to the trier of fact and
          therefore more believable (e.g. an
          explanation of repressed memory syndrome or
          battered spouse syndrome). This opinion
          evidence is directed to instructing the jury
          that all witnesses have problems in
          perception and recall with respect to what
          occurred during any given circumstance that
          is brief and stressful. Accordingly, Dr.
          Yarmey is not testifying to matters that are
          outside the normal experience of the trier of
          fact: he is reminding the jury of the normal
          experience.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] We were referred to another pre-trial ruling as to a
psychologists opinion that since a 13 year old complainant did
not exhibit psychiatric problems, the delay in making disclosure
and the information she provided were consistent with the sexual
abuse she claimed was committed by the accused. In R. v.
Villamar, [1996] O.J. No. 2742 (Gen. Div.), Trafford J. ruled the
expert evidence inadmissible. I find helpful what he said at
para. 5:
                    [5]  Despite the capable
          submissions made on behalf of the Crown, in
          my opinion this evidence must be excluded in
          the circumstances of this case, because its
          prejudicial effect significantly outweighs
          its probative value. Let me elaborate on that
          conclusion. While I am satisfied it has a
          logical relevance in the sense that it, on
          its face, tends to explain the behaviour in
          question, it is of slight probative value.
          Its probative value is slight because it is
          not diagnostic of a history of sexual abuse.
          It does not have a predictive quality to it.
          The symptoms are as consistent with a
          reliable complainant as they are with a
          dishonest one. Consequently, absent an
          assumption that the sexual abuse occurred as
          alleged by the complainant, this evidence is
          of little or no probative value to the trier
          of fact.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] And again at para. 8:
                    [8]  Lastly, one cannot help but
          observe that significant portions of this
          evidence fail to meet the necessity
          requirement. For example, all of the factors
          relied upon as justifying the delay in the
          disclosure of the complainant are readily
          understandable by an intelligent layman. If
          the evidence provides them, the Crown may
          draw the jury?s attention to them in making
          its submissions on this point. No reference
          may be made to the excluded opinion or the
          studies lying at its foundation. This,
          however, is not a significant deletion from
          the case of the Crown. Moreover, while the
          opinion referring to the nature of the
          information disclosed by the complainant is
          of greater prejudice to the defence, the
          Crown may, if the evidence tendered in the
          trial is sufficient, make submissions similar
          to some of the notions embraced by the
          opinion.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Finally, with reference to this criterion of necessity in
assisting the trier of fact enunciated by Sopinka J. in Mohan,
supra, I would observe that he closed this portion of his
judgment by relying on the judgment of McLachlin J. in Marquard,
supra, as authority for the following statement at p. 414:
                     There is also a concern inherent
          in the application of this criterion that
          experts not be permitted to usurp the
          functions of the trier of fact. Too liberal
          an approach could result in a trial becoming
          nothing more than a contest of experts with
          the trier of fact acting as referee in
          deciding which expert to accept.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    These concerns were the basis of
          the rule which excluded expert evidence in
          respect of the ultimate issue. Although the
          rule is no longer of general application, the
          concerns underlying it remain. In light of
          these concerns, the criteria of relevance and
          necessity are applied strictly, on occasion,
          to exclude expert evidence as to an ultimate
          issue. Expert evidence as to credibility or
          oath-helping has been excluded on this basis;
          see R. v. Marquard [supra]?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] For all the reasons set out above, it is my opinion that the
trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Dr. Marshall.
Since I believe that a new trial is warranted on the first issue
alone, I have developed this point because I do not believe that
Dr. Marshall should be recalled in the event of a new trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside
the conviction and order a new trial.
