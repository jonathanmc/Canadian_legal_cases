[1]   This is an appeal by Bivash Deb of the dismissal, following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial,  of  his  claims against insurers American Life  Insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Company  and  American Life Home Assurance  Company  for  payment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  a  disability  policy issued  by  them  and  for  punitive</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">SUMMARY OF FACTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   In July of 1990, the appellant purchased a Lincoln Town Car</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for use as a limousine, primarily for chauffeuring passengers  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and from Pearson International Airport. The vehicle was purchased</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under a conditional sales contract from Bay Lincoln Mercury Sales</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Limited  (&quot;Bay Lincoln&quot;), with financing arranged by Bay  Lincoln</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  Ford  Credit  Canada Limited (&quot;Ford Credit&quot;),  title  being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retained  by  Bay  Lincoln pending full payment of  the  purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">price. The conditional sales contract was assigned by Bay Lincoln</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Ford Credit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The appellant took possession of the vehicle, obtained  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">usual  automobile  insurance from Continental  Insurance  Company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(&quot;Continental&quot;), and obtained motor vehicle registration  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">name of a limousine fleet operator. He operated the vehicle as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licensed  carrier until a motor vehicle accident on February  14,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991 resulted in the virtual destruction of the vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The conditional sales contract between the plaintiff and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealer,  assigned  by the dealer to Ford Credit  Canada  Limited,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided  for  a  balance  to  be  financed  in  the  amount   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$28,000.00,  plus  a  premium for life and  disability  insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchased  by  the  appellant in the amount of $1,852.02,  and  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registration  fee  of  $20,  for  a  total  amount  financed   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$29,872.02.  The  total  balance  due,  including  the  cost   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">borrowing,  was  payable in thirty-six instalments  of  $1,076.20</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">each.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   In  return for the premium paid in the amount of $1,852.02,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent American Life Insurance Company (&quot;ALICO&quot;)  issued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the appellant Certificate D2182407, which provided for payment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the  event of the appellant's total disability in the monthly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount  of  $999.00. Under an earlier certificate issued  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  by ALICO, the monthly amount was $1,076.00, the  exact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount  of the appellant's monthly instalment payments under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditional   sales  contract;  this  earlier   certificate   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cancelled  and  replaced  by  Certificate  D2182407  because  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  disclosed  in his application that  he  suffered  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diabetes,  and  therefore could not satisfy ALICO's  requirements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for policies providing monthly benefits of $1,000.00 or more.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  trial judge found that the accident resulted in  total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability  of the appellant, as defined in the ALICO certificate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of insurance, for a period of at least 24 months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Four  days after the accident, the appellant  notified  Bay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lincoln,  which  acted as agent for ALICO, of the  event.  Within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another   four  days  he  notified  it  of  his  disability.   He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsequently completed claim forms at its request.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   ALICO denied the appellant's claim by letter dated  May  7,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991,  72 days after its Cleveland office received written notice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the claim.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   The  appellant submitted a claim to his automobile insurer,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental  Insurance Company, in respect of the total  loss  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  vehicle, and signed a proof of loss in connection  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim.  The appellant's evidence was that he believed himself  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be the owner of the vehicle for this purpose, and does not recall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reading the form before signing. The proof of loss was eventually</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">completed in three different colours of ink, and another person B</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  president of the limousine fleet operator in whose name  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle  was  registered and through which the vehicle  insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arranged B was also a signatory.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The cheque in payment of the Continental claim was made  out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  favour of three individuals - the insured named in the policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(which  was the limousine service company), the registered  owner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the automobile (who owned the license to operate the limousine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in and out of the airport), and the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  The  trial judge noted in his reasons that in his proof  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss  to Continental, the appellant stated that he was the  owner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the vehicle and that there were no liens against it. There is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no  doubt  that  the appellant did sign the proof  of  loss  form</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stating  that  there were no liens and also no conditional  sales</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreements  on the vehicle. Strangely, that proof  of  loss  form</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does  not  state that the appellant is the owner of the  vehicle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  printed  form  does say that the vehicle  is  owned  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured, but the line on the form for the name of the insured  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">blank.  It  is fairly clear that at least three different  people</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were  involved in filling out the proof of loss form. In my view,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing  much can be drawn from the appellant's oral evidence  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  his opinion of ownership, but certainly nothing at all can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drawn  from the proof of loss form other than the denial  of  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liens or conditional sales agreements on the vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  Because  the appellant had purchased the vehicle  from  Bay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lincoln  under a conditional sales contract which reserved  title</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the vendor, and because the automobile registration was in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">name  of  the limousine fleet operator, the trial judge  did  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accept  the evidence of the appellant that he thought himself  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be the owner of the automobile.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The appellant's understanding and expectations were that  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  to use the proceeds of the Continental policy to replace the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle  destroyed  in  the accident and that  ALICO  would  make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payments to carry the Ford Credit Canada Limited financing  while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he remained disabled.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Continental paid the sum of $27,024.00 to the appellant, who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took  the funds to the defendant dealer and attempted to purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another  Lincoln  Town car to replace the one  destroyed  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident.  For  reasons unknown to the appellant,  the  defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealer refused to sell the appellant a replacement vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In dismissing the action against ALICO, the trial judge held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  Continental  proceeds should have  been  used  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  to satisfy the debt owing under the conditional  sales</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUES ON THE APPEAL
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Only two issues were dealt with on appeal:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   Was  the  appellant  entitled to have  payment  of  the
          disability  benefits provided under  the  ALICO  policy
          made   to   Ford   Credit  and  applied   against   his
          indebtedness?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   Should  punitive damages have been awarded against  the
          respondent?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Entitlement to Disability Payments
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  The characteristics of the ALICO and of the Continental
insurance
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The term of the ALICO insurance was concurrent with the term</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  conditional sales contract between Bay Lincoln  and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant - both being for three years commencing from  the  date</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  vehicle  was  purchased. ALICO's  certificate  of  insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided for payment of the monthly indemnity benefit not to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant,  but to the &quot;Creditor Policyholder&quot;, i.e. Ford  Credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as assignee of Bay Lincoln. The purpose of the payment was stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the  certificate  to be &quot;to reduce or extinguish  the  unpaid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indebtedness  of  the Insured&quot;. On its face  the  certificate  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled   &quot;Creditor's   Group   Life&quot;   and   &quot;Accident-Sickness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Coverage&quot;,  and  includes the apparent advertisement,  &quot;Peace  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mind with Payment Guard&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  The  certificate defines &quot;total disability&quot; and, as  stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier  in  these  reasons,  the  trial  judge  found  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant   was  totally  disabled  within  the  terms   of   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certificate for a period of at least 24 months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] There can be no doubt that this insurance was not to be paid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  appellant,  but was to give him, and also  Ford  Credit,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;peace  of mind&quot; that the debt attached to the vehicle  would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid  by  ALICO  during  any period of total  disability  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant. It would have been paid whether or not the vehicle was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">destroyed,  and even if the appellant's disability  had  resulted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from a cause completely unrelated to the vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  The  Continental  insurance was standard  vehicle  accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance,  providing  liability  and  collision  coverage.   Its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose was to provide funds to repair or replace the vehicle  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  event  of  damage or destruction. The insured value  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile,  less  the $3,000 deductible,  was  received  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant from Continental on a timely basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  Purpose of Policies
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The position of the respondent on this issue is, simply put,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  appellant was obliged to apply the  payments  made  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental  to  a  reduction  of  the  amount  owing  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditional  sales  contract and that, had that  been  done,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indebtedness  to Ford Credit would have been fully  extinguished,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  any  liability of ALICO to pay disability  benefits  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant terminated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] If ALICO is correct that the appellant was required to remit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Continental payment to Ford Credit, then there is  no  doubt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the liability of ALICO under its certificate would have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extinguished,  because the proceeds were approximately  equal  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the balance owing to Ford Credit and the termination provision on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the certificate reads:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Insurance     hereunder    shall    terminate
          automatically  upon  the  earliest   of   the
          following dates: 1) the date the indebtedness
          is fully discharged ....
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  The  appellant takes the position that he paid premiums  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two  different types of insurance - one for repair or replacement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  his vehicle in the event of damage or destruction, and one to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protect  against  the necessity of paying under  the  conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sales  contract in the event of his death or disability.  In  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, the one has nothing to do with the other, and he should  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled  to benefits under both for the purpose for  which  each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">type of insurance was purchased.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  The  amount paid on the Continental insurance was equal  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  value of the automobile at the time of the accident less the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$3,000 deductible. According to the factum of the respondent, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount  of  the  debt  owed to Ford Credit on  the  date  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental payment was only a few hundred dollars less than  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of that cheque. Therefore, for the sake of discussion,  we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can  assume  that  the amounts were equal.  Thus,  prior  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident, the appellant had the vehicle which he used to earn his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">livelihood, he owed a debt for the purchase of that vehicle in an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount equal to the value of the vehicle, and he used the vehicle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  generate  income.  If the respondent is  correct,  after  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident the appellant would have no vehicle with which to earn a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">living, the insurance for the value of the vehicle would be  paid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  Ford  Credit to reduce the amount of the debt  to  zero,  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because the purchase money debt would be satisfied, he would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no disability insurance available from ALICO. If the appellant is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct,  after the accident he would have money to  replace  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle  from the Continental payment, he would have a  debt  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  unpaid purchase price of the vehicle, and he would have  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability  insurance  from ALICO to satisfy  that  debt  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent of $999 for a minimum of 24 months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The trial judge held that the position of the respondent was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the correct one. Before reviewing the reasons of the trial judge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I  wish  to  point out a strange result of his decision.  If  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident   had   resulted   in  damage  which   was   repairable,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental, in all likelihood, would have paid for the repair of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the vehicle, and the appellant, assuming a disability, would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been  entitled  to  have the ALICO benefits  applied  during  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability  to  satisfy his payments under the conditional  sales</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract. The appellant would have been left in the same position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  he  was in before the accident. It is only the fact that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle  was  considered not repairable that  a  cheque  for  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured value was received by the appellant, thereby opening  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way  for  ALICO's argument that the funds should have  been  paid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">over  to  Ford Credit. It is strange that the appellant's  rights</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the ALICO insurance should depend on the extent rather than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fact of accidental damage. Indeed, no accident is required to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trigger  the  disability payments under the ALICO insurance.  Had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant died or fallen ill and been unable to work,  ALICO</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would have been liable to make payments under the policy to  Ford</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Credit,  and the appellant or his estate would have had a vehicle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">free of debt.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  A  1994  decision  of  the  Ontario  Divisional  Court  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned  with  a  somewhat similar issue -- Maidana  Estate  v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Maplex General Insurance Co. (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 85 (Div.  Ct.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In that case, a deceased, whose estate was one of the plaintiffs,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">died  in  a  motor vehicle accident in which his  automobile  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demolished.  Under  a  standard liability policy,  the  defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurer agreed to indemnify the deceased against accidental  loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  or  damage to the vehicle. The deceased had also purchased  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">life   insurance   policy  through  General   Motors   Acceptance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation (&quot;GMAC&quot;), which financed the purchase of the vehicle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The liability insurer prepared a cheque, payable to GMAC, for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value  of  the  vehicle, but did not forward the  cheque  pending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receipt  of  a proof of loss. However, it later denied  liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the policy on the ground that the full value of the car had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been paid to GMAC under the life insurance policy and that to pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  the  liability  policy would result  in  double  recovery.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Speaking for the court on this issue, Southey J. stated at p.90:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  plaintiff is not disentitled to  recover
          from the defendant insurer because the policy
          was  for indemnification and GMAC had already
          been paid the value of the vehicle under  the
          policy  of  insurance that the  deceased  was
          required  to  obtain when  he  purchased  the
          vehicle.   That  policy  was  one   of   life
          insurance,  which would have been payable  on
          the  death of Mr. Maidana, regardless of  the
          cause  of death. If he had died in his sleep,
          with  the  vehicle sitting in  the  driveway,
          G.M.A.C.  would  have  been  paid  off.   The
          vehicle  would  then have been  part  of  his
          estate, and available for sale or use by  the
          persons entitled thereto. Those persons  have
          suffered  the  loss of the  vehicle  and  are
          entitled  to be indemnified under the  policy
          of insurance on the vehicle.


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  The trial judge seemed to be of the view that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  attempting  in this case to effect double  recovery  -  once</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the policy with Continental and once under the policy  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ALICO.  He  did not seriously consider the proposition  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  was  insured for two separate and distinct  hazards  -</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss  or damage of the vehicle, and his inability to service  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ford Credit debt because of disability.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  In addition to the basic facts recited above, other factors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">--  some contractual and some factual -- were considered  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge in reaching his conclusion that the appellant was not</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]  The  provision  on the back side of the &quot;Retail  Instalment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Contract&quot;, assigning &quot;the benefits of any agreements relating  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  property and contract&quot;, which the appellant did  not  recall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeing  or  reading,  is clearly binding  on  him.  However,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question  is  whether &quot;the benefit of any agreements relating  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  property  and contract&quot;, which benefit was assigned  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  to  Bay  Lincoln and by Bay Lincoln  to  Ford  Credit,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">included  the benefit of the Continental insurance,  and  if  so,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether ALICO can claim the benefit of that assignment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] There was no specific assignment of automobile insurance  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either  of  the Bay Lincoln agreements. The trial judge expressed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surprise  at that fact, but considered that the general provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assigning the benefit of agreements was sufficient to effect  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same result.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] He stated at pp. 30 and 31 of his reasons:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...  it  is provided in the Retail Instalment
          Contract  that the buyer (Deb) was  to  &quot;keep
          insurance for all risks on the property&quot;  and
          that  the buyer (Deb) &quot;assigns to the  seller
          the  benefits of any agreements  relating  to
          the property and the contract&quot;. In my opinion
          the  required property insurance would be  an
          &quot;agreement relating to the property&quot;.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35]  I  have some difficulty with that position - first, because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assignment of all &quot;benefits of any agreements relating to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property and the contract&quot; is found in paragraph 3 of &quot;Terms  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conditions&quot;,  in  very small print on the  reverse  side  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Retail  Instalment Contract. It is a vague and general  provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inserted  by the drafter of a standard form contract, and  should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  read  contra  proferentum. Paragraph  7  of  the  &quot;Terms  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conditions&quot; requires that the buyer keep insurance for all  risks</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the  property,  and  also states  that  the  seller  may  buy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance and charge the buyer. It does not contain any  specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">words  of  assignment of insurance. The absence of  any  specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment in the insurance provision itself, combined  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact  that  that provision provides for the seller to obtain  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">own  insurance,  certainly tends to obscure its  intent.  I  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty agreeing with the trial judge that the combination  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs 3 and 7, neither of which refers to the other, amounts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  an assignment in favour of Bay Lincoln of the benefits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">buyer's insurance. Indemnity insurance contracts are personal  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  insured,  and without clear indication of an  assignment  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest  in  favour of another, the insured is entitled  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds for his own use.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36]  In  any  event,  even if it could be  considered  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's coverage with Continental was assigned to Bay Lincoln</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as a result of the provisions discussed above, it is my view that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given  the  purpose  of the insurance with Continental,  and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship  of  Bay  Lincoln with ALICO,  it  would  have  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incumbent on Bay Lincoln, or its assignee Ford Credit,  to  apply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  insurance proceeds to repair or replacement of the  vehicle,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather than to satisfaction of the appellant's indebtedness.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37]  Cases involving application of insurance proceeds to either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repair  or reduction of mortgage debt in general are not helpful,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since  results vary depending on the specific facts of each case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or  the possible application of statute - the latter not being an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue  in this case. However, it must be remembered that in  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case  Bay  Lincoln acted as a de facto sales agent for  ALICO  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtaining the disability insurance. If it were available  to  Bay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lincoln to apply the Continental proceeds to pay off the purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">money  debt of the appellant, it would in fact be nullifying,  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  own act, the effect of disability insurance which it, as  de</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facto agent, sold to the appellant.



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] ALICO, on the other hand, had no interest in or right to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental  proceeds. It had a duty, in return for  the  premium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid  by  the appellant, to service the appellant's debt to  Ford</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Credit in the event of and during his disability, whether through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">illness or accident. Any right of ALICO to claim a termination of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  insurance, depends on the payment in full of the debt of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  to Ford Credit; but, as stated above, Ford Credit  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no  right  to apply the proceeds of the Continental insurance  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case in reduction of the appellant's debt to it and, in  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, it did not have the opportunity to do so.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39]   ALICO is attempting to take advantage of rights which Ford</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Credit,  as assignee of Bay Lincoln, might have had to apply  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds  of  the insurance to the debt owed by the appellant  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it.  It  has  no  independent  rights  to  the  proceeds  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental  insurance.  Given  the  trial  judge's  finding   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability  of  the appellant, and the fact that the  Continental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds  were not actually paid over to Ford Credit and  applied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  payment of the appellant's indebtedness, it is my  view  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ALICO must satisfy the claim under the policy it provided.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) Misstatements of fact by the appellant
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]  In  his application for insurance, the appellant apparently</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not inform Continental that the vehicle was financed. He did,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, inform the insurer that another person owned the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  permitted the vehicle to be used as a limousine  servicing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pearson International Airport, and also of the name of the  fleet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operator   with  whom  he  contracted.  The  cheque   issued   by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Continental following the accident was made out to all  three.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">see no particular relevance to this action of those facts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  When  the appellant told the adjuster that the vehicle  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  leased, he was, of course, telling the truth. If he said  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  the  outright owner (and the evidence is not clear  that  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did),  and  when  he signed the proof of claim  saying  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle was not subject to a conditional sales agreement, he  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  being truthful. However, those statements do not in any  way</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affect  the results of this appeal. They resulted in no  loss  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anyone. The issues involved are legal ones alone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]  I  see  no  reason,  on the facts of  this  case,  why  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  should  be  deprived  of  the  benefit  of  the  ALICO</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Punitive Damages
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43]  The trial judge stated that had he found that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  entitled  to the disability insurance he would have  awarded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive damages as a result of the behaviour of the respondents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basically  because  they provided insurance in this  jurisdiction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  failed  to  deal  with  the claim  of  the  appellant  in  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable  manner,  given the nature of the insurance.  He  also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pointed out that they denied his disability, and alleged that  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acted  fraudulently in making his claim. While I agree  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comments  of the trial judge, I am of the view that the behaviour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the respondent in this matter is more properly addressed by an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award  of  solicitor and client costs of the trial  and  of  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESULT
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44]  I  would  allow the appeal, set aside the judgment  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge, and replace it with a judgment directing payment  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  defendant, ALICO, of disability benefits in  the  amount  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$999.00  for a period of 24 months plus pre-judgment interest.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would order costs in favour of the appellant at trial and on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal on a solicitor and client basis.
