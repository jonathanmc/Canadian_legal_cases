    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>McKINLAY J.A.:</b>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by the father, David Stephen Wilson, of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Walsh dated June 15,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995, varying the divorce judgment of the Honourable Judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Gotlib, dated October 4, 1988 by increasing the amount of child</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support for the one child of the marriage, Sara Wilson, born July</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22, 1980.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The parties were married on November 25, 1979, and separated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in November of 1984. The separation agreement between the parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was effective as of January 1, 1985, but was not executed until</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">June of 1988. It was incorporated into the divorce judgment. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided that the parties have joint custody of the infant child,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with her residence to be alternated between the mother and father</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon an agreed basis. Subsequent to the commencement of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application brought by the mother to vary the amount of support,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and shortly prior to the final arguments in the variation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings, the arrangement was changed, on the recommendation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the daughter's therapist, to provide for the infant child to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reside primarily with the mother.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  At the time of the separation in 1984, the mother was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">working as a freelance journalist, having left a teaching career</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in 1982. When she commenced the application for variation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother had voluntarily given up a reasonably lucrative career as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a journalist and author to undertake a new career in television</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">broadcasting, for which she had no previous experience or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">training.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The separation agreement provided that the father pay the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sum of $850 per month for the maintenance of the infant child,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject to an annual cost of living increase. It required that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mother pay for specific expenses for the child -- the major</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">items being clothing, day care, dental and medical care, extra</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">curricular courses and recreational equipment. The mother was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further required to maintain a trust fund for the child and to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposit therein the sum of $75 per month plus the monthly &quot;baby</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bonus&quot; allowance. The agreement further required the father to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pay two-thirds and the mother one-third of fees for private</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">school, religious school, summer camp, orthodontia, and post</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secondary education, subject to the proviso that the maximum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payment by the mother for camp not exceed $500 in any one summer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period. By the time the application was heard, the monthly amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being paid by the father, as a result of the cost of living</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase, was $1,042.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There was no indication, or comment by the trial judge, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he considered the original agreement, entered into with legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advice, was other than fair at the time it was executed. However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the result of his decision was to require the father to pay to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mother $3,900 per month in before tax child support -- three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and three-quarters times the amount he was paying under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  There were a number of changes in the circumstances of both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the father and the mother between the execution of the original</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement and the hearing of the application. The most important</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of those changes were:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     i)   The mother

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The mother, at the time of the hearing had sold her house</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and purchased a condominium with a male friend with whom she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resided. He was also divorced, and had two children. He had an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">income in excess of $62,000 per annum, and paid no child support.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He contributed $1,000 monthly to the respondent's household</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant agreed that the costs of maintaining his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">daughter had increased with her age.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  There were two other important changes in circumstances</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affecting the mother. First was the child's residence change to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">live solely with her mother, except for every other weekend, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arranged vacations. Second was the mother's decrease in personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">income as a result of her intentional choice of a new career.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     ii)  The father

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The father's income had not increased appreciably from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time the agreement was executed until the time of the hearing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Any increase had varied from year to year, but was approximately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5%. He had remarried, to a former Air Canada flight attendant,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and adopted an infant child. His new wife no longer worked, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he provided the sole support for her and the child.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Expenses of providing housing and maintenance for his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">daughter during the time she spent with her father following the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new residence arrangements decreased only minimally. The decrease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would involve food consumed by her at her father's home, as well</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as transportation and incidentals.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON QUANTUM OF CHILD SUPPORT

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     i)   Cost to the mother of the residence change

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In arriving at his decision as to quantum of child support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be paid by the father, the trial judge made no finding as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the reasonableness of the mother's estimate of the amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required, other than to say that the amount requested by her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;stretches even the limits of these new standards&quot; -- referring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the tendency of courts to increase substantially the amount of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">child support awards which had, over time, drifted to the &quot;low</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">end of any acceptable scale&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The only reason given for the trial judge's decision that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amount paid under the agreement was not sufficient appears to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been the affidavit of the father to the effect that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">total child care expenses for the child on a monthly basis would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximate $35,856 annually. Accepting that figure, he struck an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of $36,000 per annum (exclusive of special expenses such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as orthodontia, camp, counselling etc.), and required that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">husband pay two thirds of that amount, grossed up for tax</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes to $3,900 per month.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In making his decision based on the husband's figures, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apparently did not consider the situation of the child and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parents at the time that affidavit was sworn. At that time, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">child was spending equal amounts of time with each parent. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenses estimated by the father referred to expenses incurred at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">each of the two homes in which the child resided for equal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">periods of time. He actually estimated that the mother's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable expenses would approximate $1,279.47 per month, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his would approximate $1,708.80. Each set of expenses included</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cost of housing as the major item of expense, and other items</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such as a portion of the cost of automobiles, food, clothing and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other usual incidentals.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The changed residence of the child was, by agreement, to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one of the changed circumstances which the trial judge could look</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to in making his decision. It is obvious that in making such a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change, the cost of the fathers' home and automobile did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">become an expense of the mother. Her home expenses would remain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same. However, the trial judge does not appear to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered that the increase in expenses to the mother as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result of having the child ten days more in each four week period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not be substantial, as she was already providing, under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original agreement, a home, an automobile. and other basic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenses. The incremental expenses would involve food for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional ten days in each four week period, and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incidental expenses for the same period.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     ii)  Savings to the father as a result of the residence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     change

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] As with the mother, the most significant cost under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original agreement was the cost of providing a home and an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile used for the child's transportation. Those expenses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not change, although the father could no longer attribute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them to maintenance of the child of this marriage. As stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">above, the true savings would be only in food and incidental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In my view, the trial judge erred in accepting, as the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of his award, the estimate of the husband of expenses based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the upkeep of two households, when the mother provides only one.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     iii) Mother's chosen change in career

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The appellant takes the position that the mother's decrease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in personal income results from her own choice in deciding on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change of career from one which earned her a reasonable income to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one for which she was neither trained nor experienced, and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his share of child care expenses should be based on her ability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to earn, and not on her preference in occupations. The law varies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantially on this point. It is clear that the court will not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">countenance an enhancement or maintaining of the life style of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the applicant in the guise of increased child maintenance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, if the change of occupation is reasonable in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, a decreased income need not be fatal to a claim to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increased child support. The considerations are always fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specific in these cases.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In this case, the trial judge made no finding as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonableness or otherwise of the change. However, he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clearly aware of all the facts, including the father=s new</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marriage and child, and his apportionment of the child support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">burden as two-thirds to the husband and one-third to the wife</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appears to me to be entirely reasonable in the circumstances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FEDERAL CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] While the new Federal Child Support Guidelines were not in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">force at the time of this application, they did come into force</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on May 1, 1997, just prior to the hearing of this appeal. Given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">my view that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct total cost of maintaining the child, I feel that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guidelines are instructive.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] It is difficult to ascertain the income of the mother, given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the very recent nature of her change in occupation. However, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">very low estimate of her probable income would be $40,000. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also obtains a monthly contribution of $1,000, tax free, from her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">male companion. Grossing that amount up for tax purposes would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result in approximately an additional $19,000 per year, resulting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in an income of approximately $59,000. The husband's income is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately $165,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] If one were to apply the guidelines to the original</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation of full joint residential custody, s. 9 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guidelines would appear to apply. Applying the tables to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incomes of each partner, the amount attributable to the mother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be $500. The amount attributable to the husband would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$1,208. The amount payable by the husband to the wife would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$708 after tax. This would be approximately the same as an amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of $1,350 to the wife, grossed up for tax purposes. This does</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not, of course, take into account all of the factors required by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 9 to be considered in such a case, and it would not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">productive here to attempt the exercise. It would appear,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, that the amount being paid under the original agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was on the low side.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Applying the guidelines to the new residential arrangement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this case, the payment required of the husband would be $1208</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after tax per month. Grossed up for tax purposes this would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount to approximately $2,400 per month.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In my view, $2,400 per month, with income tax to be paid by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the wife, would be reasonable on the facts of this case. I would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set aside the judgment below, and replace it with a judgment with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">monthly child support payments as stated above, but with all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other terms to remain unchanged.
