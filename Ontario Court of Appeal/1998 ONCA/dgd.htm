    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted of eight counts arising from two
separate incidents of sexual assault involving his former common-
law spouse. Count 1 (sexual assault) related to the first
incident; counts 2 through 8 related to the second incident. He
was sentenced to a term of 3 years on count 3 (aggravated sexual
assault) and to concurrent sentences of three years on all of the
other counts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant appeals against his conviction. The Crown
seeks leave to appeal against sentence and, if leave is granted,
appeals against sentence.
The conviction appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Preston advanced four
grounds in support of the appeal against conviction. We did not
call upon Mr. Lepofsky, for the Crown, on the first and last of
these grounds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The first ground impugned the trial judge's failure to give
a Vetrovec warning respecting the complainant's evidence. The
trial judge fully reviewed the various frailties in the
complainant's evidence in his charge to the jury, and we do not
agree with the submission that he was obliged to go further and
give a Vetrovec warning. We note that defence counsel did not
take that position at trial and made no objection to the trial
judge's charge in relation to this issue..</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The last ground, which was raised but not pressed, was that
the trial judge did not properly instruct the jury on the subject
of reasonable doubt. The trial judge's charge contained repeated
instructions to the jury to apply the standard of reasonable
doubt and related that standard throughout his review of the law
applicable to the various counts. There was no error in this
regard.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  We called on Mr. Lepofsky to respond to the second and third
grounds advanced by Mr. Preston.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Mr. Preston's second ground arose from the admission in
evidence of the opinion of Dr. Marion, who was not a pathologist,
regarding the possible length of time a piece of wood removed
from the complainant's rectum had been lodged in that area, and
from the trial judge's failure to give any limiting instruction
to the jury on the response that the doctor gave. We observe that
defence counsel at trial admitted the medical qualifications of
the witness, thus obviating the necessity to have the Crown
direct questions to him on the subject. It was defence counsel,
not the Crown, who specifically asked for the opinion of which
the appellant now complains. While the trial judge did not refer
directly to the doctor's opinion in his charge, he did express to
the jury his own view, which was skeptical of the suggestion that
the complainant could have functioned for as long as she said she
did before the discovery and removal of the object. We see no
error in respect of this ground.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Mr. Preston's third ground was the failure of the trial
judge to explain the law of alibi to the jury, particularly as it
related to the subject of fabrication or concoction and the
inference of consciousness of guilt. Mr. Preston conceded that,
in the absence of comments made by trial counsel for the Crown in
her address that invited the jury to draw an inference of guilt
on the basis of the fabricated alibi, it would not have been
incumbent on the trial judge, on the facts of this case, to
instruct the jury in the manner now contended. Although somewhat
overstated and incomplete, the submissions of trial counsel for
the Crown on this issue were nonetheless correct in law when she
said that, if the jury found that the appellant was involved in
the fabrication of the alibi evidence, they could draw an
inference of guilt. Mr. Preston acknowledged that there was
evidence on which the jury could have found that the appellant's
alibi was fabricated by collusion with friends who testified on
his behalf.  In the circumstances, the trial judge's failure to
charge the jury that they could find concoction and, if they did,
could draw the inference of consciousness of guilt redounded to
the appellant's benefit. Defence counsel at trial made no
objection to the absence of such an instruction. His failure to
object may well have been a tactical decision, for the defence
suffered no prejudice from the absence of such an instruction and
the review of the evidence of concoction that would have been
required to put that instruction in context. We see no error in
respect of this ground.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appeal against conviction is dismissed.
The sentence appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] As noted, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to 3 years
in respect of count 3 and to 3 years concurrent in respect of all
of the other counts. We agree with Mr. Lepofsky's submission
that, having regard to the nature of the assaults made by the
appellant upon the complainant, the sentence passed was below the
appropriate range of sentence for these offences. The first
incident, which gave rise to count 1, took place approximately a
month before the second incident, which gave rise to counts 2
through 8. The two incidents were quite different in nature, and
should have resulted in consecutive, not concurrent sentences.
The second incident was by far the more serious, and was fairly
described by Mr. Lepofsky as cruel, premeditated and horrific.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Even taking into account, as the trial judge did, the
appellant's good antecedents and the absence of a criminal
record, the necessity for denunciation of the appellant's conduct
and its terrible impact upon the complainant calls for the
imposition both of consecutive sentences and of a sentence longer
in total than three years. A sentence of 2 years in respect of
the first count and 5 years in respect of the remaining counts
would have been fit and proper. Taking into account the principle
of totality, however, it is our view that an appropriate total
sentence would be six years, of which two years should be imposed
in respect of count 1 and four years in respect of count 3.
Sentences of four years will be imposed on each of the remaining
counts, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in
respect of count 3. The sentences of two years and four years
will run consecutively.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Leave to appeal against sentence is granted, the appeal is
allowed and the sentences imposed are modified in the manner
indicated.
