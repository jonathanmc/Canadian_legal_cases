    </center></div><pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The principal grounds of appeal concern the Charter
violation arising out of the detention of the appellant.
It is not at all clear that this matter was raised before
the trial judge and accordingly no express findings were
made.  In any event, we are satisfied that on the evidence
of the officers, which the trial judge accepted in
preference to the evidence of the appellant, the detention
was justified either on the basis of articulable cause or
for the officers to protect themselves.  The brief
questioning that ensued concerning the items that were in
plain view was not an unjustifiable use of police powers.
Accordingly, we are not satisfied that the appellant has
established a violation of the Charter.

[2]  With respect to the second ground of appeal, we are
satisfied that the trial judge was aware of the principles
in R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) to which
he specifically referred and that he made no error in the
application of those principles.

[3]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
