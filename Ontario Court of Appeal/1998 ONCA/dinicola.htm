<H1>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h1>
    
<p>RE: LUCIA DINICOLA et al (Plaintiffs/Respondents) v. HUANG &amp; DANCZKAY PROPERTIES 
  (Defendant/ Appellant) </p>
<p>BEFORE: FINLAYSON, McKINLAY and LABROSSE JJ.A. </p>
<p>COUNSEL: W. Ross Murray, Q.C. and Wendy J. Earle, for the appellants Harold 
  W. Sterling and Robert W. Kerkmann, for the respondents </p>
<p>HEARD: June 18 and 19, 1998 </p>
<h2 class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT </h2>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals the decision of Beaulieu J. awarding the respondents 
      damages for breach of contract of their respective condominium purchase 
      agreements with the appellant. </p>
    <p>[2] The trial judge rejected the defence that the agreements were frustrated 
      by an unanticipated event, namely the failure to get municipal approval 
      for the project. Additionally, he found that the conduct of the appellant 
      caused or contributed to the non-performance of the agreements. </p>
    <p>[3] It is apparent to us that the risk of the City of Toronto not approving 
      the development was a direct concern of the appellant going into the negotiations 
      of the individual condominium agreements. After all, the agreements were 
      executed before the appellant even owned the property. To perform the agreements, 
      the appellant had to get development approval and as experienced developers 
      they must have been aware that their preferred design for the project could 
      be rejected. This risk was alleviated to some extent by the terms of the 
      agreements, in particular clause 38, an escape clause which permitted the 
      appellant to terminate the agreements without liability on or before June 
      30, 1988, in the event that municipal approval of the development was not 
      obtained. The appellant also protected itself with clauses 25(h) and 26 
      which permitted it to make major design changes. </p>
    <p>[4] It can scarcely be said that clause 38 did not contemplate specifically 
      what happened in this case. The appellant was assuming the risk after June 
      30, 1988 that the municipality might not approve the project. For their 
      part, the respondents made commitments to purchase units, and if the development 
      was not going to proceed as planned as of June 30, 1988 (as was the case 
      since development approval was not obtained), had clause 38 been triggered, 
      then they could have retrieved their deposits and re-entered the market 
      rather than risk that the units may never materialize. However, only the 
      appellant had the ability to terminate without liability under clause 38 
      and it did not do so. Accordingly, the trade-off to the appellant of acquiring 
      the privilege of locking the respondents into the agreements past June 30, 
      1988 was the assumption of the risk that the project might not be approved. 
    </p>
    <p>[5] Accordingly, the trial judge was entitled to find as he did that the 
      appellant could not argue that what occurred was &quot;entirely beyond what 
      was contemplated by the parties&quot;. </p>
    <p>[6] The appellant argues that, nonetheless, what happened here was not 
      a normal approval process. The appellant found itself in a &quot;war&quot; 
      with the City over the development philosophy for the entire harbourfront 
      property -- it was beyond any normal contemplation. The trial judge gives 
      no indication that he did not appreciate the detailed evidence respecting 
      the appellant's problems in negotiations with the City. Additionally, he 
      was entitled on the evidence to find that the conduct of the appellant in 
      failing to respond reasonably to the letter from the Chairman of the Land 
      Use Committee and the subsequent hard line taken with the City contributed 
      to the failure to obtain the requisite approvals for the development. </p>
    <p>[7] The trial judge held that the appellant made a conscious decision to 
      waive the termination right in the escape clause and therefore assumed the 
      risk of liability inherent in the agreements to construct and deliver possession 
      of the units without first obtaining approval for construction. He considered 
      all of the clauses relevant to termination (clauses 6(c), 26, 30(1) and 
      37) and concluded that none of them relieved the appellant from liability. 
    </p>
    <p>[8] The trial judge further held that the appellant failed to use reasonable 
      efforts and failed to take all reasonable steps to obtain the municipal 
      approval required for the proposed project. He also held that the appellant 
      could not rely on its refusal to negotiate with the municipality, which 
      the trial judge found to be unreasonable, to excuse itself from the performance 
      of the agreements. [9] It is essentially on the basis of these findings 
      that the trial judge concluded that the appellants breached the agreements 
      and that the doctrine of frustration could not assist the appellant. The 
      alleged unanticipated event was not &quot;so fundamental as to be regarded 
      by the law both as striking at the root of the agreement and as entirely 
      beyond what was contemplated by the parties when they entered into the agreement&quot;: 
      see Leitch Transport Ltd. v. Neonex International Ltd. et al. (1979), 8 
      B.L.R. 257 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
    <p>[10] The trial judge awarded damages intended to place the respondents 
      in the same position as they would have been had the agreements been performed. 
      The respondents had not only paid the necessary deposits required under 
      the agreements, they had committed themselves to the balance of the purchase 
      price until the proposed date of possession. Accordingly, they should be 
      compensated for the value of their investments as found by the trial judge. 
    </p>
    <p>[11] With respect to the appropriate date to assess the damages, the trial 
      judge rejected the extended possession dates provided for in the agreements 
      and the date of the breach of the agreements. (The appellant did not argue 
      that the date of the breach was the appropriate date and we need not consider 
      it.) The trial judge found that in the circumstances, the date specified 
      in the respective agreements for delivery or possession of the units to 
      the respondents was the appropriate date: see Ritcher v. Simpson (1982), 
      24 R.P.R. 37 (B.C.S.C.). He then based his assessment on the calculation 
      provided by the appellant's expert witness.</p>
    <p> [12] There was ample evidence to support the trial judge's findings and 
      conclusions referred to above. We see no proper basis to interfere. </p>
    <p>[13] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
