    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  At the conclusion of oral argument we advised counsel that
the appeal would be dismissed with reasons to follow. These are
those reasons.

[2]  The appellant has raised a number of grounds of appeal; his
principal ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in
failing to permit him to amend his statement of claim by adding
to it a claim for the cost of long term nursing care, home care,
housekeeping and other services. His proposed amendment did not
quantify these additional claims. Indeed, the proposed amendment
provided that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Particulars as to the nature and costs of
          which will be provided as the same become
          available and in any event prior to the trial
          of the action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant also sought to amend the statement of claim by
adding his children as party plaintiffs under the Family Law Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. The appellant's three children were born in
1979, 1984 and 1989. Their claims for compensation, totalling
$100,000.00, were to be made under s. 61 of the Family Law Act.
The children's claims were for loss of care, guidance and
companionship and for compensation for extra services that the
children (Elif in particular) would have to provide for the
appellant, their father.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The precise wording of the amendment sought is set out in
Schedule B to the notice of motion that was before Somers J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant accepts that had the motion to amend been
granted, he would not have been able to proceed to trial on the
day scheduled for trial. Thus, the motion was also a motion to
adjourn the trial.

[6]  The appellant also submitted that he was denied access to an
interpreter in circumstances giving rise to a miscarriage of
justice and that the trial judge erred in a number of rulings he
made concerning the evidence and in his charge to the jury.

The History of the Action

[7]  The appellant was involved as driver of the front car in a
rear end collision which occurred on August 23, 1988. He
commenced this action in 1990. The appellant and his wife
separated in 1991 and were divorced in 1992. The appellant's
three children came to live with him when their mother returned
to Cyprus in 1993.

[8]  The appellant was examined for discovery in July 1991. In
the course of his examination his then counsel was asked to
provide particulars of any claim that the appellant intended to
make based upon the break-up of his marriage, or in respect of
the effect the accident may have had on his three children. His
counsel agreed that if any such claim were to be made the defence
would be advised and given advance notice of the particulars of
the claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  A pre-trial was held in this action in May 1994 and a trial
date of November 7, 1994, was set. The action was not reached for
trial on November 7, 1994, and it was, therefore, necessary to
secure a new trial date. In due course, June 5, 1995, was agreed
upon as the trial date. Both the appellant and his counsel were
informed of this date in March 1995.

[10] In May 1995, the appellant served a notice of intention to
act in person. By June 1995, the appellant had retained new
counsel. On June 7, 1995, the identified trial date, the
appellant's new counsel (not Mr. Campbell) appeared on behalf of
the appellant before Lane J. He sought an adjournment of the
trial on the basis that he needed further time to prepare and to
permit him to amend the statement of claim by expanding the scope
of his claim, increasing the amount claimed and by adding the
appellant's three children as Family Law Act claimants. Counsel
for the defendants, respondents, opposed the request for the
adjournment and the amendments, however, Lane J. acceded to the
appellant's request in that regard. He endorsed the trial record
as follows:

          New counsel for the plaintiff seeks
          adjournment for amendment to pleading to
          raise FLA claim, chronic pain, effect of
          accident on marriage, which has since been
          dissolved. Adjourned to a new date in the
          Fall to be approved by Team 2 trial co-
          ordinator, R. Sams. New date to be peremptory
          to all persons due to prolonged delay in
          getting this action ready. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Further to Lane J.'s order, December 5, 1995, was selected
as the new trial date. Nothing happened in respect of the
amendments that gave rise to the motion for adjournment before
Lane J. between June 7, 1995, and December 5, 1995, the
peremptory trial date.

[12] On December 5, 1995, when the trial was supposed to begin,
the appellant made essentially the same motion that he had made
on June 7, 1995, before Lane J. When that motion came before
Somers J., as I have said, it was accepted that were the motion
to amend to be granted, the trial could not proceed. After
hearing submissions of counsel, Somers J. stated that he would be
inclined to permit the amendment sought were it not for the
ruling previously made by Lane J. When he dealt with that ruling
he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is no question in my mind that the
          reason Justice Lane ordered that the matter
          be made peremptory was to make it clear that
          all of these amendments were to have taken
          place and to have been completed before this
          matter came on for trial [December 5, 1995],
          otherwise the type of amendment that is
          proposed makes his order meaningless.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Somers J. declined to make the amendment on the basis that
it would be:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...entirely unfair at this stage to allow an
          amendment relating to the cost of future
          care, including long term nursing care, home
          care and housekeeping without extensive
          information being provided to the defendant.
          At this stage, even if there were to be an
          examination for discovery tomorrow, that
          evidence would not be available because it
          has not been gathered together. There simply
          must be an end to the delays.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Somers J. did allow the appellant to increase the amount
claimed for general and special damages from $500,000 to $1
million. The appellant sought to increase his claim to $1.5
million, however, it was agreed that the amendment would be
limited to $1 million, the applicable policy limits. In all other
respects, he dismissed the appellant's motion to amend.

[15] In light of the history of this matter we think that the
trial judge was right to refuse to accede to the appellant's
request to amend the statement of claim to add three FLA
claimants. Trial judges have a responsibility to control the
process that is before them. Here the trial judge listened to the
positions taken by both parties and concluded that, apart from
increasing the amount claimed, it would be unfair to grant the
amendments sought. On the basis of the history of this matter,
the trial judge's conclusion in respect of unfairness was
entirely justified. Appellate intervention is, therefore, not
warranted in respect of this ground of appeal.

The Other Grounds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  The Interpreter Issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] The appellant contends that he was denied access to an
interpreter during part of the trial and that he is, therefore,
entitled to a new trial.

[17] The appellant attended a pre-trial and a mediation without
the assistance of an interpreter. He gave his evidence at trial
with the assistance of the interpreter that he had provided. Our
review of the trial record reveals that there was no reference in
the trial proceedings by the appellant's trial counsel, or by the
appellant, to the need for the assistance of an interpreter for
the appellant during the trial when his interpreter was not
present. In the circumstances, the absence of an interpreter
during part of the trial, did not give rise to a miscarriage of
justice. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) Evidentiary Rulings and the Charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] The appellant also contends that certain rulings made by the
trial judge with respect to evidence that generally related to
his contention that his accident-related injuries caused his
marriage breakdown were inconsistent and that the trial judge
erred in his charge to the jury in failing to place the
appellant's position fairly before the jury. The appellant also
contends that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on
credibility when he failed to emphasize the appellant's
explanation for a mistake (including his difficulty in speaking
and reading English) that he had made in an affidavit on which he
was cross-examined during the trial.

[19] We see no error in the trial judge's ruling on the evidence.
In our view, the charge was fair. The position of the appellant
was clearly put before the jury. We see no merit in this ground
of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
