</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Put at its best for the appellant Downey, but viewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">realistically, the evidence offered no air of reality for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submission that Downey was acting in self-defence as defined in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 37 or s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code when he chased and tackled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the victim during the melee in which Downey, but not the victim,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a participant. We note that Downey did not testify.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  As we read the transcript, counsel for Downey did not ask</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a ruling as to the availability of any of the statutory self-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence provisions in advance of addressing the jury. It follows</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it cannot be said that the judge's failure to provide that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ruling resulted in a miscarriage of justice. We note that counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a co-accused did specifically ask for a ruling as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicability of certain self-defence provisions before he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addressed the jury and the trial judge gave it to him.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge properly instructed the jury as to the law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicable to liability under ss. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Criminal Code. He made the mens rea clear. Although it would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been preferable had the trial judge gone on to specifically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relate those legal principles to the factual issues in this case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we are satisfied that the charge and the review of the evidence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered in their entirety, made it clear to the jury that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could only convict Downey if they were satisfied that his acts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assistance to Watson (eg. procuring the knife or tackling the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">victim) not only had the effect of assisting Watson in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assault, but were performed for that purpose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Watson's Conviction Appeal

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge did not tell the jury that after-the-fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct could not assist in determining whether Watson had the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention to commit murder. It would have been preferable had he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given that specific instruction. He did, however, tell the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the after-the-fact evidence could only be used to determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the accused was attempting to &quot;conceal his part&quot; in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">crime. That instruction would direct the jury to the conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged against Watson and not to his mental state. Nowhere did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge suggest to the jury that the after-the-fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct could be used as evidence of intent. Considered as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whole, we find no error in the trial judge's instruction with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to after-the-fact conduct.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Downey's Sentence Appeal

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge imposed a sentence of 8 years in addition to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21 months pre-trial custody. In doing so, we think he committed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three errors in principle. First, he erred in concluding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Downey knew that Watson was a &quot;user of knives&quot; when Downey</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assisted Watson in the assault of the victim. There was simply no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence from which that inference could be reasonably drawn.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Second, the trial judge erred in principle in totally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discounting Downey's age. Downey was very young (18) and, despite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a bad record, his age should have been given more consideration</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than it was by the trial judge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Finally, we are satisfied that the trial judge erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle in failing to give effect to the objective basis of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Downey's culpability. Downey was convicted as an aider and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">abettor and on the basis that he should have known Watson would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause bodily harm during the assault. He was not found to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended any harm toward the victim. His culpability rested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">primarily on his participation in the street fight.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Even though Downey has a bad criminal record and this is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">most serious offence, we are satisfied that the sentence is too</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">long. We think an appropriate sentence would be time served,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which is four and a half years. Taking into consideration the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time spent in custody prior to conviction, this amounts to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence of about 7 years.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Downey is granted leave to appeal sentence, the appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowed and the sentence is varied in accordance with these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Watson's Sentence Appeal

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The trial judge, notwithstanding the unanimous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recommendation of the jury that there be no increase in Watson's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parole ineligibility, imposed a period of parole ineligibility of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">17 years. In doing so, he erred in principle in the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respects. Assuming the evidence of the other untried outstanding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charges was admissible at all, we are satisfied that he should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have given no weight to the evidence concerning the &quot;7-11</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incident&quot;. That evidence was simply too unreliable to warrant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">using it for anything. We are also satisfied that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was wrong in using the evidence of the other two incidents to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">draw the extreme conclusions he did as to Watson's character.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] We are also satisfied that the trial judge failed to give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adequate consideration to the jury's recommendation. The jury had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heard the evidence and although they had not heard about Watson's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criminal record (which was minor), we think they were in a good</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position to assess Watson's involvement in this offence. Their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unanimous recommendation reflects that assessment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Finally, in our view, the trial judge mischaracterized the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature of the offence that was proved by the Crown against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Watson. The trial judge, in the course of his reasons for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence, said the following:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my view, the evidence shows behaviour on
          the part of Watson that was cruel,
          calculating and deliberate. He stepped up and
          while one or more of his friends held Paul
          Semple down, he buried five inches of an
          eight inch knife in Paul Semple's back. What
          could be more deliberate.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The trial judge later described Watson's conduct as &quot;out and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out gratuitous, vicious violence.&quot; He referred to Watson as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">showing no more empathy than one would if he were &quot;squishing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bugs&quot;. While the seriousness of this crime cannot be denied, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is why Watson is serving a life sentence, the above</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">references from the trial judge's reasons are not justified on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence. This was a street fight, albeit a terrible one,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that got very much out of hand and led to the murder of a totally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">innocent victim. Up to the point where Watson aimed the single</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knife thrust at the victim, his conduct was no different than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that of the several other participants in the brawl.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In our view, a proper sentence in this case is one of life</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imprisonment without eligibility for parole for ten years. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence appeal of Watson is allowed and his sentence is varied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordingly.</font></pre></td>
