FERRIER J.:</strong>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These appeals concern awards of costs made in two actions
arising out of a motor vehicle accident in which a car struck and
killed a cyclist.  The first action was against the alleged
tortfeasors; the second action was against the &quot;underinsurer&quot;,
the plaintiffs' own insurance company. The actions were tried
together.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Parties and their Claims</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Udo Schmieder was the cyclist.  Ursula Schmieder is his
widow and the mother of the minor plaintiffs.  Rovo Chair of
Canada Ltd. was the employer of Udo Schmieder and is owned and
controlled by Ursula Schmieder's family who reside in Germany.
Anay Singh was the driver of the car and his wife Anjila Singh
was the owner.  Mario Parasiliti was a friend of the driver and
had supplied beer to him a few hours before the accident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In March, 1991, Ursula Schmieder and the minor plaintiffs
sued both the Singhs and Parasiliti for damages as a result of
the death of Udo Schmieder.  Rovo Chair claimed damages for the
loss of a key employee.  Ursula Schmieder also advanced a claim
on the basis that her father had promised her and Udo that they
would be gifted the shares of Rovo Chair if Rovo became
financially viable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In a separate claim commenced in May, 1991, Jens Drees,
Administrator of Udo's estate, Ursula Schmieder and the minor
plaintiffs, sued The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company
(Dominion) on the basis of the S.E.F. 44 endorsement contained in
their own automobile insurance policy, to recover any damages
exceeding the policy limits of the tortfeasor's insurance
coverage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The Singh policy limits were $500,000; the available
coverage in the S.E.F. 44 endorsement with Dominion was $500,000;
and the limits on the Parasiliti's homeowner's policy were
$1,000,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Settlement Offers and the Trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On January 9, 1996, seven days prior to trial, the
plaintiffs delivered an offer to settle to the Singhs pursuant to
rule 49.10:  the plaintiffs would release the Singhs for $500,000
plus interest at 9% from August, 1992 forward, plus party and
party costs.  Counsel for the Singhs took the position that this
offer could not be accepted because it exceeded the Singhs'
policy limits.  Counsel also took the position that because there
was another outstanding claim against the Singhs, at the suit of
Udo Schmieder's former wife and their son, he could not accept
the offer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On the eve of trial, a settlement was reached between the
plaintiffs and Dominion in the form of what has become known as a
&quot;Mary Carter&quot; agreement.  The court was advised of this agreement
at the opening of trial.  The effect of the agreement was to put
a cap on the exposure of Dominion by fixing the amount it would
pay.  The agreement also had as its purpose the maximizing of the
exposure of Parasiliti.  Further, if the plaintiffs obtained
judgment against Parasiliti in excess of an agreed figure, the
excess would be applied first to reduce the amount otherwise
payable by Dominion to the plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Upon the execution of the agreement, the plaintiffs and
Dominion joined forces against the remaining defendants.  Counsel
for Dominion remained an active participant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Neither the validity nor the propriety of the Mary Carter
agreement was in issue in this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The trial judge noted in his reasons that it was clear to
all counsel before the trial commenced that Mr. Singh was
responsible for the accident and that there was no contributory
negligence on the part of Udo Schmieder.  Mr. Singh was
travelling at an excessive rate of speed and he was drunk; he was
convicted of impaired driving causing death.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] As indicated in his reasons, at the opening of trial,
counsel for the Singhs advised the trial judge that &quot;by reason of
his retainer&quot; he could not admit liability, but &quot;he would not be
a very active participant in the proceedings.&quot;  The Singhs were
not present, counsel indicating that he could not locate them.
Nevertheless, within days the plaintiffs and Dominion located
them in British Columbia and they were subpoenaed and gave
evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The trial proceeded, and as found by the trial judge, the
issue that occupied most of the trial was the plaintiffs' effort,
with the assistance of Dominion, to fix responsibility against
Parasiliti.  The reason is apparent:  Parasiliti's insurance
coverage was the fund to which the plaintiffs needed access to
achieve full recovery and, in the case of Dominion, the greater
the award against Parasiliti, the greater likelihood Dominion
would have its exposure reduced by reason of the Mary Carter
agreement with the plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Approximately two weeks into the trial, an agreement was
made between the plaintiffs, Dominion and Parasiliti, fixing the
damages of the plaintiffs at $1.3 million and settling the action
against Parasiliti for a payment of $305,000 in satisfaction of
all claims including interest and costs.  Counsel for the Singhs
neither consented to nor opposed the assessment of the damages at
$1.3 million.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] This agreement ended the trial, but the parties could not
agree on costs.  After hearing lengthy submissions, the trial
judge delivered written reasons.  He awarded the plaintiffs costs
on the party and party scale to January 9, 1996, and on the
solicitor-client scale thereafter.  He ordered the costs payable
50% by the Singhs and 50% by Dominion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Dominion appeals on the basis that no costs should be
awarded against it as underinsurer because of the terms of the
S.E.F. 44 endorsement; in the alternative, that such costs should
be on the party and party scale and that in any event they should
be temporally limited, from a point in time later than the
commencement date of the first action, being the action against
the tortfeasor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Dominion also submits in the alternative that the costs be
apportioned between it and the Singhs in proportion to the
quantum of the damages payable by each party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The Singhs appeal the costs award, asking that the scale of
costs be reduced to the party and party scale.  The Singhs also
filed a cross-appeal, taking the position that the $305,000
payment by Parasiliti must have included a substantial sum as
costs, entitling the Singhs to a reduction in their obligation in
costs.  The cross-appeal was abandoned during argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The issues on this appeal are as follows:
     (1)  Whether the court is bound by the provisions of the
          S.E.F. 44 endorsement, such that a trial judge does not
          have discretion to order costs payable to an insured
          against the underinsurer.
     (2)  If the court is not so bound, whether the trial judge
          nevertheless erred in awarding costs against Dominion.
     (3)  Whether the trial judge erred in awarding costs against
          the Singhs and Dominion on the solicitor-client scale.
     (4)  Whether the trial judge erred in failing to apportion
          the costs between Dominion and the Singhs in proportion
          to the quantum of damages payable by each party.
     (5)  Whether the trial judge erred in failing to temporally
          limit the award of costs against Dominion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (1)  The S.E.F. Endorsement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Dominion argued that costs could not be awarded against it
as underinsurer because the Standard Endorsement Form (S.E.F.)
44, by which underinsured motorist coverage is provided, contains
the following provision:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5(e) In determining any amounts an eligible
          claimant is legally entitled to recover from
          an inadequately insured motorist as defined
          in paragraph 1(e)(i), no amount shall be
          included with respect to costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] It was conceded by counsel during argument that the awarding
of costs is in the discretion of the court, as provided in s.
131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          131(1) Subject to the provisions of an Act or
          rules of court, the costs of and incidental
          to a proceeding or a step in a proceeding are
          in the discretion of the court, and the court
          may determine by whom and to what extent the
          costs shall be paid.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Since the S.E.F. 44 is not an Act or rule of court, but
merely a private contract between the parties, it cannot fetter
the discretion of the court to award costs against any party to
the proceeding.  It was therefore within the power of the trial
judge to award costs against Dominion as underinsurer.1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (2)  Dominion's liability for costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The trial judge held that the plaintiffs' effort, with the
assistance of Dominion, to affix Parasiliti with responsibility
took up most of the trial.  He also said at p. 11 of his reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I am satisfied that Mr. Bates, on behalf of
          Dominion Insurance of Canada, in pursuing
          its' contractual rights, expanded the length
          and breadth of this trial, made a settlement
          with Mr. Percival and Mr. Singh difficult if
          not impossible.  He has achieved, and I mean
          no criticism to him or his client,
          contribution from Mr. Parasiliti which
          reduced his own contribution.  I am satisfied
          that the insurers of Mr. Singh have had the
          benefit of the limits of their policy for
          many years, and according to their policy, no
          interest is payable on that amount.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It would be unreasonable for Dominion of
          Canada to derive a windfall by expanding the
          trial without assuming some responsibility
          for the costs.  I accept the reasoning of the
          Ontario Court of Appeal in Broadhurst &amp; Ball
          [Broadhurst &amp; Ball and Allport v. American
          Home Assurance Co., Guardian Assurance Co. of
          Canada and Gestas Inc., 1 O.R. (3d) 225]
          that, &quot;the obligations between the insurers,
          although not governed by contract, should be
          subject to and governed by principles of
          equity and good conscience, which dictated
          that the costs of the litigation should be
          distributed equally between them.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and further at p. 12 of his reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Dominion of Canada's insurers derived a
          substantial benefit by the prosecution of
          this action against Parasiliti primarily at
          their behest, and should bear 50% of the
          costs with Mr. and Mrs. Singh.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Dominion argued that it never became the true effective
litigant in this action as the action against Dominion was
settled.  The plaintiffs continued the tort action against
Parasiliti with the assistance of counsel for Dominion, in an
effort to affix liability on Parasiliti and engage his homeowners
coverage of $1,000,000; to obtain judgment against the Singhs, so
as to allow the plaintiffs to seek to recover on their personal
assets; and also to fulfil the plaintiffs' obligation under the
S.E.F. 44 endorsement paragraph 4(b)(ii) to account for any
monies that the plaintiffs recover or are entitled to recover
from the insurers of &quot;any person jointly liable with the
inadequately insured motorist&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Further, Dominion submitted that the benefit of the trial
and its risk was for the plaintiffs since the plaintiffs, by
proceeding to trial, stood to gain an award in excess of the
primary coverage and the S.E.F. coverage, as agreed upon in the
Mary Carter agreement.  The prosecution of the action against
Parasiliti was not primarily at the behest of Dominion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The learned trial judge considered all of these submissions
and came to the conclusion he did for the reasons above noted.
Whilst Dominion may have some justification in taking the
position that it was not &quot;primarily&quot; at its behest that the
action against Parasiliti proceeded the way it did, it was
nevertheless at least equally at the behest of Dominion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In my opinion, the learned trial judge made no error in
finding Dominion liable for 50% of the costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (3)  The solicitor-client scale</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Absent other considerations, the terms of the plaintiffs'
offer of January 9, 1996, bearing in mind the results at trial,
clearly entitled the plaintiffs to the solicitor-client scale
after that date pursuant to rule 49.10.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Counsel for the Singhs submits that the award should be on
the lower scale.  It was submitted that their insurer could not
accept the plaintiffs' offer because of the outstanding claim of
the former wife and son.  Further, the Singhs were not the true
litigants--rather, Dominion was driving the litigation.  Dominion
needed to fix Parasiliti with some liability, as well as to
obtain judgment against the Singhs in order for the plaintiffs to
recover, under the terms of the S.E.F. 44, from the insurers of
any person jointly liable with the inadequately insured motorist.
Finally, the Singhs did not actively defend the litigation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] It is clear from the reasons of the learned trial judge that
he considered all these submissions and factors when exercising
his discretion.  In my view, he made no error in principle. Both
Dominion and the Singhs were driving the litigation. The Singhs
and their insurer ought not to be able to defeat the operation of
rule 49.10 by raising the argument that the plaintiffs' offer
exceeded the coverage limits; nor by the argument that the
insurer was faced with the additional claims from the former wife
and son. Even if it could be said that the Singhs and their
insurer were in a problematic position in these circumstances,
that position was not contributed to or created by the
plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Dominion argued that rule 49.10 should not be applied
against it because the offer of settlement was not made to it.
To accede to such an argument would ignore the reality of the
circumstances that existed at the time.  Dominion was a key
player.  It was obviously not prepared to abandon its rights
against the Singhs and against Parasiliti.  Further, as found by
the trial judge, Dominion was an active participant in the trial.
The trial judge's reasoning was correct.  He held that because of
the offer of January 9, 1992, the solicitor-client scale should
be applied after that date against the Singhs.  He then found
that Dominion should bear 50% of those costs.  He did not err in
doing so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (4)  Apportionment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] While it may be open to a trial judge, after considering all
relevant circumstances, to exercise his discretion by
apportioning the costs between the tortfeasor and the
underinsurer in proportion to the quantum of damages payable by
each, the failure to do so in this case was not an error in
principle.  The trial judge carefully considered the degree of
responsibility for the costs as between the tortfeasor and the
underinsurer in the circumstances as he found them.  He did not
err in the exercise of his discretion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (5)  Temporal limitation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] Dominion argued that the only justification for awarding
costs against it would be because at some time it became the true
effective litigant.  It was not sued until several weeks after
the action against the tortfeasor was commenced.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Once again, this argument ignores the reality of the
circumstances.  It was clear that the Singhs were liable for
damages.  It was clear that their insurance coverage was
inadequate.  It was clear that Dominion would be involved.  All
of this was known to all the parties before any litigation was
commenced.  That is to say, Dominion was a participant from the
beginning of the first action, even though formally not a party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] In the circumstances described by the trial judge, he did
not err in making the award against Dominion--which is effective
in its scope from the beginning of the action against the
tortfeasor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In conclusion, not only do I find no error in principle made
by the learned trial judge,  I agree with his decision and I
would dismiss each appeal with costs.
