    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    This is an interlocutory motion within an appeal, albeit
that it has been made returnable before a full panel of this
Court.

[2]    The application seeks a determination of whether this
court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and, if it does, then
an order staying the trial proceedings presently in progress
before O'Driscoll J. and a jury.

[3]    We answer the second question first. The stay that is
sought is not of the order under appeal. It is against
proceedings in the General Division. We must determine whether an
order is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party pending the
appeal. When reaching out beyond proceedings in this Court to
impose, even temporarily, on those in another court, we must have
a strong basis for doing so. Here, we are given no basis except
that the trial is ongoing and will likely be finished before the
appeal is heard. There is no transcript of the events at trial
that are complained of and we have no way of assessing the merits
of what is ultimately sought and balancing against the obvious
prejudice in disrupting a criminal trial.

[4]    Even if we had such evidence it is difficult to conceive
of a justification for an interlocutory order with such
disruptive implications, given that the appellant will have
appropriate remedies available to him after the trial. We make
that observation solely in the context of this interlocutory
request for intervention.

[5]    We are not prepared to grant relief, assuming we have
jurisdiction, and it is therefore not necessary to deal with the
jurisdiction issue. No doubt that issue will be raised on the
appeal and it is best left for the panel hearing the appeal when
the questions concerning the functions of the trial judge,
Smith A.C.J.O. and this court can be considered as a composite
whole.

[6]    The application is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
