  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant raised five issues on his
    appeal from the dismissal of his action for defamation consequent upon the
    respondents’ successful application for a non-suit.  We think that the first three issues raised by the appellant can
    properly be collapsed into one issue.  The other two issues concern the procedure that the trial judge followed
    when the respondents applied for a non-suit and whether the trial judge erred
    in exercising her discretion to fix costs as she did.</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE 1 – Assuming, for purposes of
    analysis, that the television broadcast in issue was about the plaintiff were
    the words used capable of defamatory meaning?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded that the
    words used were not capable of defamatory meaning.  In her extensive review of the evidence and the law, she wrote:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>            In looking at the ordinary and
    natural meaning of the words complained of (i.e. the Statements), I have
    concluded that no reasonable right thinking person would come to the conclusion
    that the Statements are capable of any defamatory meaning to the plaintiff.  The Statements contain no suggestion that
    the plaintiff committed any wrongdoing nor is there any derogatory statement
    contained therein about him.  To put it
    another way, the Statements do not amount to disparagement of the plaintiff’s
    reputation in the eyes of right thinking people. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then addressed the
    false innuendo pleaded in paragraph 7(a) to (d) of the appellant’s statement of
    claim.  On that issue she wrote:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff’s
    evidence does not support a conclusion that the words complained of bear
    defamatory meaning as alleged in paragraph 7. ... The innuendoes pleaded are
    not capable of bearing defamatory meaning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge held that the
    false innuendo alleged in paragraph 7 of the statement of claim should not be
    considered in context because the appellant’s pleadings do not assert that
    position, she nonetheless went on to find that “even if context had been
    pleaded, the plaintiff could not succeed.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Apart from the implications of the
    context issue, the appellant takes no issue with the principles applied by the
    trial judge in determining whether the broadcast in issue was capable of
    defamatory meaning in respect of the plaintiff.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the trial judge carefully
    and fairly considered all of the relevant evidence and correctly applied the
    law when she concluded that the ordinary meaning of the words in issue,
    including pleaded false innuendo, could not be taken by a reasonable right
    thinking person to be capable of defaming the appellant. We agree with the
    trial judge’s conclusion and with the path that she followed in reaching it. We
    would, therefore, not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE 2 – Should the respondents have
    been put to their election to call, or not call, evidence when they applied for
    a non-suit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the
    respondent should have been required to elect whether to call evidence as part
    of the non-suit application process.  The respondent’s position is that in a defamation action, it is well
    established that the defence will not be put to an election when applying for a
    non-suit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that since this
    was an action for defamation, she should not put the respondents to their
    election to call evidence as part of the non-suit motion process.  In reaching that conclusion she relied upon
    Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>The Law of
    Evidence in Canada</i>, 1992, Butterworths, at p. 135 where the authors, citing <i>M.V.“Polar Star” v. Louis Denker Inc.</i> (1965), 53 D.L.R. (2d) 181 (P.E.I. C.A.) stated:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>In actions of
    libel and slander, on a motion for a non-suit, the defendant is not put to his
    or her election as to whether he or she intends to call evidence.  Rather, the judge decides the question at
    the moment that the motion is brought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Polar
    Star</i>, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal set out the procedure to be
    followed on non-suit motions.  The
    prescribed procedure involved putting the defence to an election whether to
    call evidence.  However, the P.E.I. Court
    of Appeal recognized that in defamation actions the election requirement did
    not apply.  See <i>Polar Star</i> at p.187.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the circumstances of this case, any
    failure of the trial judge in respect of the defence election issue is of no
    consequence. Indeed, the appellant conceded that if we upheld the trial judge’s
    finding on the issue whether the words used were capable of defamatory meaning,
    the failure of the trial judge to put the respondents to their election was of
    no practical or legal consequence in the circumstances of this case.  We think this concession was appropriate in
    light of the basis upon which the non-suit was granted.  We thus do not think that it is necessary to
    exhaustively analyze this issue in this case.  Suffice it to say, we are not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong
    in not requiring the respondents to elect particularly in light of the basis
    upon which the respondents sought a non-suit – that the words in issue were not
    capable of defamatory meaning, even if taken in context.  In these circumstances, there is no prospect
    that defence evidence could fill the gaps, that is, cure the problems faced by
    the appellant at the close of his case.  We do not wish to be taken to have concluded that in <u>all</u> defamation cases, where a plaintiff moves for a non-suit the trial judge should
    not require the defence to elect.  That
    issue can be considered in another case when the court is required to consider
    it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE 3 – Fixing Costs</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the appellant did not
    formally apply for leave to appeal costs we have taken it that the appellant
    seeks leave to appeal costs and if leave is granted to appeal costs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submitted that the
    central issue giving rise to the non-suit (i.e. was the broadcast capable of
    defamatory meaning in respect of the plaintiff) could have been determined by
    an application under Rule 21.01.  The
    trial judge considered this submission and rejected it.  We cannot say that she was wrong in reaching
    the conclusion she did in respect of this submission. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge received extensive
    submissions on the issue of costs and she gave careful consideration to the
    question whether she should fix costs.  We do not think she erred in deciding to fix costs or in fixing them at
    $32,382.42 plus GST.  The process
    followed by the trial judge in fixing costs was entirely appropriate. It was
    not an arbitrary process as suggested by the appellant. In our view, the trial
    judge in fixing costs, in the amount that she did, met the requirements set out
    by Morden A.C.J.O. in <i>Murano et al. V.
    Bank of Montreal</i>, [1998] O.J. 2897.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no merit in this ground of
    appeal.  Leave is granted, but the
    appeal in respect of costs is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingblank><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'><span

lang=EN-US>               It would appear
    that in defamation actions trial judges in Ontario have with some consistency
    not put the defence to an election as part of the non-suit process. For
    example, in <i>Eagleson v. The Globe and
    Mail et al.</i> Ferrier J., following the trial judge’s finding on this issue
    in this case, did not put the defence to an election.</span></p>
