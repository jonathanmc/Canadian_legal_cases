    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FINLAYSON J.A.:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Sedgwick J. of the

Ontario Court (General Division) in which he dismissed the

plaintiff’s action for damages arising out of his purchase of

certain lands in the City of Ottawa, which had been given an

erroneous designation under the existing zoning by-law (By-law Z-
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2K).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Appeal as to liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  The subject lands were purchased for $310,000 by the

plaintiff, now appellant, from Imperial Oil Limited pursuant to

an unconditional agreement of purchase and sale dated May 14,

1985. There was an abandoned Esso gas service station on the

site. It is conceded that prior to entering into the offer and

again prior to closing the transaction, the appellant was assured

orally by a Zoning Information Officer and in writing after

closing by a Zoning Compliance Officer that By-law Z-2K

designated the zoning of the property for general commercial use

(C1-c (1.0)), except as a service station. Since the appellant

contemplated the construction of a shopping centre, the specific

restriction did not bother him. His position is that he relied on

these representations from the City in agreeing to purchase the

subject lands and further in closing the transaction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  By-law Z-2K was a comprehensive zoning by-law that replaced

an earlier comprehensive zoning by-law, By-law AZ-64, that had

become cumbersome over time because of multiple amendments. By-

law Z-2K was not intended to make substantive changes in the

zoning but was to replicate the existing zoning in more readable

form. Unfortunately, in making the transpositions, a great number

of errors were made including a major one for the subject

property. The original zoning called for a use restricted to

“only” a gasoline service station while the replacement by-law

provided for any permitted commercial use except “a gasoline

service station shall not be permitted”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  It is submitted by the appellant that while the employees of

the City responded accurately and in good faith to the request as

to the status of the zoning on the subject site, there were

senior members of the planning department who were aware that

there were a number of errors in By-law Z-2K and, in particular,

were aware of the error with respect to this subject land.

However, steps to address all of the errors were not taken until

after the appellant had purchased his property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  In May of 1985, Ms. Lee-Anne Coveyduck was hired to become

the Senior Planner responsible for setting up a process to

correct what the City referred to as “anomalies” in By-law Z-2K,

but a report recommending the correction of the error relating to

the subject lands was not made until June 17, 1986 and the

correction was not made until August 6, 1986 when By-law 256-86

was passed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  The trial judge made no finding of negligence against the

City and, indeed, found that the representations that were made

by the Zoning Information and Compliance Officers were true in

that the persons making them had accurately and in good faith

relayed what By-law Z-2K set out. He did not, however, address

the allegation of underlying negligence on the part of senior

planning officers who were aware of the errors in By-law Z-2K and

had never given advice to those employees dealing with the public

that they could not rely on the zoning designations in the by-

law, particularly as they related to the subject property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The respondent City argues that the trial judge was correct

in finding that there were no false statements and argues against

extending our enquiry into the alleged negligence of senior

planning officials who were slow to recognise the anomalies and

slower to institute a process to correct them. Counsel refers to

a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Virdi v.

Inland Feeders, [1982] 1 W.W.R. 551. In Virdi, supra, on very

similar facts, the trial judge found that there was no negligence

on the part of a municipal employee who gave information relating

to zoning in response to an enquiry, but imposed liability on the

municipality on the basis that it should be liable for damages

sustained by a citizen when the citizen relies to his or her

detriment on an assurance given by a municipal employee whose

responsibility includes the field of activity to which the

assurance relates and if the assurance proves to be wrong.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  In delivering the judgment of the court, Lambert J.A. stated

at p. 558:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I share the concern of the trial judge
          not to thwart the stable and practical
          conduct of municipal business. But I doubt
          that imposing an absolute liability on
          municipal officers if their assurances or
          representations turn out to be wrong will
          achieve that end. I would anticipate that it
          would put an end to all open communication
          with municipal officers. It is one thing to
          say that municipal officers must be careful
          and skilful and reasonably competent, and
          that if they are not they may be liable in
          negligence. It is another thing to say that
          they must be right in their representations
          or they and their municipality will both be
          liable to compensate anyone who suffers loss
          by acting on an incorrect representation. In
          the latter case the municipal officers become
          insurers that the building projects in their
          municipalities will not be threatened by
          zoning or building codes or whatever else the
          representation concerns.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In the case on appeal, the trial judge was not prepared to

say that any misrepresentations were made, much less that they

were negligent. We do not have any finding of negligence by the

trial judge against those employees who represent the City to the

public and there are no findings with respect to when it might

have been reasonable for the City bureaucracy to recognise and

correct the problems that emerged in administering By-law Z-2K. I

do not feel that it is appropriate that this court should make

such primary findings in the absence of  findings of fact below

that would support them. Accordingly, accepting the arguments of

the appellant at their highest, the most the appellant can

achieve is a new trial. However, set against a new trial, we must

recognize that we are dealing with a very old case and a trial

record that does not contain evidence that the appellant suffered

any significant damage recognized at law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Appeal as to damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] The appellant’s approach to damages is quite extraordinary.

He seems to think that he had won the lottery. He asserts that

since he purchased the subject property because he relied to his

detriment on a negligent misrepresentation as to its zoning

status that the measure of his damages is the difference between

what he paid for the property and what it would have been worth

if the representation was true. As evidence of the quantum of his

loss, he placed in evidence a somewhat suspect agreement of

purchase and sale dated June 13, 1986 that was conditional upon

the purchaser obtaining within 30 days site plan approval of a

site plan submitted by the appellant’s architect for a 13,000

square foot commercial plaza. The purchase price was $1,150,000.

The appellant’s profit on the resale of the subject property

almost a year to the day after he bought it would have been

$840,000 but, of course, the purchaser declined to close when the

City refused to approve the site plan. The refusal was hardly a

surprise. The appellant knew at the time the agreement was

executed that the City’s Director of Planning had, in a letter

dated May 2, 1986, criticised his architect’s site plan on the

basis of access and building location and concluded his letter by

stating:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Respecting the proposed use itself, it
          is our opinion that a commercial plaza is
          probably the worst use of the site due to
          late night operations, weekend use and
          traffic and noise which these uses often
          generate.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] This argument of the appellant assumes that the original

vendor of the subject property was prepared to part with it at a

price that must have seemed a bargain to the appellant because

the original vendor was not aware of the alleged

misrepresentation and must have been of the belief that the

property would have to be rezoned if it was to be developed for

something other than a service station. We must also assume that

the second purchaser was under the same misconception as the

appellant, otherwise there can be no explanation of why the

second purchaser would be prepared to pay the appellant three

times what it cost the appellant. It would thus appear that if

the original vendor was the only one who was not deceived as to

the true state of affairs, then the true value of the property

was what he was prepared to sell it for. I only point this out to

demonstrate the problem of attempting to proceed on the basis of

compensation put forward by the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] However, it is not necessary to get involved in such a

circular analysis because the law on this subject is clear. Where

a negligent misrepresentation induces a party to enter into a

contract, the injured party who seeks damages in tort is

entitled, so far as money can do so, to be put in the same

position that he would have been in had the negligent statement

not been made, not the position he would have been had the

statement been true: see Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Mardon,

[1976] 2 All. E.R. 5 (C.A.) at 16 and a recent decision of this

court, Garvey J. Samson and Patricia Ann Samson v. Bruce Lockwood

and Royal Lepage Real Estate Services Ltd. and James A. Snow,

released June 11, 1998, at paragraph 26. In the case in appeal,

the damages are limited to the difference between the price the

appellant paid for the property and the actual value of the

property at the time of the purchase: see Hauck v. Dixon (1975),

10 O.R. (2d) 605 (H.C.J.) at 611 and Toronto Industrial

Leaseholds Ltd. v. Posesorski (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).

There was no evidence as to what this difference was.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] It is important to remember that while the City reimposed

the restrictive zoning on the subject property through By-law 256-

86, its officials made it abundantly clear from the outset that

the City did not intend to restrict the appellant to building a

service station. They felt that an appropriate commercial use

could be determined through negotiation with the appellant.

Having been rebuffed by the City with respect his original site

plan, the appellant hired a lawyer experienced in these matters

and was able to obtain agreement to construct a shopping centre,

albeit one of reduced dimensions from that original proposed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] However, not content with claiming his loss of “profit” on

the resale of the property of $840,000, the appellant also seeks

damages for carrying costs in the form of municipal taxes of

$22,419.29 covering the extended period of negotiations and legal

and planning expenses of $63,484.29 in restoring the limited

commercial zoning to the property. The total damages claimed are

$925,903.58 and pre-judgment interest at 10%.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] One is obliged to ask how a person could invest $310,000 in

a vacant piece of land and manage to suffer damages amounting to

three times what he paid for the property in the first place.

Simply articulating this proposition should be enough to put the

court on its guard. I would have thought the appellant’s maximum

loss could not exceed the full purchase price assuming he let it

go for taxes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] In my opinion, the appellant had three options upon finding

out that he was misinformed about the history of the by-law

current at that time (By-law Z-2K):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          1.   He could have insisted upon a building permit in
          conformity with By-law Z-2K as suggested by the trial
          judge;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   He could have sold the property on the market with
          notice to the purchaser about the zoning problem and
          claimed the difference between what he paid for it and
          what he received for it in the market plus any
          unrecovered out-of-pocket expenses associated with the
          original purchase;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   He could have accepted the City’s invitation to
          negotiate realistic zoning restrictions for the subject
          property and obtained site plan approval for a
          commercial development.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] After all the dust was settled, the appellant effectively

proceeded with option three. While the respondent concedes that

the appellant suffered some additional expense in attempting to

force the City to recognise the category of commercial zoning

that the appellant believed was already in place, the appellant

is quite wrong to think that he was entitled to recover from the

City costs that any developer would have had to incur in

developing a vacant piece of land for a use radically different

from its original use.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] There can be no doubt that the appellant suffered some

damage on the basis of his reliance on By-law Z-2K. The trial

judge thought so but did not attempt to quantify the amount

because he found that the appellant did not have a cause of

action. The respondent’s counsel conceded that there must be some

damage arising out of the delay in negotiating an agreement with

the City for a usable zoning restriction, but his concession as

to amount was a modest one. For my part, I do not think that the

appellant should be given a second chance to lead evidence to

support a realistic estimate of damage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] In reflecting on this case and the limited scope for a

possible finding of negligence and damages, I do not think it

worth while to send this matter back for a new trial on either

liability or damage. The appellant simply did not prove his case.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</font></pre>
