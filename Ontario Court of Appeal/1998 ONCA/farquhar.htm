    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><strong>BY THE COURT:
</strong>
The action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The parties to this action are dentists who, at the relevant

time, were practising in association in Kapuskasing.  They had

entered into a written agreement, by which the senior dentist,

Dr. Paquin, agreed to sell the practice to the younger dentist,

Dr Farquhar. The transaction was to close on June 1st, 1991. It

did not close. On May 31st, 1991, Dr. Paquin's lawyer wrote to

Dr. Farquhar purporting to terminate the agreement.  On receipt

of that letter, Dr. Farquhar immediately committed to new

premises and moved into them. Loukidelis J. found that Dr.

Paquin's actions constituted a breach of the agreement, entitling

Dr. Farquhar to damages, and calculated those damages to be

$25,491.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appeal and the cross-appeal
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Dr. Paquin appealed, and Dr. Farquhar cross-appealed, from

the judgment of Loukidelis J. In addition to the quantum of

damages, Dr. Paquin appealed from the finding that he had

breached the agreement with Dr. Farquhar; appealed from the order

made by Loukidelis J. striking out the jury notice and proceeding

to hear the action without a jury; and appealed from the finding

made by Loukidelis J. that Dr. Farquhar, in immediately leaving

the dental practice upon receipt of the letter from Dr. Paquin's

lawyer and setting up his own new practice, was not acting

precipitously and had not thereby failed to mitigate his damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  The first of these three grounds was abandoned at the

commencement of the argument. With respect to the second ground,

it is our view that the order striking out the jury notice was

one which Loukidelis J. was entitled, in the exercise of his

discretion, to make and we are not persuaded that he made any

reversible error in exercising his discretion as he did. With

respect to the third ground, there was evidence on which

Loukidelis J. could reasonably find, as he did, that Dr. Farquhar

acted properly in immediately relocating his practice and thereby

mitigated his damages, and we are not prepared to interfere with

that finding.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The damages awarded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  The remaining issues argued on the appeal and the cross-

appeal all related to the quantum of damages. To put these issues

in context, it is necessary to indicate the damages awarded and

the basis of their calculation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  Loukidelis J. held that the damages to which Dr. Farquhar

was entitled as properly flowing from Dr. Paquin's breach were as

follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1) replacement of equipment               $28,660.00

          (3) relocation expenses                      4,800.00
          (4) cost of leasehold improvements          11,106.00
          (5) reimbursement for renovations            4,000.00
          (6) loss of hygienists' revenue             39,954.00
          Total:                                    $105,491.00
          Less:
          (7) credit unpaid purchase price
              under the agreement                     80,000.00

          Total damages awarded                      $25,491.00</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (6)  Loss of hygienists' revenue: $39,954</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] Dr. Farquhar asserted no claim for lost dental revenue.

However, he did assert a claim for loss of substantial

hygienists' revenue during the months following the relocation of

his practice. In awarding $39,954 under this heading, Loukidelis

J. said, in his reasons for judgment:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It took four to six weeks to set up his new
          office and it took four to six months before
          his one full time hygienist was fully booked.
          For a shorter period he would have had the
          revenue from a second hygienist. I would
          allow four months for one hygienist plus two
          months for a second hygienist or a total of
          six months as a fair period of lost revenue.
          I accept [Dr. Farquhar's expert's]
          calculations of the average monthly
          contribution margin of $6,659, for a total of
          $39,954.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] With deference, the evidence adduced at the trial did not

support any award of damages under this heading. Both the

evidence of Guylaine Ouellette-Godin, the hygienist who moved

with Dr. Farquhar to his new practice, and the summary sheet

prepared by Mr. Holmes, the expert from Ernst &amp; Young called by

Dr. Farquhar at trial, indicated that there was no damage

sustained as a result of the loss of the first hygienist during

this period. The further two months for the loss of a second

hygienist flies in the face of the trial judge's finding that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Without Paquin's presence, the need for two
          full time hygienists was much less probable.
          The number of dentists in Ontario who alone
          employ two full time hygienists is extremely
          small. Given also the poor local economy,
          competition, the decision to go &quot;off
          assignment&quot; and his obvious health problems,
          I strongly doubt Farquhar's ability to
          maintain a practice with two full time
          hygienists.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] Accordingly, we have concluded that Dr. Farquhar's damages

must be reduced by the amount of $39,954 awarded for lost

hygienists' revenue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The cross-appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] Dr. Farquhar's cross-appeal sought a substantial increase in

the amounts awarded in the heads of damages indicated above. We

did not invite Mr. Farb to respond to the cross-appeal. The

increase sought was at odds with findings made by Loukidelis J.,

and we would make no revision to the damages awarded to Dr.

Farquhar other than that indicated with respect to item (6),

above.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The credit of $80,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] The foregoing reasons dispose of all the grounds of appeal

and cross-appeal raised by the parties. One further item that

neither counsel raised, but that caused us some concern, was the

credit of $80,000 shown as item (7), above, given to Dr. Paquin

against Dr. Farquhar's damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] The $80,000 was the amount of the unpaid purchase price

under the agreement between the parties that never closed. At the

conclusion of the argument, we invited counsel for the parties to

make written submissions regarding the appropriateness of the

$80,000 credit, reserving our entitlement not to deal with that

aspect of the decision of Loukidelis J. on the ground that

neither counsel had seen fit to raise it on the appeal or the

cross-appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] In her written submission on behalf of Dr. Farquhar, Ms.

Irwin noted that the $80,000 was an adjustment made by Dr.

Farquhar's expert witness, Mr. Holmes, as part of his methodology

in calculating the costs associated with setting up a new

practice. In Ms. Irwin's submission, Loukidelis J. fell into

error when he rejected Mr. Holmes' methodology in respect of the

claim for lost hygienists' revenue and approached the calculation

of such lost income on the &quot;cash approach&quot; or the &quot;out of pocket

approach&quot; but nevertheless gave credit to Dr. Paquin for an

amount which, on such an approach, should not have been offset

against Dr. Farquhar's damages. She asked that we either disallow

the $80,000 deduction or permit it to stand as a credit against

an award for &quot;set-up costs&quot; in an amount more than five times the

total damages awarded at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19]  In his written submission on behalf of Dr. Paquin, Mr. Farb

noted that, if we were to disallow the damages of $39,954 for

lost hygienists' revenue (as we have concluded we should do), the

damage award to Dr. Farquhar would be $65,537; and that if, as he

submitted, the $80,000 credit against Dr. Farquhar was

maintained, the net result would be that Dr. Farquhar's damages

of $65,537 would be less than his obligation to pay Dr. Paquin by

$14,463, the difference between $80,000 and $65,537. In his

written submission, he summarized the result as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the end result His Honour would have
          concluded that although Dr. Paquin was in
          technical breach of the Asset Purchase
          Agreement, the amount of damages suffered by
          Dr. Farquhar was less than the $80,000 he
          would have paid, had the transaction been
          completed and His Honour would then have been
          obliged to dismiss [Dr. Farquhar's] action
          with costs to [Dr. Paquin], as [Dr. Farquhar]
          suffered no damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] Mr. Farb concluded his submission with an alternative

suggestion, namely, that the fair result would be to order the

dismissal, without costs, of Dr. Farquhar's action against Dr.

Paquin.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] We agree with the submission quoted in paragraph 19. The

revised cost of replacing what Dr. Farquhar would have gained

from the agreement was $65,537.00. This means he was overpaying

for the business and made a fortuitous gain when he was able to

avoid the $80,000 payment. In truth, he suffered no damages.

Given that this $80,000 credit was never claimed by Dr. Paquin,

either at trial or in this court, we adopt the alternate

suggestion of counsel for Dr. Paquin that the action be dismissed

without costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22] We turn, lastly, to the costs in this court. Although Dr.

Paquin succeeded with respect to the award for lost hygienists'

revenue, he either abandoned or was unsuccessful on all of the

other aspects of his appeal. Dr. Farquhar was unsuccessful on his

cross-appeal. In these circumstances, we consider it appropriate

that the appeal be allowed to the limited extent of substituting

a judgment dismissing the action without costs, that the appeal

be otherwise dismissed and that the cross-appeal be dismissed,

all without costs to either party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] An order will issue in the following terms:

(a)  allowing the appeal to the extent of setting aside the
     judgment of Loukidelis J. and substituting a judgment
     dismissing the action without costs to either party;
(b)  otherwise dismissing the appeal, without costs to either
     party; and
(c)  dismissing the cross-appeal without costs to either party.
