    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  1995,  on how best to accomplish equity and equal opportunity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the workplace. The term &quot;employment equity&quot;, a term coined in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Report  of  the Commission on Equality in  Employment,  1984</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(R.S.  Abella, Commissioner) (the &quot;Abella Report&quot;) at p.  7,  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopted  by  the  previous government to describe  the  mandatory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scheme enacted to carry out this purpose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   The  motivation  for the 1993 Act was,  appropriately,  set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forth in its preamble which reads:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The   people   of   Ontario  recognize   that
          Aboriginal  people, people with disabilities,
          members   of  racial  minorities  and   women
          experience higher rates of unemployment  than
          other  people  in  Ontario.  The  people   of
          Ontario  also recognize that people in  these
          groups  experience  more discrimination  than
          other   people  in  finding  employment,   in
          retaining  employment and in being  promoted.
          As  a  result,  they are underrepresented  in
          most  areas  of  employment,  especially   in
          senior and management positions, and they are
          overrepresented in those areas of  employment
          that  provide low pay and little  chance  for
          advancement. The burden imposed on the people
          in  these  groups and on the  communities  in
          which they live is unacceptable.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  people  of Ontario recognize  that  this
          lack of employment equity exists in both  the
          public and private sectors of Ontario. It  is
          caused  in  part by systemic and  intentional
          discrimination in employment. People of merit
          are    too   often   overlooked   or   denied
          opportunities because of this discrimination.
          The  people  of Ontario recognize  that  when
          objective    standards   govern    employment
          opportunities, Ontario will have a  workforce
          that is truly representative of its society.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  people of Ontario have recognized in the
          Human  Rights Code the inherent  dignity  and
          equal  and inalienable rights of all  members
          of the human family and have recognized those
          rights  in  respect  of  employment  in  such
          statutes as the Employment Standards Act  and
          the  Pay  Equity  Act. This Act  extends  the
          principles  of  those Acts  and  has  as  its
          object  the  amelioration  of  conditions  in
          employment for Aboriginal people, people with
          disabilities,  members of  racial  minorities
          and  women  in all workplaces in Ontario  and
          the  provision of the opportunity for  people
          in  these groups to fulfil their potential in
          employment.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The   people   of   Ontario  recognize   that
          eliminating discrimination in employment  and
          increasing the opportunity of individuals  to
          contribute in the workplace will benefit  all
          people in Ontario.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Although   the  preamble  refers  to  both  systemic   and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intentional  discrimination in employment it is  clear  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">chief  target  of  the statute was systemic discrimination.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form  of  discrimination has been described  as  follows  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Abella Report at p. 2 as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Discrimination  ... means  practices  or
          attitudes  that have, whether  by  design  or
          impact,    the   effect   of   limiting    an
          individual's  or  a  group's  right  to   the
          opportunities generally available because  of
          attributed      rather      than       actual
          characteristics.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It  is  not  a question of whether  this
          discrimination is motivated by an intentional
          desire  to  obstruct someone's potential,  or
          whether  it  is the accidental by-product  of
          innocently motivated practices or systems. If
          the barrier is affecting certain groups in  a
          disproportionately  negative  way,  it  is  a
          signal  that the practices that lead to  this
          adverse impact may be discriminatory.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This  is why it is important to look  at
          the results of a system.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This description was accepted by Dickson C.J.C. for the court  in
Action  Travail  des  Femmes v. Canadian  National  Railway  Co.,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at 1138-39. He went on to say at p. 1139:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In other words, systemic discrimination in an
          employment  context  is  discrimination  that
          results   from   the  simple   operation   of
          established procedures of recruitment, hiring
          and  promotion, none of which is  necessarily
          designed   to  promote  discrimination.   The
          discrimination is then reinforced by the very
          exclusion of the disadvantaged group  because
          the exclusion fosters the belief, both within
          and outside the group, that the exclusion  is
          the  result of &quot;natural&quot; forces, for example,
          that  women &quot;just can't do the job&quot; (see  the
          Abella  Report, pp. 9-10). To combat systemic
          discrimination, it is essential to  create  a
          climate in which both negative practices  and
          negative  attitudes  can  be  challenged  and
          discouraged.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The existence of systemic discrimination is not in issue  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  proceeding, nor is it in issue that it is a serious problem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that requires government response.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Generally, the 1993 Act imposed an obligation on  employers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to work toward the goal of a workplace that reflected the various</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">groups that make up Ontario society. The Act was based on the key</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  According to the reasons of Dilks J., the appellants before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him  advanced four basic submissions. I shall set them forth  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then   state,  very  briefly,  Dilks  J.'s  responses  to   these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submissions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   The  Ontario Government has a positive duty under s.  15  of
     the  Charter  to  enact employment equity  legislation  and,
     having  done so, has a corresponding duty to leave the  same
     in place.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  Dilks  J.  concluded on this issue that  &quot;the  overwhelming</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weight  of authority negates the existence of any duty under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter to legislate&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Alternatively,  even  if  there  was  no   duty   to   enact
     legislation,  having done so, the government  was  bound  to
     leave the legislation in place.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  Dilks  J. held that, in these circumstances, there  was  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutional requirement obliging the government to  leave  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment Equity Act, 1993 in place.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   The very manner and form in which the Job Quotas Repeal Act,
     1993  was  enacted  has  resulted in a poisoned  atmosphere,
     which  itself  is  a violation of the s. 15  rights  of  the
     applicants.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  Dilks J. held that &quot;[t]he difficulty with this argument  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  it presupposes a &quot;legislative distinction&quot; from the  effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Bill  8  (the  Job  Quotas  Repeal  Act,  1995)  whereas  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinction that may be said to have arisen following the  repeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Employment Equity Act, 1993 is indistinguishable from that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  existed prior to the enactment of that Act.&quot;  He  observed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further  that while the applicants and perhaps others  &quot;may  well</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deplore   the  government's  actions  ...  the  action   had   no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantive component; it merely restored the status  quo  as  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">existed  prior  to  the enactment of the Employment  Equity  Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1993.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4.   The Job Quotas Repeal Act, 1995 is not saved or justified by
     s. 1 of the Charter.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  Because  Dilks J. had concluded that there was  no  Charter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violation it was unnecessary for him to consider this issue.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE APPELLANTS' SUBMISSIONS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  Before this court the appellants' submissions,  which  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elaborated  upon by the interveners, were framed in the  form  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues, as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Did  Dilks J. err in holding that the Job Quotas Repeal Act,
     1995 is not subject to review under the Canadian Charter  of
     Rights and Freedoms?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Did  Dilks  J.  err in failing to find that the  Job  Quotas
     Repeal Act violated s. 15 of the Charter?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   In the alternative, did Dilks J. err in failing to find that
     s.  15  of  the  Charter  creates a  positive  duty  on  the
     government to enact employment equity legislation?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4.   Did  Dilks J. err in failing to find that the Government  of
     Ontario  misrepresented the Employment Equity Act,  1993  as
     entailing  job quotas, creating reverse discrimination,  and
     being  contrary  to merit, and that these misrepresentations
     resulted in the violation of s. 15 of the Charter?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5.   In  the  event that a violation of s. 15 of the  Charter  is
     found, is it saved by s. 1 of the Charter?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">6.   If  the  answer to question 5 is no, what is the appropriate
     remedy in the circumstances?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] I shall deal with these issues in the order presented.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Did  Dilks J. err in holding that the Job Quotas Repeal Act,
     1995 was not subject to review under the Charter?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Section 32(1)(b) of the Charter provides:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This Charter applies
</font></pre>

               of each province.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] It is not clear to me that Dilks J. held that the Job Quotas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Repeal Act, 1995 was not subject to review under the Charter.  If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had, it would not have been necessary for him to engage in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.  15  analysis that forms an important part of his reasons.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any event, I think that this issue can be dealt with briefly. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Job Quotas Repeal Act, 1995 is an enactment of the legislature of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario.  As  such, regardless of what may be argued  to  be  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect (changing the law, returning to the status quo before  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employment  Equity  Act, 1993, etc.) it  is  clearly  a  form  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">government action which requires scrutiny under the Charter -  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case, under s. 15.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Does  the Job Quotas Repeal Act, 1995 violate s. 15  of  the
     Charter?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Section 15 reads:

          under the law, and has the right to the equal

          without  discrimination and,  in  particular,
          without   discrimination   based   on   race,

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  By reason of the manner in which the appellants have stated</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submission  on  this issue is not dependent on  there  being  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutional  obligation  on  Ontario  to  have   enacted   the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  this  is indicated in his reasons. Before Dilks J. the  first</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment  equity  legislation it was constitutionally  enjoined</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from repealing it.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  Employment Equity Act, 1993 one can properly ignore  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analysis.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] In Vriend v. Alberta, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 493, Cory J., for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority,  set  forth several judicial statements of  the  proper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach  to  analyzing  claims under s.  15  and  then  said  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs 73 and 74:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [para 73] These approaches to the analysis of
          s.  15(1) have been summarized and adopted in
          subsequent cases, e.g. Eaton [Eaton v.  Brant
          County  Board of Education, [1997]  1  S.C.R.
          241]  (at para. 62), Benner [Benner v. Canada

          (at  para.  69) and, most recently,  Eldridge
          [Eldridge   v.  British  Columbia   (Attorney
          General),  [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624]. In Eldridge,
          La  Forest  J.,  writing  for  the  unanimous
          Court, stated (at para. 58):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               While this Court has not adopted  a
               uniform approach to s. 15(1), there
               is  broad agreement on the  general
               analytic  framework; see  Eaton  v.
               Brant County Board of Education,  [
               1997]  1  S.C.R. 241, at para.  62,
               Miron,  supra, and Egan,  supra.  A
               person claiming a violation  of  s.
               15(1)  must  first establish  that,
               because  of  a distinction  between
               the   claimant  and   others,   the
               claimant  has  been  denied  &quot;equal
               protection&quot;  or &quot;equal benefit&quot;  of
               the  law.  Secondly,  the  claimant
               must    show   that   the    denial
               constitutes discrimination  on  the
               basis  of  one  of  the  enumerated
               grounds listed in s. 15(1)  or  one
               analogous thereto.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [para  74] In this case, as in Eaton,  Benner
          and  Eldridge, any difference that may  exist
          in  the approach to s. 15(1) would not affect
          the result, and it is therefore not necessary
          to  address those differences. The  essential
          requirements  of  all  these  cases  will  be
          satisfied  by enquiring first, whether  there
          is  a distinction which results in the denial
          of  equality before or under the law,  or  of
          equal  protection or benefit of the law;  and
          second,   whether  this  denial   constitutes
          discrimination on the basis of an  enumerated
          or analogous ground.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In  terms of employment equity, s. 11  is  of
          particular  importance;  s.  11(1)   protects
          workers          against         constructive
          (systemic/adverse              impact/effect)
          discrimination and s. 11(2) puts the onus  on
          employers to accommodate the needs of workers
          covered  by the Code short of undue hardship.
          The Commission, a board of inquiry or a court
          under  subsection  11(3) shall  consider  any
          standards  prescribed by the regulations  for
          assessing what is undue hardship. Finally, s.
          14(1) permits special programs for all groups
          covered  under the Code that have been  found
          to   be  disadvantaged  in  employment.   The
          Commission has published guidelines for  such
          programs.  Hence, employment equity  programs
          are   protected  against  claims  of  reverse
          discrimination.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          While  s.  11  does  not  introduce  a  novel
          concept  of  human rights in  employment,  it
          holds  within  itself the possibility  of  an
          effective  attack on systemic discrimination.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what  it  was  before  the 1993 Act, without being  obligated  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justify the repealing statute under section 1 of the Charter.  If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  is  so,  it  cannot be said that there is  any  legislative</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect of the repeal is that there is, as was the case before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enactment  of the 1993 Act, no mandatory affirmative  action  law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operating  in  the area of employment. This does  not  create  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involve any distinction or any issue of equal protection  of  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.  15(2)  of  the Charter. This provision shields  it  from  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wording of s. 15, when compared to the wording of these sections,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">falls  considerably  short  of  indicating  a  positive  duty  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">governments to take action.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46]  Further, the particular wording in s. 15(1), which  confers</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">envisages, as I have already indicated in the preceding  part  of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not   incorporate  distinctions  that  discriminate  on   Charter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grounds.  With  this in mind, it is difficult to read  s.  15  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposing a general obligation to advance equality values.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47]  If  it  is thought that the term &quot;the right&quot;  in  s.  15(1)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">implies a correlative positive duty on governments to give effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the right in the form of legislation, there are three answers.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation of this kind (see the Abella Report at p. 14). I have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">already  indicated that, but for s. 15(2), the Employment  Equity</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason  of its under-inclusive nature. Because s. 15(2), although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned with pro-active legislation like the employment  equity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation  in this case, clearly does not impose an  obligation</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">answer this question in a satisfactory way. It is a question that</font></pre>

          point  that  the  only  significance  to   be

          generally  to equality is that the protection
          afforded  by  the  section is  restricted  to
          discrimination  through  the  application  of
          law. It is possible to read s. 15 in this way
          and  I have no doubt that on any view redress
          against  that  kind  of  discrimination  will
          constitute the bulk of the courts' work under
          the  provision. Moreover, from the manner  in
          which  it  was drafted, I also have no  doubt
          that  it  was  so intended. However,  it  can
          reasonably be argued that the opening  words,
          which take up half the section, seem somewhat
          excessive  to  accomplish  the  modest   role
          attributed   to  them,  particularly   having
          regard  to the fact that s. 32 already limits
          the application of the Charter to legislation
          and  governmental activity. It  may  also  be
          thought  to be out of keeping with the  broad

          upon  the  reach of the Code does not  offend
          the Charter because the province was under no
          obligation to provide any protection  against
          discrimination in the first place.  They  say
          that  absent such an obligation there  is  no
          room  for  constitutional  scrutiny  of   the
          state's   failure  to  go   far   enough   in
          legislating  human rights protection.  It  is
          not  self-evident to me that government could
          not  be  found to be in breach of the Charter
          for  failing to act. Whether the Constitution
          is  implicated  when the state  fails  to  do
          something is a question which has plagued the
          American  courts  for  many  years.   Indeed,
          Laurence  Tribe  has  commented  that  it  is
          precisely  when the state has not acted  that
          the  court  is called upon to make  the  most
          difficult determinations regarding the  scope
          of   the   Constitution:  see  Constitutional
          Choices at p. 246 et seq. Since this  is  not
          an instance where the province has completely
          failed  to act, we are happily relieved  from
          deciding  such a difficult question on  these
          appeals, and I refrain from doing so.

          may  be  said that the principles which  have
          been applied under the Human Rights Acts  are
          equally  applicable in considering  questions
          of  discrimination  under s.  15(1).  Certain
          differences   arising  from  the   difference
          between the Charter and the Human Rights Acts
          must,  however, be considered. To begin with,
          discrimination  in  s. 15(1)  is  limited  to
          discrimination  caused by the application  or
          operation  of  law, whereas the Human  Rights

          This Court has repeatedly drawn attention  to
          the  fact that the Charter is essentially  an
          instrument   for  checking  the   powers   of
          government over the individual. In Hunter  v.

          that  of  the  United  States  is  the  great
          constitutional exemplar, have  been  directed
          at  government. Government is the  body  that
          can    enact    and   enforce    rules    and
          authoritatively   impinge    on    individual
          freedom.  Only  government  requires  to   be
          constitutionally  shackled  to  preserve  the
          rights of the individual. Others, it is true,
          may offend against the rights of individuals.
          This  is especially true in a world in  which
          economic life is largely left to the  private
          sector  where  powerful private  institutions
          are   not  directly  affected  by  democratic
          forces.  But  government can either  regulate

          courts  have  recognized the  need  to  limit
          judicial  review  by means, for  example,  of
          privative    clauses   and    deference    to
          specialized tribunals, techniques that  would
          be unavailable in a Charter context. As well,
          as  I  noted earlier, government may, in many
          cases, establish more flexible means to  deal
          with  individual  rights. Thus  Human  Rights
          Commissions have more flexible techniques for
          dealing with discriminatory practices without
          unduly  constraining the  exercise  of  other
          democratic rights that are extremely hard  to

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  purpose of the Charter is to ensure that
          governments comply with the Charter when they
          make  laws.  The Charter does not go  further
          and  require that governments enact  laws  to
          remedy  societal problems, including problems
          of  inequality  and discrimination.  One  can
          hope  that  governments will regard  this  as
          part  of  their mission; however, the Charter
          does  not  impose this mission  at  the  high
          level  of constitutional obligation - Section
          32  of  the  Charter states that the  Charter
          applies  to  governments.  Governments  speak
          through  laws, regulations and practices.  In
          Ontario, the current legislature has  decided
          not  to  speak  in the domain  of  employment
          equity.  It  has  decided to leave  this,  at
          least  for  the time being, to the  realm  of
          private   activity.  Although   many   people
          including  the  Applicants,  may  regret  and
          oppose  this  decision,  the  legislature  is
          entitled  to  make  it. (December  29,  1995,

          variables   involved,  too  much  supervision
          required,     and    too    many    financial
          implications, to suit the judicial process.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  courts  can issue declaratory judgments,
          however, indicating to the public whether  or
          not  their  governments are  taking  adequate
          steps  to  relieve society's unfortunates  of
          the  burdens of disadvantage. Courts may also
          have  the  power  to make generalized  orders
          (e.g.,  &quot;Take all reasonable steps to  ensure
          that  by 1995 women in the civil service  are
          represented in all management ranks  and  all
          salary  levels to an extent proportionate  to
          their    overall   representation   in    the
          service.&quot;),   leaving  to   politicians   and
          administrators the appropriate ways and means
          of   achieving  that  goal.  That   kind   of
          collaboration   between  the   judicial   and

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Regarding  Women in Employment&quot; (1988), 17 Man.  L.J.  267  deals</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the question as follows at pp. 271-72:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Section   15(1)  of  the  Charter  guarantees
          procedural equality in the application of the
          law (equality before the law) and substantive
          equality  in  the  provisions  of   the   law
          (equality under the law, equal protection  of
          the  law  and  equal  benefit  of  the  law).
          Theoretically,  it  is  possible  that   this
          guarantee  could  be  very  broadly  read  as
          requiring that everyone &quot;benefit equally from
          the  existence of a given legal regime,&quot; thus
          imposing   an   affirmative   obligation   on
          legislatures, governments, and courts to cure
          inequalities.   In  its  widest   conceivable
          scope,   then,   section   15(1)   could   be
          interpreted  as  mandating  a  socio-economic
          revolution. It goes without saying that there
          is  no evidence in the legislative history of
          the  Charter  that this result was  intended;
          nor  would  this interpretation be  textually
          sound. Section 15(1) guarantees only that the
          law  will operate without discrimination.  It
          does not require that the law be used to  put
          everyone  in  an equal position. The  express
          allowance  of affirmative action  in  section
          15(2) would not be necessary if section 15(1)
          imposed   a   constitutional  obligation   to
          enhance equality and eradicate inequality.
