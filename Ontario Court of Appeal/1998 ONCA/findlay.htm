    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Overview

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The  appellant was 25 years of age when he began to develop</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certain  neurological symptoms. His wife at the time was a  nurse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  recommended that he see the respondent, who referred him for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">neurological  consultation. Demyelinating disease  was  suspected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but  his symptoms subsided. Six years later the symptoms recurred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  the  respondent referred him to another neurologist.  Again,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demyelinating disease was suspected. He was subsequently referred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  Dr. H.J.M. Barnett in the Department of Clinical Neurological</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sciences  at University Hospital, London, Ontario (&quot;MS  Clinic&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In  his  letter of June 27, 1978 to the respondent,  Dr.  Barnett</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrote: &quot;I think the diagnosis here is multiple sclerosis and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there  is very little equivocation about it. I think that  he  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">young  and has an illness that is going to cause him serious  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eventually  possibly  disabling  difficulty  in  the  foreseeable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   In  October  1978, the appellant saw  the  respondent  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewed   symptoms   of  multiple  sclerosis  (&quot;MS&quot;),   including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increased  numbness and lack of control in his legs and  slurring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  speech.  It was at this point that the respondent  prescribed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone, a dehydrogenated analogue of cortisone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The  respondent  testified that when  he  first  prescribed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone, he told the appellant that it was a powerful drug and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could  not be used indiscriminately. It was a safe drug  if  used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  his  direct supervision. He warned that it could  cause  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number   of  side  effects,  including  salt  retention,  changes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affecting his blood electrolytes and softening of the bones  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  tendency  of the bones to break. He explained that  prednisone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must  be  discontinued gradually after a short period of  use  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there  could be serious and dangerous effects. He testified  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during the years that followed, whenever he prescribed the  drug,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he  would  not  give the same warning in great detail  but  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remind  the appellant of the fact that he had given the  previous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">warnings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  appellant testified that he was told by the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  prednisone  was an anti-inflammatory  drug  that  would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficial in treating flare-ups of his condition. He was  warned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not to use added salt because the drug caused water retention. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could also cause euphoria. He was advised to taper the dosage and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not   to  stop  the  medication  abruptly.  He  denied  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  told him anything about softening of  the  bones.  He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also   denied  that  he  received  information  or  advice  about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone  from the various doctors who monitored his  condition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the MS Clinic.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   In  October 1978, the respondent prescribed the drug  in  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tapered  dosage regime over a three week period with good results</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  a  diminution  of symptoms. The appellant  did  not  require</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone again until August 1979 when he experienced  a  marked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase  in  numbness and weakness in his legs.  Again,  it  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed in tapering doses. In November 1979, the appellant was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examined  at the MS Clinic by a neurologist, Dr. D.W.  Paty,  who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">documented his use of prednisone and noted: &quot;I see no  reason  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change his management at this point.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   He  did not require the drug again until May 1981  when  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">went to the respondent, complaining of increased weakness in  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legs,  fatigue  and  a  drop  foot on the  left.  Prednisone  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed  in  a tapered regime. The respondent noted  that  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">symptoms  responded  well to the drug. The  following  month  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  was  seen  by Dr. John H. Noseworthy,  a  resident  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">neurology at the MS Clinic, who recorded the dosage of prednisone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without  comment, other than the fact that the appellant felt  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had helped him.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   Between  October 1981 and June 1982, the appellant  visited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent  monthly. His clinical  notes  reflect  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dosage  was reduced as symptoms subsided. In June, a neurologist,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dr.  T.  E.  Feasby at the MS Clinic, recorded that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remained on a small dose of prednisone which he suggested that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stop.   In  September,  however,  the  appellant  went   to   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's office, complaining that he felt worse than he  ever</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had.  There was numbness everywhere except for his head;  he  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty  walking and was suffering from extreme  fatigue.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent prescribed prednisone. The appellant continued to  see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent monthly until June 1983 and continued to  take  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">variable low dosage of prednisone for symptoms of numbness in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hands and feet, spasticity and fatigue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   In June, when he attended the MS Clinic, he had not  taken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone  for  three weeks. Dr. Feasby wrote to the  respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  he would prefer to have the appellant off the drug for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediate future. He recommended baclofen as an alternative.  One</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">month later, however, the baclofen had produced unacceptable side</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effects.  The  appellant had also sustained a fall.  Having  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unable   to   reach  Dr.  Feasby  by  telephone,  the  respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed  prednisone and then wrote to the doctor,  documenting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the severity of the appellant's symptoms and adding:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          At this point I felt I was unable to withhold
          the  prednisone to which he has responded  so
          well  in the past, and started him on 10  mgm
          q.i.d.  with a prompt and dramatic  response.
          On   29   July   he   reported   an   amazing
          improvement.  better  balance.   better   leg
          control,   and  was  able  to  climb   stairs
          normally. The prednisone was reduced to 5 mgm
          q.i.d. and I will continue to reduce the dose
          as  quickly  as possible. I am aware  of  the
          problems concerning steroid therapy,  but  as
          this   patient  was  in  acute  and   rapidly
          progressing  distress there seems  to  be  no
          alternative at the moment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  would  be  pleased to  hear  your  further
          suggestions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Dr.  Feasby replied that he agreed with the use of prednisone  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treat  the  appellant's acute relapse. He wrote that he  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comfortable  with  its long-term treatment in multiple  sclerosis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  agreed  with  a reduction in the dosage. He  concluded:  &quot;It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">might  be possible to get him off it again, but I realize he  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  alternate day therapy before with some success. I  think  you</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will have to judge what is best for him.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  The  respondent continued to reduce the  prednisone  regime</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until June 1984, when an exacerbation of symptoms necessitated  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">higher  dosage. The appellant was seen three months later at  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MS Clinic by a neurologist, Dr. George Rice, who noted:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Over   the   last   year   there   has   been
          considerable progression of his disease in an
          insidious  fashion. He has had  deterioration
          in   his  strength,  walking  abilities   and
          balance.  He  has been prone to  falling  and
          indeed has taken some bad spills. He recently
          fractured  his left arm and broke some  ribs.
          Over  the last year he has been treated  with
          several courses of prednisone. Indeed he  has
          been  receiving the medication for the better
          part  of  10 months in the last year.  He  is
          currently taking 10 mg. and is attempting  to
          taper his dosage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
No  suggestion  was made for a change or discontinuation  of  the

drug.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12]  The  appellant remained on a low dose of  prednisone  until</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">January  1985, when he was admitted to the MS Clinic for a  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  cyclophosphamide. Two weeks following his discharge, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he  developed an acute exacerbation of symptoms and on the advice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Dr. W.J. Oczkowski at the MS Clinic, the respondent prescribed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone  daily  for 10 days with gradual reduction.  The  drug</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeared   to  produce  effective  results  and  the  appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition improved to the point where he was able to ski. As  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drug  was tapered, however, he developed exacerbations.  In  May,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant  increased the dosage  on  his  own  with  a  good</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response and reduced it again on his own. In June 1985, Dr.  Rice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examined  the appellant and observed that he could easily  become</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">steroid dependent. He told him to try to taper the drug.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  In  September, the respondent was becoming frustrated  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant's  MS symptoms were worsening  and  consulted  Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Weinshenker at the MS Clinic, who suggested that he increase  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dosage  for seven days with gradual tapering. Following a further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exacerbation, Dr. G.C. Ebers at the MS Clinic recommended to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  that he increase the dosage, admit the  appellant  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hospital and thereafter, taper the dosage. The respondent carried</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out those recommendations.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Between October and December 1985, the respondent prescribed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  reduction in the prednisone in accordance with the  advice  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  doctors  at  the  MS  Clinic. His  notes  reflect  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  did  not  reduce his intake  in  accordance  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions he received from the respondent. In December, his MS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">symptoms   recurred.  He  also  began  to  experience   vertebral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fractures, initially when lifting a fifty pound box,  and  a  few</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weeks  later  when  moving a microwave oven. The  fractures  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined  to  be  caused  by osteoporosis.  The  appellant  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hospitalized  by the respondent and came under the  care  of  Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.M.J.  Leon,  an  internist. While  in  hospital,  he  developed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional compression fractures. Dr. Leon's notes state that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  was started on higher doses of prednisone  which  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">slowly reduced. He was subsequently admitted to the MS Clinic  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">February 1986, where it was decided to introduce the drug  imuran</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into  the appellant's treatment regime. This drug enabled him  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be weaned off prednisone by May 1986.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  Thus  as  a  result of the therapeutic  use  of  prednisone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between 1978 and 1986, the appellant suffered vertebral collapse,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  caused a significant reduction in his body height as  well</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  pain  and reduced mobility. The appellant testified  that  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1988,  because  of  his  physical condition,  he  was  unable  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">maintain  employment  as  District  Officer  with  the  Teacher's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Federation  in  Welland, Ontario, a position he had  assumed  ten</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years  earlier  when  he left his occupation  as  a  high  school</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Informed Consent

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The findings of the trial judge were that the appellant  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  very  alert  and  bright patient. He studied  and  brought  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">articles  and  had  long discussions with the respondent  on  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">visits.  The  respondent  was  quite  methodical,  referring  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant to other doctors on many occasions and noting carefully</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his   symptoms  and  responses.  The  trial  judge  accepted  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's  evidence  that  he warned  his  patient  about  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dangers  of prednisone and specifically, the dangers of softening</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  his  bones  and  fractures, which  necessarily  included  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possibility of vertebral collapse. He accepted that the  warnings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were  appropriate and sufficient. In contrast, he found that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was experiencing serious symptoms. He was euphoric  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may  not  have  remembered what he was told. He  noted  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manner  in  which  the respondent prescribed  the  prednisone  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carefully decreasing dosages would, of itself, logically lead  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discussions between doctor and patient of the side effects of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drug.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Further, the trial judge described the appellant as a man of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inquiring intellect. As such it was difficult to accept that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had no discussions with doctors at the MS Clinic  about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the advantages and disadvantages of his regimes of prednisone. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  clear from the evidence that the doctors were concerned  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  possibility of side effects from the drug and their  medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records  contain  many  references  to  the  appellant's  use  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prednisone.  The trial judge concluded, therefore,  that  it  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inconceivable that the side effects were not discussed  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant.  Moreover, despite the appellant's  testimony  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contrary,  he  found that a reasonable person in the  appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position, knowing the risks, would have consented to the regime.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  In my view, there was evidence to support the finding  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent did not fail in his duty of disclosure and in any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">event,  a  reasonable person in the appellant's  position,  on  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">balance  of probabilities, would have consented to prednisone  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed for pain. It is significant to note that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consented  to the use of experimental drugs cyclophosphamide  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imuran to address his MS symptoms, knowing that each drug carried</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a significant risk of malignancy and death. Given the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated eagerness to continue working, his desire to minimize  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MS  symptoms,  the apparent positive effect of the prednisone  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those  symptoms and his demonstrated willingness  to  take  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">risks  to  alleviate those symptoms, it can fairly  be  concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  a reasonable patient in the appellant's circumstances would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have  taken  the prednisone after a full warning of the  possible</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]  The  trial judge determined that the appellant's disability</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss  of  height  and mobility. The trial judge  found  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  would not have terminated his employment as  early  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1988; however, his MS would have prevented him from continuing to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work  after March 1994. He assessed general damages in the amount</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(including gross up at 54.86%) of $408, 593. He attributed 25% of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's  MS  disease.  Dr.  McIlroy  testified  that   common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">symptoms of the disease are spasticity, lack of balance, fatigue,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition,  MS patients commonly suffer from musculoskeletal  pain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">along  the  spine.  Dr.  McIlroy stated that  the  appellant  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entered the chronic progressive stage of the disease and  it  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">most likely that he would continue to deteriorate.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dr.  Noseworthy recorded that the appellant told him that he  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pain  free  and  could stand straight. Also,  there  was  medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence  that  pain  from vertebral fractures  usually  resolves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after  a  few  months  and the appellant's  complaints  were  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistent  with ongoing fractures. Dr. Keith Hayes, a specialist</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  rehabilitation and future care costs, testified that  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future  care  costs, 75% would be attributable to MS  progression</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather than to osteoporosis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  Thus  there was evidence upon which the trial  judge  could</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Short  limitation periods indicate  that
          the   legislature  put  a  premium  on  their
          function as a statute of repose. This is  one
          of  the  three rationales which serve society
          and   the   courts'  continued  interest   in
          maintaining  the  respect of these  statutes.
          Whatever interest a defendant may have in the
          universal application of a limitation  period
          must  be  balanced against  the  concerns  of
          fairness  to  the plaintiff who  was  unaware
          that   his   injuries  met   the   conditions
          precedent to commencing an action: Murphy  v.

          S.C.R.  6,  96  D.L.R.  (4th)  289.  All  the
          rationales  were set out in  M.  (K.)  v.  M.
          (H.),   where   this  Court  considered   the
          Limitations  Act, R.S.O. 1980,  c.  240  (now
          R.S.O.  1990,  c.L.15) in order to  determine
          the time of accrual of the cause of action in
          a manner consistent with its purposes (at pp.
          29-30):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               There   are  three,  and  they  may   be

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Statutes  of limitations have  long
               been  said  to be statutes of repose....
               The reasoning is straightforward enough.
               There  comes a time, it is said, when  a
               potential defendant should be secure  in
               his  reasonable expectation that he will
               not  be  held  to  account  for  ancient
               obligations....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The second rationale is evidentiary
               and  concerns  the desire  to  foreclose
               claims based on stale evidence. Once the
               limitation   period  has   lapsed,   the
               potential defendant should no longer  be

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I  am of the view that s. 17 imports, in
          the alternative, two concepts: (1) knowledge,
          that   is,   actual   knowledge,   which   is
          subjective  and (2) negligence in failing  to
          know, which is objective. The words &quot;ought to
          have  known&quot;,  is an expression  familiar  to
          practitioners  at  the negligence  bar.  They
          mean that the plaintiff is to be assessed  in
          terms  of the standard of the reasonable  man
          in   failing   to  acquire  the   appropriate
          knowledge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               So  the  issue, as I see it, is  one  of
          fact.  Did the plaintiff know, or in all  the
          circumstances, ought he to have known of  the
          fact   or   facts  upon  which   he   alleges
          negligence or malpractice one year before the
          commencement of the action? It would seem  to
          me,  that among the facts that he would  have
          to  know would be the fact of the appropriate
          standard   of   care   which   the    medical
          practitioner was required to adhere to.  That
          fact   could  only  normally  reside   in   a
          qualified professional opinion. A lay  person
          even  with legal advice would not necessarily
          be  deemed  to  have been  in  possession  of
          knowledge  of the standard, nor would  he  be
          deemed to have been necessarily negligent  in
          not  acquiring knowledge of the  standard  at
          any  given  point, even after the glimmer  of
          hope  had  been  raised by  a  discussion  as
          between   his  solicitor  and  a   consultant
          doctor, that he might have a case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It  is a question of fact as to when the
          information developed by his solicitor or  by
          himself   has  reached  the  stage   that   a
          reasonably  prudent person, with  appropriate
          access  to medical knowledge (appropriate  in
          the  sense  of that which could be discovered
          by   a   reasonably  prudent  solicitor,   or
          plaintiff  following  a  reasonably  diligent
          investigation) would have determined that  he
          had  prima  facie grounds for inferring  that
          his  doctor had been negligent or had engaged
          in  malpractice upon him. Section 17  of  the
          statute  imports  that all  of  the  material
          facts  were available, or ought to have  been
          available  to  the plaintiff,  including  the
          meaning of the facts in terms of duty of care
          appropriate   to  the  medical  practitioner.
          Without  medical advice interpreting it,  the
          raw  medical data cannot be presumed to  mean
          anything  to  a  layman.  Now,  if  after   a
          reasonably  prudent person would have  formed
          the  judgement that he has been a  victim  of
          negligence  or  malpractice,  he   fails   to
          commence  his  action within the  appropriate
          statutory period, it would appear to me  that
          his  cause  of action is barred. Essentially,
          whether   or   not   the   plaintiff    knew,
          subjectively, or whether or not the plaintiff
          ought  to have known or was negligent in  not
          knowing,  is  a  question of fact  which  can
          only,  in  my  opinion, be  determined  by  a
          tribunal  of  fact  capable  of  hearing  the
          witnesses   as   to   the  facts,   assessing
          credibility,   looking   at   all   of    the
          circumstances including the complete  history
          of  the  matter  and hearing  expert  opinion
          evidence, and ruling, as a question of  fact,
          whether  applying  the subjective  test,  the
          plaintiff  knew,  or  whether  applying   the
          objective test he ought to have known of &quot;the
          fact or facts&quot;, contemplated in s. 17 of  the
          Act. [Emphasis in original.]
