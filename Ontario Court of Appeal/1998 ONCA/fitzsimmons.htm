AUSTIN J.A.:

OVERVIEW</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a decision of
Gotlib J. made February 20, 1997 with respect to the disposition
of a benevolent fund of the Local union members, past and
present, of the Fire Department of the City of Toronto.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   The issues are whether the fund should be continued or
wound up, and if wound up how the funds are to be distributed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The contest is between those members who are still active
and those who have retired. Each &quot;side&quot; is represented by
individuals appointed for that purpose. The three trustees of the
fund are also parties to the litigation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   The present trustees are Mike Dailly, John Stevenson and
Bernie Cassidy. Mark Fitzsimmons, Mark McKinnon and Mike
Figliola, the president, secretary and assistant-treasurer of the
Local were appointed to represent themselves and the current or
active members of the Local. George McCauley, James Warren and
James McLaughlin were appointed to represent themselves and all
other members of the Toronto Fire Department Pensioners'
Association (incorporated in 1991) who have a financial interest
in the fund, i.e., the members of the Local who have retired.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   Gotlib J. decided that the fund should be wound up and that
the retired members should be paid their entitlement in priority
to active members. Any shortfall should be made up by the Local,
that is, the active members. Her reasons are reported in (1997),
25 O.T.C. 124. From this decision both active members and retired
members appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">HISTORY OF THE FUND</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   In 1903, Local 113 of the International Association of
firefighters was formed in Toronto. In 1918 a fund (the &quot;Fund&quot;)
was established to ensure that a sufficient sum of money was
available to provide members with a proper burial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   The Fund began with a special assessment of 25 cents levied
upon all members. An &quot;admission fee&quot; of one dollar was then set,
followed by a monthly levy of 25 cents per member until the Fund
totalled $1,000. Then, contributions were to stop until a death
benefit ($150) was paid. Contributions would then start again
until $1,000 was in hand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   In 1936 Local 113 expanded the Fund into a burial and
retirement fund. In 1940 three members of Local 113 were elected
as trustees of the Fund to oversee its activities. At the same
time, an account was opened for the Fund, separate from the
accounts of Local 113. In 1957 the name was changed to &quot;Toronto
Fire Fighters' Benevolent Fund.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   In 1962 the trustees produced a schedule which indicated
that by 1978 there would be problems and by 1989 there would be a
shortfall. It is not clear that any steps were taken in 1962, or
the years immediately following, to prepare for these
eventualities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  In the early 1970s, the contribution rate was $1.25 per
week per member and the benefit amount was $3,500 payable on
retirement or death. The Fund had assets of about $200,000 and
contributions roughly covered current claims.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  Until 1979 the Fund operated on an &quot;assessment basis.&quot; That
is, in any given year it would pay out almost as much as it took
in, with a small surplus for years of heavier outgo. The income
consisted of initiation fees, deductions from pay and receipts
from charity events.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  In 1971 M. D. R. Brown, of Eckler, Brown &amp; Company, Ltd.
actuaries, reported to the chairman of the trustees that the
level of benefits was considerably higher than the Fund could
support in the long run with the existing contribution rate. It
was recommended that the benefits be lowered or the contributions
increased, or both, failing which the Fund would almost certainly
be exhausted. This advice was not followed. It appears from the
minutes that the trustees may not have fully understood the
significance of the actuarial report.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  Nor was the advice followed in 1972 or 1973. In 1974, 1975
and 1976 benefits were increased with only a slight increase in
contributions in 1976. In 1977, there were no changes and in
1978, although serious concern was expressed about the rapid
depletion of assets, only minor investment changes were made.
Between 1938 and 1993 there were 19 increases in contributions
and 23 increases in benefits.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  In 1979 there were 24 former members who had retired but
who had not yet been paid their benefits. The advice of an
accountant was sought. He suggested that the trustees get legal
advice. It is not apparent that this suggestion was followed. The
trustees recommended that contributions be increased to $5 per
pay (every two weeks) for two years only.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  In 1980 a major change was made. Instead of 100% of
benefits being paid on death or retirement, only 20% would be
paid out on retirement, with the remaining 80% to be paid out on
the earlier of death or reaching 65 years of age. The total
benefit was set at $5,000 for 1980, with scheduled increases at
the compound rate of 4% per annum for each year thereafter, for
fifteen years, and 9% per annum thereafter to 2018.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  From 1980 to about 1994, a retiring firefighter would
receive 20% of his or her entitlement on retirement. With that
payment a letter would be received which followed this format:
           Dear Mr. Penfound,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Enclosed please find a cheque in the
           amount of :
                  $1,559.92
           This represents 20% of your Benevolent
           Fund entitlement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Method of payment was passed by the
           members of Local 113, at a Union Meeting
           held May 8, 1980.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Payment is based on the year base rate,
           which is:
                    $6,324.00    . This amount is
           divided by 30 years, and then multiplied
           by your number of completed years, which
           is:
                  37           years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           The remainder of your entitlement, in the
           amount of:
                   $6,239.68
           will be payable to you at age 65, or to
           your beneficiary upon your death,
           whichever is first.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           We wish to remind you that this money is
           Income Tax free, and does not have to be
           declared on your Income Tax return.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Congratulations on your retirement. We
           wish you good health, and the very best in
           your years ahead, and in your future
           endeavours.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  By February 1981 all unpaid balances of retirement benefits
were paid off on the new basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  By 1988 it became clear that the Fund could not support the
proposed increases in benefits. The 9% increase scheduled for
1995 and after was therefore reduced to 4%.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  In 1993-1995 a series of meetings was held resulting in
attempts to &quot;cap&quot; benefits, the securing of legal and actuarial
advice, the threat of one or more members that they would make no
more contributions, advice that although the Fund could be
salvaged there were better ways to invest the money, and demands
that the Fund be &quot;collapsed&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  On November 10, 1993, a meeting of the members of Local 113
resolved to investigate the legality of collapsing the Fund
without honouring its existing obligations to retired members.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]  At a special meeting of Local 113 on September 20, 1994,
the members voted overwhelmingly to collapse the Fund, despite
the views of some members that it could and should be maintained.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  At a meeting on October 13, 1994, the members decided that
the payout entitlement would be limited to one's contributions to
the Fund and payable only at age 65. Those who had retired or
withdrawn before October 13, 1994, but who had attained the age
of 65 after that date, would receive a return of contributions
less any amount paid to them on retirement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  On March 9, 1995, the constitution and by-laws of Local 113
were amended to permit members to put their contributions in a
separate interest-bearing escrow account instead of the Fund
until the position of the Fund was clarified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  As of August 31, 1995, approximately 200 members had
withdrawn from the Fund and the deductions from their pay cheques
were being deposited in the escrow account.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25]  According to the material filed, as of April 30, 1995,
there were approximately 1177 active members of Local 113 and 514
retirees entitled to benefits (pensioners). The latest audited
statement was as of October 31, 1994, and it put the value of the
Fund at $1.9 million. An unaudited statement as of April 30,
1995, put it at $2.1 million. The material filed on behalf of the
pensioners set the value of the Fund at $1,829,900 and said it
was &quot;approximately equal to the actual liability for the vested
interests of the [pensioners].&quot; For their part, the &quot;accrued
benefits&quot; of the active members as of April 30, 1995, were said
to approximate $4.8.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">GOVERNANCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  The essentials of the governance of the Fund changed little
over the years. It is administered by the trustees, each of whom
is a member of Local 113 and is elected for a three-year term by
the members of Local 113. The trustees serve on a voluntary basis
and receive a modest honorarium.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  The trustees are responsible for the Fund assets and have a
duty to consider all matters relating to investments. They are
required to submit all recommendations relating to the Fund to
the Executive Committee of Local 113. All decisions concerning
such recommendations are made by a regular meeting of the members
of Local 113, but the Executive Committee of Local 113 may render
a decision in urgent circumstances. The Assistant Treasurer of
Local 113 acts as Secretary Treasurer of the Fund. All initiation
fees and fortnightly payments required to be made to the Fund by
the members of Local 113 are collected by the Local and remitted
to the Secretary Treasurer of the Fund who deposits them in the
Fund account in a chartered bank.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  No amounts may be paid from the Fund except by cheque
signed by the President of Local 113, the Chairman of the
Trustees and the Secretary Treasurer of the Fund. Changes to the
rules governing the Fund are made only on the recommendation of
the trustees and endorsation by Local 113 by a vote at a regular
membership meeting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]  The court below found that &quot;the Fund is a creature of Local
113.&quot; I agree with that conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]  It is a matter of contention that contributors to the Fund
who are no longer active firefighters, whether by reason of a
change of occupation or retirement or otherwise, are no longer
members of Local 113 and as a result have no vote in respect of
matters affecting the Fund.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31]  The rules of the Fund make no provision for its winding-up
or for the distribution of the Fund assets in that event.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE LITIGATION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]  Not surprisingly, the decisions to collapse the Fund to
limit the pay-out and to set up an escrow account led to
negotiations between pensioners and the active members. These
negotiations were unsuccessful and the pensioners launched an
application on March 3, 1995. Among other matters, they sought a
declaration that the letter they received on retirement or
withdrawal (see para. 16) constituted a promissory note. They
also sought payment of those notes when due.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33]  The Trustees commenced their own application on May 10,
1995. They asked the court to quash or stay the pensioners'
application, to authorize the Trustees to wind up the Fund and
for a determination as to entitlement and distribution.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34]  The applications were heard together on June 10 and 11,
1996, and judgment was handed down on February 20, 1997. The
judge below found that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           All parties agree that the Fund is not now
           financially viable
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           ... the Court has inherent jurisdiction to
           order termination of a benevolent fund
           such as the Fund in issue here and upon
           termination to settle a scheme of
           distribution of fund assets.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35]  It was common ground that the Fund constituted money held
in trust. The judge below went on to find, as argued on behalf of
the pensioners, that the circumstances gave rise not only to a
trust but to a contract amongst the members of Local 113:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           ... This Court finds that a contract,
           though badly documented, was entered among
           the members of Local 113 beginning in
           1918. While it was varied on consent from
           time to time, the most recent and
           crystallized understanding is set out in
           the 1980 decision acquiesced in by the
           retirees to receive 20% on retirement and
           the balance of 80% on attaining 65 or on
           the death of the retiree whichever
           occurred earlier. The particulars of these
           contracts were confirmed by the form of
           letters sent to Mr. Penfound and others
           quoted earlier in these reasons. The
           beneficiaries have a right to compel the
           administration of the trust and the
           completion of the contract.... This Court
           finds that those letters represent a
           confirmation of the contract between the
           retirees and the members of the Local. The
           Pensions' Association [sic] and the
           retirees being beneficiaries of both the
           contract and the trust have a right to
           compel the administration of the trust.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36]  It was also argued on behalf of the pensioners that their
interests were vested. The judge below accepted that submission,
concluding as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           ... The interest of the retirees vested on
           retirement and the contractual obligations
           of the Trustees is set out in the pro-
           forma letter to Mr. Penfound above quoted
           and similar letters sent to retirees....

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37]  The judge below also found that the letters received by
members on retirement or withdrawal did not constitute promissory
notes. Notwithstanding this, she concluded that &quot;the
beneficiaries have a right to compel the administration of the
Trust and the completion of the contract.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38]  The judge below went on to find the Trustees in breach of
their duty as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                In taking the steps that they did the
           Trustees have not only breached the
           contractual relationship between Local 113
           and the retirees, they have taken it upon
           themselves to re-write an unwritten Trust
           Agreement which was finally reduced to
           some form of writing by the understanding
           in 1980 that retirees were entitled to 20%
           of the formula on retirement and the
           balance at age 65 or on death whichever
           occurred first. That the earlier Trustees
           maladministered the Fund to the detriment
           of everyone is quite clear but Local 113
           must bear the responsibility for that
           maladministration. The Trustees of the
           Benevolent Fund cannot be considered
           independent in any sense of the word and
           were controlled and guided by the
           decisions of Local 113.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39]  To give effect to her findings, the judge below ordered
that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">      (1)  the Fund be wound up, effective June 30, 1996;
      (2)  the monies paid into the escrow account from 1993 to
           June 30, 1996, be paid over to the Fund;
      (3)  persons who have retired up to and including June 30,
           1996, are entitled to be reimbursed out of the Fund
           forthwith in accordance with the 1980 agreement;
      (4)  Local 113 is liable to make up any shortfall in
           paying those claims;
      (5)  in the event of any surplus in the Fund after paying
           out persons who have retired up to and including June
           30, 1996, such surplus is to be distributed on a pro
           rata basis to the active members of Local 113;
      (6)  there be a reference to the Master to settle all
           accounts respecting the winding up of the Fund and
           the distribution of assets.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]  In my respectful view, the judge below erred in concluding
that retiring members had an entitlement based upon contract.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  In reaching that conclusion, reference was made to Orchard
v. Tunney (1957), 8 D.L.R. (2d) 273 (S.C.C.) in which Rand J.
stated that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Apart then from statute, that a union is
           held together by contractual bonds seems
           obvious....

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]  This statement was made in a context of explaining the
legal relationship between and amongst members of the same union.
In the instant circumstances, it is common ground that the Fund
constitutes trust monies. No further explanation of the
relationship between the Fund and the members of Local 113 is
therefore necessary.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43]  Looked at from another aspect, the situation has none of
the elements of a contract, there being neither offer nor
acceptance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44]  In the alternative, if there is a contractual relationship,
why would it not include all contributors? I agree with the judge
below that the letter sent to retiring or withdrawing members is
not a promissory note. It is clearly intended as a simple
statement of a future fact. It was not intended to be, and did
not constitute a promise to pay. Nothing in the letter suggests
any intention on the part of anyone to create a contract or
contractual relations. There was no promise to pay anything C
simply a statement that the balance of the addressee's
entitlement would be payable to him or her at age 65, or upon
death, whichever happened first.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45]  Returning then to the question whether or not there was a
contractual relationship, there is no basis upon which to draw a
line between active members and retired members and to say that
the latter have a contractual right to payment while the former
do not.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46]  In other words, if the pensioners are involved in a
contractual relationship, so too are the active members of Local
113. Accordingly, for purposes of distribution of the Fund, there
is no basis in contract for distinguishing between those have
retired or withdrawn and those who have not.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47]  The judge below concluded that the interests of those who
had retired was vested. No authority or analysis was provided to
support this proposition. It is difficult to see how, as a matter
of equity, a distinction should be drawn, in circumstances such
as these, between a person who retired or withdrew from Local 113
on the day before the date scheduled for distribution and one who
retired or withdrew the day after. I would, for this reason,
disregard the concept of vesting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48]  The next question is that of priority. On the basis of
contract and vesting, the judge below gave priority to the claims
of those who had retired, the cut off date being June 30, 1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49]  Leaving aside for the moment the matter of the date, if
contract and vesting are removed as criteria, is there any reason
remaining why retirees should be paid in priority?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50]  The reasons of the judge below suggest that there is,
namely, the maladministration of the Fund in the past. In this
regard, she said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           ... That the earlier Trustees
           maladministered the Fund to the detriment
           of everyone is quite clear but Local 113
           must bear the responsibility for that
           maladministration. The Trustees of the
           Benevolent Fund cannot be considered
           independent in any sense of the word and
           were controlled and guided by the
           decisions of Local 113.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51]  I agree that there was maladministration. I also agree that
the Trustees cannot be distinguished from Local 113. I cannot,
however, see any rationale for making Local 113 liable to make up
any deficiency in the Fund in paying out the pensioners in full.
Such a process would simply penalize present and future members
of Local 113 for the benefit of former members. If &quot;fault&quot; is to
be considered, then the reality is that that fault or blame must
be spread over many years, at least as far back as 1971. Some,
perhaps many, of the present pensioners were active members
during part or all of that period.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52]  The proposition may be tested by asking why a person who
became an active member of the Fund in 1992 should be penalized
for the benefit of a person who was an active member, perhaps
even a trustee, during the period 1970 to 1990, and then retired.
I can see no reason whatever.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53]  I conclude, therefore, that the objective of this
litigation should be to find the most equitable method or methods
of distributing the proceeds of the Fund with maximum speed and a
minimum expense.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESOLUTION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54]  After reviewing the history of the Fund, Gotlib J.
concluded that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           The hostilities between the retirees and
           Local 113 and the Trustees of the
           Benevolent Fund are such, however, that
           the Fund cannot continue to operate. The
           good will and co-operation that is
           required is simply not there, and the
           hostile parties must be separated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55]  This same condition was reflected in the presentation of
the appeal and cross-appeal in that only the pensioners suggested
the continuation of the operation of the Fund, and then only for
the limited purpose of paying themselves out in full.
Accordingly, the real issue is not whether to continue the Fund
but how to distribute it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56]  In that regard the pensioners' factum submitted that
payment should be made on the 20%/80% basis established in 1980.
The active members and the trustees argued in favour of a pro
rata distribution.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57]  The court did not find that the submissions adequately
dealt with the circumstances and accordingly requested further
assistance with regard to distribution.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58]  The submissions of the pensioners in this respect first
repeated their claim for payment in priority to others in
accordance with the scheme of entitlement first adopted in 1980.
If distribution pro rata is to be ordered, they want it to take
into account three factors:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">      (a)  that their contributions were made over time, not in
           1995 dollars;
      (b)  that any money received by active members would be
           received in advance of any entitlement under the
           terms of the Fund; and
      (c)  that active members would be relieved of the
           obligation of making further contributions and could
           invest the money thus saved at better rates of return
           than those historically received on the assets of the
           Fund.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59]  The pensioners suggested devices designed to take each of
these factors into account.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60]  The active members are opposed to distribution on this
basis. They submit that the most equitable approach is one based
upon the Schedule of Entitlements set out in the Fund rules
immediately prior to October 13, 1994.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61]  As I understand their proposal, however, it is not based
upon a 20%/80% approach but upon a payment, real or notional, of
20%, and then, instead of a payment of 80%, a return of
contributions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62]  The impression I get is that the use of the Schedule of
Entitlements is more symbolic than actual and that insufficient
regard is had to the time factor, or, to put it another way, the
fact that the pensioners' contributions were paid over time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63]  In the final analysis, I am not persuaded that the court
has received sufficient information to enable it to make the
decision as to the appropriate method of distribution. For
instance, neither side provided a comparison of the results of
the two methods. It would have been helpful to provide examples
to illustrate what each would receive according to the two
methods and to have submissions explaining or justifying the
differences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64]  In these circumstances I see no alternative but to direct a
reference to the Master to determine a scheme or schemes of
distribution of the Fund. It will be part of such scheme to
determine a date or dates for the winding up of the Fund.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DISPOSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65]  To summarize, the appeal of the active members is allowed
and the order of Gotlib J. of February 20, 1997, is set aside. In
its place will go an order as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           1.   THIS COURT ORDERS THAT the
                Application not be stayed and that
                the counter-application of Mike
                Dailly et al. as Trustees be
                dismissed to the extent it requests
                such relief.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           2.   AND THIS COURT ORDERS THAT the Fund
                be wound up and distributed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           3.   AND THIS COURT ORDERS THAT there be a
                reference to the Master or such other
                person as the parties may agree upon
                to determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                (a)  the date of such winding up;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                (b)  the method or scheme of
                     distribution of the
                     proceeds of the Fund; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                (c)  the method or scheme of
                     disposition of the escrow fund.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The cross-appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to the
costs of the hearing below or the appeal or cross-appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66]  These proceedings, it seems to me, are the product of a
failure of leadership, a failure which extends back for at least
25 years. While a reference has been directed, there is no
sensible reason why the issues remaining outstanding could not be
resolved more expeditiously, and at least as fairly, by
reasonable efforts by the parties themselves.
