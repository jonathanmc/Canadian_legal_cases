    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The sole question before us on this appeal is whether there
is a clearly more appropriate forum than Ontario in which the
appellant plaintiff's action should be tried.  In his statement
of claim, the appellant claims inter alia a declaration that an
assignment of copyright from him to the respondent Greensleeves
Publishing Limited is null and void, and an order vesting full
copyright in the musical work &quot;Oh Carolina&quot; in the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  A major fact argued before the motions judge was whether or
not the appellant was a party to an action brought in England by
the respondent Greensleeves Publishing Limited and the appellant
to determine the ownership of the copyright in the musical and
literary work entitled &quot;Oh Carolina&quot;. The work was authored by
the appellant and assigned by him to Greensleeves.  The appellant
originally joined with Greensleeves in that action.  They claimed
copyright infringement against two named defendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Subsequent to the commencement of that action, the appellant
contested the validity of the assignment agreement between him
and Greensleeves.  As a result, Greensleeves obtained an order
from the English court having the appellant removed as plaintiff
and added as a defendant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant's statement of defence in the English action
contained the following denial:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Third Defendant [John Folkes] denies that
          he continues to assert that he remains the
          owner of the copyrights as alleged in
          paragraph 7.1 of the Amended Statement of
          Claim or at all. The Third Defendant asserts
          that he was the owner of the said copyright
          and all rights therein prior to 11 February
          1993, being the date of the assignment
          referred to in paragraph 3 of the Amended
          Statement of Claim. If this is denied by the
          Plaintiffs then any dispute concerning the
          interpretation of the said document as
          between the Second Plaintiff [Greensleeves]
          and Third Defendant is a matter for
          independent arbitration in accordance with
          clause 14 thereof.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Following this acknowledgement, the respondent Greensleeves
discontinued the English action against the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The English decision contained a declaration that the
appellant Folkes &quot;is the sole author of the music and lyrics of
the song entitled in 'Oh Carolina', and that the respondent
Greensleeves &quot;is the owner of the copyrights in the Song&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The appellant now takes the position that he did not agree
to being added as a defendant in the English action and did not
authorize the filing of the statement of defence relied on by
Greensleeves in that action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In our view, that dispute alone would have been sufficient
in this case to justify the decision of the motions judge that
England is clearly the most appropriate forum in which to bring
the appellant's action.  However, the motions judge relied not
only on that fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but on a number of additional facts which appropriately connect
the action to the courts of England. In our view, he made no
error in permanently staying the appellant's action in this
jurisdiction against all defendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appeal is dismissed. There will be one set of costs of
the appeal in favour of the respondents Greensleeves Publishing
Limited, Northridge Music Company and Estate of Henry Mancini;
and costs in favour of Virgin Records (Canada) Inc., Global Music
Ltd. and Orville Burrell.</font></pre></td>
