[1]  The court is divided in this case. Mr. Justice Laskin and I
are of the opinion that the motions judge failed to give
sufficient weight to the efforts made by the appellant to
promptly deliver his defence, personally, on learning of the
respondent=s motion and to the fact that the appellant's
statement about the merits are virtually uncontradicted in the
material.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In these circumstances, particularly as no prejudice has
been shown by the respondent, the delay of nine months before
moving to set aside the judgment is not sufficient to deny the
appellant the opportunity to defend. We would allow the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Madam Justice Charron does not agree. In her opinion, the
motions judge properly exercised his discretion as the delay
called for some explanation and none was forthcoming.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appeal is allowed, the judgment is set aside but on the
following terms and conditions:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   the writ of execution remains
          in place;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   the defence must be filed
          within ten days;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   the costs of the respondent thrown
          away are the costs of the motion and
          the costs of this appeal are to be paid
          forthwith after assessment.         </font></pre></td>
