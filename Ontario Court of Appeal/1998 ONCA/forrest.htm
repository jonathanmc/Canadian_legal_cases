    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This sentence appeal illustrates once again the problem of
dealing in a criminal context with a person who is suffering from
a serious mental disorder.  The appellant was convicted on April
25th, 1996 by Mr. Justice Whealey of the Ontario Court (General
Division) of one charge of aggravated assault contrary to section
268 of the Criminal Code, and one charge of sexual assault with a
weapon contrary to section 272 of the Code, after a three day
trial by judge alone. On June 17, 1996, Whealey J. sentenced the
appellant to 9 years imprisonment on each charge, to be served
concurrently. In addition, a lifetime section 100 order was
imposed.  The appellant now appeals his sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The facts giving rise to these charges were largely
undisputed at trial, as the major issue was whether the accused
had the specific intent to murder; in addition, the appellant
raised a section 16 defence, which was rejected.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Sometime during the afternoon of November 14, 1995, the
appellant entered the Old City Hall courthouse in Toronto.
Concealed on his person was a 6 inch knife.  At 4:45 p.m., he
encountered K.B.  The appellant walked around the floor twice to
ensure that there was no one else nearby. He then approached K.B.
and asked her at what time the courts closed. She told him that
the courts would close at 5 p.m., but that the night courts would
sit later that evening.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant then moved closer to K.B., blocking the
doorway. When K.B. asked him what the matter was, he answered:
&quot;Take your clothes off. I want to rape you&quot;.  K.B. immediately
began to struggle with the appellant. Although she did initially
break free, she fell after running about three metres. The
appellant once again grabbed K.B., restrained her with one arm,
and used his free hand to retrieve the knife. The appellant held
the knife close to K.B.'s neck and stated: &quot;I am going to kill
you&quot;; he said this twice. After a further struggle with the
appellant, K.B. managed to free herself and escaped. It was at
this time that she realised that the appellant had cut her with
the knife: she had received a puncture wound in the area of the
jugular vein of her neck, and three slash or cut wounds on her
right arm, near the elbow.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant was arrested at the scene shortly afterwards.
He was charged with and tried for attempted murder and sexual
assault with a weapon. He was convicted of the lesser and
included offence of aggravated assault, as well as the sexual
assault charge. A section 16 defence was rejected at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  During the sentencing proceedings, a report by Dr. A.
MacDonald of the Clarke Institute  was filed on behalf of the
Crown. In this report Dr. MacDonald affirmed an earlier diagnosis
of the appellant that he manifested definite evidence of sexual
sadism suggesting a person who received sexual satisfaction from
inflicting pain including fear, or inflicting humiliation on
sexual partners. Dr. MacDonald concluded that &quot;there was little
doubt that he is a risk for future acting out which could result
in serious or lethal consequences&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Nevertheless, the sentence of nine years imposed by the
trial judge is not within the range for similar offences
committed by similar offenders. It is not a fit sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant's prior record of one assault is minimal. He
served seven months in pre-trial custody. The sentence does not
reflect the gravity of offence but rather manifests an intention
to simply remove the appellant from circulation.  In fact, the
trial judge in his reasons made reference to a sentence of
&quot;preventive custody&quot; being required. The offence itself, while
serious, would not warrant a penitentiary sentence without the
benefit of Dr. MacDonald's report.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In our view, while giving full recognition to Dr.
MacDonald's opinion that the appellant is a dangerous person
liable to re-offend, we do not think a sentence in excess of five
years is justified. Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is
granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced from
nine years to five years on each charge, to be served
concurrently. The lifetime section 100 order was not appealed,
and is to remain in place.</font></pre></td>
