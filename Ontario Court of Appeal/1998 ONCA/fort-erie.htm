    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The justice of the peace found that the respondent had not
presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements of the
charge. The Provincial Court judge did not impugne this
conclusion of the justice of the peace. He appeared to come to
the same conclusion when he concluded that there are &quot;wide open
spaces&quot; in the evidence and he was unable or unwilling to enter a
conviction. Independently of any error of interpretation on the
part of the justice of the peace, both courts appear to have come
to the same conclusion that the respondent had failed to prove
the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
[2]   In  any event, Justice Gowan was invited by counsel either
to uphold the acquittal or, based on the evidence and the
findings of the fact by the justice of the peace, to enter a
conviction. In our view, these were the two options properly open
to him. In ordering a new trial, particularly in view of the
comments regarding the gaps in the evidence, he erred.
[3]  The appeal is therefore allowed, the order for a new trial
is set aside and the acquittal is restored. In the circumstances,
there should be no order as to costs.</font></pre></td>
