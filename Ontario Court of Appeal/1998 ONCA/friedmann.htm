    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   The  issue  in  this appeal is whether,  on  certain  facts
pleaded  in  the  statement of claim and the  two  statements  of
defence, the defendants before us can be liable to the plaintiff,
as undisclosed principals, for money owing on a mortgage of land,
registered  on  February 6, 1989, by Final Note  Limited  to  the
plaintiff,  Friedmann  Equity  Developments  Incorporated.    The
plaintiff,  in  its statement of claim, alleges that  Final  Note
Limited executed the mortgage as a bare trustee and agent for the
defendants. Although the document in question is in the form of a
charge  under the Land Registration Reform Act, 1984, the parties
before  us  referred to it as a mortgage and I shall continue  to
use this term in these reasons.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   The  statement of defence of the defendants represented  by
Mr. Malen includes the following:
          15.   These  defendants state that  if  Final
          Note  acted  as  their agent,  which  is  not
          admitted but denied, they are, in any  event,
          entitled to a dismissal of this action  based
          on  the  rule  that an undisclosed  principal
          cannot  be  sued  by  a  third  party  on  an
          indenture executed by an agent under seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The  statement of defence of the other group of defendants,
represented by Mr. Orbach, contained the same pleading.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Proceedings to this Point</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   As  indicated,  this is an action on the  covenant  in  the
mortgage.  In its statement of claim the plaintiff claims payment
and then pleads as follows:
          2.    The Defendant, Final Note Limited  (the
          &quot;Bare  Trustee&quot;) is a corporation  under  the
          laws of Ontario and is the legal title holder
          to   property   municipally  known   as   100
          Tullamore   Court,  Brampton,  Ontario   (the
          &quot;Property&quot;).
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.    The  Bare  Trustee holds title  to  the
          Property  as  trustee and/or  agent  for  the
          remaining defendants which are the beneficial
          owners thereof (the remaining defendants will
          hereinafter  be collectively referred  to  as
          the &quot;Owners&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          7.    The  Plaintiff  states  that  the  Bare
          Trustee  was created for the sole purpose  of
          holding title to the Property as Bare Trustee
          on behalf of the Owners.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.   The Plaintiff states that at no material
          time   did   the   Bare  Trustee   have   any
          independent existence either in  fact  or  in
          law  and  that  at  all  material  times  all
          decisions  regarding  the  Property  and  the
          Mortgage were made by the Owners.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          10.  Alternatively, the Plaintiff states that
          at  all material times the Bare Trustee acted
          as agent for the Owners who are at law liable
          to the Plaintiff under the Mortgage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The statements of defence, in so far as they relate to  the
issue in this appeal, contain the allegation I have set forth  in
paragraph  [2]  of these reasons. Although not  material  to  the
issue on this appeal, I mention that in each statement of defence
there  is  a  denial of a trustee or agency relationship  between
Final Note and the defendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   Both  sets of defendants commenced third party  proceedings
against  the  solicitors who represented them on the transaction.
Because  the  allegations  made  in  these  proceedings  are  not
material to the issue in this appeal, I need not set them forth.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Both  sets  of defendants also brought motions  under  rule
21.01(1)(a)  for an order dismissing the action against  them  on
the ground that (to quote from Mr. Malen's notice of motion)
          If  Final  Note  did act  as  agent  for  the
          remaining defendants, they are entitled to  a
          dismissal of this action on the basis of  the
          rule that an undisclosed principal cannot  be
          sued   by  a  third  party  on  an  indenture
          executed by an agent under seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Orbach's notice of motion contains the identical ground.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   Under  rule  21.01(1)(a), in so far as these  motions  were
concerned,  the  only materials that may be  considered  are  the
pleadings (more particularly, only those parts of them that  give
rise to the issue) and the mortgage in question.</font></pre>

state that it is in Form 2 prescribed under the Land Registration
Reform Act, 1984. It is entitled &quot;Charge / Mortgage of Land&quot;. The
principal  amount  is  $1,000,000.  In  paragraph  (8)   entitled

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  Borins  J.,  who  heard the motions,  dismissed  them.  His
reasons are succinct and read as follows:
          This action involves the question of a cestui
          que trust with respect to a covenant made  on
          its  behalf by a trustee. In this  case,  the
          covenant is contained in a mortgage signed by
          the  1st  defendant under corporate seal,  as
          bare   trustee   for  some   of   the   other
          defendants. Some of the defendants,  who  are
          the  moving parties, submit that they are not
          liable,   as  undisclosed  principals,   and,
          therefore,  the  action should  be  dismissed
          against them.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is no disagreement amongst counsel that
          an undisclosed principal cannot be sued by  a
          third  party  on an indenture executed  by  a
          trustee,  or agent, under seal. Nor is  there
          disagreement, that in certain circumstances a
          mortgage  signed  by  a  mortgagor,  by   the
          application of its corporate seal, may be  an
          indenture under seal, and therefore,  attract
          the  application  of the first  principle  of
          law.  However, whether what would  ordinarily
          be  a  simple contract is transformed into  a
          contract by specialty by execution under seal
          can  only be determined having regard to  the
          intention of the parties to the contract,  as
          evidenced  by  its true construction.  In  my
          view,  this only can be determined by a trial
          judge  who will hear the evidence surrounding
          the execution of the contract.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In  MacDonald  v. Ontario Hydro  [(1994),  19
          O.R. (3d) 529 (Gen. Div.) aff'd 86 O.A.C.  37
          (Div.  Ct.)] and T-D Bank v. Deloitte Haskins
          and  Sells  [(1991), 5 O.R.  (3d)  417  (Gen.
          Div.)]  this  Court has held  that  the  same
          principles or tests apply whether a motion is
          brought,    as    in   this    case,    under
          R.21.01(1)(a), or under R.21.01(2)(b). On the
          application of this test, the moving  parties
          have  not  satisfied me  that  it  is  plain,
          obvious and beyond a doubt that the plaintiff
          could not succeed at trial.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  Steele  J. granted leave to appeal to the Divisional  Court
from this decision. His brief reasons read:
          This  motion is allowed. Leave to  appeal  is
          granted.   The  charge  was  executed   under
          corporate   seal  and  in  my  opinion,   the
          decision  of  Borins  J. conflicts  with  the
          decisions in Tri-S Investments Ltd.  v.  Vong
          [1991]  No.  2292 (Feldman J.)  and  Parkview
          Towers of Hamilton v. C.I.B.C. et al. (1980),
          30   O.R.   (2d)  294  that  held   that   an
          undisclosed  principal cannot be  sued  by  a
          third  party  on  such an  indenture.  It  is
          desirable that leave to appeal be granted.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In  addition,  I  have reason  to  doubt  the
          correctness of the decision and the matter is
          of  such general importance that leave should
          be granted. Borins J. felt that the intention
          of  the parties must be determined. I see  no
          reason  to  doubt  the  correctness  of  that
          statement relating to whether or not a simple
          contract  is  turned  into  a  specialty   by
          execution under seal. I have reason to  doubt
          its  applicability  to a charge  or  mortgage
          executed under seal which may be specialty in
          itself without looking to intent.

          trustee under seal. Here the indenture was  a
          mortgage on land executed under seal, and  in
          our opinion, could only have been a specialty
          debt.  With  respect to the  learned  motions
          judge,  we  are of the view that  in  such  a
          situation  there is no room for  ascertaining
          the intent of the parties. Accordingly it  is
          plain  and obvious that the appeal should  be
          allowed  and  the action against  the  moving
          parties dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  Although the pleadings show that there are disputes on  the
facts  in this proceeding, the purpose of this motion under  rule
21.01(1)(a)  is  to  determine  a  question  of  law  raised   by
statements  of  defence as framed in the  notices  of  motion.  I
repeat it:
          If  Final  Note  did act  as  agent  for  the
          remaining defendants, they are entitled to  a
          dismissal of this action on the basis of  the
          rule that an undisclosed principal cannot  be
          sued   by  a  third  party  on  an  indenture
          executed by an agent under seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  As  I  have  said, the only document respecting  the  facts
before  the court, in addition to the pleadings, is the  mortgage
in question. For the purpose of addressing the question raised we
are obliged to accept as true the allegations in the statement of
claim respecting Final Note Limited holding title to the property
as  a bare trustee and/or agent for the remaining defendants  who
are  the  beneficial owners of the property,  some  of  whom  are
respondents before the court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Further, the issue raised should not be resolved against the
plaintiff unless it is plain, obvious, and beyond doubt  that  it
could  not  succeed  at trial. I refer to the authorities  relied
upon by Borins J. for this proposition: Toronto-Dominion Bank  v.
Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 417 (Gen. Div.)  and
MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 529 (Gen.  Div.),
aff'd 86 O.A.C. 37(Div. Ct.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Trustee as Agent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  Accepting that Final Note Limited is a bare  trustee,  that
is,  it  is subject to the control of the beneficiaries  and  not
bound by any trust terms, it follows that it has the power as  an
agent  to  bind the defendants, as principals, to  the  terms  of
contracts  it makes on their behalf. I refer to Trident  Holdings
Ltd. v. Danand Investments Ltd. (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 65 (C.A.) at
73-79.  Final Note's agency powers, in so far as its  contractual
powers  are  concerned, predominate over its powers  as  trustee.
Accordingly,  the only issue is whether the form of the  mortgage
is  such that the defendants before the court are insulated  from
liability  by what was referred to by the parties as the  &quot;sealed
contract rule&quot; or the &quot;sealed indenture rule&quot;. In these reasons I
shall refer to it as the &quot;sealed contract rule&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Sealed Contract Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]  While  the  rule  has  been criticized  by  reason  of  its
technicality (see, for example, Laskin J.A. in Re Zamikoff et al.
v. Lundy et al., [1970] 2 O.R. 8 (Ont. C.A.) at 18-19), it is not
in  question that the rule exists and that it is binding on  this
court.  I  refer  to the following authority:  Porter  v.  Pelton
(1903), 33 S.C.R. 449; Margolius v. Diesbourg, [1937] S.C.R. 183;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  I  mention  now  that,  although  the  parties  accept  the

judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In Porter v. Pelton, supra, Nesbitt J. said for the court at
p. 455:
          The  cases  for over a century establish  the
          rule   of  law  firmly  that  where  partners
          contract  under seal they are  bound  by  the
          form of the instrument, and where parties  so
          signing  are merely acting as agents and  are
          so described, only the parties signing can be
          bound. A principal or partner cannot be bound
          unless   he  has  given  authority  for   his
          signature under seal, and is designated as  a
          party  to the deed. A cestui que trust cannot
          either sue or be sued upon a covenant made by
          and in the name of a trustee on his behalf.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(I  observe  that the last sentence does not state  part  of  the
sealed contract rule. Further, it is subject to the qualification
that the trustee is not a bare trustee: Trident Holdings Ltd.  v.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  In  Margolius v. Diesbourg, supra, Davis J.  said  for  the
court at p. 189:
          It  has long been settled that no person  can
          sue  or  be sued in an action at law  upon  a
          contract under seal, unless the person  is  a
          party  to the contract. Pollock on Contracts,
          10th ed. (1936), at pp. 97 and 98 states  the
          rule thus:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               When a deed is executed by an agent

               of   the  agent  and  not  of   the
               principal,   then   the   principal
               cannot  sue or be sued upon  it  at
               law,  by  reason of  the  technical
               rule  that those persons  only  can
               sue  or  be  sued upon an indenture
               who are named or described in it as

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  rule was applied in this Court in Porter
          v. Pelton [(1903), 33 Can. S.C.R. 449], where
          it  was held that no action could lie  on  an
          agreement under seal that had not been signed
          by   the  defendant,  even  if  it  were   an
          agreement for his benefit and a seal was  not
          necessary.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]   Following  this,  Davis  J.  dealt  with  &quot;the   different
considerations&quot;  which  prevail in  a  proceeding  in  equity  in
respect  of a contract involving a trust. In this part  he  dealt
with  the  decision of the English Court of Appeal in  Harmer  v.
Armstrong,  [1934]  1  Ch.  65. The plaintiff  relies  upon  this
decision  in its submissions respecting the scope of  the  sealed
contract rule and I shall consider it later in these reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  In  both  Porter v. Pelton and Margolius v.  Diesbourg  the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25]  In  Whisper Holdings Ltd. v. Zamikoff, supra,  the  Supreme
Court  of  Canada  dismissed an appeal from the judgment  of  the
Court  of  Appeal from Ontario in Re Zamikoff et al. v. Landy  et
al., [1970] 2 O.R. 8. At page 120 Spence J. said for the court
          It  is, of course, well established that when
          an  instrument  is executed under  seal  only
          those  who are expressed in it to be  parties
          thereto  can  sue or be sued  on  a  covenant
          contained in the said instrument. No  further
          authority  is required than Porter v.  Pelton
          and  Holden  (1903),  33  S.C.R.  449,  where
          Nesbitt  J. said at p. 455: [This passage  is
          set forth above.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  I note that this statement was dictum because, in agreement
with  the  Court of Appeal for Ontario, the court found that  the
parties  who were seeking the benefit of the rule to  escape  the
burden   of  the  contract  in  question,  were  liable  on   the
alternative basis of novation. Notwithstanding that it was dictum
it  is  an  authoritative statement of the law,  particularly  in
light  of the implicit invitation in the judgment of Laskin  J.A.
in  the  Court of Appeal, who regarded himself as bound by Porter
v. Pelton, that the final court review the rule. See also Sellars
v.  The  Queen,  [1980]  1 S.C.R. 527 at  529-30  respecting  the
binding effect of dicta in Supreme Court of Canada judgments.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Basic Arguments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The basic arguments before us are as follows:
          (1)  The plaintiff submits that Borins J. was
          right. The affixation of Final Note's seal to
          the  mortgage does not necessarily mean  that
          it  is  a  contract under seal,  because  the
          affixation may have merely been a part of the
          corporation's signature without involving the
          making  of a contract under seal. Whether  it
          amounted to the latter is a question of  fact
          that requires a trial to be resolved.
          (2)    In  response  to  the  foregoing,  the
          defendants  submit  that Steele  J.  and  the
          Divisional  Court  were  right.  Because  the
          document  in  question was  an  indenture  of
          mortgage  executed under seal it  could  only
          have   been  a  specialty  debt,  i.e.,  been
          embodied in a deed which attracts the  sealed
          contract  rule.  This  leaves  no  room   for
          ascertaining intent as contemplated by Borins
          J.  Intent, according to the argument, is, or
          may  be,  relevant in determining  whether  a
          simple  contract, such as a promissory  note,
          is  converted into a specialty  debt  by  the
          affixation of a seal (see Alton Renaissance I
          v.   Talamanka  Management  Ltd.  (1996),  27
          B.L.R.  (2d) 307 (Ont. Div. Ct.)) but not  in
          this case. Implicit in this view, I think, is
          the  notion that, to the extent the  parties'
          intent  may be relevant, it relates  only  to
          whether they intended to create a mortgage --
          and the answer to this, without question,  is
          that they did.
          (3)   Quite  apart  from the submissions  set
          forth   above  in  paragraph  (1)   and   the
          plaintiff's  answers  to  the  submission  in
          paragraph  (2) that it involves  circular  or
          question-begging  reasoning,  the   plaintiff
          made  two further submissions that relate  to
          the scope of the rule. They were:
          (a)   The  rule  does  not  apply  where  the
          contract  under seal is entered  into  by  an
          agent which is a corporation. This submission
          assumes  that  the document  is  under  seal,
          i.e.,  that  the affixation of the  corporate
          seal  goes beyond the mere function of  being
          the signature of the corporation.
          (b)   There  is  an exception to  the  sealed
          contract rule exemplified in the decision  of
          the  English  Court of Appeal  in  Harmer  v.
          Armstrong, supra.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  I  shall deal with the last two specific submissions before
turning to the earlier, more general, submissions. I mention  now
that I do not think that the general submissions can be addressed
without considering the application to the facts of this case  of
s. 13 of the Land Registration Reform Act, 1984 (now s. 13 of the
Land Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4) referred to by
Steele J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  Does the rule apply where the agent is a corporation?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]  The  defendants  submit  that  the  cases,  with  very  few
exceptions, that apply, or refer to the existence of, the  sealed
contract  rule,  involve  agents who  were  individuals  and  not
corporations and that the rule, which is a technical one,  should
not be extended to cover corporate agents. The shareholders of  a
corporation  enjoy the benefit of limited liability.  Why  should
this be extended to the principals of corporate agents?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]  With  respect,  regardless of the views  I  may  have  with
respect  to  the  soundness  of the rule,  I  do  not  find  this
submission to be persuasive. None of the statements of the rule I
have  set forth earlier, although made in cases involving  agents
who  were  individuals, regarded the fact that the agent  was  an
individual  and not a corporation as being material. The  general
principle  is that a corporation has the same capacity and  power
of  a  natural  person. Business Corporations Act,  R.S.O.  1990,
c.B.11, s. 15.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31]  I turn to the case law. In Tri-S Investments Ltd. v.  Vong,
[1991]  O.J. No. 2292 (Gen. Div.), Feldman J. applied the  sealed
contract rule in a case of a corporate agent as one ground of her
decision. In Edelstein Construction Limited v. The Fire Pit  Inc.
supra, this court at pp. 392-394 accepted that the rule &quot;is  part
of  the  law&quot;  and  was prepared to apply it in  the  case  of  a
corporate  agent,  had the liability of the principals  not  been
based  on  a  ground other than contract and the facts  otherwise
supported  its application. See also Parkview Towers of  Hamilton
v.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce et al (1980), 30 O.R. (2d)
294  (H.Ct.).  where Van Camp J. at 297 referred to  an  argument
based on the sealed contract rule, without adverse comment on the
fact that the agent was a corporation. The case was decided on  a
basis unrelated to the rule.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]  In  support  of its argument on this point,  the  plaintiff
referred  to the judgment of Bouck J. in Kootenay Savings  Credit
Union v. Toudy (1987), 48 R.P.R. 68 (B.C.S.C.). At p. 73 Bouck J.
noted  that under the applicable statute the mortgage  which  was
the basis of the claim in that case had to be executed under seal
in  order for it to be registered in the Land Titles Office.  The
judge  at p. 74 observed that the affixing of the corporate  seal
was  an act demanded by statute and was required by the mortgagee
for   the   purpose  of  securing  its  priority  by   means   of
registration.  The  underlying reasoning  may  be  that,  because
affixing  the seal was to satisfy the statutory requirements  for
registration, the resulting document should not be regarded as  a
contract under seal for the purposes of the sealed contract  rule
- that is, the seal was not affixed for the purpose of creating a
sealed contract within the meaning of the rule.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33]  This  feature of a statutory requirement of a seal  is  one
that does not exist in the present case (indeed, as will be seen,
the  governing  statute in this case provides that  the  mortgage
need  not  be  executed under seal) and so the  decision  can  be
distinguished on this ground.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34]  Quite  apart from the absence of the statutory  requirement
feature in the present case, I have difficulty distinguishing, on
a  principled basis, cases involving corporate agents from  those
involving agents who are individuals.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  The Harmer v. Armstrong Exception</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In Harmer v. Armstrong, supra, the defendant agent (who  was
an  individual)  executed under seal a contract to  purchase  the
copyright  in  certain  periodicals  from  three  of  the   other
defendants. The defendant was found by the trial judge to be  the
agent  and trustee for the plaintiffs and himself. The agreement,
with notice of the plaintiffs' claim that the defendant agent was
acting for them as well as himself, was rescinded. In the action,
the  plaintiffs  claimed a declaration that the  defendant  agent
entered  into and held the benefit of the agreement as agent  and
trustee  for the plaintiffs and an order for specific performance
of  the  agreement. They succeeded on this claim in the Court  of
Appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] Because I think the case is distinguishable from the present
one, on at least one ground, it is not necessary to set forth the
court's  reasoning  in full. The headnote  at  p.  66  states  it
generally and succinctly:
          ...  [A]s  all  the parties to the  agreement
          were  before the Court, the fact that it  was
          under  seal  did  not prevent the  plaintiffs
          from  enforcing it in this action,  when  the
          agency   of   the  defendant   A   had   been
          established,  and  that as  the  defendant  A
          (having  been found to be agent and  trustee)
          was  willing  that  the agreement  should  be
          carried  out, the Court would decree specific
          performance thereof.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] It is an important part of the reasoning of at least two  of
the  three  members of the Court of Appeal that the contract  was
being  enforced  according to its tenor - that is,  that  it  was
being  enforced in favour of the agent and not in favour  of  the
plaintiff  beneficiaries. I refer to Lawrence L.J. at p.  88  and
Romer L.J. at p. 93 and at pp. 94-96. At p. 95 Romer L.J. said:
          As   I  pointed  out  just  now,  under   the
          principle  of equity the contract  is  always
          enforced  in the name of and for the  benefit
          of the trustee. In the present case no one is
          suggesting  that  the  contract   should   be
          performed  in the name of any one other  than
          the trustee Armstrong.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The present case is distinguishable because it is not one of
the  principals or beneficiaries (the defendants)  who  seeks  to
enforce   rights  against  the  other  contracting   party   (the
plaintiff) in circumstances where their agent/trustee (Final Note
Limited)  has  initially refused to enforce. It is,  rather,  one
where  the  other contracting party seeks to have the  principals
found directly liable, as principals, without its being necessary
for  the  agent/trustee Final Note Limited - although a defendant
in  the  action  -  to be involved in the terms of  the  judgment
sought. To parallel the reasoning in Harmer it would be essential
that   Final   Note   be   held   liable   on   behalf   of   the
principals/beneficiaries.  The  reasoning  breaks  down  in  this
context  to  such  an extent that it is pointless  to  pursue  it
further.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39]  Put more simply, the reasoning in Harmer v. Armstrong shows
that,  despite the elaborate nature of the proceedings, it  still
involved a claim by one party to the contract (the trustee/agent)
against  the  other parties. The role of the beneficiaries/agents
was in seeking to enforce this claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]  In  connection with Harmer v. Armstrong, the plaintiff  has
referred  to  the  following  passage  in  Cheshire,  Fifoot  and
Furmston,  Law of Contract, 13th ed. (1996) at p.  495  which  is
based on Harmer v. Armstrong:
          The   technical  rule  [the  sealed  contract
          rule],   however,   is   subject   to    this
          limitation, that if the agent enters  into  a
          sealed contract as trustee for the principal,
          whether the trust is disclosed on the face of
          the  contract  or  not,  and  he  refuses  to
          enforce it against the other party, then  the
          principal,   qua  beneficiary,  may   himself
          enforce any proprietary right to which he  is
          entitled  by  bringing an action against  the
          third  party and the agent. It would seem  to
          follow  that in such a case the principal  is
          equally liable to be sued by the third party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  The  plaintiffs rely on the last sentence in this  passage.
With respect, as I have indicated, I do not follow its reasoning.
It  is essential to the reasoning in Harmer that the contract was
being  enforced  in  the  name of the  agent  against  the  other
contracting  parties  as  defendants.  The  plaintiffs  were  not
asserting  any  rights  they  had in  the  contract  against  the
defendants directly. If the learned authors of this text in their
use  of  the  expression  &quot;qua beneficiary&quot;  meant  this  then  I
respectfully disagree with them. Accordingly, there was no  legal
relationship  which would enable &quot;the third  party&quot;  to  sue  the
principal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]  On  a more general basis, if the final sentence in Cheshire
is  correct,  then  the sealed contract rule  for  all  practical
purposes  does not exist. The judgments in the Supreme  Court  of
Canada,   particularly  Margolius  v.  Diesbourg,   supra   which
considered Harmer v. Armstrong, show that this is not so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Does the Sealed Contract Rule Apply to the Mortgage in this Case?
The Bearing of s. 13 of the Land Registration Reform Act, 1984</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43]  I  turn  now to the basic submissions (1) and  (2)  of  the
parties set forth above. They both are concerned with the  intent
with  which  Final Note's seal was affixed to the  mortgage.  The
plaintiff, adopting the reasoning of Borins J., submits that  the
document is not a contract under seal unless the affixing of  the
seal  was  done with the intent of making it an instrument  under
seal  and  this is a question of fact requiring a trial  for  its
resolution.  The  defendants, based  on  the  Divisional  Court's
approach,  submit  that because the document in  question  is  an
indenture of mortgage it must be regarded as an instrument  under
seal. There is no room for ascertaining intention.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Neither of these submissions take into account s. 13 of  the
Land Registration Reform Act 1984, S.O. 1984, c. 32 which reads:
          13. (1) Despite any statute or rule of law, a
          transfer  or  other document transferring  an
          interest in land, a charge or discharge  need
          not be executed under seal by any person, and
          such  a  document that is not executed  under
          seal has the same effect for all purposes  as
          if executed under seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  Subsection (1) applies to a guarantee in
          a charge.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] There is no question that the mortgage in question, which  I
have  said  is in the form prescribed under the Land Registration
Reform Act, is subject to the provisions of this Act. It is  also
not  in  dispute that &quot;person&quot; in s. 13(1) means both individuals
and corporations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46]  The key words in the provision, as far as the present issue
is  concerned, are &quot;a charge ... that is not executed under  seal
has  the same effect for all purposes as if executed under seal.&quot;
(Emphasis added.) In my view, the effect of this provision is, as
a  matter  of law, to make the covenant to pay in the mortgage  a
covenant  under seal for all purposes, including the  application
of the sealed contract rule. I shall now set forth my reasons for
this conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Contrary to the plaintiff's submission on this point, I have
treated  s.  13(1) as going beyond providing for the requirements
of  documents  for registration under the Act and have  given  it
substantive effect. I think that this is the ordinary meaning  of
the  provision. Its final clause (&quot;[the] charge ... has the  same
effect for all purposes as if executed under seal&quot;) requires this
interpretation.  I  am  inclined to  think  that  the  underlying
rationale  of  the subsection is, while providing for  simplified
forms  of instruments for registration purposes, to preserve  the
common  law  substantive consequences associated with traditional
forms of conveyancing and mortgages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48]  In this regard, I refer to the following provisions in  the
Act relating to &quot;charges&quot;:
          1.   In this Part,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          &quot;charge&quot; means a charge on land given for the
          purpose of securing the payment of a debt  or
          the   performance   of  an  obligation,   and
          includes  a charge under the Land Titles  Act
          and  a mortgage, but does not include a  rent
          charge;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          6.    (1)  A  charge does not  operate  as  a
          transfer of the legal estate in the  land  to
          the chargee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)   Despite  subsection (1), a chargor  and
          chargee  are  entitled to all the  legal  and
          equitable rights and remedies that  would  be
          available   to  them  if  the   chargor   had
          transferred the land to the chargee by way of
          mortgage,   subject   to   a   proviso    for
          redemption.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49]  This  shows  the  intention  to  preserve  the  traditional
substantive   rights   and  remedies  of  chargor   and   chargee
notwithstanding the alteration of one of the traditional elements
of  a mortgage. Cf. Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5, ss.  93
and  97.  Further, s. 13(2) in the Act, set forth above,  clearly
has a direct bearing on substantive rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50]  Legislatures,  like judges, prefer to base  their  work  on
precedent. (See Horack, &quot;The Common Law of Legislation&quot;, 23  Iowa
L.  Rev.  41).  Accordingly,  as  is  often  the  case  with  new
legislation  ,  s.  13(1) is not brand new. It is  reasonable  to
think that it is based, at least in part, on what is now s. 79 in
the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5, which reads:
          79. (1) Despite any statute or rule of law, a
          charge or transfer of registered land may  be
          duly  made  by an instrument not  under  seal
          and,  if  so made, the instrument  and  every
          agreement, stipulation and condition  therein
          has  the same effect for all purposes  as  if
          made  under seal, but this section  does  not
          apply  to  the  execution of  a  transfer  or
          charge by a corporation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)   Subsection  (1) does  not  apply  to  a
          charge  or transfer of registered land  in  a
          part  of Ontario designated under Part  I  of
          the Land Registration Reform Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51]  Section 79(1) has roots in Ontario going back to 1889  when
An  Act regulating certain matters under the Land Titles Act,  52
Vict. C. 20, s. 3 provided:
          3.    Notwithstanding the provisions  of  any
          statute,  or any rule of law, any  charge  or
          transfer  of land registered under  The  Land
          Titles Act may be duly made under a charge or
          transfer  without  seal. This  section  shall
          take  effect  from the 31st day  of  December
          1887.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  to  1911 when this provision was amended by the Land  Titles
Act, 1 Geo. V. c. 28, s. 102 to read:
          102.  Notwithstanding the provisions  of  any
          statute,  or any rule of law, any  charge  or
          transfer  of land registered under  this  Act
          may  be duly made by an instrument not  under
          seal,  and  if  so made, the  instrument  and
          every  agreement, stipulation  and  condition
          therein  shall have the same effect  for  all
          purposes as if it were made under seal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52]  In  Hooper v. Hooper, [1953] O.R. 752, the Court of  Appeal
gave  this  provision  substantive  effect  in  holding  that   a
transfer, to which a seal had not been affixed (p. 754) and which
had  not been registered under the Land Titles Act, was effective
to  transfer  title. The court, at pp. 758-59,  referred  to  the
words in the statute &quot;shall have the same effect for all purposes
as  if made under seal&quot; in giving the transfer the same effect as
a delivered deed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53]  Statutory  provisions similar  to  s.  13(1)  of  the  Land
Registration Reform Act and s. 79(1) of the Land Titles Act, have
earlier  precedents in legislation giving effect to  the  Torrens
system  of  title  registration. See Di Castri,  Registration  of
Title to Land (loose-leaf ed.) at p. 8-11.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54]  In addition to the submission that s. 13(1) should  not  be
given  substantive  effect, the plaintiff  relied  upon  Kootenay
Savings  Credit  Union  v.  Toudy, supra,  which  held  that  the
application  of  the corporate seal to comply  with  registration
requirements  did  not  attract the  sealed  contract  rule.  The
plaintiff submits that an even stronger case can be made for this
conclusion where the mortgage is deemed to be of the same  effect
as  if made under seal by legislation concerned with registration
requirements.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55]  With  respect, Kootenay, assuming it to have  been  rightly
decided, is distinguishable on the basis that the legislation  in
the  present  case is, for the reasons I have given, intended  to
have substantive effect.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] I return to the parties' submissions. The legal framework
governing the mortgage is different from that contemplated by
these submissions. In so far as the intention of the parties with
respect to execution of the mortgage is relevant, it must be
taken to be an intention to comply with the requirements of the
Land Registration Reform Act. The statutory form of the &quot;Charge /
Mortgage&quot; is not that of a traditional indenture of mortgage in
several respects. Accordingly, the factual foundation of the
defendants' argument is lacking. Similarly, in light of the terms
of s. 13(1) of the Land Registration Reform Act, the intent with
which the corporate seal was affixed is not relevant. This
provision, as I have said, makes the sealed contract rule
applicable to the covenant to pay in the mortgage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Arguments of Principle or Policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] Before concluding, I shall refer to arguments of principle
or policy which were addressed to the court to inform our
determination of the application of the sealed contract rule to
this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] The plaintiff relied upon a statement in Edelstein at p. 394
that the doctrine which enables an undisclosed principal to be
sued &quot;has been defended as being fair and as serving a useful
commercial purpose: see Seavey, &quot;The Rationale of Agency&quot; (1920),
29 Yale L.J. 859 at p. 879, Waddams, The Law of Contracts, 3rd
ed. (1993) at p. 170, and Anson's Law of Contract, 25th ed.
(1979), at p. 618.&quot; The plaintiff submitted that the sealed
contract rule should not be allowed to frustrate this commercial
purpose. The statement in Edelstein was a response to the
possible view that holding the undisclosed principals liable in
that case would be &quot;an unexpected windfall&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] While well-established in our law, the doctrine relating to
the undisclosed principal has been severely criticized. In 3 L.Q.
Rev. 358 (1887) at 359 Pollock said: &quot;The plain truth ought never
to be forgotten that the whole law as to the rights and
liabilities of an undisclosed principal is inconsistent with the
elementary doctrines of the law of contract.&quot; See also Ames,
Lectures in Legal History (1913) at p. 453 which refers to the
doctrine as &quot;an anomaly, to be reckoned with of course, but not
to be made the basis of analogical reasoning&quot; and, also, E.J.
Weinrib, &quot;The Undisclosed Principle of Undisclosed Principals&quot;
(1975), 21 McGill Law Journal 297 which recognizes the commercial
utility of the doctrine but, also, refers to the undisclosed
principal as an &quot;enigmatic&quot; creature.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] As far as the good sense and justice of applying the
undisclosed doctrine in this case is concerned, it is argued on
behalf of the defendants that it must be assumed that the
plaintiff in lending the money on the mortgage must be taken to
have been looking solely to the creditworthiness of the borrower,
Final Note Limited, or, more likely, at a time of rising real
estate prices, to the value of the land as security. If the
plaintiff expected more, it should not have closed the
transaction without obtaining additional covenantors - or
guarantors. In these circumstances, to hold the defendants liable
would be to give the plaintiff the benefit of a bargain it did
not make.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] Because the proceeding is at the pleading stage, we do not
know what the particular facts are with respect to these
submissions. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to observe that it
does not necessarily follow that an inability to obtain a
judgment against undisclosed individual principals is a
frustration of reasonable expectations or an injustice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] Having made brief reference to the justice aspects of the
undisclosed principal rule of agency, I now refer to an aspect of
the justice of applying or of not applying the sealed contract
rule, which is an exception to general agency principles.
Accepting that it is a formal rule which has been much
criticized, it is, at least in this jurisdiction, unquestionably
part of our law. Parties may take it into account in structuring
their transactions. The form of the document, either selected or
imposed by law, dictates who may have rights and obligations
under it. For a court to repeal the rule (which is not sought
from us) or cut back on the scope of the rule (which is sought)
could unfairly frustrate the intention of the parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] This latter point was made by the Court of Appeals of New
York in Crowley v. Lewis, 146 N.E. 374 (1925). The court was
asked not to apply the sealed contract rule to enable a contract
to be specifically enforced against undisclosed principals on
whose behalf the contract was executed by the nominal party.
Andrews J. on behalf of a unanimous court said, at p. 374:
          We repeat that we do not feel at liberty to
          change a rule so well understood and so often
          enforced. If such a change is to be made it
          must be by legislative fiat.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          We had no thought [in an earlier decision
          concerned with contracts under seal but not
          the sealed contract rule], however, that all
          distinctions between sealed and unsealed
          instruments were swept aside. Such an idea
          would have been impossible if for nothing
          else because of the rules contained in our
          statutes with regard to the limitations of
          actions. Equally impossible is such an idea
          with regard to the subject now before us.
          Thousands of sealed instruments must have
          been executed in reliance upon the authority
          of Briggs v. Partridge [an 1876 decision
          which refused to hold an undisclosed
          principal liable under a contract under
          seal]. Many times the seal must have been
          used for the express purpose of relieving the
          undisclosed principal from personal
          liability. It may not be unwise to preserve
          the distinction for this especial purpose.
          But whether wise or unwise the distinction
          now exists.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] I would dismiss the appeal, with costs.
