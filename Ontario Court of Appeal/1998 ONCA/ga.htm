    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  On July 20, 1995, the appellant was charged with one count
of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code
and one count of sexual assault contrary to s. 271. The
complainant on both counts was a niece of the appellant. She
alleged that on three occasions between December 1986 and March
1988, the appellant briefly touched and rubbed her vaginal area
while she was fully clothed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On May 3, 1996, the appellant’s trial commenced before
Flaherty P.C.J. in the Ontario Court (Provincial Division). The
appellant testified and denied the allegations.  On June 12,
1996, he was convicted of the sexual assault count. The trial
judge held that the finding of guilt on the sexual count
“precludes a finding of guilt for sexual interference based on
the same conduct” and acquitted the appellant on that count. The
appellant was sentenced to five months imprisonment and three
years’ probation.  He now appeals from his conviction and
sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The complainant was the appellant’s niece. The appellant’s
wife was the sister of the complainant’s mother and was the
complainant’s godmother.  The complainant sometimes called the
appellant her godfather. The complainant was sixteen years of age
at the time she testified. She was unsure how old she was when
the offences took place, but estimated that she was between six
and eight years of age.  She testified that while she was seated
the appellant rubbed her vagina, through her clothing, on three
occasions when their families were visiting. The first of the two
touching incidents happened at the appellant’s home just before
Christmas in either 1986 or 1987, and  the second occurred  a few
weeks later.   The complainant testified that in both incidents
the assault occurred on a red couch in the appellant’s basement;
in both incidents the appellant asked her if it felt good, and
told her not to tell anyone.  The third incident is said to have
occurred at the home of the complainant.   The only other people
who may have been present on any of these occasions were one of
the complainant’s younger sisters and the appellant’s young son,
who were said by the complainant to be present during the second
incident.  There is no explanation as to why these incidents
ceased when they did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant testified and denied touching the
complainant’s vagina and also asserted that he was never alone
with just the complainant and the other children for more than a
few seconds during any of the frequent visits the families paid
to each other’s houses. He stated that the red couch upon which
the complainant testified she was sitting with the appellant when
he touched her the first two times was not in his basement until
the summer of 1988, whereas the time frame alleged in the
information was from December 1, 1986 to March 31, 1988. In
addition, he testified that in 1986 and 1987 part of his basement
was rented out to tenants, and the remaining part was under
construction.  The appellant testified that he was able to
pinpoint the time by referring to bills for products he used to
renovate the basement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant’s wife also testified.  The main thrust of her
evidence, and that of a family acquaintance, was with reference
to the red couch.  They supported the appellant on this point,
testifying that the couch was not in the basement until after the
incidents alleged by the complainant.  The wife also testified to
the fact that her sister did not like the appellant and that in
October of 1995 she told her sister that she would do anything to
put the appellant behind bars.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  As is evident from the above narrative, there was a lapse of
eight to ten  years between the commission of the offences and
the trial. The circumstances of the disclosure of the offences
gives rise to considerable concern.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Sometime in the fall of either 1993 or 1994, the complainant
was talking to a school friend, N.. This disclosure came up
rather innocently when N. stated that she was having trouble at
home.  After the complaint’s disclosure of the touchings,  N.
told the complainant that her cousin’s husband had raped her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  On July 16, 1995, the appellant and his family paid the
complainant’s family a visit.   The complainant was not home, as
she was at Canada’s Wonderland with a friend called L..
According to the complainant’s mother, the appellant, when he
found that the complainant was out with L., stated: “Good.  It’s
not N.”.  When asked why he made this statement, he then said
that N. was a bad influence.  She smoked, her family had problems
and “she is sleeping around with all the guys”.  According to the
mother, the appellant also said that he had seen N. recently with
the complainant in the park and they had tried to hide from him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The next day, July 17, the complainant’s mother asked her
daughter if she had seen the appellant in the park when she had
been there with N..  The complainant said she had not seen the
appellant.  The mother then told her of some of the conversation
she had with the appellant, including that he had said that N.
was a bad influence.  The complainant’s evidence was that during
this conversation, her mother had warned her about the appellant
and told her that if he came to the house when the mother and her
father were not there, she should lock the door and put the chain
on it.  She should not let him in.  The mother said she “should
watch out for him because they’ve heard of other girls”. She
said: “I don’t trust this man.  I don’t want him in the house
with the girls alone.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The complainant then disclosed her account of the sexual
activities of the appellant for the stated reason that she was
concerned for her sisters.  When the complainant’s father heard
of the appellant’s conduct, his first reaction was to confront
the appellant.  However, his wife was opposed to this and on July
18 she took the complainant to the family doctor for some advice.
The doctor referred the complainant to the Children’s Aid
Society, which in turn referred her to the police.  On July 20,
the complainant gave a videotaped interview. The complainant
testified that she had been reluctant to see the police as she
just “wanted the whole thing forgotten about”.  As for the
appellant, he had no knowledge of the allegations until he was
arrested outside his workplace on July 20.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue:   Is the verdict unreasonable?
[11] I have elected to treat this ground of appeal as relating to
the reasonableness of the verdict, but in fairness to counsel for
the appellant, he has insisted that the question should be: In
all the circumstances of the case, is the trial judge’s verdict
unsafe?  Counsel then proceeded to develop an argument that the
court should give an expanded meaning to the word “unreasonable”
in s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Code and even to the word “unsafe” as
it has been applied by this court.  He asked us to import the
concept of  “a lurking doubt” and to quash the verdict on that
basis. Indeed he went further and stated that he was prepared to
concede, for a while at least, that if the court took the
traditional view of “unreasonable” as interpreted by the Supreme
Court of Canada in R. v. Yebes (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417
(S.C.C.), that this case would not meet that standard.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In support of this new standard, counsel referred the court
to a number of cases in the United Kingdom, notably R. v. Cooper
(1969), 53 Cr. App. R. 82 (C.A.) and some in Australia; e.g.
Chamberlain v. The Queen (No. 2) (1984), 153 C.L.R. 521 (Aust.
H.C.).  He also referred us to a decision that I wrote for the
court in R. v. Malcolm (1993), 21 C.R. (4th) 241 (Ont. C.A.)
where at pp. 250-52 I considered and applied Cooper and other
English cases in support of my view that the standard of
unreasonableness embraces an unsafe verdict.  Relying further on
Cooper and other cases, I stated that when considering whether a
verdict was unsafe, the court was entitled to take a subjective
view of the record.  I did not, as suggested by later decisions
commenting on Malcolm, attempt to expand the definition of
“unreasonable” in the Code.  See: R. v. Irani (1996), 81 B.C.A.C.
203 (B.C. C.A.), application for leave to appeal dismissed March
7, 1997, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 575, and R. v. Guyatt (1997), 119
C.C.C. (3d) 304 (B.C. C.A.), application for leave to appeal
dismissed May 14, 1998, [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 601.  My position was
stated in Malcolm at p. 250:
                However, accepting as I must, the
          limitations on this jurisdiction, it is my
          opinion that this court should not hesitate
          to exercise it in a proper case. In practice,
          it is usually invoked by appellants in jury
          cases, but there is no such limitation in the
          Code. I do not think we should avoid our
          responsibility simply because we are faced
          with a decision of the trial judge who has
          not misdirected himself on the law and has
          indicated by his reasons that he is aware of
          the difficulties inherent in the Crown’s
          case.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The cases I have referred to emphasize the
          limitations in appellate jurisdiction, but
          are not that helpful in providing guidance as
          to when the jurisdiction should be exercised.
          I find some comfort in English decisions
          which point out that the final analysis, the
          reaction of the court as to when an injustice
          has been done is a subjective one. While the
          language of the English Court of Appeal’s
          empowering statute is different than our
          Code, the court asks itself what amounts to
          the same question: Is the verdict safe or
          unsatisfactory? I think that as appellate
          judges we will be expected to ask ourselves a
          similar question notwithstanding the absence
          of reversible error on the part of the trial
          judge.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] I believe this position is supported by what was said by
Doherty J.A. in R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)
at 515:
               Section 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal
          Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, requires that
          this court review a trial record to determine
          whether a conviction “is unreasonable or
          cannot be supported by the evidence”. The
          section recognizes that there will be cases
          where despite an error-free trial and the
          existence of some evidence against an
          accused, appellate intervention is necessary
          to avoid an injustice. As Sopinka J. said in
          R. v. Burke (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 205
          (S.C.C.) at 212, s. 686(1)(a)(i) is:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    ¼ intended as an additional and
               salutary safeguard against the
               conviction of the innocent.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The review directed by s. 686(1)(a)(i)
          is a limited one for very good reasons. The
          appellate process is not well suited to the
          assessment of the cogency of evidence led at
          trial. Appellate courts can claim no
          particular expertise in the secondhand
          evaluation of evidence. Appellate assessment
          of the factual merits of a case is not likely
          to be more reliable or accurate than the
          judgment made at first instance.
          Consequently, it is only in the clearest
          cases where the result at trial can be said
          to be unreasonable that appellate
          intervention is warranted. A verdict is
          unreasonable only where the appellate court
          is satisfied that the verdict is one that a
          properly instructed trier of fact acting
          judicially could not reasonably have
          rendered: R. v. Corbett (1973), 14 C.C.C.
          (2d) 385 (S.C.C.) at 389; R. v. Yebes (1987),
          36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) at 430; R. v. S.
          (P.L.) (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at
          197.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The full quotation from Sopinka J. in Burke, supra is:
               I acknowledge that this [s.
          686(1)(a)(i)] is a power which an appellate
          court will exercise sparingly. This is not to
          say that an appellate court should shrink
          from exercising the power when, after
          carrying out its statutory duty, it concludes
          that the conviction rests on shaky ground and
          that it would be unsafe to maintain it. In
          conferring this power on appellate courts to
          be applied only in appeals by the accused, it
          was intended as an additional and salutary
          safeguard against the conviction of the
          innocent.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Accordingly, I do not think that it is necessary to
introduce fresh language to define our jurisdiction as an
appellate court.  In my opinion, there can be no argument that
the jurisdiction of this court is not limited to matters of law
or mixed law and fact.  We have plenary powers over all questions
of fact and are in a position to reverse trial judges on their
verdicts in situations where they have demonstrated no error in
their reasons for conviction. While most of the reported cases
dealing with unreasonable verdicts relate to identification
convictions, the principles are as applicable, indeed even more
applicable for reasons that I will develop, to sexual assault
convictions.  In R. v. S.(W). (sub nom. R. v. Stewart) (1994), 18
O.R. (3d) 509 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused (1994), 93
C.C.C. (3d) vi, after quoting briefly from two judgments of
McLachlin J. in the Supreme Court of Canada (R. v. W.(R.) (1992),
74 C.C.C. (3d) 134 at 141-42, and R. v. Burns (1994), 89 C.C.C.
(3d) 193 at 198-9), I stated at p. 521:
               This court has long recognized that it
          is a statutory judge of fact, as well as of
          law, and that it should exercise its power
          under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Code in cases
          where the evidence in support of a conviction
          is, in the court’s opinion, of such a kind,
          description or character that it would be
          unsafe to rest a conviction on this evidence:
          see R. v. Boyd (1953), 105 C.C.C. 146 at pp.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] At the conclusion of the appellant’s argument, this court
announced that it did not propose to deal with what I might
describe as the “lurking doubt” argument.  Counsel for the Crown
was instructed to address the court on the issue of the
reasonableness of the verdict without reference to the
appellant’s concept of an expanded jurisdiction.
[17] The appellant had submitted that the verdict was unsafe for
the following reasons:
               1.   There was no physical evidence that
          the complainant had been assaulted;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               2.   The appellant testified that the
          assaults did not occur;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               3.   The Crown did not introduce any
          evidence to undermine the credibility of the
          appellant;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               4.   In his reasons for judgment, the
          trial judge did not state why he disbelieved
          the appellant’s evidence and believed the
          complainant’s evidence;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               5.   The complainant’s evidence that the
          assaults in the appellant’s home occurred on
          a red couch in the basement was contradicted
          by the evidence of the appellant, his wife
          and a family friend. They testified that at
          the time of the alleged assaults, the
          appellant’s basement was under construction
          and that the appellant’s red couch was
          located in another part of the house;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               6.   The complainant had a motive to
          fabricate. Her mother had told her that the
          appellant did not like one of her closest
          friends shortly before the complainant
          revealed the alleged assaults. In addition,
          before her disclosure, the complainant had
          learned from her mother that her mother
          suspected that the appellant had engaged in
          untoward conduct with other girls. In the
          complainant’s mind, this could have served to
          justify and add credibility to the
          allegations.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Another point that was stressed in argument is that it is
obvious that there was a long standing animosity between the
complainant’s mother and the appellant.  It was she who repeated
gossip about him to her daughter and put her in fear for her
sisters.  Both the mother and the complainant testified that it
was the mother’s warning about the appellant and the discussion
of the reasons for it that so upset the complainant and led to
her disclosure of the assaults to her mother. It was the mother
who orchestrated the prosecution without bothering to give the
appellant an opportunity to respond to the allegations.
[19] It is conceded by counsel for the appellant that there are
no errors in law in the reasons of the trial judge in convicting
the appellant. I have read them carefully and they say all of the
right things.  However, as indicated in the authorities cited
above, it is in this situation that the residual jurisdiction of
the court is available where in the opinion of the court the
verdict is unreasonable.  In my opinion, I am entitled to take a
subjective view of the evidence and ask myself if I am satisfied
that the verdict is safe.  I have done so and I am not so
satisfied.
[20] It seems to me that the trial judge failed to approach the
complainant’s evidence with the skepticism that it deserved in
this case.  There is not the remotest of supporting evidence that
any sexual acts took place.  Indeed the only objective evidence,
that of the location of the red couch, contradicts the
complainant. The sexual acts are highly ambiguous coming as they
do from an uncle and “godfather” to the young girl.  Any form of
“horseplay” could explain them. Giving the most generous
interpretation to the acts as described by the complainant, they
are hardly consistent with intent to commit a sexual assault.
Even the trial judge noted that at the time of their occurrence,
the complainant did not know what the touchings meant. The
evidence is very much open to the construction that the appellant
could have had some incidental contact with the girl that was
entirely innocent.
[21] There is no pattern of abuse here.  The appellant must have
had more than three opportunities to abuse the girl if he was of
a mind to.  No explanation is offered for the fact that the
assaults simply ceased. On the darker side, the evidence is not
inconsistent with the appellant’s contention that the complainant
had a motive to fabricate, given the appellant’s concerns
regarding her friendship with N..
[22]  Having had the advantage of reading the transcripts of
many of what are termed “historical sexual abuse cases” that have
come before this court over the last decade, I am concerned that
this case does fit a pattern of allegations of sexual abuse that
are initiated by ulterior motives. The complaints are usually of
this vague and unsubstantiated nature.  They are so stale dated
and amorphous that it is impossible for the person accused to
give a detailed rebuttal to them without arousing suspicion as to
why his memory is so precise.
[23] The defence also reveals a pattern.  Faced with attempting
to recall what must have been a non-event to any normal person,
the accused seized upon a material discrepancy in the
complainant’s evidence and demonstrated objectively that the
appellant’s story cannot be true in a significant particular.  In
this case it was the red couch.  The trial judge at no time
stated that he disbelieved the appellant or the other witnesses
on this issue (by way of a sidebar, he did not expressly
disbelieve the appellant on any of his evidence).  His approach
to the red couch evidence was to ignore its importance.  He said:
               The complained of detail is this case of
          course relates to the where of the offence as
          recounted by a six or seven-year-old as
          opposed to the who, the who-did-it and what-
          was-done to her by him.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The criminal courts need a new gatekeeper.  Parliament and
the judiciary have radically eroded the traditional protection
available to the accused in sexual assault cases.  My comment
does not reflect nostalgia.  The changes were long overdue.
However, the pendulum must not be allowed to swing too far in the
other direction.  As I had occasion to observe in R. v. P. (M.B.)
(1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 424, affirmed [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555 at p. 433:
               In our efforts to protect those most
          deserving of protection, we must not neglect
          our traditional role as protectors of the
          rights of the accused to a fair trial.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The majority of sexual offences are now tried without a jury
in the Ontario Court (Provincial Division). There is no
preliminary hearing in which both the Crown and the defence can
make some assessment of the reliability of the complainant’s
testimony. In any event, the safeguard of the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion in weak cases has fallen victim to the
catchword “zero tolerance”. The former rules regarding
corroboration have been abolished. Despite the obvious need in
most cases for some supporting evidence, many judges pay lip
service to this admonition. Distortions in the complainant’s
evidence are too often dismissed as the norm with children. The
accused who testifies is granted no such leeway. The burden
quickly shifts to him to explain his conduct. Reasonable doubt,
the most fundamental concept of British justice, runs the risk of
becoming a hollow invocation, rather than the shield against
injustice it was meant to be.
[26] There has to be a new gatekeeper and that person is the
trial judge. He was not present in this case. The trial judge was
prepared to convict the appellant on the flimsiest of evidence.
This complaint should not have gone to trial, much less have led
to a conviction. I do not require any expanded version of
“unreasonable” to justify interference with this verdict. Where
the trial judge convicts on evidence such as this record
displays, the Court of Appeal has more than the right, it has the
duty to interfere and, in the interests of justice, quash the
verdict as unreasonable.
[27] There were other grounds raised on appeal, including a
sentence appeal. In the light of my concern over the
reasonableness of the verdict, it is not necessary for me to deal
with them.
     Disposition
[28] I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and enter a
verdict of not guilty.

<b>LABROSSE J.A.:</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] My colleague, Finlayson J.A., has rejected the concept of
the &quot;lurking doubt&quot; in the application and interpretation of s.
686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. I agree with his conclusion and
with his reasons for rejecting the argument of counsel for the
appellant that the court should give an expanded meaning to
s. 686(1)(a)(i). Accordingly, this appeal must be decided on the
traditional basis of the reasonableness of the verdict. Finlayson
J.A. concluded that the verdict is not reasonable. Unfortunately,
I cannot agree with his conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">IS THE VERDICT UNREASONABLE?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] On the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Lockyer, counsel for the
appellant, did not argue that the verdict was unreasonable. On
the contrary, he conceded that the verdict was reasonable. He
submitted that the appeal could not succeed on the basis of the
traditional interpretation of s. 686(1)(a) but could only succeed
if his argument, based on the&quot; lurking doubt&quot; concept, was
accepted. I agree with the concession made by counsel for the
appellant. In my view, the verdict is reasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The test to be applied in assessing the reasonableness of
the verdict was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Corbett (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 385 at 389 (S.C.C.), where
Pigeon J., speaking for the majority, stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">...the question is whether the verdict is reasonable, not whether
it is unjustified. The function of the Court is not to substitute
itself for the jury, but to decide whether the verdict is one
that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could
reasonably have rendered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This test was further expanded by McIntyre J. in R. v. Yebes
(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 430 (S.C.C.):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for
that of the jury, in order to apply the test the court must re-
examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the
evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In R. v. Francois (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 289, McLachlin J.,
speaking for the majority, confirmed the above statements. She
specified that the need to reexamine and to some extent reweigh
the evidence also applies to cases where the objection to the
conviction is based on credibility. However, she indicated that
the mere presence of contradictory details in the evidence or
motives to concoct does not lead to an inference that the verdict
is unreasonable (p. 297). McLachlin J. also emphasized the
advantage possessed by the trier of fact of seeing and hearing
the evidence of the witnesses which the appellate court does not
possess, and which it must bear in mind in deciding whether the
verdict is unreasonable. See also R. v. W. (R.) (1992), 74 C.C.C.
(3d) 134 (S.C.C.) at 141-42.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] It is in light of these authorities that the issue of the
reasonableness of verdict must be decided.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Although there have been numerous verdicts which have been
overturned by appellate courts on the basis of an unreasonable
verdict, such cases are illustrative of particular situations
that arose from inherently flawed evidence. Included in this
category are cases involving frail identification evidence,
allegations of a bizarre nature, evidence fraught with
inconsistencies on central aspects of the case, a central witness
who is proven to have lied or grossly exaggerated and cases where
no confirmatory evidence existed when such evidence would be
expected to exist. See generally: R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C.
(3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Burke (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 205
(S.C.C.), R. v. Quach (1995), 107 Man. R. (2d) 127 (Man. C.A.).
The present case is not in this category of cases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] A useful approach for assessing the reasonableness of a
verdict in a case which turns largely on the respective
credibility of the complainant and the accused was provided by my
colleague Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Mair (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d)
563 (Ont. C.A.). In his analysis of the issue of the
reasonableness of the verdict, he stated at pp. 568-69:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I have not been persuaded that the trial judge's findings on
credibility and reliability in favour of the complainant's
evidence, or his finding against the appellant's evidence, were
unreasonable. Those findings are supported by the evidence.
Except for the disclosure issues dealt with below, this case
contains few of the features which justify reviewing findings of
credibility. The events testified to by the complainant have no
particularly bizarre aspects as in R. v. R. (D.) (1996), 107
C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). The account given by the complainant
was internally consistent and her evidence was free of the
frailties found in the testimony of the complainants in R. v.
Burke. To the extent it can be ascertained from the transcript,
the trial judge's description of the manner in which the
complainant gave her evidence is supported by the evidence.
Finally, this is not a case where there is any manifest reason to
doubt the reliability of the complainant's account.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The complainant's evidence, if believed, was capable of
supporting the verdicts. As I explained above, since the trial
judge's findings with respect to the credibility of the
complainant and the appellant are supported by the evidence the
verdicts were not unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The elements identified by Rosenberg J.A. indicating that
the complainant's credibility was supported by the evidence are
directly applicable to the instant case. There is no bizarre
aspect in the testimony of the complainant that could lead to the
inference that her account is unreliable. Additionally, her
account is internally consistent and there is no manifest reason
to doubt its reliability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] With respect to the contradictory testimony regarding the
location of the red couch, which is reviewed by Finlayson J.A.,
the Supreme Court of Canada has commented in R. v. W.(R.), supra,
at 144, that for events that occurred in childhood, the &quot;presence
of inconsistencies, particularly as to peripheral matters such as
time and location, should be considered in the context of the age
of the witness at the time of the events to which she is
testifying&quot;. (The complainant was between six and eight years of
age at the time.) As such, the contradiction regarding the
location of the red couch does little to undermine the
reliability of the complainant's account of events. Similarly,
the allegation that the complainant was motivated to fabricate
her story does not lead to the conclusion that the trial judge's
verdict was unreasonable. Finally, the trial judge's failure to
state why the evidence of the appellant was rejected does not
render a verdict unreasonable nor does it mean that the trial
judge, who reviewed both the appellant's evidence and the other
supporting evidence in detail, failed to consider the appellant's
evidence when rendering this verdict. See R. v. Morrissey (1995),
97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] There is no allegation that the trial judge either
misapprehended the evidence or that he failed to consider
relevant evidence.  He reviewed both the legal principles
applicable to the assessment of credibility and the onus of proof
and he carefully reviewed the evidence. He accepted the evidence
of the complainant. In particular, he was satisfied with the
explanation for the delayed disclosure and he concluded that the
complainant did not have a motive to lie. He concluded, as was
within his purview, that the charges against the appellant were
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Keeping in mind the comments of
McLachlin J. in R. v. W.(R.), supra, that in applying the
unreasonable verdict test the appellate court should show great
deference to findings of credibility made at trial given the
advantage possessed by the trial judge in hearing the evidence
and observing the demeanour of the witnesses, I conclude that the
trial judge's verdict is supported by the evidence and is not
unreasonable, as conceded by counsel for the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] I cannot agree with the comments made by Finlayson J.A. with
respect to sexual assaults, particularly those found in
paragraphs 25 to 26 of his reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] I also cannot agree with his reasons for concluding that the
verdict is unreasonable. Finlayson J.A. noted that the majority
of sexual offences are now tried without a jury in the Ontario
Court (Provincial Division). This change resulted from recent
amendments to s. 271 of the Criminal Code which increased the
maximum penalty for summary convictions from six months to
eighteen months. In my view, neither the recent amendments to
s. 271, nor the other factors identified by Finlayson J.A. in
paragraphs 25 and 26 of his reasons, provide a basis for changing
the standard of appellate review when a verdict is alleged to be
unreasonable. His approach would give an appellate court a power
that far exceeds the standard of review recognized by the Supreme
Court of Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DID THE TRIAL JUDGE’S COMMENTS INDICATE A REASONABLE APPREHENSION
OF BIAS?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] As a second ground of appeal, the appellant argued that
certain comments made by the trial judge jeopardized the fairness
of the trial and the appearance of impartiality. In R v. S.
(R.D.) (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 367 (S.C.C.), the Supreme
Court of Canada confirmed the test for determining whether there
was a reasonable apprehension of bias during the course of a
trial. At p. 367-68, L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ., quoting
de Grandpré J. in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada
(National Energy Board), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394-95, said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[W]hat would an informed person viewing the matter realistically
and practically – and having thought the matter through –
conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that
[the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would
not decide fairly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] In applying this test to the conduct of the trial judge in R
v. S. (R.D.), L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ. noted the
importance of construing the impugned conduct in light of the
whole trial proceedings and of all other portions of the
judgment. They also highlighted the strong presumption of
impartiality that applies to trial judges and the hesitancy of
reviewing courts to make a finding of bias, in the absence of
convincing evidence to that effect.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Similarly, in R. v. Valley (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 at 232
(Ont.C.A.), this court stated that the question to be decided
when dealing with allegations of impartiality is whether a
reasonably minded person who had been present throughout the
trial would consider that the accused had not had a fair trial.
[1]
[44] Counsel for the appellant, who was not counsel at trial,
points to four exchanges between defence counsel and the trial
judge, which he submitted seriously jeopardized the fairness of
the appellant’s trial and the appearance of impartiality. I will
deal with each of these exchanges in turn.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] The first exchange occurred early in the cross-examination
of the complainant. Having received testimony that the
complainant’s mother had taken her to see a doctor following her
disclosure of the sexual abuse, defence counsel proceeded to ask
the following questions:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.	All right. And so you go see the doctor, and when you're
	at the doctor's office, what happens there? Tell us.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.	My mom told him -- no, actually, my mom wanted me to tell
	him. I told him that I was abused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you say that your uncle had rubbed your vagina?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  Yes, that was the information I think I did give. No, 
	probably -- I can't use that. I can't -- I'm not
	sure of the exact information I gave.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell the doctor that your uncle rubbed your
	vagina three times over your clothes?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  No, I don't remember telling him that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell him that your uncle had had sexual 
	intercourse with you?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  No, I did not tell him that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell him that your uncle put an object up your vagina?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  No, I did not tell him that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell the doctor that your uncle had put his 
	fist up your vagina?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  No, I did not tell him that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell the doctor that my client,
	your uncle, had put his finger in your vagina?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  No, I did not tell him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you tell the doctor that your uncle had put anything
	in your vagina?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  Inside? No.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Okay. Did you convey to the doctor in general terms that 
	all that had happened. . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  Could you please tell me what convey means?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Convey means to communicate, to tell, to explain.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.  Okay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Q.  Did you explain to the doctor that what your uncle had 
	done was confined to touching your vagina outside
	of your vagina, not inside?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">At this point, Crown counsel objected to defence counsel's line
of questioning. Defence counsel stated that he was trying to
determine why the complainant had gone to see the doctor. When
the trial judge ascertained that defence counsel had no basis for
believing that the complainant had reported any penetration to
the doctor, the following exchange occurred:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Court: It's shocking that you would ask those kinds of
questions. They can only be calculated to embarrass the witness.
You know, Bonzo the chimp would know that people go to doctors
for counselling as well as medical treatment, [defence counsel's
name]. That is shocking and outrageous. You have no business
suggesting to this young woman that she told anybody that
somebody put a fist up her vagina when you know very well that
she made no such allegation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[Defence counsel]: Well, I don't know really what she said to the
doctor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Court: Well, then don't suggest any such thing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[Defence counsel]: What I'm trying to determine is what, in fact,
was said to the doctor . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Court: Well, in my view you are acting improperly. You are
trying to -- your conduct is outrageous.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] This clear rebuke from the trial judge resulted when he
ascertained that defence counsel had no basis for believing or
suspecting that the complainant had revealed to the doctor that
anything had been inserted into her vagina, let alone the
appellant’s fist. Based on disclosure, defence counsel would have
known the substance of the complainant’s allegations. As such,
the questions were improper, outrageous and clearly exceeded the
proper limits of cross-examination.  The questions could only
have been intended to embarrass the complainant. Further, the
trial judge was justified in stating that it was shocking that
defence counsel proceeded with such a line of questioning when he
had no basis to justify the questions. Although I agree with the
trial judge’s comment that it is generally known that people go
to doctors for counselling as well as medical treatment, the
reference to “Bonzo the chimp” was uncalled for and cannot be
justified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] The second incident occurred shortly after the first, when
counsel continued to ask questions which were, in his own words,
designed to help him understand the reason for the complainant
seeing the doctor when there had been no physical examination.
The trial judge again indicated that there were other reasons
that people go to doctors besides physical examinations (for
instance, to obtain counselling or medical referrals). When
defence counsel persisted in his inquiry, insisting that he
couldn’t understand why this complainant would go to the doctor,
the trial judge stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Well, [defence counsel's name], I can't believe you're so dumb
that you can't imagine why she went to the doctor. It's quite
normal. So don't suggest that you have no idea why she would go
to a family doctor as a result of the disclosure she made to her
mother.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] The line of questioning pursued by counsel was unskilful.
First, defence counsel had already received an answer from the
complainant that it was her mother who took her to see the
doctor. Second, a simple question at the outset as to why she
went to see the doctor would likely have clarified any confusion.
The trial judge was obviously correct in stating that people see
doctors for counselling as well as medical treatment. The
reference to “dumb” was again uncalled for and cannot be
justified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] These two rebukes from the trial judge came as a result of
highly improper questioning. In fairness to counsel for the
appellant, he did not attempt to justify the conduct of defence
counsel. The incidents covered only four pages (including the
objections of Crown counsel) out of sixty pages of cross-
examination. The trial judge otherwise permitted extensive cross-
examination of the complainant and twice permitted counsel to
reopen his cross-examination to cover areas that were initially
omitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The third allegation of impartiality is found in the trial
judge’s reasons for judgment where he says at p. 105:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I sincerely regret that in the course of [defence counsel's]
cross-examination of the complainant I found it necessary to
strongly admonish him when he put to her a series of questions
that suggested she had reported to her family physician far more
violent and intrusive sexual misconduct than she did without, as
it soon became apparent, any disclosure that that had been the
case. I found his explanation that he could not imagine why she
would have been taken to see a physician otherwise to be
disingenuous.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This comment was brief and directed solely at defence counsel.
The trial judge was in the best position to assess counsel’s
sincerity when he maintained that he could not understand why the
complainant would go to a doctor. There is no indication that the
trial judge’s view on this issue carried over to his assessment
of the appellant or the position of the defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The final incident to which the appellant pointed as giving
rise to the appearance of bias occurred during defence counsel’s
submissions on sentence. At the outset of the submissions, the
following exchange took place between defence counsel and the
trial judge (p. 105):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Now, the other area of the pre-sentence report which he hasn't
really pointed to because I don't think he fully understands it
but there are certain references on page 5 to the offender being
in a state of denial, implying that he's denying that he did
anything wrong and therefore it means that he hasn't fully come
to terms with what he has done. And I have to make a distinction
between that and I can't argue against the fact that Your Honour
has made a conviction. I have to live with that and make
submissions to you based on the fact that he has been convicted.
But with regard to this issue or this area of whether he's in a
state of denial or whether he is not being fully remorseful, I
have to point out to Your Honour that there's at least a
possibility that he may have been improperly convicted. I don't
say that....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Court: Oh, don't be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. You're
not assisting him at all by making a submission like that. He's
guilty. He's been found guilty. Now, the fact is he won't admit
his guilt, so it's going to be very difficult for me to fashion a
sentence that would have any rehabilitative effect but it's most
improper for you to stand here and suggest that there's a
possibility that he may be wrongfully convicted. You can argue
that somewhere else. Let's do something constructive.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] These comments by the trial judge were triggered as a result
of clumsy advocacy on the part of defence counsel. There is a
difference, which is not so subtle, between submitting to a trial
judge that the accused had throughout maintained his innocence
and telling the trial judge that there is “at least a possibility
that [the accused] may have been improperly convicted”. It was
unhelpful of defence counsel to suggest to the trial judge during
sentencing submissions that he may have improperly convicted the
appellant. The very foundation of sentencing is the assumption
that the convicted accused has been found guilty of the crime.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] The trial judge did not translate the appellant’s denial of
guilt into an aggravating factor. He considered that it was a
potential mitigating factor that was absent in these
circumstances. Once again, the choice of words used by the trial
judge was unfortunate, but in the context of the record on
sentencing I am satisfied that the comment was of no consequence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] In my view, an examination of the record as a whole does not
support the submission that the trial judge’s comments
jeopardized the fairness of the trial and the appearance of
impartiality. The trial judge’s discourteous comments to defence
counsel did not carry over outside the isolated incidents
referred to above. Although it would have been preferable if the
trial judge had not made these comments, they do not support the
contention that the trial was unfair or appeared to be unfair.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] The appellant was sentenced to five months imprisonment and
three years probation. The trial judge recommended the appellant
for the temporary absence program.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] Crown counsel maintained that the sentence, although at the
high end of the range for offences of this kind, was not
manifestly unreasonable. However, Crown counsel, Ms. Arnup, with
her usual fairness, recognized that the sentence had failed to
achieve the objective of the trial judge to impose a denunciatory
sentence while avoiding the &quot;great tragedy&quot; which would follow
from the appellant losing his job. Any sentence longer than an
intermittent sentence would result in the loss of the appellant's
job.  In order to comply with the stated intention of the trial
judge, Crown counsel recommended a sentence near the upper end of
sentences which could be served intermittently without probation,
which according to the pre-sentence report would not serve any
purpose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] The appellant was sentenced on August 23, 1996 and the
conditional sentence regime in the Criminal Code did not come
into force until September 1996. The appellant is entitled to the
benefit of the new provisions on his sentence appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] The offence involved a breach of trust with a victim of
tender age. It consisted of three brief sexual touchings over the
complainant's clothing that happened approximately nine or ten
years ago. The conduct did not &quot;escalate beyond fondling&quot;. See R.
v. Wismayer (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.).
Rehabilitation does not appear to be a pressing concern since the
appellant has not engaged in similar conduct since approximately
1987. His lack of any other criminal record strongly suggests
that he will not re-offend and therefore does not pose any danger
to the community. He has complied with all bail orders since he
was charged with this offence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] In addition, the offence was completely out of character.
The appellant has the support of his family, friends and others
who know him and he is a productive member of his community. He
is gainfully employed and the primary source of income for his
family.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] This is an appropriate case for a conditional sentence. In
these circumstances, a conditional sentence is consistent with
the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DISPOSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal against
conviction.  I would grant leave to appeal the sentence. I would
set aside the sentence and impose a conditional sentence of five
months pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code. In addition to
the mandatory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1), I would impose
the condition that the appellant shall not associate with the
complainant or her family. The person releasing the appellant
shall comply with the provisions of s. 742.3(3) of the Criminal
Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] I would continue the order banning publication made at
trial, pursuant to s. 486(3) of the Criminal Code.
