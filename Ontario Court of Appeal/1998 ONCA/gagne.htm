</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       Beginning in late 1996, the defendant Silcorp proceeded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to merge the operations of the Becker's and Mac's convenience</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">store chains which it owned. As a consequence of the merger, a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Initially Silcorp offered those terminated only an amount that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was less than the minimum termination and severance pay to which</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1990, c. E.14.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       On March 24, 1997 the appellant solicitors commenced a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">class action for wrongful dismissal on behalf of those former</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees who had been terminated. Sherrie Gagne was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representative plaintiff.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       Immediately after commencing the action, the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brought a motion before Southey J. seeking an injunction to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required by s. 29 of the Act. The settlement order was very</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          •    Sherrie Gagne was appointed the
               representative plaintiff on behalf of
               the class of former employees who had
               been terminated by the defendant

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          •    The defendant was adjudged liable for
               compensatory damages and Employment
               Standards Act entitlements.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          •    The claims for punitive and exemplary

          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          •    The class members were each permitted to
               be represented in the mini-hearing

               the appellant solicitors.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the appellant solicitors prepared the material seeking to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">triple their base fee, thirty-five individual claims were finally</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recovery of $1,945,723.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]       As required by the Act, the appellant solicitors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executed a written agreement with the representative plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting their fees and disbursements. It provided that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payment of any legal fees was contingent on the class action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being concluded successfully as defined by the Act. It also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided that the base fee would be the product of the hours</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">worked by the solicitors and their usual hourly rates. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition, it set out that the solicitors could seek court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approval for a multiplier to be applied to that base fee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finally, the agreement described two examples of how this might</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          7.   The Consortium and the Client
          acknowledge it is difficult to estimate what
          the expected fee will be. However, the
          following are estimates:
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (a)  If the class action results in a
               quick settlement for the class, within 3
               months after the date of this retainer,
               and at that time the Base Fee is $50,000
               and if the court sets the Multiplier at
               3.0, then the fee will be $50,000 x 3.0
               = $150,000.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (b)  If the trial of the common issues
               occurs within 2 or 3 years and is
               decided in favour of the class and no
               appeals are taken, and at the time the
               Base Fee is $250,000 and if the court
               sets the Multiplier at 2.0, then the fee
               will be $250,000 x 2.0 = $500,000.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          These estimates do not include work for any
          mini-hearings or other proceedings which may
          be necessary to deal with individual damage
          claims.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       The motion brought by the appellants sought a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplier of 3. In denying this request Southey J. considered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two factors, namely the degree of risk in accepting the retainer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the degree of success achieved by the solicitors. He set out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his analysis of each of these factors clearly and concisely as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               As to the first of the above elements, I
          am unable to see any reason why the employees
          who were dismissed would not be entitled to
          their &quot;entitlements&quot; under the Employment
          Standards Act and to compensatory damages, if
          any. It appears to me that there was no
          serious issue as to liability in this case.
          In these circumstances, I cannot find that
          there was any material risk in accepting the
          retainer.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               When I asked counsel for the Consortium
          to explain the risk, his reply was that the
          difficulty arose out of procedural
          complexity. In my judgment, that is not the
          sort of risk that should influence the
          multiplier. That sort of risk is adequately
          covered by an award of a Base Fee in the full
          amount of the usual charges made by the legal
          professionals, as I have approved in this
          case….
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As to the second element, what has been
          achieved?  Former employees now have
          available to them a procedure for the prompt
          determination of their claims. For Achieving
          that result, the solicitors, in my opinion,
          are fairly compensated for their services to
          August 8 last by the Base Fee of $109,411.28,
          including GST. Any premium based on a high
          degree of success must depend on the recovery
          in each case, which was not the subject of
          evidence before me.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellants argue that Southey J. erred in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration of both the risk factors and the success factors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, further, that he failed to give weight to the views of the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In applying this standard of review to the decision appealed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from, it is appropriate to begin with a consideration of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">genesis of the Class Proceedings Act, 1992. It was enacted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following much legislative study and in the wake of a detailed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">report of the Ontario Law Reform Commission laying out the broad</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rationale for such legislation. One of the objects which the Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeks to achieve is the efficient handling of potentially complex</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases of mass wrongs. See Dabbs v. Sun Life Assurance Company of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, released</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">September 14, 1998 at p. 3.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Another fundamental objective is to provide enhanced access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to justice to those with claims that would not otherwise be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brought because to do so as individual proceedings would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prohibitively uneconomic or inefficient. The provision of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contingency fees where a multiplier is applied to the base fee is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an important means to achieve this objective. The opportunity to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">achieve a multiple of the base fee if the class action succeeds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gives the lawyer the necessary economic incentive to take the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case in the first place and to do it well. However, if the Act is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to fulfill its promise, that opportunity must not be a false</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hope.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] With that background, I turn to the judgment appealed from.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As I have said, Southey J. addressed two criteria in concluding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he would not apply a multiple to the base fee: the degree of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">risk assumed by the solicitors and the degree of success they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">achieve. In my view, he was correct in focusing on these two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considerations. Section 33(7)(b) makes clear the relevance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;the risk incurred in undertaking and continuing the proceeding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under an agreement for payment only in the event of success&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Section 33(9) invites a consideration of the manner in which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor conducted the proceedings. However, for the reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that follow I have concluded that he erred in giving no weight to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considerations relevant to each of the risk and success criteria.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Risk Factors

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The multiplier is in part a reward to the solicitor for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bearing the risks of acting in the litigation. The court must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine whether these risks were sufficient that together with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the other relevant considerations a multiplier is warranted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">While this determination is made after the class proceeding has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded successfully, it is the risks when the litigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commenced and as it continued that must be assessed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The only risk factor considered by Southey J. was whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant might ultimately escape liability. Because there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no real doubt about that liability, he determined that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no material risk in accepting the retainer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Since this class proceeding was concluded quickly, the risk</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment was properly focussed on the risks incurred at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outset in undertaking the proceeding and did not have to extend</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the risks, if any, in continuing it. Nonetheless, in my view</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was from the beginning a second material risk that was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant consideration, namely the risk that comes with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action being brought as a class proceeding, particularly the risk</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of non-certification. The certification step in a class action is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a significant one, often requiring extensive preparation by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel. If certification is denied, a solicitor who has agreed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a fee contingent on success recovers nothing. Moreover, when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this action was commenced, certification could not be predicted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with certainty. A debate was quite possible about whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common issues requirement would be met or whether a class</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding was the preferable procedure given the enforcement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mechanisms provided by the Employment Standards Act. This risk</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factor was material and ought to have been given weight.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] It is true that this risk factor will be present in most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">class proceedings. This factor should be recognized so that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors faced with a class proceeding retainer will have the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary economic incentive to take on the matter. They will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">know that if, in prosecuting the action, they can meet the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">success criterion there will be a real opportunity to have some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiple attached to the base fee. To accord due weight to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration is to serve the legislative objective of enhanced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">access to justice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Success Factors

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Section 33(9) invites the court, in determining whether a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplier is appropriate, to consider the manner in which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor conducted the proceeding. Just as the real opportunity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to receive an enhanced reward for incurring the risks of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation serves as an incentive for the solicitor to take on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the retainer, that opportunity is also designed to serve as an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incentive for the solicitor to achieve the best possible results</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the class, expeditiously and efficiently.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The only success factor considered by Southey J. was that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure had been provided to former employees for the prompt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determination of their claims. This was insufficient, in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, to warrant the application of any multiple to the base fee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] In my view, this fails to recognize that the solicitors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">achieved immediate, partial success in extracting a commitment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the defendant to comply forthwith with the Employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Standards Act. Second, the ultimate settlement of the common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues was achieved quickly. Third, the settlement provided for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creative and effective mini-hearing process that resulted in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complete resolution of all individual claims within little more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than a year. These factors are all relevant to the degree of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">success with which the solicitors conducted the proceedings and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all deserved to be considered in determining whether a multiplier</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was appropriate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Views of Class Members

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In reaching his decision Southey J. did not consider the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">views of class members about whether a multiplier should properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be applied to the base fee. In my view, he was correct in doing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so. The Act does not appear to invite such a consideration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Moreover, in this case those views, which are said to constitute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acceptance or even approval of a multiplier, can be gleaned only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by a very tenuous process of inference. One simply cannot say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with any certainty that the views of class members on this issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are as they are argued to be.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In summary, therefore, I have concluded that Southey J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in the exercise of his discretion in failing to give due</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weight to relevant risk and success considerations. If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate weight is accorded them, I think the conclusion must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be that this is an appropriate case to apply a multiplier to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">base fee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] I recognize that the selection of the precise multiplier is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an art, not a science. All the relevant factors must be weighed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Here, while the risk of an adverse finding on liability was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minimal, there was a material risk of non-certification. As well,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as I have outlined, there were significant elements of success in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the manner in which the solicitors conducted the proceedings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Weighed against these success factors is the fact that following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the April 17, 1997 settlement, individual class members had to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incur further legal fees to finally realize on their claims.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In the end, these considerations must yield a multiplier</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, in the words of section 33(7)(b), results in fair and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable compensation to the solicitors. One yardstick by which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this can be tested is the percentage of gross recovery that would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be represented by the multiplied base fee. If the base fee as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplied constitutes an excessive proportion of the total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recovery, the multiplier might well be too high. A second way of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testing whether the ultimate compensation is fair and reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is to see whether the multiplier is appropriately placed in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">range that might run from slightly greater than one to three or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four in the most deserving case. Thirdly, regard can be had to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the retainer agreement in determining what is fair and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable. Finally, fair and reasonable compensation must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficient to provide a real economic incentive to solicitors in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the future to take on this sort of case and to do it well.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] In this case, then, taking into account all the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considerations I have recited, in my view the appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplier is two. This reflects the risk and success factors at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">play. It represents a multiplied fee that is significantly less</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than ten per cent of gross recovery. It reflects the fact that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case does not exemplify the greatest risk or the greatest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">success. It is within the range contemplated by the retainer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement. And finally, the resulting compensation should provide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a sufficient real incentive for solicitors in future similar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DISPOSITION

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] I would therefore allow the appeal and provide for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplier of two to be applied to the base fee up to April 17,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1997, the date of the settlement order. I would vary the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below accordingly. The appellants do not seek costs of the appeal</font></pre>
