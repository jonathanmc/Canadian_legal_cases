</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   The  appellant plaintiff required leave  of  the  court  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commence an action against the receiver.  The original order made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">June  23, 1992 when the receiver was appointed so provided.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action  was  commenced without leave June 23, 1994,  some  months</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after  October  22, 1993 when an order had been made  discharging</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the receiver and approving its actions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]     The  plaintiff=s allegation is that in administering  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security  which consisted of a mortgage over real  property,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiver also took over the plaintiff=s chattels and proceeded to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">run  the restaurant operated by his numbered company under  lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within  the  mortgaged premises without any right to  do  so  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">using his chattels.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]     In the fall of 1994, the defendants had consented  to  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order  in  the  action  whereunder the chattels  claimed  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  were  returned to him.  The action  proceeded  through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings, production and the discussion of dates for examination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at which point the receiver first took the position that it would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  proceed  further with the action until  an  order  had  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained by the plaintiff granting leave to proceed.  This was in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  spring  of 1996.  For reasons not explained, the motion  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only brought in the fall of 1997.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    Neither the plaintiff nor his company were given notice of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any  of  the court proceedings brought by the receiver or by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secured creditor, Mr. Beber, either to obtain the appointment  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  receiver,  to  take over and operate the restaurant,  or  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharge  the receiver.  The motions judge points out  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  did,  however,  become aware  of  the  action  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiver taking over his restaurant in the fall of 1992, and took</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no  steps in response until the summer of 1993.  Nor did he  seek</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the leave of the court to commence an action against the receiver</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before  the  final order was made in the fall of 1993 discharging</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  receiver.  However, the appellant explains this  failure  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  material. He apparently approached two lawyers to assist him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but  was not able to pay a retainer until he retained his current</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors in July, 1993.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]     At that time his lawyer wrote to counsel for the creditor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr.  Beber,  who  is  also counsel to the receiver,  raising  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues  with  respect  to  his chattels and  some  correspondence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ensued.   However, the receiver proceeded to bring on its  motion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  discharge  without giving notice to  the  plaintiff  or  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawyer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]     In  his  reasons, one of the issues on which the  motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge focuses is the fact that this motion was not brought before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  discharge  order was made.  However, since  that  order  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought and made without notice to the plaintiff, in our view  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff cannot be faulted on that score.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]     The  test for a court to apply in determining whether  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grant leave to sue a receiver nunc pro tunc is concisely set  out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the  headnote to Roynat Inc. v. Allan (1988), 69  C.B.R.  245</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Alta. Q.B.):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            An  application for leave to commence an
            action  nunc pro tunc should be  granted
            if  to do so does not cause prejudice or
            any  substantial injustice, and if leave
            would  have been granted if it had  been
            sought at the appropriate time.  In  the
            absence   of   prejudice,   leave   will
            generally be granted unless it is  clear
            that  there  is  no foundation  for  the
            claim  or  the  action is  frivolous  or
            vexatious.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In  certain  circumstances, a stricter  test  for  leave  may  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate,  such  as in the case of Bank of America  Canada  v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Willann  Investments Ltd. (1993), 23 C.B.R.  (3d)  98  (Ont.  Ct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Gen.Div.)), where the same issues raised in the action had  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised or could have been raised in the discharge proceeding.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  case the court held that the applicant must show  a  strong</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prima facie case in order to meet the test for leave.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]     That  is not the case here, as the issue of the  receiver</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administering assets which may not have been the subject  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditor=s  security does not appear to have been the subject  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  discharge  proceeding.  Had the  issue  in  that  form  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brought  to  the  attention of the judge  hearing  the  discharge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application,  notice would most certainly have been required  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff, the potentially affected party.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]     In  this case the prejudice to the receiver is  the  fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  before the litigation commenced it had already  obtained  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharge  order upon which it should normally be able  to  rely.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However this case is unusual in that the discharge order was made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without  notice to the plaintiff and after the receiver had  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notified through its counsel of the plaintiff=s claims concerning</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  chattels,  as  discussed above.   On  its  face,  the  order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purports  to  discharge the receiver in respect of the  mortgaged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property,  as one would expect, and not in respect of  any  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.   However, the effect of that order in the  context  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this litigation should be determined at the trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   The other normal indicia of prejudice from the passage  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time such as lost or destroyed documents or unavailable witnesses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are  not raised in this case.  Furthermore the receiver has  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">able  to  deal with the litigation requirements and  has  already</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">produced  its  affidavit of documents.  There is  no  element  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surprise here.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]    On  the issue of the potential merits of the  claim,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions  judge  applied the more stringent  Astrong  prima  facie</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case@  test.  He found that the plaintiff had not satisfied  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">test,  and further, that he had concerns even on the lower  test.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">With  respect,  I disagree.  If the receiver did  take  over  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administer  property which was not subject to the security  under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  it  was  operating, then the claim of the  owner  of  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  can certainly not be said to be frivolous or vexatious.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Given that that issue was not raised before the judge who granted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  discharge  and that the plaintiff was not  notified  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hearing, this is not a case for the stricter test.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]    For the above reasons the appeal is allowed and an  order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will go nunc pro tunc allowing the plaintiff to proceed with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation.   We  accept the submission of  the  respondent  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because  the applicant was seeking an indulgence from the  court,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there  should  be no costs of the motion, but the  costs  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal are to the appellant.
