    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal against
conviction. In his opening comments the trial judge made what he
referred to as &quot;generalities&quot;. The appellant submits that the
trial judge erred in suggesting that in some cases the evidence
of children may be worth more than that of an adult. However,
those comments must be assessed in context. The trial judge said
that in this particular case he approached the testimony of the
complainant with &quot;an extreme degree of caution&quot; and with a
&quot;healthy degree of care&quot;. We are satisfied that the
generalizations do not undermine the clear expression that in
this case the trial judge approached the testimony of the
complainant with caution.
[2]  The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended
the evidence, especially some of the testimony of Ms. P.. On a
crucial issue, Ms. P.  appeared to contradict herself in cross-
examination about when the appellant went upstairs. Counsel for
the appellant submits that the witness later clarified her
evidence and was therefore consistent throughout. The trial judge
had the advantage to see the witness and determine whether or not
she was consistent and the effect of what appeared to be a
contradiction. We are not satisfied that he misapprehended the
evidence.
[3]  In our view, the trial judge did not place undue emphasis on
the complainant's demeanour. He carefully reviewed all of the
complainant's evidence and did not simply rely upon the
complainant's demeanour in court.
[4]  Finally, the trial judge did not err in his application of
the burden of proof and the rule set out in R. v. W. (D.) (1991),
63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), having regard to his earlier
assessment of Ms. P. 's evidence.
[5]  As to sentence, we are of the view that the sentence is
grossly excessive and requires our intervention, notwithstanding
the appellant's record for similar offences. The trial judge was
motivated to impose this sentence primarily for the purposes of
treatment. However, in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, Parliament
has laid down as the fundamental principle of sentencing that the
sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the
degree of responsibility of the offender. While an offence
involving sexual touching of a young child is always serious, not
all offences are of equal gravity within the meaning of s. 718.1.
The appellant was not in a position of trust. The touching was
brief, on the top of the complainant's underwear, and had few of
the more serious aggravating features often associated with this
kind of conduct. We acknowledge the serious consequences upon the
complainant's family, but that does not justify a sentence out of
the appropriate range.
[6]  As well, the degree of responsibility did not warrant this
length of sentence. The appellant immediately desisted from the
conduct. He has sought treatment in the past. The objectives of
treatment and protection of the public are best met by the
imposition of appropriate terms of probation and the order made
under s. 161 of the Criminal Code.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave
to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, and the
sentence reduced to time served and two years' probation on the
statutory conditions and on the additional conditions that the
appellant report to a probation officer within fifteen days of
his release and thereafter when required by the probation
officer, that he have no contact with the complainant or her
family and, as requested Mr. Hicks, on the condition that the
appellant take such counselling as may be recommended by his
probation officer.</font></pre></td>
