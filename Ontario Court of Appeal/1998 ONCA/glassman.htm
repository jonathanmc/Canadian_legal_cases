    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Honda R &amp; D Co. Ltd. (“Honda R &amp; D”) designed a Honda</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
2.   The issue in this appeal is whether the motions judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was entitled to draw the inference that, when Honda Canada

was sued in relation to one of the Honda ATVs on the basis

it was unsafe, Honda Motor and Honda R &amp; D would have been

aware of the lawsuit.


3.   Where the inference drawn by the judge of first

instance is unsupported, improperly drawn and unreasonable,

an appellate court has a duty to intervene: Jengle v. Keach

(1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 187 at 191-192 (C.A.).


4.   Whether an inference can be drawn is fact specific and

depends on all the circumstances and all of the evidence

adduced: R. v. LePage, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 654 at 668-669.


5.   A brief review of the circumstances and the evidence is

therefore essential to an appreciation of this appeal.


6.   The respondent Brenda Glassman was a passenger in the

Honda ATV on August 18, 1990 when it went off the roadway

and into a ditch overturning and trapping her underneath it.

She sustained serious injuries and is totally paralysed from

the waist down.


7.   On August 15, 1991, Brenda Glassman issued her

statement of claim and it was served on Honda Canada on

September 19, 1991.  Honda Canada filed a notice of intent

to defend on October 4, 1991 and requested additional time

to file a statement of defence. The reason given was that

Honda Canada needed extra time to conduct a proper

investigation of the circumstances surrounding the accident,

including inspection of the vehicle, before delivering a

statement of defence.  An indulgence was granted by the

respondents, and a statement of defence was finally served

and filed on December 18, 1992 some four months after the

expiry of the two-year limitation period.  In the statement

of defence, Honda Canada denied that it designed or

manufactured the vehicle, or that when the vehicle was

imported into Canada, it was in any way unsafe. Honda Canada

did not add the other Honda companies as third parties or

claim against them. Due to inadvertence, Ms. Glassman’s

solicitor did not notice Honda Canada’s denial that it had

designed or manufactured the vehicle until several months

later.


8.   In August, 1993, examinations for discovery of Ms.

Glassman and the other parties were conducted in Hamilton,

with the exception of Honda Canada. The solicitors for Honda

Canada insisted that the representative for Honda Canada be

examined in Toronto. Arrangements were made to conduct this

discovery in May 1994.  In conducting the examinations for

discovery of Honda Canada's representative, the identity of

the Honda companies that designed and manufactured the

vehicle was obtained.  Following the receipt of answers to

undertakings in April, 1995, and a motion to compel answers

to questions which were refused, apparently heard on June

29, 1995, Ms. Glassman's solicitor drafted a motion seeking

to add Honda Motor and Honda R &amp; D on October 19, 1995.

Philp J., who heard the motion, was of the opinion that the

delay in bringing the motion to add the proposed parties was

in large measure excused by the delay in completing the

discovery of Honda Canada.

9.   Philp J. granted leave to add Honda Motor and Honda R &amp;

D as parties as if they had been named in the original

statement of claim. In supplementary reasons Philp J.

confirmed that the added defendants were not allowed to put

the expiry of the limitation period in issue in their

statement of defence.  In adding the Honda companies, Philp

J. relied on the broad discretion of the court in rule

5.04(2) to add parties to an action on such terms as are

just unless prejudice in being able to defend the action

would result. He considered the presumption of prejudice to

a proposed party created by the loss of a limitation period

defence, but, in the circumstances, concluded the proposed

parties were not prejudiced.


10.  In coming to his conclusion, Philp J. stated, &quot;... a

reasonable inference can be drawn that when Honda Canada is

presented with a claim alleging faulty manufacture and

design of one of its parent's ATV's,  that it would

immediately advise its parent of the claim.&quot;

11.  An inference is the drawing of a conclusion from a

proposition. There must be a rational basis or connection

between the evidence proving or establishing certain facts

and the proposition before the conclusion can be drawn. See

generally W. Little, ed., Shorter Oxford English Dictionary:

On Historical Principles (Oxford: Oxford University Press,

1973); R. J. Delisle, Evidence: Principles and Problems,

4th ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1996) at 23; Jeffs v.

Matheson, [1951] O.R. 743 (C.A.). Knowledge need not be

proved by direct evidence; it can be inferred from all the

surrounding circumstances: R. v. Aiello (1978), 38 C.C.C.

(2d) 485 (Ont. C.A.), appeal dismissed (1979), 46 C.C.C.

(2d) 128 (S.C.C.).


12.  A rational basis on which to draw the inference that

Honda Motor and Honda R &amp; D had knowledge of the lawsuit

arises from the evidence that Honda Canada chose to conduct

an investigation and inspection of the vehicle although it

claimed to be a mere conduit for delivery of the vehicle,

the omission of Honda Canada to claim over against the other

Honda companies, the corporate relationship of the three

Honda companies and their joint representation by the same

counsel.


13.  Where the proponent of a proposition puts forward

evidence from which an inference could have been drawn, the

absence of any explanation, will permit the trier or judge

to draw the inference: R. v. Lepage, supra, at pp. 667- 669.

The Honda companies chose not to file an affidavit in reply

to the application to add them. Philp J. drew the inference

that Honda Motor and Honda R &amp; D were aware of the action

and, in my opinion, he was entitled to do so.


14.  Philp J. also found that special circumstances existed

which would warrant the adding of the proposed parties in

accordance with Basarsky v. Quinlan, [1972] S.C.R. 380;

Chedour v. Newmarket  (1988), 63 O.R. (2d) 680 (Div. Ct.);

and Swiderski v. Broy Engineering Ltd.  (1992), 11 O.R. (3d)

594 (Div. Ct.). I would agree.   Ordinarily, allowing

defendants to be added to a lawsuit involving a motor

vehicle after the expiry of the two year limitation period

gives the plaintiff an advantage because it takes away the

right a defendant would have had to plead a defence.

Assuming that the limitation period in this instance was two

years, the presumption of prejudice to the added defendants

is rebutted by the inference that they had knowledge of the

action. They would also have access to the results of the

examination of the ATV conducted by Honda Canada.  Once

Honda Canada denied liability for the accident on the basis

that, if the ATV was unsafe, it neither designed or

manufactured the vehicle, it was also foreseeable that Ms.

Glassman would seek to add Honda Motor and Honda R &amp; D as

defendants. The indulgence granted to Honda Canada which

enabled it to file its statement of defence beyond the

limitation period is a further circumstance militating in

favour of the amendment. The delay in seeking to add the

proposed defendants was incurred in good faith and, as found

by the motions judge, is also in large measure attributable

to Honda Canada. Sufficient special circumstances in this

case are present to support the amendment.


15.  The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.</font></pre>
