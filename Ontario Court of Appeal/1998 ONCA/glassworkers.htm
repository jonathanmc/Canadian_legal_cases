    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants Forestgate Leasing and Luciano Didiodato

appeal from the summary judgment granted by Borkovich J. on March

3, 1998, in which he declared that the transfer of 787 Barton

Street in Hamilton under power of sale was valid and that the

appellants did not have a valid lease on 789-791 Barton Street.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellants raise five grounds of appeal:

       (1)  the motion judge unfairly refused the appellants'
            request for an adjournment  of the summary judgment
            motion;
       (2)  the notice of sale and the transfer were invalid
            because the terms of the mortgage (a) did not permit
            the mortgagee to exercise its power of sale for
            default in payment of realty taxes and (b) did not
            provide for the acceleration of principal for
            nonpayment of realty taxes;
       (3)  the notice of sale and transfer were invalid because
            the notice of sale was spent when the mortgagee
            accepted subsequent payments of principal and
            interest;
       (4)  the transfer was invalid because the transferees,
            the trustees of the respondent union who owned the
            property, had knowledge of the defects in the sale
            proceedings and were not bona fide purchasers; and
       (5)  the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant
            had no valid lease on 789-791 Barton Street.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.     Refusal of an Adjournment
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The motion record for summary judgment was served on Friday,

February 27 for a hearing on Tuesday, March 3, 1998.  Counsel for

the appellants requested an adjournment to file material but his

request was refused.  It would have been preferable for the

motion judge to have granted a short adjournment, but we are not

persuaded that his failure to do so  denied the appellants a fair

hearing.  The facts put before the motion judge by the

respondents were not in dispute.  The appellants were given a

full opportunity to make submissions on why summary judgment

should not have been granted.  Even in this court the appellants

did not suggest that there was any further material they could

have filed on the motion.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  This ground of appeal therefore fails.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.     Validity of the Notice of Sale
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The respondents concede that the mortgage did not permit

acceleration of the principal for default in payment of realty

taxes.  To that extent the notice of sale was defective.  In our

view, however, the mortgage did permit the mortgagee to exercise

its power of sale if the realty taxes were unpaid.  Under

paragraph 5 of the standard charge terms, the chargor or

mortgagor &quot;shall pay as they fall due all taxes, rates, levies,

charges, assessments ... municipal, local, parliamentary and

otherwise ...&quot;  Paragraph 9 permits the chargee or mortgagee to

exercise its power of sale &quot;on default of payment for at least

fifteen (15) days.&quot;  Default in payment in paragraph 9 includes

failure to pay taxes in accord with paragraph 5.  Forestgate has

not paid any of the realty taxes on 787 Barton Street since it

purchased the property in November 1994.  Therefore the mortgagee

was entitled to exercise its power of sale, though the amount

claimed in the notice of sale was wrong.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The wrong amount does not necessarily invalidate the notice

of sale.  Section 36 of the Mortgages Act may come to the aid of

the mortgagee.  Section 36 provides:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                 36. Where a notice has been given
            in professed compliance with this Part
            and, where applicable, with Part II, the
            title of the purchaser is not liable to
            be impeached on the ground that the
            provisions of this Part or, where
            applicable, Part II respecting default
            and the provisions of this Part
            respecting notice,  have not been
            complied with, but any person damnified
            thereby has a remedy against the person
            exercising the power of sale.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  In our opinion the notice of sale was given in professed

compliance with the Act.  The notice enabled the appellants to

protect their interest in the mortgage should they have desired

to do so Re Botiuk and Collision (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 580 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  The appellants argue nonetheless that the purchasers cannot

claim the protection of s.36 for two reasons. First, the

appellants argue that the notice of sale, even if given in

professed complicance with the Act, was spent because the

mortgagee accepted several payments of principal and interest

after it was served. Second, the appellants contend that the

purchasers cannot rely on s.36 since, as trustees of the union

owner, they must be taken to have knowledge of the defects in the

notice of sale. The appellant rely on Botiuk in support of both

arguments. These arguments form the subject-matter of the next

two grounds of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
3.  Effect of Subsequent Payment on Validity of the Notice of

Sale</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  In our view, the notice of sale was not spent by reason of

the subsequent payments on principal and interest. The appellants

did not make any payments on the outstanding tax arrears. The

situation is not at all the same as in Botiuk where the

mortgagee, after service of the notice of sale, had agreed to new

terms as an accommodation to the mortgagor and then purported to

revive the original notice of sale upon subsequent default by the

mortgagor on the new terms. The notice of sale in this case was

still valid and subsisting at the time of transfer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
4.  Bona Fide Nature of the Transfer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] The appellants also attack the transfer because it was made

to the trustees of the union, who then agreed to sell to

McDonald's.  The appellants, relying on Botiuk, submit that the

trustees knew or must be taken to have known of the defect in the

notice of sale and accordingly the transfer must be set aside.

The appellants are correct in stating that s.36 of the Mortgages

Act can only protect the title of a purchaser without notice of

the defect. However, we do not agree that the purchasers had

knowledge or that knowledge should be imputed to them.  In Botiuk

the court held that a purchaser, represented by the same

solicitor as the mortgagee who gave the defective notice, is not

a purchaser without notice of the defect. Here the mortgagee's

solicitor did not act for the purchasers (the trustees) and, in

our view, the material does not otherwise raise a genuine issue

for trial on the question of knowledge, either actual or

constructive.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] For these reasons, we are of the view that the mortgagee can

rely on s.36 of the Mortgages Act to remedy the defects in the

Notice of Sale. Thus the transfer was valid, though in accord

with s.36 a claim for damages is preserved.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] Moreover the equities weigh strongly against the appellants.

The notice of sale was served in January 1996 and, but for one

solicitor's letter in February 1998, the appellants took no steps

to challenge the sale proceedings.  The appellants have not paid

the arrears of taxes or the principal owing on the mortgage, and

they have not made an unqualified offer to redeem the mortgage.

They concede that the sale price was not improvident and even at

that price it appears there is no equity left in the property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
5. Validity of the lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] In oral argument the appellants did not seriously press

their appeal of that part of the judgment expunging the notice of

lease registered against 789-791 Barton Street.  We see no merit

in this part of the appeal.  No lease was ever executed for this

property.  Forestgate was permitted on the property on the

understanding it would pay rent consisting of the expenses

incurred to maintain the property.  Forestgate never made any

rental payments.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
