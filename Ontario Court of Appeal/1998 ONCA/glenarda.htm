</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    The appellants made three submissions:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    (1) the respondent was not entitled to terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        agreement in June 1989;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    (2) if the respondent was entitled to terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        agreement, its failure to accept the appellants'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        valid tender on September 15, 1989 was a breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        its duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the loss;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    (3) the appellants are entitled to a return of their deposit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    We did not call on the respondent on the first issue. We</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agree with the trial judge that the respondent was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate the agreement . The appellants concede that, having</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lost on this issue, they are not entitled to the return of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    The main issue on this appeal, therefore, is whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent acted reasonably in refusing to accept the appellants'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    When one party to a contract breaches the contract, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law requires the innocent party to take reasonable steps to avoid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the loss. These reasonable steps may include an obligation to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accept a subsequent offer from the defaulting party. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge found that the appellants were ready, willing and able to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complete the transaction on the closing date of September 15,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1989 and made a valid tender on that date. Regrettably, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge did not address the question whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent acted reasonably in refusing to accept this tender.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Although this is a question of fact, we are of the view</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that we can resolve this question on the material before us.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Looking at the question from the respondent's perspective, we are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not persuaded that the respondent did act reasonably in refusing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to accept the tender.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    The respondent submits that it was justified in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refusal because it was dealing with difficult purchasers. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent points to the aspenite issue and to the position taken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the appellants on the third deposit. We do not agree that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these considerations justified the respondent's refusal to close.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    The appellants had no obligation to sign the aspenite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amending agreement proffered by the respondent. And even though</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants had no such obligation, they did eventually sign</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this agreement and they tendered it on closing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    The appellants did not wilfully withhold payment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">third deposit. They simply did not have the money to make the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposit until the end of June 1989. Although they may have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overstated their position in their June 27, 1989 letter, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants had reason to think that the respondent would extend</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the time for payment until the end of June. Moreover, by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">September 15 the house was 60% completed and once finished, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties would not have had a continuing relationship with each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other. Finally, the trial judge found that the residential real</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estate market was declining in the fall of 1989 and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent must therefore have known that refusing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants' tender would inevitably result in a sale of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property at a substantially lower price. For all of these reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we do not think that the respondent acted reasonably in refusing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to close with the appellants on September 15, 1989.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    Therefore the appeal is allowed and paragraph 2 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment of Dilks J. is set aside. In its place there shall be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order that the balance of the plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   The court heard the submissions of counsel on costs. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shall be no costs of the trial. The appellants shall have their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs of the appeal.</font></pre></td>
