appellant, The Catholic Church Extension Society of Canada
(&quot;C.C.E.S.&quot;), is a small charitable foundation which employed the
respondent as its financial director and office manager until he was dismissed
from his employment on the grounds of sexual harassment of a subordinate
employee, Ms. N. The respondent brought an action for wrongful dismissal and,
after a trial before McCombs&nbsp;J. (the reasons reported at (1996), 20
C.C.E.L. (2d) 106), the respondent was successful in recovering a judgment for
an amount in excess of $200,000 plus pre-judgment interest. The appellant
appeals against the finding of liability and says that the termination was
justified.</span></p>

</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The
foundation operated out of modest premises, with eight full-time and two
part-time female employees under the supervision of the respondent, Mr.
Gonsalves, who reported to the president. In 1994, the president was Father
Coughlan, who was for the most part absent from the office visiting missions.
The respondent did the hiring and firing, made pay recommendations, and
supervised the day-to-day operations. In 1981, Mr. Gonsalves hired Ms. N to
work for him in a clerical position.</span></p>

</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In
January of 1992, Ms. N's longstanding relationship with a man ended and this
was the beginning of a change in the respondent's behaviour to her. Although
none of this was reported to Father Coughlan at the time, the trial judge made
these findings as to what was occurring, at p. 110 of his reasons:</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is not necessary
to detail the competing allegations of the various parties. I am satisfied on
the evidence that Mr. Gonsalves would occasionally tell staff members
inappropriate sexual jokes. I am also satisfied that he became infatuated with
Ms. N, and began to make inappropriate comments to her both privately and in
front of co-workers. He made it clear to her that he was attracted to her and
that he found her beautiful and &quot;sexy&quot;. Although he told her that he
just wanted to be friends, his behaviour suggested that in fact he wanted to
have a sexual relationship with her. He suggested that they go away together,
and occasionally gave her gifts. On more than one occasion, he hugged her, and
once, he caressed her breast.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I accept the
testimony of Ms. N that although she considered Mr. Gonsalves a friend, she was
intimidated by him, and had no idea how to deal with his unwanted advances. She
lacked confidence both in herself, and in her job security. Mr. Gonsalves was
her boss, and she felt trapped and isolated, not knowing where to turn. For
those reasons, she did not report her concerns to anyone, nor did she make it
clear to Mr. Gonsalves that his attentions were unwelcome. Instead, she
attempted to deflect them by gently reminding him that he was a married man, or
by behaving as if she thought he was joking, or by saying that he should not
behave this way because the others in the office might find out. As Ms. N
testified:</span></p>

took it as a joke from the very beginning. I tried everything not to show that
I understood what he means. I laughed it off and I'd say &quot;Peter you're
kidding&quot;. When Peter was saying these things, I'd say don't talk like
that, you're kidding. He'd say no, I'm serious.</span></p>

November of 1992, the foundation hired Brad Clark as the new director of
development. He reported directly to Father Coughlan, as did Mr. Gonsalves, but
the other employees continued to report to the respondent. Mr. Clark noticed
that Mr. Gonsalves seemed to be overly critical of Ms. N's competence and,
about two months after joining the foundation, Mr. Clark was shocked to
overhear an exchange in which Mr. Gonsalves criticized Ms. N about a
work-related matter, and, when she replied that no one had told her about it,
Mr. Gonsalves said, &quot;No one told you about sex either but you know how to
do it.&quot; The next day, Mr. Clark spoke to both parties about the remark and
Mr. Gonsalves said that he realized it had been inappropriate and that he had
already apologized. Mr. Clark reported the incident to Father Coughlan, who asked
him to continue to monitor the situation.</span></p>

Gonsalves was tyrannical, sexist and disrespectful, not only towards Ms. N but

responded a week later with further changes in the administrative hierarchy. He
produced a new organizational chart in which Ms. N and another staff member
would no longer report to Mr. Gonsalves, but to Mr. Clark.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Although Mr.
Gonsalves was never advised of the reasons for the change, the administrative
shake-up had the desired effect. It clearly brought home to him that his power
base was eroding, and that Mr. Clark was gaining further authority. I am
satisfied on all the evidence that the organizational changes effected by
Father Coughlan brought an end to Mr. Gonsalves' inappropriate conduct toward
Ms. N. I find that his inappropriate behaviour stopped in March, 1993, seven
months before he was fired for sexual harassment.</span></p>

reasons of the trial judge recount the succeeding events. For the purposes of
this appeal, it is sufficient to jump to a luncheon meeting arranged by Mr.
Clark on October 7, 1993, between Mr. Clark, Ms. N and another staff member.
The purpose of the meeting was to seek to ease the tension that appeared to
have developed within the office and was thought to flow from a recent special
audit that had been conducted at Father Coughlan's direction. Apparently, the
source of the tension was, in fact, the conduct of Mr. Gonsalves because it was
at this meeting that Ms. N poured out the history of her complaints. These
included the respondent:</span></p>

at trial that the allegations were untrue and that nothing even remotely close
had occurred. Moreover, he acknowledged that the things complained of were serious
and very wrong, and he acknowledged that no warning or instruction not to do
such things would have been necessary. These significant admissions are not

nightmares about Mr. Gonsalves. She was living in constant fear of
embarrassment, and was terrified that she would lose her job if she spoke up.
The trial judge basically accepted Ms. N's complaints as to the incidents of
harassment and there is no apparent reason that he would disbelieve her
evidence as to the symptoms she was suffering, even after the overt conduct had
ceased. This evidence has obvious significance to the alternatives available to
the employer when faced with a denial of apparently credible complaints. The
employer has a duty to all the employees both to end the abuse and to alleviate
its impact upon the employment environment. On the face of this evidence
continued employment would have perpetuated Ms. N's distress.</span></p>

behaviour came to light. Having regard to all of the circumstances of this
case, I conclude that he was entitled to a warning that his conduct was
completely unacceptable and that any re-occurrence of the behaviour would not
be tolerated. In my view, the defendant has not discharged the onus upon it to
establish that Mr. Gonsalves was properly dismissed for cause. He is accordingly

<p class=level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-ansi-language:

less serious than others. For less serious instances of sexual harassment, a
warning that such misconduct may result in dismissal is required before
termination is justified: <i>MacDonald v. Valley Credits Ltd.</i> (1988), 13
A.C.W.S. (3d) 358 (B.C. S.C.). In these less serious situations, for sexual
harassment to constitute cause for dismissal it must be made known to the
plaintiff by the employer that it is unwelcome and that dismissal will be the
consequence.</span></p>

allegations against Mr. Gonsalves were very serious, including the criminal act
of sexual assault. As a generality, it seems no more appropriate to address
sexual assault by a warning than to issue a warning to an employee caught
stealing money, even if seven months ago. And here, the employee was a
supervisor who by his own admission knew the conduct complained of was
unacceptable and conceded that he didn't need to be told so.</span></p>

as noted earlier, the trial judge failed to consider the impact upon Ms. N of a
continuation of Mr. Gonsalves' employment under a warning. It should be noted
that Ms. N testified that, while the physical assaults stopped in March of
1993, the verbal intimidation continued, including the veiled threats against
speaking to anyone of her personal life. Perpetuating his employment would
likely have perpetuated her symptoms of intimidation.</span></p>

</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Yet
another feature of the circumstances of this case which the trial judge ignored
is the difficulty presented to the employer by a flat denial of complaints. The
initial reaction to a denial should be a careful investigation and analysis of
the complaints to be assured that they are not false complaints motivated by
some collateral grudge. Here, Father Coughlan conducted a very limited
investigation but, as it turned out at trial, his assessment was correct  the
complaints were valid and the denial was false. Once the employer is satisfied
that the complaints are well-founded, the denial has a significance in limiting
suitable choices open to the employer. There is no opening for an apology to
clear the air if employment is to be continued. Further, in this case, the
pattern of behaviour was inconsistent with responsible management and suggests
a profile that might benefit from treatment if employment was to be continued.
That alternative was eliminated by the denial. Without some acknowledgement of
fault and steps taken to reassure staff it is my view that Father Coughlan
could not responsibly have left this small group of female employees in the
charge of Mr. Gonsalves, subject only to a warning.</span></p>

</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is
a very sad and difficult task to tell an employee, with a long service record
that was previously unblemished, that he must be dismissed at an age when his
re-employment potential is questionable. However, persons in a supervisory
capacity must not, over time, permit their position of power to supplant good
judgment and responsibility. When credible evidence stands against denial, the
employer's options may be limited and its obligations to the work force may
have to supervene over the interests of an otherwise valued employee.</span></p>
