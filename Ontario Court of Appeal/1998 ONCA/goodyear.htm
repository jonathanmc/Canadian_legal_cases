</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   In  the  summer of 1987, Goodyear negotiated to reduce  its</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part  of  the office tower at 10 Four Seasons Place. As  part  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  arrangement,  Goodyear negotiated a letter  agreement  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Angeles  dated  July 30, 1987. As part of this letter  agreement,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties agreed, inter alia, that consents and non-disturbance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreements  would  be  obtained from all existing  mortgagees  to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amendment  of  the 1980 lease. Ultimately, two  new  leases  (the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;1987 leases&quot;) were executed, but the consents of mortgagees  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">non-disturbance agreements were not. The rental income from these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases  represents  over 30 per cent of the total  rental  income</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  the  development. The total rent due over the remainder  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the original term of the 1987 leases is over $11,000,000.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shortly  thereafter, V&amp;A and Goodyear began to discuss Goodyear's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupancy  costs in both buildings. Commercial leasing rates  had</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  Goodyear and Angeles were unable to negotiate an acceptable</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  We  start  with the fact that Goodyear  executed  the  1987</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases,  and did intend, at that time, to take advantage of  them</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and to be bound by them. Goodyear now wishes to be freed from its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations.  It  takes  the  position  that  the   leases   were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated  on  December  12, 1994,  when  Ernst  and  Young  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharged  as  receiver  and  manager  and  Canada   Life   took</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession and control of the property. Burnhamthorpe  takes  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position that Goodyear continues to be bound by the terms of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases because:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   It   is  in  privity  of  contract  with
               Burnhamthorpe, as ultimate  assignee  of
               the mortgagees;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   It   is   in  privity  of  estate   with
               Burnhamthorpe, as ultimate  assignee  of
               the mortgagees;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   There  was  an implied contract  between
               Canada Life and Goodyear that both would
               be  bound  by  the  terms  of  the  1987
               leases;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.   After    the    mortgagee   went    into
               possession,  both lessee  and  mortgagee
               were  bound  by the terms  of  the  1987
               leases; and
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5.   The  foreclosure  resulted  in  Goodyear
               being  bound  by the 1987 leases  either
               because  they  were enforceable  in  law
               after   foreclosure,  or  Goodyear   was
               estopped     from     denying      their

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Broadly speaking, the doctrine of privity of contract stands</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  As  stated  above,  Burnhamthorpe agreed  to  purchase  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  from Canada Life in the fall of 1995. The purchase  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carried  out  by Burnhamthorpe taking assignments  of  the  three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages  from Canada Life, and then Canada Life  continuing  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment  in  the name of Burnhamthorpe an action for foreclosure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commenced  by  Canada  Life. On October  31,  1995  Burnhamthorpe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained a judgment for immediate foreclosure against a number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">companies registered on title; however, Goodyear was not named in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  action. Consequently, any rights which Goodyear had in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property at the time of the foreclosure were not foreclosed,  but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remained  intact. However, that does not answer the  question  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether there were contractual rights between the original lessor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  lessee which have survived the various assignments  and  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Burnhamthorpe, in its argument, refers to the first mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  Assignment of Rents Agreement entered into between  Saracini</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  mortgagor and Excelsior as mortgagee, both dated October  18,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1979. It relies on a number of factors involving those documents:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first, a provision in the mortgage to the effect that it was Athe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention  of  the parties to establish an absolute transfer  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment of all such leases and agreements, and all the  avails</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thereunder, unto the Mortgagee@; second, that the liabilities and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations of the mortgagor were, by the terms of the  mortgage,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">binding  on  the  assigns and successors of  the  mortgagor;  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">third,  that  the  Assignment  of Rents  Agreement  entered  into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between Saracini as mortgagor and Excelsior as mortgagee  was  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secure payment of the first mortgage and to assure performance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  agreements contained in the assignments, which included  all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present  and  future  leases of any parts of  the  premises.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment also included a provision that it would be binding  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all persons obtaining any interest in the land.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  In  my  view,  none of these factors is  of  assistance  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burnhamthorpe. First, the short statement of intent  included  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgage  - that the assignment of leases contained  therein</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was intended to be absolute - does not avail to overcome numerous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other provisions in the same document which indicate clearly that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assignment was intended as security only. The landlord was to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continue  to  collect rents and act as landlord in  all  respects</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unless  and until any default by the mortgagor in payment of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amounts  due  under  the  mortgage. In  any  event,  as  will  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discussed later in these reasons, it is my view that the question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  whether the assignment of rents was absolute does not resolve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any issue in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25]  Second,  the relevant provision in the mortgage  respecting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  binding  effect  on  successors  and  assigns  reads:  AYall</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  the case may beY@. That portion of the mortgage binds assigns</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  carry out only covenants, liabilities and obligations of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagor  and mortgagee under the mortgage. There  are  no  such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations  imposed  on the mortgagee in the  mortgage  document</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  respect to the lessor=s obligations to the lessee. In other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">words, there was no indication that the mortgagee intended or was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obliged to carry out any of the obligations of a landlord.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  Third,  the  purpose of the Assignment of Rents  Agreement,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  was executed at the same time as the mortgage, was  stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  be,  ATo  secure the payment of the Mortgage  and  to  assure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance  of  the  agreements  contained  herein  and  in  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorized  and directed by clause 4.7 of the assignment  to  pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rents  to the mortgagee, without inquiry, on written demand  from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mortgagee stating that a default has occurred. Similar to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage, there are no provisions in the assignment which require</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgagee to perform obligations of the landlord  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases.  Indeed, clause 4.5 of the assignment does precisely  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reverse.  It  states that the AMortgagee shall not by  reason  of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutes  an assignment to the mortgagee of rights  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases but, equally clearly, does not constitute an acceptance by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgagee  of  the  landlord=s  responsibilities  under  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases.  Although the assignment is specifically stated to  enure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  benefit of and be binding on successors and  assigns  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, that provision adds nothing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  rights  and  obligations of the immediate  parties,  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot  expand  in  any way the rights and obligations  of  their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">successors  and  assigns. The assignment, without more,  operates</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only  as  an  assignment of a chose in action (i.e.  a  debt  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rental  payments), for which the mortgagee may be able to sue  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its own name, depending on future events.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  Goodyear's  first lease of a portion of  the  premises  was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executed that first lease, it was subsequent in time to the first</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although the mortgagee clearly has the right to demand payment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rent from future lessees on default by the mortgagor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  Section 53(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property  Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1990, c.C-34 permits the assignee of a chose in action  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sue in his own name on that chose in action. Thus, the mortgagee,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  virtue of the assignment of rents could sue in its  own  name</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  recovery of those rents. This right is not denied by any  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  parties to this litigation. The relevant question is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  party  to a contract (here the mortgagor/lessor Saracini)  can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assign  its obligations under a contract (the leases) to a  third</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party  (the  mortgagee), since without the  existence  of  mutual</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistently  held  that  obligations  cannot  be  assigned,  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burnhamthorpe  acknowledges in its factum that only  by  novation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can obligations under a contract be transferred to a third party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It fails to explain in what way novation occurred in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]  There  are  vital gaps in the argument of Burnhamthorpe  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this point. It states in paragraphs 38(c) and (d) of its factum:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  ...   Where   there   is   a   purported
               assignment  of the burden or obligations
               of a contract, what occurs is that there
               may    be   vicarious   or   substituted
               performance  of  the  contract  by   the
               assignee/third   party.   However,   the
               original party (the &quot;assignor&quot;)  remains
               liable  in  the contract, and the  other
               party  can sue that &quot;assignor&quot;, but  not
               the third party &quot;assignee&quot;.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  As a result, the fact that the mortgagee

               obligations  of  the  lessor  under  the
               leases  is  irrelevant  to  whether  the
               assignments  of the leases are  absolute
               and thus create privity of contract.  ..
               ..  Since  an assignment is absolute  if
               the  entire interest of the assignor  in
               the  chose in action (i.e. in the rights
               under  the  contract) is  for  the  time
               being transferred unconditionally to the
               assignee,  and such occurred  here,  the
               assignments   of  leases  are   absolute
               assignments    under    contract    law.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]  In  my  view,  the whole basis of this argument  is  flawed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because,  as  I have pointed out earlier in these reasons,  there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no purported assignment to and acceptance by the mortgagee of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(see  clause  38(d) quoted above) to the question of whether  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  assignment of a major benefit of a contract alone  (in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  facts  of this case, privity of contract between the  tenant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  the mortgagee does not result from the assignment of  rents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given  the substantial remaining rights and obligations  on  both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sides  of  the lease agreement, none of which was either assigned</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in question were not absolute assignments, because they were made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  way  of security only. Its view is that the assignments  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absolute, since they were specifically stated to be so, and  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also  stated to be binding as against successors and  assigns  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both parties.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] The question of whether or not an assignment is absolute  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  way of security is a vexing one. It is clear that parties  to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">least  simple  to comprehend. In Alberta (Treasury  Branches)  v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">M.N.R.,  [1996] l S.C.R. 963 Cory J. dealt with this question  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the context of a conflict between an assignment of book debts  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour  of Alberta Treasury Branches (&quot;A.T.B.&quot;), which had loaned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moneys  to a hotel operator, and the Minister of National Revenue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  which the hotel operator owed moneys on account of income and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Excise Tax Act provided for the collection of taxes by way of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">garnishment.  It  was  argued  on  behalf  of  A.T.B.  that   its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment of book debts was an absolute assignment of  the  book</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debts  of  the hotel operator and that, consequently, A.T.B.  was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the M.N.R. had nothing to which it could attach. Speaking for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the majority, at p. 980, Cory J. said:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ....  the  same instrument cannot be  both  a
          &quot;security    interest&quot;   and   an   &quot;absolute
          assignment&quot;. If an instrument is an  absolute
          assignment,  then since it  is  complete  and
          perfect in itself, there cannot be a residual
          right  remaining with the debtor  to  recover
          the  assets.  By definition, a  complete  and
          perfect   assignment  cannot  recognize   the
          concept  of  an  equity  of  redemption.   An
          absolute  assignment  cannot  function  as  a
          means  of  &quot;securing&quot; the payment of  a  debt
          since  there would be no basis for the debtor
          to  recover  that  which has been  absolutely
          assigned.    An   absolute   assignment    is
          irrevocable. To say that the same  instrument
          can  operate  both as an absolute  assignment
          and   as   a   security   interest   is    to
          simultaneously  put forward two  incompatible
          positions.   The  two  conflicting   concepts
          cannot live together in the same document.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]  The background of the concept of privity of estate  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord  and tenant context is clearly summarized by Prof.  R.E.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scane  in  the  1965 Law Society of Upper Canada Special  Lecture</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">series in his lecture entitled &quot;The Relationship of Landlord  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Tenant&quot; at pages l and 2, as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In considering commercial leases....it is too
          easy  to  think of the lease as  a  contract,
          pure  and  simple, and, in turn, to  consider
          the  rights  and obligations of  your  client
          purely in contractual terms. Probably in  the
          greatest majority of cases this suffices. But
          you should never forget that the relationship
          between  landlord and tenant is more  than  a
          contract  -  it also involves  an  estate  in
          land. On that estate, contractual obligations
          may be, and usually are, engrafted....
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          You  will  recall that, in English  law,  the
          estate  of  a  tenant or lessee  is  a  &quot;non-
          freehold  estate&quot;, or &quot;an  estate  less  than
          freehold&quot;. In the eyes of the law, it  is  in
          theory inferior in quality to even the  least
          of  the  freehold estates, the  life  estate,
          even  though  the lease be for  one  thousand
          years.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  Through the ingenuity of the English courts, the rights  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenants  evolved over the years from mere rights in  personam  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights in rem. Prof. Scane continues at pp. 2 and 3:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This  right  in  rem gave the leaseholder  an
          estate in land in the true sense, and brought
          the  leasehold within the system  of  tenure,
          i.e., the tenant held an estate in land  from
          his  lord. The result is that an interest  in
          land,  which was originally not part  of  the
          feudal system of tenure at all, is now almost
          the   only  part  of  that  system  with  any
          remaining practical importance.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Because the relationship is that of a  tenant
          of  an estate to his lord, the parties to the
          original  tenancy are not only....in  privity
          of  contract,  but  are also  in  privity  of
          estate. It is the relationship of privity  of
          estate  which continues between the assignees
          of  the  reversion and the assignees  of  the
          [tenant's  interest in the] lease,  who,  not
          being  the original contracting parties,  are
          no longer in privity of contract.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] It appears to me that much of the confusion in the arguments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to privity of estate between the mortgagees and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lessee  in  this  case arises because of the  use  of  the  words</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;assignment of the lease&quot; when what is meant is assignment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's rights under the lease. An assignment of a  lease,  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to in most, though not all, of the authorities, means an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment of the term of the lease to a new lessee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43]  Canada  Life takes the position that there was  privity  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estate between it and Goodyear first, by reason of assignment  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  leases by Angeles to Aetna, Canada Life's predecessor,  and,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second  by reason of Canada Life having given implied consent  to</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44]  In  paragraph  54  of its factum  Canada  Life  states  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It   is   respectfully  submitted  that   the
          landlord's  reversion  related  to  the  1987
          Leases, was assigned to Aetna pursuant to the
          assignment of future leases contained in  the
          Aetna mortgage and pursuant to the assignment
          of   replacement  leases  and  future  leases
          contained  in  the 1979 Aetna Assignment  and
          the  1982  Aetna Assignment. Aetna's interest
          was  then assigned to Canada Life in February
          1993  pursuant  to  the transfer  of  Aetna's
          Mortgage to Canada Life and pursuant  to  the
          Assignment of Assignment of Rents from  Aetna
          to   Canada  Life  whereby  the  1979   Aetna
          Assignment  and  the 1982  Aetna  Assignments
          were  specifically assigned to  Canada  Life.
          Canada  Life  is  in privity of  estate  with
          Goodyear  in  respect of the 1987  Leases  by
          reason of the assignments. The effect is that
          Canada  Life  may enforce those covenants  of
          the  lease which touch and concern the  land,
          such as the obligation to pay rent. This will
          be  so independent of whether or not there is
          privity of contract between them.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45]   The  problem with that paragraph is that  the  assignments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred  to are assignments &quot;of the lease&quot; from the landlord  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour  of  mortgagees. Those assignments do  not,  nor  do  they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purport to assign the landlord's reversionary interest. The  most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  they  can assign is the landlord's interest in  the  lease.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Since they do not assign the reversion, they must assign only the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Without reviewing the reasons in that case in detail, it  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evident that the majority considered an &quot;assignment of lease&quot;  to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clear  from  the  facts  that there  was  no  assignment  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's  reversionary interest in the property.  None  of  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;assignment  of a lease&quot; by a lessor amounts to an assignment  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the reversion. The facts in the cited cases involve an assignment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the lessor's reversionary interest in the land. I cannot agree</font></pre>

          Agreements  which  were  never  finalized  or
          executed  by all of the parties. The evidence
          appears  to be that Aetna would not sign  the
          NDAs  and accordingly they were never entered
          into  or  assigned  to Canada  Life.  In  any
          event,  in my view, even if there had been  a
          written consent to the 1987 leases by  Canada
          Life or its predecessor mortgagee, this would
          not create a landlord and tenant relationship
          based  on  privity of contract or privity  of
          estate  between the mortgagee and the tenant.
          One  cannot  create  such relationship  by  a
          unilateral consent to the lease on  the  part
          of the mortgagee.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision  of  the English Court of Appeal in Corbett v.  Plowden,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question at pages 681 and 682:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If  a  mortgagor left in possession grants  a
          lease   without   the  concurrence   of   the
          mortgagees...the  lessee  has  a   precarious
          title,  inasmuch as, although  the  lease  is
          good as between himself and the mortgagor who
          granted  it,  the  paramount  title  of   the
          mortgagees  may be asserted against  both  of
          them.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          .....it  is  well  settled law  that  when  a
          mortgagee   intervenes  by  virtue   of   his
          paramount  title, and claims rent,  which  he
          has  right to do without setting up any lease
          whatever,  the  rent  if  paid  will  be  the
          previously existing rent, under a new tenancy
          from year to year under the mortgagee.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65]  Another question considered by the court in that  case  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether  the  tenant had become a tenant under the mortgagee,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continued as a tenant under the original lease. At page 684  Fry,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">L.J. states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          That  raises  this further question,  whether
          Mr.  Plowden  [the lessee] occupied  at  that
          time the position of tenant from year to year
          to  the  mortgagees, or of tenant  under  the
          agreement  [the original lease].  That  turns
          upon  this  further  question,  whether   the
          mortgagees  by their notice .... and  by  the
          correspondence,  asserted  their  independent
          superior title as mortgagees, or whether they
          claimed to receive the rents as agents of the
          mortgagor.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66]  In  this case there can be little doubt that the  mortgagee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  asserting  its superior title. There had previously  been  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiver and manager collecting rents as agent for the mortgagor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  that  receiver and manager was discharged and the  mortgagee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediately informed the tenants that it was in possession of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.  That  being the case, and the tenant not  rejecting  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenancy with the mortgagee, there was a deemed tenancy from  year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  year established between Goodyear and the mortgagee, given no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts which would compel a different result.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67]  From  the time Canada Life took possession in  December  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1994, Goodyear continued to abide by the terms of the 1987 leases</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  paid  rent  to the property manager without any  comment  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion  that the terms of the lease had changed. In  June  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995  Goodyear  initiated discussions about  the  possibility  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subletting one floor of its premises for the balance of the  term</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the leases, and requested Canada Life to agree to an extension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  lease  term  of that portion of the property  for  three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years,  because  the proposed sublessee wished a  ten-year  term.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">These  facts,  in my view, clearly indicate an intention  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part of Goodyear, at least until June of 1995, to be bound by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms  of  its  lease  for the full term. However,  there  is  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that the mortgagee intended to be so bound. Thus,  I  am</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied  that the tenancy, at that time, was one from  year  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">year.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commencement  of  this action, was a lease in the  terms  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original  leases  between Goodyear and Angeles for  two  reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first,  the  lease  between  Goodyear and  Angeles  continued  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between them despite the taking of possession of Canada Life, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when  Burnhamthorpe took over the position of Angeles as a result</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the foreclosure, it was entitled to enforce the original lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against  Goodyear; second, Goodyear is estopped  by  its  conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from denying that it is bound by the terms of the original lease.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  Continuance of Original Lease
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75]  The  application  judge expressed  his  view  that  when  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee  goes into possession of premises subject  to  a  lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsequent to the mortgage, unless there is an agreement  between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  lessee and the mortgagee to the contrary, the original lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is terminated. He cites no authority for that proposition, and  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have  some  difficulty with it. The only case to  which  we  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directed  where  that conclusion is stated is  Page  v.  Welford,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1941]  4 D.L.R. 448, a decision of a single judge of the Ontario</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court of Appeal on facts very different to those involved in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case.  The  judge  in Page v. Welford relied on the  decision  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corbett  v.  Plowden, supra, for authority  that  a  lease  given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subsequent  to  a  mortgage  is terminated  by  notice  from  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee to the tenant to pay rent to him. A careful reading  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corbett  v. Plowden indicates that it does not in fact stand  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such  a  proposition.  Corbett v.  Plowden  does  stand  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposition that such notice results in a new tenancy  from  year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  year  under the mortgagee. It does not deal with the question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  termination of the original lease. In any event, the facts in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Page  v.  Welford are substantially different from the  facts  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  case, since neither the tenant, nor his sub-tenant in  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, was continuously in possession of the mortgaged premises. I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do  not  consider it to be authority for the general  proposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  a  lease  is always terminated by notice from a  subsequent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee to pay rent to it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76]  Burnhamthorpe  takes  the position  that,  although  a  new</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenancy may be created after possession between the mortgagee and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  tenant,  the  original lessee's interest in  the  equity  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">redemption  does not come to an end, and the original lease  does</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  terminate  merely  as  a  result  of  the  mortgagee  taking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession.  Burnhamthorpe concedes  that  the  mortgagor,  as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result  of his default under the mortgage, has placed the  lessee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the  precarious  position  of possibly  being  evicted  by  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee  with paramount title. The mortgagor, by  his  default,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breached his covenant for quiet enjoyment, and the lessee, if  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does  not  remain in possession, cannot be sued by the mortgagor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However,  if the lessee remains in possession under a lease  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgagee, that lease can only be a lease of the mortgagee's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest  in the property, since the mortgagor still retains  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equity  of  redemption. The mortgagee's right to possession  will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">come to an end on payment by the mortgagor of the mortgage debt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] There can be no doubt that this analysis of the position  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  parties is correct as far as it goes. The next step  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analysis, and one for which we were given no clear authority,  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burnhamthorpe's proposition that after redemption by a mortgagor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  lessee  (who is still in possession under a lease  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee) can enforce the original lease against the mortgagor's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in the land. It seems to me that he must be able  to  do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so,  since  otherwise a mortgagor, by virtue of his own  default,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could  later redeem the mortgaged premises free and clear of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lease agreement which he himself entered into.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78]  If the lessee then stays in possession after redemption  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgagor,  the lease, being enforceable  by  him,  must  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enforceable against him. If the lessee does not wish to  stay  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession,  then  it should follow, that the  mortgagor,  having</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breached his covenant for quiet enjoyment, should not be able  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">force the tenant to remain in possession and abide by the lease.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79]  But  this argument is taken a step further by Burnhamthorpe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this case. The core of its theory is that the original leases,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which are carved out of the equity of redemption of the landlord,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Angeles,  continued as against Angeles as a contract, and  as  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest  in  the  Angeles' equity of redemption,  and  when  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equity  of  redemption  of  Angeles was foreclosed,  Angeles  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">replaced  by  the  foreclosing mortgagee (or its assignee)  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then  took  subject to the lease, and was entitled to enforce  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against  Goodyear. We were directed to no authority which  stands</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically for this proposition, and there is, as I see  it,  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basic  flaw  in  this portion of Burnhamthorpe's  argument.  When</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Angeles'  equity  of redemption was foreclosed,  the  foreclosing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee did not replace Angeles by becoming owner of its equity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of   redemption.  That  equity  was  gone  as  a  result  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foreclosure,  and  the  legal estate of the  mortgagee  became  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vested estate free from the mortgagor's equitable claim.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80]  Burnhamthorpe  argues further that  the  lease  granted  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goodyear was a partial transfer of Angeles' equity of redemption.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It  is  for this reason that a lessee in the position of  Angeles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has  a  right  to  redeem in a foreclosure action.  As  indicated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">above,  Goodyear  was  careful in its  estoppel  certificate,  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retain  that  right,  although it  did  not  exercise  it.  Since</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goodyear's  interest  in  the  equity  of  redemption   was   not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foreclosed,  Burnhamthorpe  argues  that  Goodyear  remained   in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession as a result of that interest, and must, therefore,  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject to the lease which attached to that equity.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81]  I  see  no  reason in law, and none was cited  to  us,  why</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goodyear  should  be  required to remain  in  possession  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  under a lease made with Angeles merely because  it  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  joined  in  a foreclosure action by Canada Life.  Goodyear's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship  with Canada Life was one of a tenant from  year  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">year,  and  I  see  no  reason why the  foreclosure  of  Angeles'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest should change that relationship.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  Estoppel
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82]  Burnhamthorpe's last argument is that Goodyear is  estopped</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  against it from taking the position that the 1987 leases  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated because of its estoppel certificate dated December 15,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995,  quoted  earlier  in  these  reasons,  and  Burnhamthorpe's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reliance  on  that  certificate. I  agree  with  the  application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge's  conclusion with respect to this argument.  Burnhamthorpe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in no way changed its position in reliance on the certificate. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  date the certificate was signed, Burnhamthorpe, even  if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   transaction  of  purchase  had  not  been  completed,   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrevocably  bound  to  its contract. Its argument  that  it  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various  options  which were not taken, such as not  closing  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffering  the attendant damages, is completely unpersuasive.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition,  the  provisions  in  the  agreement  with  respect  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmation of leases on which it relies did not refer to leases</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  any  particular term, but merely required a confirmation  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases such as they happened to be.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Take  notice that Goodyear Canada Inc.  will,
          at   the   expiration  of  its   year-to-year
          tenancies  for the Premises on  December  21,
          1996,  quit and deliver up possession of  the
          Premises to Burnhamthorpe Square Inc.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] Since he found that the term of the year-to-year tenancy ran</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  January l to December 31, the applications judge held  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goodyear's  notice to quit the premises on December  21  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adequate  to terminate the tenancy and that, therefore,  a  fresh</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">six  months'  notice to quit, would have to be given  to  end  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December  31,  1997  if Goodyear still wished  to  terminate  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenancy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[87]  That decision was no doubt based on the law that  at  least</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">six  months' notice to quit must be given to end on the last  day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  tenancy, that the notice must be unambiguous  and  state</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the tenant will deliver up the premises on the proper date:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">see  Cohen  v. Taylor Service Stores, [1948] 4 D.L.R.  658  (Ont.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.A.)., and the cases cited therein.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[88]  The  law, which had for many years been applied in  a  very</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">technical fashion, evolved to the state where persons wishing  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate  a  tenancy  would insert in  the  notice  to  quit  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative to the precise date of termination stating  something</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">akin  to  &quot;at  the end of the year of the tenancy&quot;.  In  Cohen  v</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Taylor,  supra, the term of the tenancy was clear, and there  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no element of unfairness in applying the law strictly. However, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recent   decision of the House of Lords - Mannai  Investment  Co.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ltd. v. Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd., [1997] 2 W.L.R. 945 -</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealing  with  notice  to terminate a commercial  tenancy,  where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was some element of doubt as to the termination date of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenancy, applied a flexible test. At p. 962, Lord Steyn stated:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the inquiry is objective: the question is
          what reasonable persons, circumstanced as the
          actual parties were, would have had in  mind.
          It  follows  that one cannot  ignore  that  a
          reasonable  recipient of  the  notices  would
          have  had  in the forefront of his  mind  the
          terms of the leases.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[89]  The facts in that case were simpler than those in this case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but,  in  my  view,  the  test  as articulated  is  a  fair  one,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">preferring  as it does fairness over technicality. In  our  case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  confusion  was  caused  by a number  of  possible  dates  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commencement  of  the  year-to-year tenancy.  Goodyear  obviously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thought  that it commenced on December 22, 1994, the date  Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Life  gave notice to pay rent to V&amp;A as its agent. It could  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken  the  position that it commenced on December 12, 1994,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">date  Ernst &amp; Young gave notice to it to pay rent to V&amp;A as agent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Canada  Life. It could also have taken the position  that  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commenced  on January 3, 1995, the date of Goodyear's  cheque  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response to notice to pay to Canada Life's agent. In my view, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application  judge was correct in his choice of January  1,  1995</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  the  reasons  he  gave. However, that does  not  answer  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question  posed by the Mannai test. The question is,  what  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada  Life  have reasonably considered to be  intended  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice.  The  clear answer to that question is that  Canada  Life</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would  have known that Goodyear wished to vacate the premises  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  end of the current year-to-year term. Canada Life also  knew</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  there could be varying views as to when the term ended.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">my view, it was incumbent on it to either resolve that issue with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goodyear, or ask the court to resolve it. In effect, it  did  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">latter.  That  being the case, I consider the appropriate  remedy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  Canada  Life to have been the requirement that Goodyear  pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rent  up to the end of December 1996, the last day of the current</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">term, not that Goodyear be required to stay in possession, or pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rent, until the end of 1997.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[90] There were cases cited by Burnhamthorpe from other provinces</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  appear to have come to a different conclusion.  They  are,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however,  substantially  different  on  their  facts.  I  do  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider  it necessary to review them in detail because,  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent that they reach a different conclusion, I would not follow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them.  The decision of the Ontario Divisional Court in Re Bianchi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">et al. v. Aguanno et al. (1983), 42 O.R.(2d) 76 (Div. Ct.), cited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  Burnhamthorpe, is not helpful, as it deals with a statutorily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mandated notice in a residential tenancy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[91]  I consider that the notice given by Goodyear was sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to terminate the tenancy as of December 31, 1996.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESULT
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[92]  I  would  dismiss  the cross-appeals of  Burnhamthorpe  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada Life with costs, but allow the appeal of Goodyear in  part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with costs and amend the judgment of Ground J. on the application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by striking the word &quot;not&quot; from paragraph 2 and adding at the end</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  that  paragraph  the  words &quot;as of December  31,  1996&quot;,  and</font></pre>
