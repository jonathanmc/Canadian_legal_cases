[1]  The appellant, Richard Fletcher, pleaded guilty in 1994 in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brother Edward Fletcher and was fined and placed on 18 months=</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    As they were passing in a hallway,
          an altercation arose where Edward Fletcher
          was knocked backwards into the filing
          cabinets by Richard Fletcher. Richard
          Fletcher struck Edward Fletcher a number of
          times in the face and body. Edward Fletcher
          suffered bruises to the chin, temple, head
          and also a cut to his lips.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he heard at the trial in these proceedings, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was more than justified in making the findings as to liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he did.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In this court, the appellant complains that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not make findings of credibility with respect to the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provocation. The issue of provocation was not pleaded in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">civil proceedings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  With respect to the award of damages, very little was said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this court on the subject, but in any event, having read the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">material, we are not in a position to disagree with the award</font></pre>
