    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1. For the purposes of this appeal we are prepared to assume
without deciding that the plaintiff's cause of action
crystallized when the breach of the building code was
reasonably discoverable.  Even so, in our view there is a
factual dispute as to whether the Chief Building Officer
assured the appellant that the existing fire separations
were satisfactory.  This is an integral issue as to the
application of the limitation period.  Its resolution
depends in part upon the precise timing, context and content
of the various representations received by the plaintiff as
to possible building code violations.  These facts can only
be determined at trial.

2. We would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and
below.</font></pre></td>
