    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is a Crown appeal from the decision of the Honourable
Mr. Justice Hill dated August 22, 1996 acquitting the respondent
of the charge of assault causing bodily harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The respondent was charged in the indictment as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   That he, on or about the 15th day of
          December, 1990, at the City of Mississauga,
          in the Regional Municipality of Peel, did
          unlawfully in committing an assault on
          Patrick Groom, cause bodily harm to that
          person, contrary to Section 267(1)(b) of the
          Criminal Code of Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  It is conceded that common assault is an included offence of
assault causing bodily harm as the offence charged in the
indictment and the included offence refer to the same
transaction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge found as a fact that the complainant's
injuries were the result of a single forceful impact due to the
respondent police officer unlawfully causing the complainant's
head to come into contact with a desk in a room in a police
station.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge was unable to determine whether the bodily
harm from the blow was objectively foreseeable and therefore
acquitted the respondent on the charge of assault causing bodily
harm. The trial judge declined to enter a conviction on the
lesser included offence of common assault because the foundation
for such a conviction, i.e. a single impact event, was not
advanced by the Crown as a theory of criminal liability at trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The complainant was arrested for being drunk in a public
place and for attempting to break into a police vehicle, and was
taken into custody in the early morning hours of December 15,
1990. He testified that he had consumed 12 bottles of beer during
the previous six hours. The trial judge found that the
complainant was arrested in an uninjured state. He was handcuffed
behind his back and guided by the respondent who held the
complainant in a restraint hold, and was taken into the Youth
Division Interview Room. The trial judge found that it was not
normal police procedure for the officer to take a prisoner into
the Youth Bureau Interview Room. The complainant was injured
immediately after the respondent led him into the interview room.
The theory of the Crown was that the complainant's injuries were
caused by the respondent officer intentionally ramming his head,
repeatedly, into a desk in the interview room.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The defence contended that the complainant &quot;heaved up
against&quot; the respondent as they turned to enter the interview
room, and as a result the respondent was knocked off balance and
reacted by pushing the complainant into the interview room where
he hit his head on the desk and then fell to the floor as his
hands were handcuffed behind his back.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  It is uncontroverted that the complainant sustained the
injuries while in the sole custody of the respondent and that the
injuries were caused by his head coming into contact with a desk
in the interview room. The trial judge described the
complainant's injuries as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Police witnesses who observed the complainant
          in Interview Room #4 saw him to be bleeding
          profusely. The top of the desk was composed
          of chip or particle board with an upper and
          lower plastic veneer or laminate surface. The
          desk corner was broken and pieces of the desk
          corner were on the floor.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          At trial, all medical witnesses acknowledged
          that the laminate edges could easily cut into
          skin. The import of all of the experts'
          testimony was that the injuries to the
          complainant's forehead involved a lot of
          energy to create.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Dr. Schwartz, the emergency treating
          physician, removed ten wood chips deeply
          embedded in a deep cut in the left side of
          Patrick Groom's forehead. This cut went right
          to the bone of the skull and took nine
          sutures to close. A second, equally deep cut
          to the skull, just below the first, took six
          sutures to close. There was a swelling in the
          area of the left eye. A one centimetre
          superficial laceration was discovered on the
          left cheek. Dr. Schwartz further observed a
          midline abrasion under the lower lip and two
          and one half centimetre laceration under the
          chin. There was an abrasion to the tip of
          Groom's nose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The medical evidence called by the prosecution supported the
Crown theory that the injuries resulted from multiple blows,
although the Chief Pathologist for Ontario testified that the
'one fall' theory was unlikely but not impossible.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] After a careful review of the evidence the trial judge
concluded in part as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           In the instant case, not only do I
          disbelieve the accused's version of events
          relating to the causation of injuries but I
          am satisfied, additionally, in all of the
          circumstances, that the false account was
          advanced with the design of avoiding
          responsibility and detection for the criminal
          use of force against the complainant. The
          accused's entire course of conduct since the
          incident, in my view, has been inconsistent
          with innocent causation or some mere attempt
          to avoid responsibility for misconduct under
          the provincial policing statutory regime.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                               ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           I am inevitably led to conclude, beyond a
          reasonable doubt, on the totality of the
          evidence, including the circumstances of the
          accused's calculated false story, that the
          accused unlawfully caused his prisoner's head
          to come into contact with the desk and in
          turn the floor of the room. The result was a
          single forceful impact with the desk before
          the complainant, intoxicated, handcuffed and
          unable to protect himself, fell to the floor
          striking his face. In my view, these findings
          do not engage the court in speculative
          reasoning.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           However, I am unable to more precisely
          define the unlawful causative conduct. For
          example, I am unable to determine whether the
          accused intentionally rammed or pushed the
          prisoner into the desk, a clear assault
          causing bodily harm, or in an unjustified and
          excessive employ of custodial force,
          propelled the prisoner into the darkened
          interview room, resulting in Groom's head
          striking the desk.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           The result of the unjustified use of force
          was the infliction of bodily harm.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           At trial, because of the dominant focus upon
          a fall as a single impact event, other
          matters were not explored, for example, the
          accused's ability to see in the darkness of
          the interview room and the accused's state of
          knowledge regarding the location of the
          interview room furnishings. In the instance
          of the accused, on entry to the room, simply
          hurling his prisoner into the darkness, it
          may or may not have been objectively
          foreseeable that a collision would occur and
          that injury would be occasioned by such an
          unlawful application of physical force.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           On one view of the case then, while the
          accused would be deserving of a reasonable
          doubt on the issue of bodily harm, he would
          be guilty of assault simpliciteur. The
          prosecution did not seek such a verdict,
          undoubtedly because of its position
          throughout the litigation that the accused
          had manhandled his prisoner by occasioning
          multiple strikes of the complainant's head
          into the desk corner. In closing submissions,
          Crown counsel reemphasized the prosecutorial
          theory of the likelihood of five blows being
          delivered to Groom's head in a short time.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           Although not particularized in the
          indictment, the Crown promoted, throughout
          its case, a theory which did not embrace a
          single impact with the desk. The Crown
          submitted that the evidence substantiated the
          infliction of injury through the engine of
          multiple directed impacts with the desk. That
          prosecutorial position was reflected in the
          Crown's examination of its experts and in
          cross-examination of the accused and of
          defence experts. As a result, other theories
          of criminal liability, in the context of a
          single impact event caused by the accused,
          were not explored at this trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                               ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           The indictment did not describe the precise
          nature of the assault causing bodily harm. No
          particulars were requested. The prosecution
          was not obliged to plead, in the indictment
          or otherwise, the exact mechanism of the
          assault alleged. However, the Crown chose to
          adopt an approach to the case engaging an
          exclusive theory involving unequivocal
          rejection of a single impact event. In turn,
          the accused defended the case, in an effort
          to raise a reasonable doubt, with substantial
          reliance on evidence designed to counter the
          beating or multiple blow theory. As
          indicated, in the context of the other facts
          found by the court, such defence evidence
          contributed to establishing the accused's
          liability for the employ of a single act of
          assaultative force.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                               ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...I do not think it can be said that the
          accused knew or ought to have known that a
          factual basis of liability involving a single
          impact event occasioned by the accused would
          be relied on to convict. Accordingly, I have
          been led to the belief that to find the
          accused guilty, on the court's view of the
          facts, even of assault simpliciteur, would be
          to impose liability upon the accused on a
          basis materially different from that relied
          upon by the prosecution. In turn, and not
          without some misgivings, I believe the
          consequence to be that a finding of guilt
          cannot, as a matter of law, be made.
          [emphasis in original]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In summary, while the trial judge found that the accused
used assaultative force against the complainant which resulted in
bodily harm, he was unable to convict on either the offence as
charged or simple assault because the single force impact theory
was at odds with the theory presented by the Crown throughout the
trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The indictment is broadly worded and does not contain any
details of the alleged assault. As noted by the trial judge,
particulars were neither given nor requested. The appellant
submits that the Crown, having regard to the completely
unrestricted allegation of assault, was not required to prove any
specific theory of the offence but rather the essential elements
of the offence. The respondent's principal argument is that once
the Crown presented a particular theory that it would be unfairly
prejudicial to the accused to allow the trier to convict on a
different theory.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] S.587 of the Criminal Code provides that a court may require
the Crown to produce particulars where the Court is satisfied
that it is necessary to a fair trial. The purpose of ordering
particulars is to give the accused reasonable and accurate
information enabling him or her to make a full and fair answer
and defence. Once particulars have been forwarded under s.587,
they form part of the indictment and the indictment is read as
amended by the particulars. As stated earlier, no request was
every made by the respondent for the Crown to provide
particulars.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] It is important to distinguish between particulars under
s.587 of the Code and particulars of the theory of the Crown.
While the Crown is bound to prove formal particulars, subject to
the surplusage rule, particulars are distinguished from the
Crown's theory which it is not bound to prove.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In R. v. Govedarov, Popovic and Askov (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d)
238 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A. made it clear that the Crown's
theory can be distinguished from the particulars and that the
Crown is bound to prove only the essential elements of the
indictment (including particulars if provided); it is not bound
to strictly prove its theory. In Govedarov, the appellants were
jointly tried and convicted of capital murder. The evidence
revealed that the victim had been killed in the course of a well-
planned break-in at the restaurant where he worked. One of the
grounds raised on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that they might find the accused guilty with
respect to the robbery, when the Crown had limited itself,
through particulars, to burglary as the basis of the s.213
offence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In Govedarov, counsel for the accused had moved for
particulars at the opening of the trial and requested to know,
specifically, which offence under s.213 the Crown intended to
rely upon. After some oral discussion, the Crown conceded that it
would be relying on the burglary part of the section.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Martin J.A. reaffirmed, at p.270, that while oral
particulars may also be binding on the Crown, particulars must be
viewed in light of their purpose in the context of a trial: that
being to provide the accused with reasonable information to
enable a full and fair defence. He quoted the following from R.
v. Stapylton et al. (1857), 8 Cox C.C. 69 at p.270:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The general principle applies only to this
          extent, to give such information as is
          sufficient to enable the defendant fairly to
          defend himself when in court; but, on the
          other hand, not to fetter the prosecutor in
          the conduct of his case. [emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In finding that the Crown was not bound to prove burglary,
Martin J.A. stated as follows at p.271:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The accused in the instant case were charged
          with murder. The Crown was entitled to rely
          upon any part or parts of the definition of
          murder which were applicable to the facts
          which it was open to the jury to find were
          proved. The statement of Crown counsel that
          he relied on the provisions of s.213 with
          respect to burglary was, at most, merely an
          announcement of the theory upon which he
          intended to proceed and did not constitute
          the furnishing of particulars having the
          effect of limiting the charge contained in
          the indictment. Moreover, it does not appear
          that the accused were in any relevant sense
          misled or prejudiced by the enlargement of
          that theory to include the offence of robbery
          if there was evidence to support the
          application of ss.213 and 21(2) to that
          offence. [emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In Thatcher v. The Queen (1987), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 481 the
Supreme Court of Canada held that there was sufficient evidence
to go to a jury in relation to the Crown's theory that the
accused either killed the deceased himself or had her killed by
someone else. Dickson CJC at 515 quoted with approval Professor
Peter MacKinnon's article 'Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowsty
and Stuart', 51 C.R. (3d) 134 at p.135 (1986):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...if an accused is to be acquitted in
          situations where every juror is convinced
          that the accused committed a murder in one or
          two ways, merely because the jury cannot
          agree on which of the two ways, it is
          difficult to imagine a situation more likely
          to bring the administration of justice into
          disrepute... and deservedly so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Here, the trial judge stated that the respondent
substantially relied on evidence to counter the multiple blows
theory and that &quot;such defence evidence contributed to
establishing the accused liability for the employ of a single act
of assaultive force.&quot; However, the trial judge does not explain
the manner in which the multiple blow theory of the Crown
&quot;contributed to establishing the accused liability... &quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Finally the trial judge observed that &quot;considering the
history of the first trial and the course of the trial before me,
I do not think it can be said that the accused knew or ought to
have known that a factual basis of liability involving a single
impact event occasioned by the accused would be relied upon to
convict.&quot; In my view, while it is quite clear that the Crown was
in fact relying on the multiple blow theory to convict, it cannot
be said that the Crown expressly rejected any other theory of
liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The principal issue to be determined is whether the
respondent would have suffered any unfair prejudice as a result
of a conviction for common assault based on a single impact event
when the Crown had stressed throughout its prosecution the
multiple blow theory. In view of the fact that the defence
position was that the injuries sustained by the complainant were
as a result of an accident based on reflexive conduct by the
respondent, I am unable to ascertain any unfair prejudice. The
fundamental issue was whether the force used was intentional or
accidental. The accused's response to the charge was that it was
an accident, whether the factual theory was based on a single
blow or multiple blows. It is therefore my respectful view that
the trial judge erred in concluding that a conviction for common
assault could not be entered because &quot;to convict on the court's
view of the facts would be to impose liability on a materially
different basis than that relied upon by the Crown.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Whatever the theory of the Crown as to the precise chain of
events, there was one fundamental issue in this case from the
beginning to the end. The fundamental underlying issue was
whether the injuries were accidental or deliberate. This issue
could come as a surprise to no one. Having found the injuries
deliberate and therefore assaultive the learned trial judge was
logically required to enter a conviction at least on the lesser
charge of common assault contained within the indictment as
charged.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In the case before us the trial judge has found as a fact
that the respondent committed an unjustified assault upon a
defenceless and shackled complainant. To acquit the respondent
because the trial judge was only satisfied as to the application
of a single blow rather than the Crown's theory of multiple blows
in my opinion does represent a very real possibility of bringing
the administration of justice into disrepute within the meaning
of Thatcher.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The respondent was clearly aware of the case that he had to
meet. The trial judge accurately described the &quot;root&quot; of the
Crown's theory being that the complainant &quot;was unlawfully
assaulted in the interview room within a split second of entering
and thereby sustained injuries.&quot; The trial judge ultimately
determined that the &quot;root&quot; of the Crown's theory had been
established when he concluded as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I am inevitably led to conclude, beyond a
          reasonable doubt, on the totality of the
          evidence, including the circumstance of the
          accused's calculated false story, that the
          accused unlawfully caused the prisoner's head
          to come into contact with the desk and in
          turn the floor of the room.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In relation to the issue of whether assault causing bodily
harm had been established on the facts found by the trial judge,
it is conceded by the appellant that the trial judge's conclusion
accords with the decision of this court in R. v. Nurse (1993), 83
C.C.C. (3d) 543 to the effect that the mens rea for assault
causing bodily harm includes the objective foreseeability of
bodily harm as a consequence of the assaultative conduct. I am
therefore not persuaded that the trial judge erred in requiring
proof of the objective foreseeability of bodily harm.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] In my view the learned trial judge made all the findings of
fact necessary to support a verdict of guilty of common assault.
(See R. v. Cassidy (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.). The
appeal is therefore allowed, the acquittal set aside and a
conviction entered for common assault. The matter of sentencing
is remitted to the trial judge.
