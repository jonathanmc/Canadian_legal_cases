[1]  Dyson J. found as a fact that the respondents' predecessors
in title had acquired the disputed triangle of land through
adverse possession prior to Mr. Mikulin purchasing Lot 13. There
was evidence to support that conclusion. Moreover, the trial
judge had the particular advantage, which we do not, of observing
the witnesses testify, examining all of the exhibits and
observing the witnesses' as they interpreted those exhibits. On
the evidence it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the
possession of the disputed triangle by the respondents'
predecessors in title, including Mr. Mikulin, was open,
notorious, constant, continuous, peaceful and exclusive of the
rights of the holders of the paper title.
[2]  Counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge failed
to consider the impact of the documentary material submitted on
Mr. Mikulin's application for consent to severance and that he
also failed to consider the effect of the deed. On the other
hand, the testimony of Mr. Mikulin demonstrates that he did not
intend to relinquish any claim to the disputed triangle. His
testimony reveals that he believed that if the application for
severance was successful he would be conveying to the purchasers
not only Part I of Lot 13 but the triangle encroaching on the
lands to which the appellant's predecessor in title held paper
title, and which Mr. Mikulin believed was part of his property.
The trial judge made an express finding that even after the
severance application was made, Mr. Mikulin treated the disputed
triangle as Apart and parcel of the property now known as the
west part of Lot 13&quot;. In those circumstances, the failure of the
trial judge to expressly refer to the documents cannot be said to
constitute reversible error.
[3]  In our view, s. 13 of the Limitations Act, R.S.O., c. L.15
has no application to this case. Counsel argues that registration
alone brings the case within s. 13. The words of s. 13 cannot
fairly bear that interpretation. Section 13 refers, in the
context of this case, to an &quot;acknowledgement in writing of the
title&quot; of the holder of the paper title being given to him or his
agent by the person in possession. Mr. Mikulun gave no such
acknowledgement to the appellant's predecessors in title.
[4]  We are also not persuaded that in a case such as this, being
one of mutual mistake, there is any important policy basis for
adopting the broad interpretation urged by counsel for the
appellant.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
[6]  With respect to the cross-appeal, we would not interfere
with the trial judge's decision. As counsel for the respondent
concedes, the result in this case does not fit literally within
rule 49.10(2). It was then a matter of discretion for the trial
judge under rule 49.13. The trial judge was very familiar with
the unfortunate history of this litigation and was in the best
position to determine whether an order for solicitor-and-client
costs was appropriate. We have not been persuaded that the trial
judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in limiting costs
to a party and party basis.
[7]  Accordingly, the cross-appeal is also dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
