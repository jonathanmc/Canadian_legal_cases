    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant argues that while disclosure of enhanced value
due to subdivision was required of him, that obligation has been
discharged in this case by disclosure to the respondent's lawyer.
It is our view that this argument must fail.  The respondent was
buying for himself, the lawyer was acting for both sides of the
transaction and was, in our view, subject to a conflict and in
any event the disclosure was not made to the lawyer until after
the agreement was signed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Since this argument fails and given the trial judge's
findings of credibility, the appeal must be dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  As to the costs ordered below, we would grant leave to
appeal from that order.  In our view this is not a proper case
for solicitor-client costs to be ordered at trial and we would
substitute an order of party-and-party costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In all the circumstances the appeal, subject to the
amendment of the costs order, is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
