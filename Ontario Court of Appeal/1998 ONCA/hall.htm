    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 (the Act). The motion succeeded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the action was dismissed. The appellant appeals from that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissal and, if successful on that issue, also challenges</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There is no appeal from the judgment as it relates to Pilot</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Section 266(1)(b) of the Act provides in part, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owner of an automobile is not liable for loss or damage for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bodily injury arising from the operation of that automobile</font></pre>

          bodily function caused by continuing injury
          which is physical in nature.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge accurately identified Meyer v. Bright</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused 1994 1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.C.R. v.i. as the controlling authority and correctly</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determination of whether an injury met the criteria established</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in s. 266(1)(b).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge found that the appellant had sustained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permanent impairment of a bodily function caused by a continuing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injury which was physical in nature. She further found that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bodily function which was permanently impaired was an important</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one. These findings are accepted on appeal. The trial judge also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that the permanent impairment of the important bodily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">function was not a &quot;serious&quot; impairment within the meaning of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">266(1)(b) of the Act. This finding of fact precipitated the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissal of the action and is the focal point of the appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Appellate deference to findings of fact is a firmly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established and essential component of appellate review. Counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the appellant acknowledges the limited scope of review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available. However, he submits that the trial judge's reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reveal a failure to give appropriate weight to certain medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reports, a misapprehension of evidence and inconsistent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusions all of which, when taken together, render her finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the injuries were not &quot;serious&quot; unreasonable and properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject to reversal on appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  It is appropriate to begin the review of the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons with the caution that they must be read as a whole.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Anomalies or ambiguities which appear in a specific sentence or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph may disappear when placed in the context of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entirety of the reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  In deciding whether the appellant's injuries brought her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within s. 266(1)(b), the trial judge examined at length the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various medical diagnoses advanced for the appellant's injuries.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Those diagnoses were found in medical reports filed by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, medical evidence called by the appellant, and medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence called by the respondent. The trial judge ultimately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that the appellant had suffered a thoracic outlet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compression as a result of the injury sustained in the car</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident. That condition left the appellant with intermittent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pain in her arm, numbness in two fingers on her left hand and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">neck pain. It affected her ability to lift and led to fatigue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">One of the physicians, whose evidence was accepted by the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge, described the appellant's injury as resulting in a &quot;mild</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permanent disability.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The trial judge rejected the diagnosis of chronic pain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">syndrome (also referred to as fibromyalgia) because the requisite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permanence of the symptoms associated with that diagnosis had not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been established. She also rejected the diagnosis of ulnar nerve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entrapment as inconsistent with the timing of the appearance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some of the appellant's symptoms.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Counsel for the appellant contends that in reaching her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion as to the proper diagnosis of the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injuries, the trial judge improperly discounted the probative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value of the diagnoses contained in the medical reports filed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant. Counsel relies on s. 52 of the Ontario Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.E.23 in support of the proposition that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">medical reports are entitled to as much weight as viva voce</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">medical testimony.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We cannot accept that submission. Clearly, s. 52 makes the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reports admissible. It also implies that resort to reports as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opposed to viva voce evidence does not in and of itself diminish</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the probative value of the reports. In every case, however, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge is charged with the responsibility of weighing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence, including the evidence offered by way of medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reports. The weight to be given to a medical report will depend</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the circumstances. In this case, the medical reports on which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant relied to establish chronic pain syndrome were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared years before the trial. The trial judge found that some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of these reports contained significant inconsistencies and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ambiguities. Those findings are fully supported by a review of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relevant reports. The trial judge was entitled to take those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors into account in deciding what weight to give to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diagnoses found in the reports.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant also submitted that the trial judge wrongly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected the viva voce evidence of Dr. Wright, the only physician</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retained by the appellant who had seen the appellant near the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time of trial. The trial judge's reasons for rejecting Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Wright's evidence are sound and supported by the evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] After determining the nature of the injuries suffered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and concluding that it met the criteria in s. 266(1)(b)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Act, save the &quot;seriousness&quot; requirement, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">turned to that requirement. Following Meyer v. Bright, she said:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I turn then to consider whether the permanent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          impairment of an important bodily function is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          serious. It is clear from Meyer v. Bright</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          that not all permanent impairments of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          important bodily functions are to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          considered serious. I must be satisfied that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          the impairment, which is not the injury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          itself, causes substantial interference with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Mrs. Daues' [the appellant's married name]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ability to perform her regular daily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          activities or to continue with her regular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          employment. In either event, it can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          considered to be serious. [Emphasis added.]

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The trial judge held that the appellant's injury did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantially interfere with her ability to perform her regular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">daily activities. This finding is not challenged. In considering</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the injuries substantially interfered with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's ability to &quot;continue her regular employment&quot;, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge had first to decide the nature of the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;regular employment.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The appellant was a registered nurse. It was her position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that her &quot;regular employment&quot; should be taken as the employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she enjoyed when the accident occurred. At that time she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">working as a registered nurse in a coronary care unit. That job</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved physical demands beyond those placed on registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nurses working in other parts of a hospital. It was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' position that the appellant had worked as a coronary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">care unit nurse for a relatively brief time before the accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that her &quot;regular employment&quot; should be taken as that of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered nurse working in a hospital setting.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The trial judge examined the evidence on this issue at some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">length. The appellant contends that she misapprehended the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence as to how the appellant came to begin working on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coronary care unit and wrongly concluded that the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment on that unit had begun as a result of hospital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cutbacks and not by any choice of the appellant. We have reviewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence relied on by the trial judge and it does appear that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she overstated its effect. That evidence does not refer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically to the reason the appellant (as opposed to her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">friend) started work in the coronary care unit. There is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direct evidence as to what led her to commence work in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coronary care unit when she did.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] While acknowledging this error in the appreciation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence, we are satisfied that the rest of the evidence relied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on by the trial judge amply supported her conclusion. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's employment should be viewed as that of a registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nurse working in a hospital setting and not necessarily a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered nurse working in the coronary care unit. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge concluded:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In this case, there is some interference in
          the ability of Mrs. Daues to perform the job
          of a coronary care unit nurse. However, I do
          not think that this amounts to an
          interference in her ability to perform her
          regular employment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Her regular employment was as a registered
          nurse, specifically as a hospital nurse
          providing patient care. While I am satisfied
          that Mrs. Daues enjoyed her work and was a
          competent coronary care unit nurse, the
          evidence is that she also enjoyed and was a
          competent and caring nurse on the medical
          floor at Centenary Hospital where she had
          worked for two years before moving to the
          coronary care unit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Having determined the nature of the appellant's employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the purpose of assessing whether her injuries would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantially interfere with her ability to continue that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment, the trial judge turned next to the effect of those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injuries on the appellant's ability to work as a registered nurse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in a hospital setting. That issue turned largely on whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was able to work the 12-hour shifts customary in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hospitals. There was opinion evidence from two defence experts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that she was able to perform 12-hour shifts. The medical reports</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied on by the appellant were of little assistance although one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strongly suggested the likelihood that the appellant would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">able to work 12-hour shifts. Dr. Wright's evidence that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant could not perform those shifts was not accepted by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge. On this record, the trial judge was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">find, as she did, that the appellant would be able to work 12-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hour shifts. More to the point, she was certainly entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">find that the appellant had not shown that she was unable to work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">12-hour shifts. As the onus was on the appellant, it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incumbent upon her to establish the requisite &quot;seriousness&quot; of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her injuries.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] It remains to consider the main argument advanced by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant in oral submissions. Counsel contends that the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge accepted the appellant as a credible witness who was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">malingering or deliberately overstating her injuries. He further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submits that the appellant's evidence and her description of her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injuries is consistent only with a diagnosis of chronic pain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">syndrome. It is his contention that the trial judge could not,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acting reasonably, reject that diagnosis and yet accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's evidence. Counsel further argues that the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence makes it clear that she was unable to work a 12-hour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shift as a nurse because of her fatigue, pain and inability to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lift the necessary weight. Counsel contends that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not accept that evidence and yet make the finding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was able to work a 12-hour shift.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Clearly, the trial judge found the appellant to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credible witness. She was speaking the truth as she believed it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be. We cannot, however, read her reasons as accepting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's claim that she could not work 12-hour shifts as of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the time of trial. The passage in the reasons relied on by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant is a reference to the appellant's evidence of her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition in June 1993, some seven months after the accident and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some three and half years before trial. The trial judge clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted that, as of that time, the appellant was unable to work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in a hospital as a registered nurse because of the lifting and 12-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hour shifts. Her rejection of chronic pain syndrome as the proper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diagnosis was an implicit rejection of the appellant's contention</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that her fatigue and pain continued to have the same debilitating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect at the time of trial as they had in 1993. It was also a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejection of the contention that those problems would render her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unable to work 12-hour shifts in the hospital in the future.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Nor is there any inconsistency between the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that the appellant acted reasonably to mitigate her</font></pre>
