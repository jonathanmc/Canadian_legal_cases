    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><strong>SOUTHEY J. (ad hoc):</strong>

          This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the decision of

Mr. Justice McDermid, dated March 17, 1995, dismissing the claims

of the plaintiff arising out of the termination of his employment

by The University of Western Ontario (the &quot;University&quot;) for cause

and  without notice on October 16, 1986. The plaintiff  had  been

employed  since  1972  as  the Director  of  the  Social  Science

Computing  Laboratory (the &quot;SSCL&quot;) at the University  and  as  an

Adjunct Professor without tenure.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  claims  against the University were  for  wrongful

dismissal,  infringement  and  other  remedies  arising  out   of

copyrights in computer software claimed by the plaintiff, damages

for  inducing  breach  of  contract and a  declaration  that  the

University  held  certain property in trust for him.  The  claims

against the defendants Teevan and Bjerring were abandoned at  the

opening  of trial. The plaintiff did not appeal the dismissal  by

the   learned  trial  judge  of  his  claims  against  the  other

individual defendants. The claim for inducing breach of  contract

was  not  pressed in this court, with the result that the  appeal

related only to the claims for wrongful dismissal and the  claims

arising out of copyright.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  plaintiff  was dismissed because of his  continued

use  for his own purposes of the University's computer, allegedly

without  the consent or knowledge of the University.  The  reason

for  discharge  was  given in a letter from the  Dean  of  Social

Science,  Denis  Smith, dated October 16, 1986.  The  letter  was

delivered  to the plaintiff shortly after the London City  Police

had  entered  his home that morning to execute a search  warrant.

The  reason  for  dismissal was said to be the continuance  of  a

relationship  between  the  SSCL and  Tycho  Research  Associates

Limited  (&quot;TRA&quot;), the plaintiff's corporation, in  breach  of  an

understanding  contained in correspondence between the  plaintiff

and Dean B. B. Kymlicka in 1981 that such relationships would  be

terminated. The letter of dismissal concluded with the words:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
               In   accordance   with   the   Personnel
          Policies of the University, you may request a
          hearing   with  a  Vice-President   and   the
          Director  of  Personnel  (or  designate),  at
          which time the reasons for termination may be
          discussed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A  media release from the University the following  day

said  only  that the dismissal was the result of an investigation

by  the  University into &quot;procedural improprieties&quot;. The  release

stated  that  &quot;because  the City of London Police  Department  is

continuing  an investigation the University can make  no  further

statement  on  the  matter  at  this  time&quot;.  The  plaintiff  was

subsequently  charged in a summons dated March 3,  1987,  with  a

breach of s.301.2(1)(c) (now s.342.1(1)(c)) of the Criminal Code,

which provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               301.2  (1)  Every one who, fraudulently
               and without colour of right,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (a) obtains, directly or indirectly, any

               acoustic,  mechanical or  other  device,
               intercepts  or causes to be intercepted,
               directly or indirectly, any function  of
               a computer system, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (c)  uses or causes to be used, directly

               paragraph (a) or (b) or an offence under
               section  387 in relation to  data  or  a

          offence punishable on summary conviction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The charge, as stated by His Honour Judge W. E. Bell in

his reasons delivered orally on October 4, 1988, was:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Edward  Herbert  Hanis is  charged  that
          between December 1st, 1985, and October 17th,
          1986,   at  the  City  of  London,   he   did
          fraudulently and without colour of right, use
          or  cause to be used, directly or indirectly,
          a  computer system, to wit, VAX-R, VAX-1, and
          MINI  VAX-2  the  property of  the  Board  of
          Governors,  University  of  Western  Ontario,

          Richmond   Street,  with  intent  to   obtain
          directly  or  indirectly a computer  service,
          contrary to clause (c), of subsection (1), of
          Code Section 301.2.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          On  consent,  the date of commencement of  the  alleged

offence  was  changed  to December 4, 1985,  the  date  on  which

s.301.2 was proclaimed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  plaintiff was acquitted by Judge Bell because  the

Crown  had  failed to prove beyond a reasonable  doubt  that  the

accused  had  acted fraudulently and without colour of  right.  I

shall  have  occasion  to refer later at greater  length  to  the

reasons of Judge Bell.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS

          The striking feature of this case is the failure of the

University  to give any opportunity to the plaintiff  before  his

dismissal  to  explain  his conduct, or,  more  particularly,  to

respond  to  the  allegations against  him.  Unbeknownst  to  the

plaintiff,  his  use of the University computer  had  been  under

investigation by the University and by the police for some months

before  his dismissal. No explanation was given to the court  for

the failure to give the appellant an opportunity before dismissal

to explain the conduct of which the University complained.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          I  accept  the  submission on behalf of the  University

that  there  is  no  general duty at common law  under  which  an

employer  is  required  to  give an  employee  a  hearing  before

deciding  to  terminate the employment. Such a  duty  can  arise,

however,  as  a  term of the employment contract or  because  the

employee  is the holder of an office in which the public  has  an

interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  plaintiff was originally hired as Director of  the
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposed SSCL for a 5-year term commencing July 1, 1972,  without

tenure   or   promise  of  tenure.  He  was  a  member   of   the

administrative staff rather than a member of the faculty, but was

appointed an Adjunct Professor. The learned trial judge held that

the purpose of his appointment as Adjunct Professor was to assist

him in attracting grants from sources external to the University.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  plaintiff  built the SSCL from the ground  up  and

played  a  leading  role in its development  and  management.  He

applied for and received many valuable research grants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          In   1977,  the  plaintiff's  employment  contract  was

extended  for  another  5  years. In  1982  his  appointment  was

converted  to  a continuous one, that is, one that  need  not  be

renewed every few years. It was recognized in writing by the Vice-

President and the Dean of the Faculty of Social Science that  the

appointment was an administrative staff appointment, but that the

appointment  as  Adjunct  Professor  was  to  carry  out  various

academic  duties. As to the quality of the plaintiff's  work  for

the University, apart from the use of the University computer for

TRA, the learned trial judge made the following findings:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
               There is no suggestion that in any other
          respect,  Dr.  Hanis failed to discharge  his
          duties properly. He was energetic, efficient,
          imaginative and innovative when  it  came  to
          directing the work of the SSCL. He was a very
          good  administrator  and always  received  an
          extremely high rating from the various  deans
          under  whom  he served. In addition,  he  was
          active   in  instruction  and  research   and
          attracted  a  great  deal  of  money  to  the
          University in the form of research grants. He
          took  pride in the operation of the SSCL and,
          as  evidenced  by  the  highly  complimentary
          report  of the SSCL Review Committee, he  was
          quite  justified  in doing so.  The  time  he
          spent  on TRA activities did not encroach  on
          the performance of his duties as Director  of
          the  SSCL.  It appears that he and his  staff
          gave  priority to the needs of the SSCL  over
          those of TRA.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          At  a  hearing in November, 1986, after his  dismissal,

the  plaintiff was informed by Mr. William F. Trimble,  Assistant

Vice-President  of  Human Resources, that the personnel  policies

applicable to his appointment were those contained in  a  booklet

entitled Personnel Policies for Regular, Full-Time Administrative

Staff  (non-academic), Revised January 1, 1981, which was  marked

at  trial  as  Tab  11, Exhibit 5. The relevant  terms  of  those

personnel policies include the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          B. TERMINATION - DISCHARGE FOR CAUSE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.00 The    University,   subject   to    the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.00 Except  in extreme cases as provided  in

               outlining  the problem and stating  that
               continuance of the problem will lead  to
               dismissal.

               misconduct,  disobedience   or   willful
               neglect  of duty, the staff member  will
               be  interviewed and suspended from  work
               without pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.00 The case will be considered within three
               working   days   and   may   result   in
               suspension  without pay for up  to  five
               working   days   or  dismissal   without
               further notice.</font></pre>

                    suspension    without    pay    nor
                    dismissal is appropriate, the staff
                    member will not lose pay.
          3.00 In  all  such  cases,  the  Director  of
               Personnel or designate must be  notified

               time the reasons for termination may  be
               discussed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It  is  clear that the University failed to follow  the

Personnel  Policies respecting termination. No warning was  given

to  the plaintiff under Article 2.00 under Heading B. If the case

was  an  extreme  one to which Heading C applied, the  University

failed  to  interview the plaintiff, as required by  clause  1.00

before  suspending him from work without pay, and failed to  give

the  case consideration within three working days as required  by

article 2.00 under heading C.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          In  my opinion, the Personnel Policies were part of the

plaintiff's  contract of employment. By failing  to  comply  with

them, the University committed a breach of contract.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Before  considering the legal effect of the  breach  of

contract, I turn to the plaintiff's claim to procedural  fairness

as holder of an office in which the public has an interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          I  am unable to accept Mr. Ortvid's submission that the

plaintiff  did not hold an office. The appropriate definition  of

&quot;office&quot; in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) is:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          A  position or place to which certain  duties
          are  attached,  esp. one of a  more  or  less
          public   character;  a  position  of   trust,
          authority, or service.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The appropriate definition of &quot;office&quot; in Webster's New

World   Dictionary  of  the  American  Language,  Second  College

Edition, (1976) is:

          a  position of authority or trust, esp. in  a
          government, business, institution, etc.  (the
          office of president).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There  is no doubt that the plaintiff was in a position

of  authority  and  trust. He used his own ideas  and  skills  in

setting  up the SSCL. The way in which he did so was not governed

by detailed instructions received from a person in authority over

him. His responsibility was to achieve a goal for the University,

and he discharged that responsibility with considerable success.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  University  is a statutory body continued  by  the

University  of  Western  Ontario Act,  S.O.  1982,  c.92.  It  is

financed in part by public funds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          In Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 (1990),

69  D.L.R.  (4th) 489, the Supreme Court of Canada dealt  with  a

claim for wrongful dismissal arising out of the dismissal of  the

respondent Knight with 3 months' notice from his employment  with

the   appellant  school  board  as  its  director  of  education.

L'Heureux-Dubé  J.,  delivering the majority judgment,  in  which

Dickson  CJC,  La Forest and Cory JJ. concurred,  held  that  the

respondent  could  be  terminated even with  just  cause  upon  3

months'   notice  pursuant  to  a  provision  in  the  employment

contract.  She  went  on to consider the question  of  procedural

fairness, commencing with the following observation, in part,  at

p.499:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.  Procedural Fairness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">              The   conclusion  that  the  respondent's
          employment   could   be  legally   terminated
          without  a  showing of just  cause  does  not
          necessarily   entail   that   the   procedure
          involved  can be arbitrary. There  may  be  a
          general   right   to   procedural   fairness,
          autonomous  of the operation of any  statute,
          depending  on consideration of three  factors
          which  have  been held by this  court  to  be
          determinative  of  the existence  of  such  a
          right:   Cardinal   v.   Director   of   Kent
          Institution, [(1985), 24 D.L.R. (4th) 44]
                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It  should  be noted at this point  that  the
          duty  to  act  fairly  does  not  depend   on
          doctrines  of employment law, but stems  from
          the  fact that the employer is a public  body
          whose powers are derived from statute, powers
          that must be exercised according to the rules
          of administrative law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          L'Heureux-Dubé  J. began her analysis  at  the  top  of

p.500:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. General duty of fairness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             The  existence of a general  duty  to  act
          fairly  will  depend on the consideration  of
          three factors: (i) the nature of the decision
          to  be made by the administrative body;  (ii)
          the  relationship existing between that  body
          and  the individual; and (iii) the effect  of
          that  decision  on  the individual's  rights.
          This Court has stated in Cardinal v. Director
          of  Kent  Institution, supra,  that  whenever
          those  three elements are to be found,  there
          is  a  general duty to act fairly on a public
          decision-making  body (Le  Dain  J.  for  the
          Court at p. 653).
                              ...</font></pre>

          nature of the relationship between the  board

          of  the  House  of Lords, Ridge  v.  Baldwin,

          the  possible employment relationship between
          an   employer  and  an  employee  into  three
          categories (at pp. 71-2): (i) the master  and
          servant relationship, where there is no  duty
          to  act fairly when deciding to terminate the
          employment; (ii) the office held at pleasure,
          where no duty to act fairly exists, since the
          employer   can   decide  to   terminate   the
          employment  for  no  other  reason  than  his
          displeasure; and  (iii) the office from which
          one cannot be removed except for cause, where
          there exists a duty to act fairly on the part
          of   the   employer.  These  categories   are
          creations  of  the common law.  They  can  of
          course  be  altered  by  the  terms   of   an
          employment   contract   or   the    governing

          not  incompatible with the  imposition  of  a

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As  to  the  third  element, the impact of the  decision  on  the

employee, she said at p.505:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             This  point  can be dealt with  summarily.
          There is a right to procedural fairness  only
          if  the decision is a significant one and has
          an   important  impact  on  the   individual.
          Various courts have recognized that the  loss
          of  employment  against  the  office-holder=s
          will  is  a  significant decision that  could
          justify imposing a duty to act fairly on  the
          administrative decision-making body.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In  my judgment, all three of the elements necessary to

give rise to a duty to act fairly existed in the case at bar. The

decision  of the University was final and specific. The appellant

held  an  office and the decision to terminate the employment  of

the  appellant  was of great significance to the  appellant.  The

appellant, in my opinion, was entitled to procedural fairness  in

connection  with the decision to dismiss him. He did not  receive

procedural  fairness, because he was given no opportunity  before

termination  to  answer the allegation of breach  of  trust  made

against him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  learned  trial  judge recognized  the  appellant's

right  to  procedural fairness, but found that it was in conflict

with  the  University's right to dismiss the  appellant  for  the

breach  of  fiduciary duty of which the learned trial  judge  had

found  the appellant guilty. He asked himself which right  should

prevail,  and concluded that it should be that of the University,

because of the continuing and surreptitious nature of the  breach

of  duty  in the face of ample warning that he should  cease  the

conduct  involved in the breach, and because the  University  was

entitled to rely on evidence of breach of duty acquired after the

dismissal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          With  respect, the learned trial judge erred in holding

that  the  rights  of  the appellant and the University  were  in

conflict.  Both  rights could have been given effect  to  if  the

University  had given the appellant an opportunity to respond  to

the  accusations against him before dismissal. As was pointed out

by  L'Heureux-Dubé J. in the Knight case, one of the purposes  of

imposing procedural fairness is to enable the employee to try  to

change the employer's mind about dismissal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          For  the  foregoing  reasons I am  satisfied  that  the

dismissal  of the appellant without notice and without a  hearing

was  void on either or both of two grounds, namely, the dismissal

was  in  breach of the appellant's employment contract,  and  the

appellant did not receive the procedural fairness to which he was

entitled.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The next question is whether the unlawful nature of the

discharge  is  of  any significance in this  case  in  which  the

learned  trial  judge  found  that  there  was  just  cause   for

dismissal. Although counsel for the appellant took issue with the

onerous  nature of the duty found to exist, we were not asked  to

retry  the issue of cause. Does the finding of the learned  trial

judge mean that the breach of contract by the University and  its

failure   to  observe  procedural  fairness  are  of   no   legal

significance, because the appellant could have been dismissed  in

any  event. In my judgment, the answer to that question  must  be

&quot;No&quot; in the circumstances of this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  right of which the appellant was deprived was that

of  having the opportunity, before his employment was terminated,

to persuade the University that he should not be dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  learned trial judge on the issue of cause should be reversed

on the merits, it is not clear to me that the appellant might not

have  persuaded the University to stay its hand, if he  had  been

given  the  opportunity prior to dismissal to present  his  case.

That  opportunity might have been given to him in  the  interview

required  under the Personnel Policies or in some other  type  of

hearing sufficient to give procedural fairness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  case  against the appellant was not open and  shut

and  it  certainly was not a simple one. The trial judge  pointed

out that the trial consumed 64 days, that 19 witnesses testified,

many  of them at great length, and that the nature of the  claims

was  complex and varied. Counsel for the University submitted  in

this  Court  that the case was overwhelmingly fact  driven,  that

much  of  the  evidence  was in conflict, and  that  the  factual

scenario depended upon findings of credibility.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  trial  judge  reached  an unfavourable  conclusion

regarding the credibility of the appellant. He said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
               This is perhaps a good point at which to
          comment on Dr. Hanis' testimony generally.  I
          found  that  many times he was not forthright
          in  describing important events. He was often
          self-servingly  selective in  his  recall  of
          events  and  withheld  important  information
          during  his  direct  examination,  which  was
          extracted only with some difficulty on cross-
          examination. He was often evasive  on  cross-
          examination and admitted matters damaging  to
          his   position  grudgingly  and  only   after
          extensive   questioning   and   after   being
          confronted  with  some  documentary  evidence
          that  made  the maintenance of  his  position
          untenable. Even then, he frequently attempted
          to  provide  some unpersuasive,  self-serving
          justification.   His   insistence   that   by
          terminating cost recovery project  #60001  he
          had  eliminated the source of  the  potential
          conflict of interest complained of by  senior
          University administrators defied logic.
               Usually,   he  interpreted  his   rights
          expansively      and     his      obligations
          restrictively.   In  my  opinion,   on   many
          occasions he either had a distorted  view  of
          reality  or  was deliberately  attempting  to
          mislead me. In coming to these conclusions, I
          have  taken  into account the fact  that  Dr.
          Hanis   is,   by   nature,  a  stickler   for
          precision. For example, he would not agree to
          suggestions  put  to him on cross-examination
          that  did  not  coincide  exactly  with   his
          version  of events. He was quite entitled  to
          take that position and I do not criticize him
          for  that.  However, I do censure  his  self-
          serving lack of forthrightness.</font></pre>

a  critical  conversation between the appellant  and  Mr.  W.  S.

McBride,  the University's Director of Finance, as to the  nature

of  the 1961 understanding referred to in the letter of dismissal

was that he accepted Mr. McBride's version of the conversation as

being  more reliable, where it differed from the recollection  of

the plaintiff.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Judge Bell, who presided at the criminal trial, held  5

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In  summary, as counsel put  it  in  his
          submissions,  the  accused honestly  believed

          consultants who were employed in the computer
          laboratory  as  well as under  contract  with
          Tycho,  was done within reasonable boundaries
          of personal use, authorized by the University
          and for the benefit of the University.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          After referring to evidence attesting to the honesty of

the plaintiff, he concluded at p.25:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I'm  satisfied the accused is testifying
          honestly as to his personal impression of the
          purport of the discussions with Mr. McBride.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               After  an  anxious  review  of  all  the
          evidence I am left in doubt, which I consider
          reasonable,    that   the    accused    acted
          fraudulently and without colour of  right.  I
          cannot   accept   the  argument   of   wilful
          blindness   under   the  circumstances.   The
          accused may have been careless, but I  cannot
          assign moral turpitude to that carelessness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If  the appellant had been heard before dismissal,  and

the  University had assessed his evidence in the same way as  did

Judge  Bell, it is unlikely that he would have been dismissed.  I

am  not  satisfied that the hearing after termination  under  the

Personnel Policies, which, according to Mr. Ortvid, did occur  in

this  case,  provided an equivalent opportunity to the appellant.

Once  the  decision to dismiss had been made, it would have  been

more  difficult to have it reversed than it would  have  been  to

persuade  the University not to take the decision to  dismiss  in

the first place.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Judge  Bell  concluded his reasons for  acquitting  the

appellant by quoting as follows form the evidence of Dr. Baldwin:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          And sir   if  technical  persons  working  in
               communication  systems in  the  computer
               lab are working in their private time on
               projects that are compatible with  their
               profession, is that seen as  a  positive
               or a negative thing?
          Largely positive.
          Why is that?
          It enhances their professional expertise in a
               variety of ways. It keeps them close  to
               the  real  world and the application  of
               their theoretical knowledge.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          He  added &quot;I would add that Dr. Baldwin was a member of

the  University  senate  council  on  computers  and  was  in  an

excellent position to make those informed comments.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  evidence at trial in the case at bar was that some

use  of  the University's resources by employees and faculty  for

their  own  purposes was accepted. So long as the usage  did  not

interfere  with  the  primary purpose of  having  the  equipment,

namely,  research  and teaching, a modest  amount  of  usage  was

tolerated. It was a question of degree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          In  light  of the foregoing, I find that the effect  of

the  breach  of  contract by the University  and  its  denial  of

procedural  fairness, or either one of them, was  to  render  the

dismissal  wrongful and to cause the appellant to suffer  damages

which he is entitled to recover from the University.</font></pre>

COPYRIGHT IN TYCHO/HASP</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  only  issue respecting copyright raised on  appeal

related  to  the  appellant's claim of copyright  in  TYCHO/HASP.

TYCHO/HASP was a computer software system which enabled  multiple

users  of a mini-computer to obtain computing services from,  and

exchange information with a remote main frame computer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Mr.  Roland  made 3 submissions without elaboration  in

oral argument. Those submissions were:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The TYCHO/HASP  system was the personal research project  of  the
     appellant,  notwithstanding  the  contrary  finding  of  the
     learned  trial judge, because the appellant said it was  his
     personal research project, and it had been accepted as such.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The University  is  estopped from denying the  copyright  of  the
     appellant  in  the software, because he had  relied  on  his
     belief  in  the  existence of copyright while marketing  the
     software over a 10-year period.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant  had paid approximately $190,000 to his consultants
     to   write  the  software,  and  had  taken  assignments  of
     copyright from them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          None  of  these three points is telling, in my opinion.

As to the first, determination of the issue of copyright does not

depend  on whether or not the system is labelled as the  personal

research project of the appellant. As to the second, the elements

necessary in law for an estoppel were not present. There  was  no

representation by the University and no detrimental  reliance  by

the   appellant.   As  to  the  third,  the  appellant   received

substantial  net pecuniary benefit from marketing  and  servicing

the  software,  despite payments to those whom  he  described  as

consultants.  The  assignments  of  copyright  from   them   were

ineffective,  because they themselves had  no  copyright  in  the

software for reasons to be explained below.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          I  turn  then  to the points raised in the  appellant's

factum.  The  first  is that the learned trial  judge  failed  to

consider  that  the  University  had  infringed  the  appellant's

copyright  in  certain design notes, drawings and  diagrams.  The

documents in question were handwritten design notes, drawings and

diagrams  prepared by the appellant in 1968 before  he  commenced

employment  at the University. We were not referred  to  evidence

sufficient  to prove that TYCHO/HASP constituted an  infringement

of  the  appellant's copyright, if any, in the contents of  those

documents. It is significant that the documents, which  were  the

basis  of  the appellant's claim respecting TYCHO/HASP, were  not

proferred in his evidence in chief, but were put to him in cross-

examination  by counsel for the University. They were  marked  as

Exhibits 13A and 13B. The appellant admitted in cross-examination

that he never showed these documents to anyone at the University.

The TYCHO/HASP software reflected the idea in the 1968 notes, but

did  not  copy  any  form of expression  in  them,  as  would  be

necessary for infringement of copyright.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  learned trial judge relied on the evidence  of  an

independent  expert in computer technology, Mr. W. G. Hutchinson,

in  finding that it was a &quot;long way&quot; from exhibits 13A and  B  to

the  source  code  for TYCHO/HASP. In my judgment,  the  evidence

amply supports the following finding by the learned trial judge:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  &quot;idea&quot; is at one extreme of the process,
          and  the source code is at the other end.  In
          between,  there  are many  steps  or  phases,
          including  the preparation of functional  and
          technical design specifications, the  use  of
          computer  programming languages to write  the
          code,  assembling  it  in  machine  language,
          execution and testing. The skills required to
          accomplish  all these tasks are  usually  not
          resident  in one person. To go from  what  is
          incorporated  in Exhibits 13A and  B  to  the
          finished programme known as TYCHO/HASP  would
          require  a  significant amount  of  analysis,
          planning,   and  programming  by  experienced
          communications programmers. Such  programming
          ability is highly skilled in nature and would
          likely  require  someone  with  a  degree  in
          computer  science. Dr. Hanis did not  possess
          this ability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Therefore,  I  reject any suggestion  by
          Dr.  Hanis  that he had &quot;created&quot;  TYCHO/HASP
          before  coming  to  UWO and  that  he  merely
          &quot;implemented&quot; his &quot;original work&quot;  after  his
          arrival.  I find that Dr. Hanis had an  idea,
          which Mr. Kushnir took and used to write most
          of  the source code for TYCHO/HASP under  Dr.
          Hanis' direction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  second point raised in the appellant's  factum  is

that  the  learned  trial  judge  failed  to  consider  that  the

appellant  was  an employer of the consultants who developed  the

source code for TYCHO/HASP and had obtained from them assignments

of the copyright to which they were entitled under s.13(3) of the

Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-30. The relevant portions of s.13

read as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               13  (1)     Subject  to  this  Act,  the
               author  of  a  work shall be  the  first
               owner of the copyright therein.
                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                  (3)    Where the author of a work was
               in  the  employment of some other person
               under   a   contract   of   service   or
               apprenticeship and the work was made  in
               the  course  of his employment  by  that
               person,  the person by whom  the  author
               was  employed shall, in the  absence  of
               any  agreement to the contrary,  be  the
               first owner of the copyright. ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                  (4)     The owner of the copyright in
               any  work  may assign the right,  either
               wholly    or   partially,   and   either
               generally   or  subject  to  territorial
               limitations,  and either for  the  whole
               term  of the copyright or for any  other
               part thereof, and may grant any interest
               in   the   right  by  licence,  but   no
               assignment or grant is valid  unless  it
               is in writing signed by the owner of the
               right in respect of which the assignment
               or   grant  is  made,  or  by  his  duly
               authorized agent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Although  the  appellant  had obtained  assignments  of

copyright  from  his  consultants, who were the  authors  of  the

TYCHO/HASP software, those assignments, in my judgment,  conveyed

no ownership to the appellant for two reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The consultants were all employees of the University, so that the
     University  was  the owner of the copyright  in  their  work
     under  s.13(3). No records were kept to establish that these
     authors produced the software outside of the course of their
     employment by the University.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant   emphasized  that  the  authors  were  independent
     contractors,  or  independent  consultants,  as  opposed  to
     persons under a contract of service with him, so that he did
     not  become the owner of copyright in their work because  of
     the operation of s.13.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  third  point raised in the appellant's  factum  is

that  the  learned  trial  jduge  failed  to  consider  that  the

University  assigned copyright to the appellant.  The  assignment

was  said to be contained in correspondence between the appellant

and  the  University in 1976. The correspondence consisted  of  a

letter, dated March 29, 1976, from the appellant to Dean Kymlicka

and  a  letter  dated June 28, 1976, from A. K. Adlington,  Vice-

President,  Administration and Finance, to  Dean  Kymlicka,  with

copy  to the appellant, approving the proposal contained  in  the

appellant's letter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  appellant stated in his letter that in the  course

of  developing the Computing Laboratory from &quot;ground zero&quot; he had

developed  certain  software which he had decided  to  supply  in

modified  and  extended  versions with the  requisite  consulting

services  &quot;to  very  limited numbers of sites  on  the  following

basis&quot;.  The provisions relevant to copyright are the first  two,

which read as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As the author, I intend to exercise copyright
               ownership   over   the   software    and
               modification   and  extensions   thereto
               under   section  E-X-1  of  the  Faculty
               Handbook.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In order to proceed in a clearcut fashion,  I
               have invested in the establishment of  a
               firm,  Tycho Research Associates,  (P.O.
               Box #415, Station 'B', London, Ontario).
               Tycho   is   presently   an   individual
               proprietorship, but will be incorporated
               if  and when activity should warrant the
               expense.   Ownership  of  the   software
               copyrights  is held by Tycho  and  Tycho
               will  contract  with interested  clients
               for  the supply of modified versions  of
               RSTS/UT200   or   RSTS/HASP   and    the
               prerequisite consulting services.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  short answer to the third point in the appellant's

factum is that the letter of March 29, 1976, did not contain  any

words  of  conveyance or transfer of any copyright interest  from

the  University to the appellant. The appellant in his letter did

not recognize that the University owned any copyright of which he

was  seeking  an assignment. Instead, he asserted in  the  letter

that he owned the copyright in the software and would licence  it

to the University.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          For  the  foregoing  reasons, I see  no  error  in  the

decision  of  the  learned  trial  judge  denying  the  copyright

interest in TYCHO/HASP claimed by the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
UNJUST ENRICHMENT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          In  view  of the substantial benefits received  by  the

appellant from the use of the resources of the University, I  see

no  merit in the appellant's claim to compensation based  on  the

doctrine of unjust enrichment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
RESULT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The  appeal is allowed. The judgment below is set aside

and  in  its  place  will  be  judgment  for  the  plaintiff  for

$158,034.54,  less  any  income earned  from  employment  by  the

appellant  during the 18 months following his dismissal.  If  the

parties  are unable to agree on the amount of such income,  there

will be a reference to determine such amount.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          As  requested by Mr. Ortvid, with the agreement of  Mr.

Roland,  the  Court  will hear submissions  from  counsel  before

making  any  order  with  respect  to  costs.  Counsel  may  make

arrangements for a date on which those submissions will be heard.

The  Court will expect counsel on that date to speak as  well  to

the  amount  of  the  deduction to be made in respect  of  income

earned  by  the appellant from employment following his dismissal

and  to the entitlement of the plaintiff to prejudgment interest,

including the appropriate rate and date of commencement.
