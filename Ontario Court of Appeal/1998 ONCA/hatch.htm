</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Notwithstanding Ms. Secord's able and thorough submissions,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we are not satisfied that there is any basis for interfering with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge's finding that Dual Removal was liable on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract with the respondent. This was principally a question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact. The respondent was retained in a meeting with Mr. Abrams on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 17, 1989 to decommission the site and construct a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer station for Dual Removal. Thus, it was open to the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge to find that until February 1990 the contracts were with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dual Removal. The fact that following February 1990 the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was instructed to invoice Dual Transfer did not alter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contractual relationship between the parties. Even after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">February 1990, Dual Transfer had no assets and the project</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continued to be directed by the principals and employees of Dual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Removal. Mr. Abrams himself conceded that Dual Transfer never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carried on business of any kind and the payments to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent, both before and after February 1990, were made by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same corporate entity.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The letter of January 24, 1992 confirms Dual Removal's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuing liability for the respondents' fees. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected Mr. Abrams' attempt to explain that letter. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence gave further support for the trial judge's findings of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dual Removal's liability.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We reach a similar conclusion with respect to Mr. Abrams'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal liability. The trial judge found that at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">September 5, 1991 meeting Mr. Abrams gave a personal guarantee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for payment of the respondent's account. In view of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship between the parties, it was open to the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to find that the terms of the guarantee had been agreed and were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficiently clear and unambiguous. As a result of the meeting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent returned to work. Mr. Abrams never denied giving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the guarantee until the litigation commenced. Indeed he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledged receiving the written guarantee and asked for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change as to its form but not its substance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  It was not disputed that estoppel is available to prevent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Abrams from relying on the defence in the Statute of Frauds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">We do not accept that Mr. Abrams at any time withdrew the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee. The only conduct pointed to by Ms. Secord is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Abrams' failure to return the written guarantee to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents. That was not itself sufficient to constitute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">withdrawal of the guarantee given at the September 5, 1991</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting so as to defeat the operation of the equitable doctrine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of estoppel. Mr. Abrams never communicated to the respondent that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was withdrawing his personal guarantee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Finally, we do not agree that Mr. Abrams is liable only for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fees and expenses incurred after the September 5, 1991</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting. The guarantee covered all of the indebtedness to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We see no merit in the cross-appeal and the cross-appeal is</font></pre>
