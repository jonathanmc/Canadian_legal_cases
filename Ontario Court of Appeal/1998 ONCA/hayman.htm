[1]  The appellant seeks release pending her appeal. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">currently has an in-person appeal against conviction, and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor’s appeal against sentence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Because the transcript has not yet been ordered in full, </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her</font> <font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel has not been able to give an opinion as to the merit </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of</font> <font face="Courier New" size="3">her appeal against conviction. The Crown takes the position </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there is no merit in it. Defence counsel points to his need </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to retain his own expert to provide an opinion on the expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence given at trial, and the possibility that the appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be based on fresh evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Under the circumstances, at the present time, the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot say that the appeal is not frivolous as required by s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">679(3)(a) of the Criminal Code.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The test in respect of a sentence appeal is set out in s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">679(4). There must be some merit in the appeal as leave is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required, there must be sufficient merit that detention would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause unnecessary hardship, the appellant must establish that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will surrender when required, and that her detention is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary in the public interest.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The crown opposes the application on the basis that it would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not be in the public interest to release the appellant at this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time. In particular she points to the fact that the proposed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surety, Mr. Winn was not forthright with the court on the bail</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hearing in respect of his knowledge of the appellant’s cocaine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">use, that he is involved in two businesses and will not be able</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to supervise the appellant, that he has a record for possession</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, and that he allowed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant to continue to use cocaine while she was on bail</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pending her trial, in breach of her recognizance and while he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her surety.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The crown also points to the fact that the presentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">report recommends that the appellant be incarcerated in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vanier Institute where she currently is in order to obtain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treatment for her drug addiction problem as she was unwilling to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">undergo treatment in the community. She has been in that facility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since August, and has  now enrolled in a substance abuse class</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which commenced on November 16, she has been in a life skills</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">course for one month, is seeing a psychiatrist once per week and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a social worker. Crown counsel also points to the fact that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant has received a misconduct in jail for possession of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marihuana, which reflects on her attitude toward drug</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rehabilitation as well as toward complying with any undertakings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she may give with respect to her release and  her rehabilitation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Defence counsel points out that because the child is now in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">care, there will be no opportunity for further harm to him if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant is released. He also points to the fact that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant now wishes to attend a residential program in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">community for her drug problem, which program apparently can only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be applied for from outside the institution. He also suggests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that as a condition of her release she be obliged to report back</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the court within two weeks to confirm that she is following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">through  with the drug treatment plan which she is now proposing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  He also says that the sentence of two years less a day is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particularly harsh for this offence and for a first time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offender, and that the factor of denunciation was over-emphasized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the court. He submits that a conditional sentence would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been appropriate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  I am not satisfied that bail should be granted in this case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if it is a sentence appeal only. In those circumstances the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal can be expedited and heard early in the new year. If the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction appeal is also going to proceed so that the matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be expedited, then the issue of bail may be revisited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">based on whatever submissions may be made to the court as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tests under s. 679(3)(a).</font></pre></td>
