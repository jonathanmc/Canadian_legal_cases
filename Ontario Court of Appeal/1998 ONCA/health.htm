    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>CARTHY J.A.:</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal arises from a determination of a question of law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by MacFarland J. pursuant to a motion under Rule 21 of the Rules</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Civil Procedure. The defendants sought an order declaring that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff had no legal basis for its cause of action for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of contract, as the action was based on restrictive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenants which were unenforceable. MacFarland J. held that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenants were unenforceable because the parties were not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carrying on the same businesses C the plaintiff is a corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">providing space and associated services and the defendants are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practising doctors.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The motion judge found herself bound by the judgment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McLennan J. in Carruthers Clinic Limited v. Herdman, [1956] O.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">770 (H.C.), which limits the enforcement of restrictive clauses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to parties in the same business. In her endorsement, MacFarland</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. wrote that &quot;[t]he Carruthers Case is still the law in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">province and that being so the non-competitive clauses are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unenforceable...&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The issue before this court is whether the Carruthers case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stands for so broad a prohibition against the enforcement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictive covenants, or alternatively, whether Carruthers was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongly decided and should be overruled.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant operates a health centre and entered into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreements with the two respondent doctors to grant them a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licence to practice within the centre on terms that the doctors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would receive a particular percentage of their gross receipts and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the balance would be retained by the appellant as a contribution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to its overhead and profit. Both agreements contain the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision which gives rise to the issue on this appeal:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.02 For a period of one year following the
          termination of the Agreement, in accordance
          with its terms, the Physician covenants and
          agrees not to conduct his practice or
          business or compete with the Manager either
          directly or indirectly in any manner or form
          by himself or in combination with others
          within an area of two and one-half mile
          radius from the Centre without having first
          obtained the written consent of the Manager.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The respondent doctors terminated the agreements and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement of claim alleges that each was, within the one year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following the termination, practicing medicine within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proscribed radius.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The Carruthers decision is similar to the instant case, both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involving an agreement between a clinic and a practicing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">physician containing a restrictive covenant which the physician</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was allegedly violating at the time of the institution of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings. There are distinguishing facts from those presented</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this appeal, but at the heart of the reasons McLennan J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">states his conclusion so bluntly that it stands squarely in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">path of these proceedings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  McLennan J. concludes at p.778 that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A covenantee is not entitled to restrain a
          covenantor from carrying on business other
          than that which the covenantee carries on:
          Rogers v. Maddocks, [1892] 3 Ch. 346; Bromley
          v. Smith, [1909] 2 K.B. 235; 32 Halsbury, 2nd
          ed. 1939, p.407, s.681; p.417, s.697.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Prior to making the above statement, McLennan J. states the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general principle quite accurately, in effect stating that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictive covenant is an unlawful restraint of trade unless the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff can show a legitimate business interest in restricting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant's right to practice, and that the restraint is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable. McLennan J.'s reasons at p.777 read as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The main question in connection with the
          defence that the covenant is an unlawful
          restraint of trade is whether the plaintiff
          had any interest in restricting the
          plaintiff's[sic] right to practise after
          termination of the agreement. The other
          question is, if the plaintiff had such an
          interest, were the restrictions as to time
          and space greater than was reasonably
          necessary for the protection of that
          interest?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In discussing the first of these
          questions there is no dispute about the
          proposition that an essential element in the
          justification of a covenant such as the one
          in this case, is that the person in whose
          favour it is imposed should have some
          business or proprietary interest which the
          law recognizes as requiring protection and
          that a mere restraint in gross is contrary to
          public policy and void: Nordenfelt v. The
          Maxim-Nordenfeldt Guns and Ammunition
          Company, Limited, [1894] A.C. 535; Mason v.
          Provident Clothing and Supply Company,
          Limited, [1913] A.C. 724; Herbert Morris,
          Limited v. Saxelby, [1916], 1 A.C. 688.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In determining whether there is any
          interest that requires protection the inquiry
          must in each case be, what the interests of
          the covenantee are that are to be protected
          and against what is he entitled to have them
          protected: Herbert Morris, Limited v.
          Saxelby, supra, at p.701.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  I do not question any of the above as a statement of the law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then and now. My concern is the leap from these general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">propositions to the narrow conclusion quoted above that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenantor must be carrying on the same business as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenantee in order for the covenants to be enforceable. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated above, McLennan J. finds support for that conclusion in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rogers v. Maddocks and Bromley v. Smith. I do not agree that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either of those cases justifies the narrowing of the focus to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what is really a very arbitrary rule that as a covenantor you do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not have a business interest to protect unless you are in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same business as the covenantee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In Rogers v. Maddocks, [1892] 3 Ch. 346 (C.A.), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff was a brewer and was held entitled to restrain a former</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">salesman from selling beer in a prescribed area. However, it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also held that it would not be reasonable for the brewer to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrain the salesman from selling aerated water, given that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had not been involved with that product while employed by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff. In making its determination of the business interests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the plaintiff and the reasonable restraints that could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposed upon the defendant without being oppressive and without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affecting the public interest, the Court of Appeal simply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analyzed the factual circumstances of the case. I find no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement, or even inference, in the reasons for judgment that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties must be in the same business. As in most such cases,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two parties were, generally, functioning in the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business. That, however, is not sufficient to create a rule of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In Bromley v. Smith, [1909] 2 K.B. 235, the plaintiff was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">baker who employed the defendant to sell baked goods and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purported to restrain him, after his employ, from selling similar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">goods and from being a restaurant keeper. The trial judge held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the agreement was unenforceable in so far as it sought to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrain the defendant from engaging in the business of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restaurant keeper because the provision went beyond what was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary for the protection of the business carried on by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Both these cases deal with whether the covenant was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable in all the circumstances. In the Bromley case it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered to be unreasonable to seek to restrain employment in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business other than that of the covenantee. In the Maddocks case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was considered unreasonable to restrain a former employee in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an area of business that he was not involved in while in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenantee's employ. However, these cases do not lay down a rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that in all cases it would be unreasonable to impose a restraint</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">simply because the two parties are in different businesses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] It is my conclusion that McLennan J. erred in the statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quoted above from p.778 of his reasons and, to that extent, his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment should be considered overruled. We cannot know how the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence will develop through discoveries and trial in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present case, but the pleadings leave it open to develop evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supporting a legitimate business reason for the plaintiff as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provider of space and facilities to protect itself from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">activities of the doctors after they leave the health clinic. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be for a trial judge to determine whether there is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legitimate business interest to protect and, if so, whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covenant is reasonable in scope and time.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] I would therefore set aside the order of MacFarland J. with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs here and below in the cause in the action. This form of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order of costs is made in recognition of the fact that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Carruthers case ostensibly stood in the way of the proceedings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and justified the motion and this appeal as legitimate steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decide the need for a trial. The questions posed on the motion as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to whether the plaintiff has a cause of action can only be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">answered after the evidence is considered at a trial.
