    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The court has delayed its decision in this matter to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider the reasons for judgment in Dawson et al. v. Rexcraft</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Storage and Warehouse Inc. et al. and Pacific &amp; Western Trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Company v. Carroll released on August 13, 1998 and the additional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submissions provided by the parties. In our view, this appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be dismissed, except with respect to the enforceability of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the third mortgages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  While there are superficial similarities between these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeals and the appeal in Rexcraft, we are satisfied that Cusson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. was correct in granting summary judgment allowing the claims</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the respondents, except with respect to the third mortgages,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and dismissing the counter-claims by the appellants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Fundamental to the success of the appellants’ case is their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allegation that there is a genuine issue for trial as to whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents were aware of the assumed breach of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Securities Act. They rely upon the acknowledged fact that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chick, a lawyer with Nelligan/Power, received a copy of the OSC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bulletin about a month before these transactions. Nelligan/Power</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not act for the Royal Bank and so his knowledge cannot affect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claim against it. The Royal Bank denied knowledge of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violation and there is no circumstantial evidence from which it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could be inferred that the Royal Bank had actual knowledge of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of the Securities Act as required by this court’s decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Armstrong v. R.J. Nichol Homes Ltd., [1997] O.J. No. 1545. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants argue that as a sophisticated financial institution,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Royal Bank ought to have known of the breach of the Act. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases in this court indicate that only actual knowledge (probably</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including wilful blindness) will suffice. The alleged violation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Securities Act had no impact on the enforceability of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loans granted by the Royal Bank.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We are also of the view that there is no evidence that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Household Realty had actual knowledge of the breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act. The uncontradicted evidence from Household is that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not have such knowledge (Affidavit of Paul Lavoie). Mr. Chick</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was extensively cross-examined by counsel for the respondents. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided no evidence that he was aware that the transactions may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have violated the Act or that he passed such information on to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Household. Even if he ought to have known that the Act applied,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that was not sufficient to render the second mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unenforceable. The appellants heavily rely on the reasons of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Borins J.A. respecting the appeal in Pacific &amp; Western Trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Company v. Carroll. They argue that there are striking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">similarities in the facts of Carroll and this appeal. We do not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agree. In particular, we note that in Carroll no evidence was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided by Standard Trust or Nelligan/Power in respect of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge of whether the promoters were in compliance with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act. See para. 117 of the reasons of Borins J.A. The alleged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violation of the Securities Act had no impact on the second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages provided by Household.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  We take a different view of the third (vendor take back)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages assigned by Reicor to Household Realty. There is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue for trial as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether Reicor was aware of the violation of the Act. If so, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction may be voidable. That issue can only be resolved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after a trial. See the discussion of this issue in Rexcraft by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Borins J.A. at paragraph 97 and by Rosenberg J.A. at paragraphs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">140 to 145. Accordingly, we would set aside that part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment granting summary judgment to Household Realty with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to the third mortgages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  We also agree that the trial judge properly dismissed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counter-claims by the appellants. The claims made in this case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are factually different from Rexcraft. There is no evidence that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents were parties to any misrepresentations by the Reid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">group. There is no person in these cases in a position similar to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that of Mr. Turk of the Bank of Nova Scotia in the Rexcraft case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellants also failed to produce any evidence from which it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could be said that the respondents were aware of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation. In particular, the material shows no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation of the present value of the property. The “soft</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs” are clearly set out in the material. If the promoters made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any misrepresentations of some other kind the respondents were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unaware of them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We are also of the view that there is no evidence that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents breached any duty of care to the appellants or that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they did anything to induce the appellants to enter into the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions. The evidence is all the other way and shows that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants had decided to enter into the transactions before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">becoming aware of the involvement of any of the respondents in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the financing. There is no evidence that the respondents favoured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the promoters at the expense of the appellants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In light of that conclusion, the question of equitable set-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">off does not arise and accordingly we express no opinion on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correctness of Cusson J.’s conclusion on that issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed except with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Household Realty third mortgages. The appellants were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsuccessful in respect of the appeal except in relation to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enforceability of the Household Realty third mortgages. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">represents a very small part of the case and in our view the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal.</font></pre></td>
