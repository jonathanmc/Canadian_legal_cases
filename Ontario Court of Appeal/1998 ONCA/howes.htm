[1]  The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing

death for which he received a sentence of four years and six

months, of failing to remain at the scene of the accident for

which he received a sentence of one year and driving while

disqualified for which he received a sentence of one year and six

months. The sentences were all consecutive to each other for a

total of seven years. He also was prohibited from driving for life.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant complains about the totality of the sentences

of seven years and suggests that the sentence for driving while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disqualified, at least, should be concurrent. Against this,

however, we have to consider the cumulative conduct of the

appellant that led to these sentences. The appellant had a

serious criminal record for driving offences. He refused to

address his severe drinking problem. He deliberately flouted the

order of the court disqualifying him from driving by acquiring a

false identity and he clearly left the scene of the accident in

order to avoid criminal liability.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In all these circumstances, the sentence is a fit one. Leave

to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
