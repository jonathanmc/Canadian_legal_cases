[1]  This is an application by counsel for the Attorney General
of Canada for an Order granting Forfeiture of the Recognizance of
Rui Qiang Huang in the amount of $200,000 or alternatively in the
amount that this Court considers proper pursuant to s.771 of the
Criminal Code of Canada. Section 771 of the Criminal Code
provides in part as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          s.771(2) Where subsection (1) has been
          complied with, the judge may, after giving
          the parties an opportunity to be heard, in
          his discretion grant or refuse the
          application and make any order with respect
          to the forfeiture of the recognizance that he
          considers proper.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  On July 8, 1995 the appellant was convicted at the City of
Toronto of (i) conspiracy to import heroin and (ii) conspiracy to
traffic heroin. On the 31st day of August, 1995 the appellant was
sentenced to fifteen years incarceration on each count with the
sentences to be served concurrently.
[3]  On July 12th, 1996 the appellant was released by the Order
of a judge of this Court pursuant to s.679(5)(b) of the Criminal
Code, pending the hearing of the appeal. Conditions of the Order
required the appellant to report upon release weekly to a
reporting centre in Toronto and for the appellant to reside at a
specific address. Pursuant to the Order the appellant also
entered into a recognizance in the amount of $200,000, with one
surety, Allen Yuk Ho Yu.
[4]  It is believed that the appellant fled the jurisdiction
shortly after his last report to the reporting centre on August
12, 1997.
[5]  In an affidavit filed on this application, the surety
deposed as follows:

          That, because I was living in Ottawa and the
          Appellant was living in Toronto, I would not
          have agreed to act as the Appellant's surety
          if it had not been for the agreement of the
          Appellant's brother to assist me in
          supervising the Appellant. As I stated in my
          first affidavit as a proposed surety, sworn
          July 27, 1995, &quot;I am content to act as a
          surety for the Applicant/Appellant and have
          been assured by the Applicant/Appellant's
          brother that he will assist me in the
          supervision of the Applicant/Appellant,&quot;
          attached to this my affidavit and marked
          Exhibit &quot;C.1&quot; is a true copy of an affidavit
          of the Appellant's brother filed with this
          Honourable Court in support of the
          Appellant's application for bail pending
          appeal. Moreover, I would not have agreed to
          act as the Appellant's surety if it had not
          been for my regular attendance in Toronto for
          business purposes, which gave me the
          opportunity to supervise the Appellant
          personally.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  The affidavit filed by the appellant's brother in support of
the appellant's application for bail pending an appeal stated as
follows:

          It is my further understanding that if this
          Honourable Court should release my brother he
          intends to return to live with his wife and
          child at 32 Windstanly Crescent, Scarborough.
          Further, I and Mr. Yu propose to be part of a
          network of support for my brother to ensure
          that he abides by any conditions of release
          that this Honourable Court may see fit to
          impose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The surety further deposed that his business dealings with
the appellant's brother brought him to Toronto on a weekly basis
and that he arranged with the appellant and his brother to have
lunch with him every week. He also deposed that on the first two
occasions that the appellant had to report to the police that he
drove him to the reporting centre to &quot;make sure that he knew the
location and understood the procedure.&quot;
[8]  The weekly meetings with the surety, the appellant and his
brother continued to the beginning of August, 1997 when the
surety was told by the appellant's brother that the appellant was
no longer able to meet for the weekly lunch because of the fact
that the appellant and his wife had had a second child and the
appellant was &quot;busy taking care of the children.&quot; The surety
continued to meet with the appellant's brother on a weekly basis
and the surety would contact the appellant or his wife by
telephone, also on a weekly basis. The surety deposed that &quot;it
was only on October 1, 1997,&quot; when he &quot;received a phone call and
a letter from the Appellant's counsel&quot; that he &quot;learned that the
Appellant had not reported to the police since August 12, 1997
and that no one was living at his address.&quot; The surety further
deposed that as of October 1, 1997 he had not spoken to the
appellant personally for approximately four weeks.
[9]  The Metropolitan Toronto Police bail file listing indicated
that the appellant's weekly reporting ceased as of August 19,
1997 and it is reasonable to infer that the surety had probably
not spoken to the appellant since shortly after August 12, 1997.
In any event, the record is unclear as to whether or not there
was any communication between the surety, the appellant or the
appellant's brother after August 12, 1997.
[10] In the affidavit of the surety sworn in July of 1995, the
surety stated that his principal assets were an equity of
$220,000 in a combined house and business premises in Ottawa, as
well as a $70,000 equity in some condominium properties. The
surety did not reveal prior to the appellant entering into his
recognizance of July 12, 1996 that the surety had placed a
$300,000 charge on his premises in Ottawa, thereby effectively
wiping out his equity.
[11] It is agreed by counsel for the Crown and the surety that
the decision of R. v. Andrews (1975), C.R.N.S. Vol.34 344 sets
out the proper principles in relation to the exercise of judicial
discretion in a matter such as this. Furlong C.J. quotes with
approval the decision of Lord Denning M.R. in the English case of
Regina v. Southampton Justices, [1975] 2 All. E.R. 1073, where
Lord Denning stated in part at pp.1077-78 as follows:

          By what principles are the justices to be
          guided? They ought, I think, to consider to
          what extent the surety was at fault. If he or
          she connived at the disappearance of the
          accused man, or aided it or abetted it, it
          would be proper to forfeit the whole of the
          sum. If he or she was wanting in due
          diligence to secure his appearance, it might
          be proper to forfeit the whole or a
          substantial part of it, depending on the
          degree of fault. If he or she was guilty of
          no want of diligence and used every effort to
          secure the appearance of the accused man, it
          might be proper to remit it entirely.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] It is submitted on behalf of the Crown that there was a
failure of due diligence on the part of the surety which
commenced in July or early August, 1997 when he stopped seeing
the appellant personally. The Crown submits that the surety
should have gone to the appellant's home when the appellant
stopped attending the weekly luncheon meetings. Visits to the
appellant's home would probably have alerted the surety in August
that the appellant was no longer living at the address, and this
in turn would have reasonably required the surety to inform the
police at the reporting centre. It is therefore submitted that
the surety failed the second test under Andrews.
[13] Counsel for the surety submits that the material before the
judge who released the appellant on bail indicated that the
surety would be relying on the assistance of the appellant's
brother. Furthermore, it is submitted that it was reasonable for
the surety to agree to a &quot;new system&quot; during the summer of 1997
when the appellant was unable to meet the surety by reason of his
child-caring responsibilities. Counsel submits that the fact that
the appellant had observed his bail conditions for more than a
year was a reason for him to trust the &quot;new system.&quot;
[14] Counsel for the surety also submits that there was a duty on
the part of the police to notify the surety when the appellant
failed to attend at the reporting centre on August 19, 1997. It
is also submitted on behalf of the surety that there was no nexus
between the actions or lack of actions on behalf of the surety
and the flight of the appellant. Furthermore the police, by
August 19, 1997 had the same information that could have been
provided by the surety had he attended the appellant's residence
on a weekly basis in August of 1997.
[15] Counsel for the surety acknowledges that the present
precarious financial position of the surety is not a factor to be
considered in relation to this application.

CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] It is my view that it was unreasonable of the surety not to
have maintained direct personal contact with the appellant after
the arrival of the appellant's second child and the
implementation of the &quot;new system.&quot; It is a matter of speculation
as to whether a higher level of diligence would have made a
difference in relation to the appellant fleeing the jurisdiction.
However, it is unrealistic to require the Crown to establish a
link or nexus between a lack of due diligence on the party of the
surety and the breach of conditions of a recognizance by an
appellant.
[17] At the same time, I am of the opinion that it was
unreasonable of the police authorities not to inform the surety
of the failure of the appellant to attend the reporting centre.
[18] I am also of the view that the surety demonstrated a degree
of bad faith in placing the $300,000 encumbrance on his property
shortly before the appellant entered into his recognizance on
July 12, 1996.
[19] There is, of course, a major public interest component in
requiring the surety to exercise a reasonably high level of due
diligence in securing the appellant's residence within the
jurisdiction pending the hearing of the appeal. In my opinion,
the requisite due diligence was not demonstrated in the weeks
prior to the appellant's disappearance.
[20] There will therefore be a Forfeiture of the Recognizance of
Rui Qiang Huang in the amount of $75,000.</font></pre></td>
