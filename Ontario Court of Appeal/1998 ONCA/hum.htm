    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant has raised a number of grounds of appeal
challenging the correctness of the trial judge’s findings
with respect to equalization of net family assets and the
respondent’s inability to make any spousal support payments.
In our view, the most significant of these grounds relates
to the trial judge’s valuation of the respondent’s one-half
interest in a restaurant business which he and his brother
own and operate.

The trial judge rejected as unfounded the appellant’s
allegation that the respondent and his brother routinely
siphoned cash from the restaurant business and falsified
their business records and income tax returns.  This finding
was significant because it had a direct bearing on the
respondent’s asset base for equalization purposes, as well
as his ability to make support payments.

In concluding, as he did, that the respondent was an honest
business man and that his income tax returns accurately
reflected his earnings, the trial judge failed to consider a
compelling body of circumstantial evidence which lent
credence to the appellant’s allegations.  That body of
evidence centred around the respondent’s lifestyle and the
likelihood of his being able to afford that lifestyle on an
income which, according to his tax returns for the years
1991 through 1996, consistently fell below the poverty line.

To be precise, even taking into account the appellant’s part-
time earnings, absent some other source of income, it is
difficult to comprehend how the respondent could somehow
have supported a wife and two children, maintained a
substantial mortgage on the family home, leased an expensive
car, purchased a costly piano and found $4,000 in cash to
buy a Rolex watch for the appellant.

No where in his reasons did the trial judge address this
troublesome and unexplained contradiction.  Had he done so,
he might well have come to a different conclusion about the
respondent’s income from the restaurant and this in turn
could have had a significant impact on his findings with
respect to the equalization of net family assets and the
respondent’s ability to make spousal support payments.
It follows, in our view, that the judgment under appeal
cannot stand.  Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set
aside the trial judgment and order a new trial.

Under the circumstances, we are of the view that the
appellant should have her costs of the appeal and the costs
of the trial should be left to the discretion of the new
trial judge.</font></pre></td>
