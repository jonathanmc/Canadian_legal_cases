    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The parties' first lease was for office space, for a period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from February 1, 1983 to December 31, 1983. It contained an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automatic renewal provision which stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          PROVIDED, however, that unless notice of
          cancellation by registered mail is given by
          either party to the other party at least
          three (3) calendar months prior to the date
          of expiration of this Lease, namely prior to
          the 1st day of October 1983, this Lease shall
          be considered as renewed for one (1) year and
          thereafter shall continue in force from year
          to year subject to all the covenants,
          agreements, provisos, terms and conditions
          herein contained, unless terminated as herein
          provided.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  A further lease was entered into for dock space on September</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1, 1987 for a four month period. It too contained an automatic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewal clause, which stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          PROVIDED always and it is mutually agreed
          that at the end of the initial term of this
          lease and at the end of each renewal term
          thereafter the term shall automatically be
          extended for a further year unless at least
          three (3) months before the end of the then
          current term, either the Lessor or the Lessee
          shall give to the other notice by registered
          letter terminating this lease at the end of
          the then current term.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  In 1988 and 1989, both leases were amended but the automatic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewal provisions were unchanged.



[4]  On August 1, 1991, the parties entered into an Amending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Agreement amending both leases for a three year term ending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 30, 1994. The rent was increased and the location of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises was changed. The lessee, Roadway, was given an option to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renew each lease at a higher rent for a further two years, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If the Lessee pays the rent and performs the
          material covenants contained in the Lease,
          the Lessee shall have the option of renewing
          the Lease for a further period of two years
          subject to all the conditions contained in
          the Lease excepting this option to renew and
          excepting rent which will be ... payable in
          12 monthly instalments ... during each lease
          year. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  No method or time limit for exercising this option was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stipulated. There was no reference to an automatic renewal in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this Amending Agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The two original leases, plus a third lease entered into for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a temporary period in 1992 with respect to additional space, were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all amended on July 18, 1994 by a new Amending Agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increasing the rents, and due to expire on November 30, 1995.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Roadway was given an option to renew all three leases for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further year on the same terms except as to renewal. The renewal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">option is expressed as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Provided the Lessee is not in breach of any
          term of this Agreement, the Office Lease, the
          Dock Lease, or the Additional Dock Lease the
          Lessee shall have the option to further renew
          the term of the Office Lease, the Dock Lease
          and the Additional Dock Lease for a further
          term of one (1) year. Any such renewal shall
          be upon the same terms and conditions as are
          contained in this agreement save as to
          renewal. Provided that in order to exercise
          the option the Lessee shall be required to
          give the Lessor notice thereof in writing by
          September 30, 1995, failing which this option
          will become null and void. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  This Amending Agreement stated that the terms of all three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases would continue to apply &quot;except those [terms] amended by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this agreement.&quot; The form of renewal was clearly one of the terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amended by the Agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In September 1995, the lessor, Interport, reminded Roadway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the automatic renewal provisions in the original leases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Interport then formally advised Roadway by letter that the 1983</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and 1987 leases were automatically renewed for a further year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since neither party had given notice to terminate in accordance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the renewal terms in those original leases. Roadway, who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took the position that the automatic renewal provisions had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">replaced by the renewal option provisions, responded by informing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Interport that, pursuant to the July 1994 Amending Agreement, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not intend to exercise its option to renew the leases and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would vacate the premises at the end of the term. Roadway vacated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the premises on November 23, 1995.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Boland J. agreed with Interport that the automatic renewal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions in the 1983 office lease and the 1987 dock lease</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continued to be valid and binding since they were never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically deleted in subsequent Amending Agreements.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, these leases were found to be automatically renewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a further one year period, making Roadway liable to Interport</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for rent in the amount of $414,776.24 plus interest and costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fixed in the amount of $2,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] With respect, we are unable to agree with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation. The Amending Agreements of 1991 and 1994</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contained options to renew different from the automatic renewal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions in the original leases. It was not necessary for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Amending Agreements to delete the automatic renewal provisions by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specific reference; they were deleted by necessary implication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">once new terms for renewal were agreed upon. A provision that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lease is automatically renewed unless terminated by either party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(on 90 days' notice), is fundamentally different from a renewal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision that gives an option to renew only to one party (on 60</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">days' notice). The first is an automatic renewal unless</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated; the latter is an automatic termination unless</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Boland J., and dismiss Interport's application, with costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both of the appeal and of the original hearing.</font></pre></td>
