    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    The trial judge found that &quot;as of November 8 the existing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deal between the plaintiff and the purchaser was dead&quot;.  She also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that what killed the deal, amongst other matters, was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's failure to acknowledge that the option to renew the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">banquet hall lease extended to the restaurant lease.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    In our view, the trial judge erred in relying on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;failure&quot;.  While it would have been helpful had the landlord</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmed that the option to renew was applicable to both the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">banquet hall lease and the restaurant lease, there was no legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation whatsoever on its part to do so.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    More important, the plaintiff tenant never made it clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the defendant landlord that the deal had to close on November</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8, failing which the landlord would face a claim for damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    That was not done and the tenant continued to negotiate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the landlord after November 8 as if the deal was still on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foot.  On November 9, the tenant's solicitors advised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's solicitors by fax that the closing &quot;has been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rescheduled for November 14&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The landlord's solicitors responded on November 10</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicating, amongst other matters, that they were dealing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly with the purchaser's solicitor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    On November 11, the tenant's solicitor wrote to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's solicitors and stated &quot;I am advised that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchaser's are not prepared to wait beyond November 14, 1994&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    In fact, the tenant's solicitors had been advised on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 9 by the purchaser's solicitors that &quot;our clients [the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchasers] have not given us instructions to extend the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">closing...to November 14, 1994&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    It is not clear when, if ever, this information was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conveyed to the landlord or its solicitors.  It is clear,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, that as early as November 10 the landlord or at least</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his solicitors, were dealing with the purchaser's solicitors and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were attempting to sort out their respective priorities.  It was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this process that the landlord withdrew the condition, imposed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by it earlier, that the exclusive use provision in the lease be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">waived as a condition of the landlord's consent to assignment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lease to the purchaser.  The tenant's solicitors were advised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this on November 15.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    On November 18, the tenant's solicitors advised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">landlord's solicitors that the tenant and the purchaser had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreed to comply with all of the landlord's remaining terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting assignment of the lease.  The tenant's solicitors went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on to ask the landlord to add to his consent to the assignment, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmation that the tenant's option to renew the banquet hall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lease also applied to the restaurant premises.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   The landlord's solicitors responded on the same day,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 18, to the effect that the proposed addition to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent was not acceptable and that there was no option to renew</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the restaurant lease.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]   On November 25, the landlord's solicitors advised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenant's solicitors that the landlord had executed the assignment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and all that was required was confirmation from the tenant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors that the proposed transaction was to go forward.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]   Further negotiations took place and a closing occurred on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 22.  Under the arrangement as closed, the terms of both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leases were extended.  The exclusivity clause was not amended as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such, but a clause was added to permit the landlord to lease to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doughnut shop to be built on the landlord's premises.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]   The tenant's position on the appeal was that the deal was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in fact dead either on November 8 or shortly thereafter.  He said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had to bring in a new real estate agent to revive the deal or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to make a new one.  He suggested that the agent did put together</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a new arrangement but the cost to the tenant was $50,000 by way</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of reduction of the sale price.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]   The tenant may very well have lost $50,000 but there is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indication that the landlord was ever warned that this might</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occur or that it had occurred.  From the landlord's perspective,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the negotiations went on from late October to well into December.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Neither the risk nor the fact of a $50,000 reduction in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchase price was brought home to the landlord.  The major</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty and delay appear to have been caused by the tenant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors on November 18, by adding to the matters in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contention, the question whether the option to renew the banquet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hall lease was also applicable to the restaurant lease.  In that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regard, there was no legal obligation on the part of the landlord</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to give any such assurance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]   The landlord's appeal should therefore be allowed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]   Damages were awarded below to the tenant as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (a) Reduction of purchase price                  $50,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (b) Fees of new real estate agen     t           $ 5,350</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (d) Reduction of legal fees paid by tenant on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           behalf of landlord                           $ 3,100</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (e) Overpayment by tenant to landlord by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">           reason of use of wrong multiplier         $14,922.40</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (f) Overpayment of taxes by tenant            <u>$ 4,046.08</u></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                   Total                             $80,418.48

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]   The only items affected by this decision are items (1) and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2) totalling $55,350.  These amounts must be deducted from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's recovery.  The balance of his judgment remains</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unchanged.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]   Insofar as interest is concerned, the trial judge allowed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pre-judgment interest &quot;at the prevailing rate&quot; from January 16,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995.  That appears to have been the date of an offer to settle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the plaintiff.  The statement of claim was issued on December</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22, 1994.  Having regard to the items upon which the plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has been successful, we see no reason why pre-judgment interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;at the prevailing rate&quot; should not be payable from that date.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19]   The trial judge awarded costs to the plaintiff, on a party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and party basis to January 16, 1995, and thereafter on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor and client basis, by reason of an offer to settle made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the plaintiff on that date.  The result of the decision of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court is that the plaintiff's success has been substantially</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited; the major part of the plaintiff's claim has failed.  At</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same time, the plaintiff has had some success.  In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, the appropriate disposition would be to award the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff his costs of the action to and including the trial on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party and party basis and to award the defendant its costs of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal, also on a party and party basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]   The trial judge found that a landlord may be sued by a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenant for damages for unreasonably withholding consent to an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assignment of lease.  It was not necessary to deal with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question in order to dispose of the appeal and accordingly, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make no comment on it.
