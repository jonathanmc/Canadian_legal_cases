    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The issue in this appeal was whether Charbonneau J. erred in
his conclusion that the mother, who had custody of the three
young girls of the marriage, should continue to have custody of
them and that she be permitted to move with them from Cornwall to
Hamilton.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant submitted, among other things, that
insufficient weight was given to the wishes of the children, how
each parent was meeting the needs of the children including
facilitating contact with the other parent, and the children's
relationship with their father and his family. The reasons of
Charbonneau J. indicate that he considered these factors. He
found that there was no sound evidentiary basis on which to
conclude that the children did not wish to remain in the custody
of their mother and that, in any event, their views could not be
a determining factor in view of their age. He further found that
the mother was best suited to continue being the primary
caregiver of the children and that she provided good care to
them. He acknowledged the children's close relationship to their
father and the fact that a move to Hamilton would have an impact
on the access terms but was of the opinion that alternative terms
could ensure the continuance of meaningful contact with the
father and his extended family. We cannot agree that Charbonneau
J. gave insufficient weight to the factors raised by the
appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appeal is dismissed. Costs of the appeal including the
motion to expedite to the respondent on a party and party basis
fixed at $5,000.</font></pre></td>
