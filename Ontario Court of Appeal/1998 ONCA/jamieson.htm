</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Counsel for the appellant submit that the trial judge erred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in respect of the three factors that he used to find that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was guilty of dangerous driving causing death, namely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">speed, point of impact and impairment. With respect to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence of speed and point of impact, counsel submit that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge either misapprehended the expert evidence or erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">giving it any weight. However, the trial judge’s findings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting speed and point of impact were primarily based upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence of Mr. MacDonald. The trial judge accepted this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence which, as he pointed out, was uncontradicted. In our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, the evidence of MacDonald is, together with the undisputed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">physical evidence of the scene, sufficient to sustain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">verdict.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  MacDonald's evidence was that the appellant never came out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the curve, that he came &quot;straight across the road&quot; at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Valade car, that the accident happened well over on the side of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the road for southbound traffic, and that he was “driving higher</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than the speed limit”. Each aspect of this is supported to one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">degree or another by the physical evidence. The point of impact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is established by the marks made by the Valade car and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dragging marks made by the appellant’s motor vehicle after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impact. The extent and nature of the damage to the truck are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistent, even to a layman, with speed. It was conceded by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's counsel on appeal that it was a high-speed collision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Mr. Addario, who was not counsel at trial, also argues that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge erred in failing to find that there was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violation of the appellant’s rights under s. 9 of the Charter of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rights and Freedoms and in failing to exclude the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">observations of the appellant’s conduct at the hospital. Although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge excluded the evidence of the results of the blood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">test, he relied upon the appellant’s conduct at the hospital as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that he was impaired.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Counsel for the appellant at trial made no application to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclude the evidence of the appellant’s conduct at the hospital.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The written notice of application does not refer to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. In his oral submissions, trial counsel limited his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application to the results of the testing of the blood samples.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Counsel for the respondent argues that in those circumstances the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant is precluded from raising this issue for the first time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on appeal. She submits that the exclusion of this evidence raises</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues of fact that were not explored at trial because they were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not relevant to a determination of the only issue raised at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial, the admissibility of the results of the testing of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">blood samples. We agree.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The exclusion of the hospital conduct depended primarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon a finding that the appellant had been arbitrarily detained.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">While Crown counsel conceded at trial that the appellant had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detained, there was no concession that any detention was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arbitrary. The burden was on the appellant to prove an arbitrary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention. The trial judge found that the appellant’s rights</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under s. 8 of the Charter were infringed by the unlawful seizure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the blood samples. However, he made no finding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was arbitrarily detained or that his rights under s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">10(b) were infringed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge also made a finding, which is supported by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence, that there was a “factual basis for the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taking [the appellant] to the hospital for medical treatment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">observation”. In our view, in light of that finding, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possibility that the appellant was arbitrarily detained would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">depend on the appellant at least establishing that he did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agree to go to the hospital for treatment. In this respect, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">see a distinction between mere acquiescence in the face of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police request for assistance, information or evidence from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motorist as, for example, in R. v. Wills (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">529 (Ont. C.A.) at 541 and R. v. Mellenthin (1992), 76 C.C.C.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3d) 481 (S.C.C.) and failure to raise any objection in a case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where, as found by the trial judge, the officer is offering</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assistance to the motorist. In the latter circumstance, there is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no question of waiver of constitutional rights and the burden is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the accused to establish the detention was arbitrary. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant did not testify and what evidence there is on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record shows that the appellant raised no objection to being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken to the hospital. Moreover, had the issue been properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised at trial, it is possible that the Crown could have called</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other evidence. In particular, the Crown may have chosen to lead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence of Sergeant Vanderwoude, who spoke to the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shortly before he left with Constable Amirault for the hospital.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Even if the appellant had been able to establish a violation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of s. 9 of the Charter, it would have been open to the Crown to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resist the exclusion of the hospital conduct evidence by showing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, inter alia, its admission would not affect the fairness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial because its discovery was inevitable. The Crown was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">denied that opportunity because the issue was not raised at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  For all these reasons, it is our view that this is not a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proper case to allow the appellant to raise this issue for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first time on appeal. It follows that the trial judge did not err</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in using this evidence. In any event, as indicated earlier, it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">our view that the finding of dangerous driving is supported by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the other evidence, especially the evidence of Mr. MacDonald: see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R. v. Reed (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
