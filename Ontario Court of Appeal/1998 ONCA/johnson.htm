    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  In this court, counsel for the appellant sought to throw
doubt upon the accuracy of the test results reported by Dr.
Christiane Ayotte, Chief of the Doping Control Laboratory,
showing that the appellant tested positive for a banned
substance. These test results were the basis upon which the
appellant received his life time suspension. Had the appellant
taken advantage of the appeal procedures available to him at the
time the tests were conducted, the accuracy of the results could
have been reviewed and evaluated. Moreover, Dr. Ayotte swore an
affidavit in support of her findings that was filed before the
motions judge. There was no cross-examination on that affidavit,
nor on the affidavit of any expert who gave evidence in this
area. Accordingly, the argument now made in this court does not
appear to have been presented below and we are not prepared to
give effect to it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In our opinion, the very full reasons of the motions judge
reflect no error in principle and the findings which she made are
fully supported by the evidence before her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
