[1]  The circumstances that give rise to this appeal are most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfortunate. In the first place, issue is taken with the reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the trial judge as to whether the parties had agreed to expand</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issues directed to be tried by Weekes J. which related to an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">October 22, 1991, will to encompass what has been described as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Astore form@ will of August 1991, a 1985 will which had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lost, a 1982 will, and an inter vivos transfer to the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Treeview Drive property in August of 1991. We are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied that the conduct of the parties in conducting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hearing amounted to an enlargement of the issues that were to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined. Certainly, they are inextricably intertwined and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resolving them in other than a single proceeding would make no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sense at all.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  As to the merits of the issue whether the deceased had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approved and understood the contents of the October 22, 1991 will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and whether it was procured by undue influence, we acknowledge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some inconsistencies in the trial judge=s reasons, but her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimate findings, at least as to the testatrix=s lack of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understanding and approval of the will=s contents, are supported</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the evidence. This leaves only one concern and that is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an earlier 1982 will, which was not challenged, was revoked by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two 1991 wills which the trial judge was not prepared to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uphold as valid. Once again, the record does raise concern but it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is apparent that the missing 1985 will, which the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found as a fact to have been drafted by a Polish speaking lawyer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and properly executed, would have the effect of revoking the 1982</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The result is an intestacy. This is consistent with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result which the trial judge found was desired by the testatrix.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Her sons would be treated equally. Accordingly, in the unusual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of this case, we are not prepared to interfere with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judgment below. The appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
