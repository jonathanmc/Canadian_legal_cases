    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>FINLAYSON J.A.:</b>

[1]  This is an appeal by Allstate Insurance Company of Canada,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the judgment of Lederman J., of the Ontario Court (General</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division), directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sum of $500,000, post-judgment interest and costs. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents cross-appeal and ask that the judgment be varied to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award pre-judgment interest on the sum of $1,000,000 and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs be assessed on a solicitor client basis from September 21,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1993. In addition, the respondents move, if necessary, for leave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to amend their statement of claim to include a claim in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligence as against the defendant in the original action.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The action in appeal arose out of the disposition of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal injury action in which the respondents, Stella Kalkinis,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the wife of Christos Kalkinis, and her children sued Christos</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kalkinis, pursuant to s. 258(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1990, c. I. 8, for extensive injuries Stella Kalkinis received on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">October 2, 1989 while a passenger in a Chevrolet Caprice owned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and driven by her husband and insured by Allstate. That action,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">founded on the negligence of Christos Kalkinis, was settled on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the basis of a judgment issued in favour of the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against Christos Kalkinis in the amount of $1,000,000. Allstate,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as the automobile insurer of Christos Kalkinis, paid $500,000 in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect of that judgment on behalf of Christos Kalkinis on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis that $500,000 was the limit of coverage under the policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issued to Christos Kalkinis and in effect at the time of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident. Asserting that the limits of coverage were $1,000,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and not $500,000, the successful plaintiffs in the personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injury action commenced the action in appeal against Allstate for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a declaration that its policy of insurance on the Caprice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile owned by Christos Kalkinis is for $1,000,000&quot; and for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payment by Allstate &quot;of the difference between the $1,000,000 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any moneys already paid under the policy&quot;. The plaintiffs also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought pre-judgment interest, punitive and exemplary damages, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Background

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The son-in-law of Christos Kalkinis, Robert Stephan,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operated a used car dealership and had dealt in the course of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business with the Allstate agent, Alex Vezer. In 1986, when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Christos Kalkinis purchased a vehicle, a 1982 Datsun, from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Stephan, he was introduced by Stephan to the Allstate agent Vezer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and obtained a policy of automobile insurance from Allstate with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability coverage of $500,000 on that vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In July 1987, Christos Kalkinis purchased a second vehicle,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a 1978 Mercury Cougar, from Stephan, who then arranged through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Allstate agent Vezer to have coverage placed on that vehicle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with liability coverage of $1,000,000 resulting in the coverage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the 1982 Datsun vehicle being automatically increased to that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same amount. In October 1987, Christos Kalkinis replaced the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mercury Cougar with a 1978 Chevrolet Caprice and Stephan advised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Allstate agent Vezer accordingly of this change.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On June 6, 1988, in accordance with instructions received</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from Stephan on behalf of Christos Kalkinis, the Allstate agent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vezer reduced the limits of liability coverage provided under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy issued to Christos Kalkinis in respect of the Datsun and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Caprice vehicles from $1,000,000 to $500,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On August 24, 1989, the Allstate agent Vezer met Christos</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kalkinis at a new home Kalkinis had purchased in Aurora for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose of assessing the home and placing appropriate homeowner's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance on it. Stephan was not a participant in that meeting as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was out of the country at that time. In the course of that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting, the Allstate agent Vezer took the opportunity to advise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Christos Kalkinis that, given he was now residing outside of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Metropolitan Toronto in a less populated area, he could obtain a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">higher limit of  $1,000,000 liability coverage for his motor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles under the Allstate policy for the same premium he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paying for his existing limit of coverage of $500,000. Without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the involvement of Stephan, Christos Kalkinis agreed to increase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his coverage from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in response to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Allstate agent's suggestion. The Allstate agent then placed a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request with Allstate showing both a change of address for Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kalkinis as well as a request for an increase of the limits of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability coverage under the auto policy from $500,000 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$1,000,000 effective August 25, 1989.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  While Alex Vezer, the Allstate agent, testified at trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he had no independent recollection of receiving any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone call or calls from the insured or any member of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">family, the Christos Kalkinis file at Allstate revealed a request</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form in Vezer's handwriting which stated that the policyholder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had called on September 7, 1989 and wanted to cancel the increase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in his third party liability coverage, effective August 25, 1989.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Since this instruction followed so closely on the request for an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase in the coverage, no change in the coverage was made and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it remained at $500,000. Because the Kalkinis policy was to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expire on October 20, 1989, the Allstate computer automatically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">printed out a renewal offer on September 20th and it was mailed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on September 21, 1989 directed to the current address of Christos</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kalkinis in Aurora and showing coverage for the Caprice vehicle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the term October 20, 1989 to October 20, 1990, in the amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of $500,000. The accident took place on October 2, 1989, with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limits remaining at $500,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The insured Kalkinis and all members of his family,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including his son-in-law Stephan, testified and denied making any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone calls to Allstate on any subject ; in addition,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Christos Kalkinis denied receiving notice of the renewal of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy. The trial judge rejected the evidence of Stephan at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">least, and concluded that Christos Kalkinis did receive the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewal offer from Allstate at his address in Aurora before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident occurred. He found &quot;in all probability&quot; that Stephan,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after his return from Australia on September 5, 1989, and upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">learning of the increase in the insurance coverage to $1,000,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during his absence, had contacted the Allstate agent on behalf of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Christos Kalkinis to cancel the request for the increase in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage and leave the limits of coverage at $500,000. Stephan's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motivation was to secure a reduced premium that would attach to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$500,000 policy in Aurora as opposed to Metropolitan Toronto.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Acting on those instructions, Allstate sent a renewal policy for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$500,000 to the insured. The trial judge held that &quot;it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficult to accept that Christos [the insured] did not receive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the renewal notice&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            (a)     Was the trial judge entitled to find
          liability on a basis that was not pleaded?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            (b)     In any event, was there any basis for finding
          on this record that the Allstate agent had breached a
          duty of care to the insured with respect to providing
          him with information as to the availability and
          suitability of coverage underwritten by Allstate?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The only live issue in this action as pleaded was whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Allstate had received and acted upon instructions from the son-in-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law of the insured Christos Kalkinis to cancel the increase in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage originally agreed upon with Vezer and maintain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage at $500,000. After closely reviewing all of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence, the trial judge found in favour of the appellant on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this issue. This should have been the end of the matter. However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the basis of an argument raised by counsel for the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the first time after both parties had closed their respective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases, the trial judge embarked upon an analysis of the duty that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the agent of the appellant had to the insured to give him advice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about a prudent level of coverage. Relying upon Fletcher et al.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Manitoba Public Insurance Co., (1990) 74 D.L.R. (4th) 636</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(S.C.C.), the trial judge found Allstate's agent negligent for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not having advised its insured that the cancellation was not in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his best interests and was inappropriate in the circumstances,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stating: &quot;Specifically, he should have advised him that, based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recent damage awards, $500,000 was insufficient coverage for his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirements&quot;. The trial judge concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               With the appropriate advice, one cannot
          conclude that Christos would not have kept
          this coverage at $1,000,000. Accordingly, the
          plaintiffs will have judgment against the
          defendant for $500,000.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In my opinion, this fresh analysis was highly prejudicial to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant. The parties, certainly the appellant, were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding on the basis that this was an action in contract on an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance policy. The record had been developed within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confines of the cause of action as pleaded. Accordingly, it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impermissible for the trial judge to entertain an argument</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">founded on totally different legal principles.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In this court, the respondents sought to remedy this problem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by moving to amend their pleading to allege in the alternative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Allstate &quot;through its agent Alex Vezer was negligent in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failing to alert, advise and promptly explain to Christos</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kalkinis the adequacy of the insurance coverage, the foreseeable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">risk of the reduced coverage and the deficiency in the policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage. In addition, the [respondents] state that [Allstate]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has breached and failed to fulfil the duty of care required of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">skilled agent&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] This amendment is exactly what is required to enable the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court to deal with the disposition of this case at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, it is much too late. It has long been established that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties to a legal suit are entitled to have a resolution of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their differences on the basis of the issues joined in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings: see Rule 25.06. The trial judge cannot make a finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of liability and award damages against a defendant on a basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that was not pleaded in the statement of claim because it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deprives the defendant of the opportunity to address that issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the evidence presented at trial. Any amendment to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings to have them conform to the evidence after the parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have closed their cases is a matter for discretion but should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only be exercised where no prejudice results that cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compensated for by costs or an adjournment: see Rules 26.01, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">26.02(c).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] An example of a case where leave to amend pleadings was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">denied on appeal is found in  Sutton, Mitchell &amp; Simpson Limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Kelore Mines Limited, [1956] O.W.N. 648 (Ont. C.A.). There,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff drilling company asserted in its pleadings that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had entered into an oral  contract with the defendant requiring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant to pay for its drilling services on the basis of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quantum meruit. Particulars were provided on this basis, and in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its statement of defence the defendant denied the existence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any such contract. At trial, the trial judge did not determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether a contract existed as pleaded, but rather found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was a contract obliging the defendant to pay the plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its drilling costs plus 10%. Laidlaw J. A., speaking for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court stated at 649:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    With great respect, it is our
          opinion, that the learned trial judge did not
          direct his mind to the issues joined on the
          pleadings and the issue which the parties
          sought to have determined. He directed his
          mind to an altogether different issue and he
          decided an issue which was not before him for
          trial.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In this Court the plaintiff moved
          to have the statement of claim amended so as
          to make it conform with the judgment as
          delivered and with the evidence given at
          trial. Counsel for the appellant quite
          properly takes the position that the
          amendment would create an issue which he did
          not endeavour to meet at trial, to which he
          did not direct his cross-examination, and
          which is so different in character and in
          substance that an injustice would be done to
          his client by the proposed amendment, and
          that he ought to have an opportunity to meet
          a new issue fully and squarely. The question
          whether or not an amendment should be
          permitted is a matter in the discretion of
          the Court, and that discretion should be
          exercised at all times so that no injustice
          is done to either party. What the applicant
          seeks to do now is to create in this Court an
          issue that has not been tried. We think that
          is not right. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] This court has been critical of trial judges for ignoring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the pleadings in situations much less serious than this case. For</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">example, in Roncato v. Caverly (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 714 (C.A.),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff asserted in its pleadings that the defendant, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's chartered accountant, had been negligent in failing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to notice that the plaintiff's book-keeper, whom the defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had recommended to the plaintiff, had been stealing money from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff. However, in his judgment, the trial judge found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant liable for having negligently misrepresented the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bookkeeper's qualifications and reliability when he recommended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the plaintiff hire her. Speaking for the court, I stated at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">717:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Thus, the trial judge enlarged the
          pleading of negligence to embrace the tort of
          negligent misrepresentation. In my respectful
          opinion, the trial judge was in error in
          attempting to recognise a cause of action
          that was basically an afterthought.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In this case, the respondents made no attempt to amend the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings at trial. The trial judge appeared to think that it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unnecessary. This is illustrated by his treatment of the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pre-judgment interest, one of the two issues raised in the cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal, which demonstrates that he misconceived the magnitude of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his departure from the original pleading. He relied upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment of this court in Pagliarella v. Di Biase Brothers Inc.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 597 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) x, to deprive the successful</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents of pre-trial interest on $1,000,000 because there was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing in the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 218, s. 214 that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precluded the insurer from limiting its liability under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy of insurance. Included within that limitation is pre-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment interest that, unlike post-judgment interest and costs,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is a component of the damages against which the insured is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indemnified by the policy. Pagliarella  would have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicable had the respondents succeeded in their claim as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleaded for a declaration that the limit of Christos Kalkinis's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy with Allstate was $1,000,000, however, the judgment that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge rendered was not under the policy; it was for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages for negligence. Accordingly, as the award made was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for moneys payable under the policy, the trial judge was entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to award pre-judgment interest on the $500,000 damage award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] This resolution of the first issue is sufficient to allow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appeal. However, the question remains: should a re-trial be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordered on the basis of a claim in negligence? In Sutton,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mitchell &amp; Simpson Limited v. Kelore Mines Limited, supra, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court set aside the judgment below and ordered a new trial on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proper pleadings. I do not think such a disposition is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate in this case because the facts in evidence are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">totally at odds with a breach of duty on the part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's agent and point directly to the fact that Allstate's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agent consistently advocated that the insured increase his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage to the maximum available, namely $1,000,000. There was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no breach of duty. To the extent that he was cross-examined as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his practice relating to appropriate coverage, Vezer testified to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the effect that while as an agent he would try to get the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage for the customer at the lowest premium he would not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lower the premium to the detriment of the customer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The problem in this case was not the advice but the failure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to act on it. The insured did not rely upon the Allstate agent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for insurance advice, he relied upon his son-in-law. It was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">son-in-law who persistently recommended that the emphasis should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be on the cost of the premium not the quality of coverage. On the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">critical occasion when he learned of what had occurred during his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence, the son-in-law overrode the advice of the agent given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly to his father-in-law to increase the policy limits to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the maximum offered by Allstate and instructed Vezer on behalf of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the insured to reduce the coverage back to $500,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In addition to complying with instructions given by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">customer with regard to the coverage he or she wants, a private</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurance agent owes a duty to that customer to provide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information about available coverage and advice as to which forms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of coverage meet that customer's needs: see Fine's Flowers Ltd.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. General Accident Insurance Co. (1977), 17 O.R. (2d) 529 (Ont.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.A.). However, in addition to proving a failure to perform such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a duty, the customer must demonstrate reliance upon the agent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provide such information. In Fletcher et al. v. Manitoba Public</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Co. supra, Wilson J., speaking for the Supreme Court of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada, set out (at 651) three requirements that must be met</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before a duty of care could arise as between the insured and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vezer. As applied to this case, they are: (1) Christos Kalkinis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied upon the information that Vezer was in a position to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supply to him as to the appropriate level of the coverage for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him; (2) Kalkinis's reliance was reasonable; and (3) Vezer knew</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or ought to have known that Kalkinis would rely on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Requirements  (1) and (3) are entirely absent in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As to (1), there was no evidence from the insured that he relied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon the expertise of the agent Vezer to give him advice as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage and indeed the record is replete with evidence that for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this type of advice he always deferred to his son-in-law who was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the business of selling cars. A reasonable reliance upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment or skill of the person having the specialised knowledge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is an essential element of an action based on breach of fiduciary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty. As to (3), Vezer was well aware, on the basis of his past</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">experience with Stephan and the insured, that the insured relied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon the judgment of his son-in-law and not Vezer in all matters</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relating to insurance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The trial judge has misapplied Fletcher. The evidence he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted was that the son-in-law had telephoned and cancelled the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase in coverage recommended by the agent. However, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured denied that he had authorised such a call and the son-in-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law denied that he made it. The insured's position was that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had accepted the recommendation of the agent to increase the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coverage. In these circumstances, is it logical to posit a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability based on a failure by the agent to attempt to talk the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured out of a decision that he swears he never made?  I think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not. The second issue in this appeal must be decided in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negative.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Disposition

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, I would allow the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal, set aside the judgment below and enter a judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissing the action with costs. The cross-appeal should also be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed but without costs. The appellant is entitled to its</font></pre>
