    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  In our view, this appeal must succeed.
[2]  In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge specifically
found that, at the close of the Crown's case, all of the evidence
called by it failed to prove the case against the appellant
beyond a reasonable doubt. She then went on to say that, in
reaching her decision, she had to consider all of the evidence,
including that of the appellant, who chose to testify. She
concluded that his evidence (at pages of the transcript which she
cited) left no doubt in her mind that touching of a sexual nature
occured in the complainant's bedroom on one occasion, and
proceeded to register a conviction for sexual interference.
[3]   We were taken thoroughly by Mr. Gold through the evidence
at the pages cited by the trial judge and find nothing in it
that, fairly read, could reasonably constitute a basis for
conviction when read together with the evidence called by the
Crown.  Indeed, a fair portion of the evidence led from the
appellant by the Crown in cross-examination at trial appears to
be irrelevant to the charge on which the appellant was being
tried.
[4]  It is evident that the trial judge took a dim view of the
manner in which the appellant testified. She described it in such
terms as &quot;robotic&quot;, &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;creepy&quot; and, not surprisingly,
rejected his evidence. Having done so, she then went on to state
her conclusion in these words:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Therefore, in reviewing all of the evidence
          totally, ... [including] the accused's own
          testimony which was most damaging, his bald
          denial that he never touched her actual
          vagina coming some 10 or 12 pages after he
          recited this procedure of being directed or
          forced into it by a six-year-old is rejected.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          On the totality of the evidence, I am
          convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          accused did touch his daughter on one
          occasion in the vagina area in her bedroom
          ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In our view, that conclusion was irretrievably flawed. While
it was within the purview of the trial judge's function to reject
the appellant's evidence, it was not open to her to reject his
denial and then to convert her rejection of his evidence into a
basis for supplying the deficiency she found in the proof offered
by the Crown. Even if the appellant's evidence was in some places
as bizarre as the trial judge suggested, it never achieved the
quality of affirmative evidence that could properly be used to
repair the hiatus in the Crown's case and to establish the
appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
[6]  In these circumstances, the verdict reached by the trial
judge was unreasonable and cannot stand. The appeal is allowed,
the conviction is set aside and an acquittal is entered.</font></pre></td>
