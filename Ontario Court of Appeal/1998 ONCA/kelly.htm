  the Crown wrote to defence counsel advising that it intended to join the two 
  charges together in a new information with a view to going to trial on either 
  July 19 or July 26, whichever the defence preferred. The defence responded on 
  June 12, 1995, that it preferred July 26.</span></p>

  elected to proceed summarily on the third information, the accused pleaded not 
  guilty and the complainant testified. At the end of her examination-in-chief, 
  the trial judge called a brief recess. Immediately following the recess, counsel 
  for the defence advised the court that it had just come to his attention that 
  the third information was sworn outside the six-month limitation period for 
  summary conviction proceedings: s. 786(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The Crown 
  could therefore not proceed summarily on either of the charges in the third 
  information.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Defence counsel expressed 
  the view that the Crown's election to proceed summarily was a nullity, although 
  the information itself was not. Crown counsel agreed with this view and took 
  the position that, because both offences charged in the third information were 
  &quot;hybrid offences,&quot; the Crown could proceed on the third information 
  by way of indictment. It would then be up to the defence to decide whether it 
  wanted to proceed with a trial or to turn the hearing into a preliminary inquiry.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Such an application 
  was brought and was argued on January 10, 1996. The defence's position was that, 
  while it had consented to the setting of the trial date for July 26, it had 
  not agreed to the swearing of the third information outside the six-month limitation 
  period, nor had it agreed to have Kelly placed in greater jeopardy through the 
  institution of indictable proceedings.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Crown's position 
  was that the swearing of the third information was, by inadvertence, outside 
  the time limited, as a result of which the Crown could now proceed only by way 
  of indictment. There would, however, be no prejudice to Kelly as the Crown would 
  not be asking for &quot;a higher penalty than they otherwise would have.&quot; 
  It was now up to Kelly to elect whether to proceed to trial before the provincial 
  court judge or to turn that hearing into a preliminary hearing.</span></p>

  Crown applied to G. Morin J., of the Ontario Court (General Division), for an 
  order in the nature of mandamus with <i>certiorari</i> in aid. The Crown sought 
  an order quashing the stay and directing a Provincial Division judge to arraign 
  Kelly and put him to his election under s. 536(2) of the <i>Code</i>, that is, 
  to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had 
  a preliminary inquiry, or to have a preliminary inquiry and to be tried by a

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The application was

<p>(2)            Kelly was ordered to appear before the Provincial Court judge

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Before dealing with 
  the merits of the appeal, it may be helpful to comment on the procedure followed. 
  In that regard, <i>R. v. Currie</i> (Ont. C.A., January 13, 1983, unreported) 
  provides some guidance.</span></p>
<p class=Level1> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Currie was charged 
  with assault causing bodily harm. When he appeared for trial, the Crown indicated 
  that it was proceeding summarily. Currie pleaded not guilty and his counsel 
  then pointed out that the information was a nullity, having been sworn more 
  than six months after the commission of the offence alleged.</span></p>
<p class=Level1> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The trial judge chose 
  to treat the matter of the date of swearing as a defence to which there was 
  no answer and dismissed the charge.</span></p>
<p class=Level1> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Crown appealed 
  from the dismissal to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court. The court allowed 
  the appeal on the basis that, in the circumstances, the Crown had no right to 
  proceed summarily and there was therefore no jurisdiction on the part of the 
  trial judge to accept a plea. The dismissal was set aside and the matter returned 
  to the Provincial Court to proceed upon indictment.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Currie then appealed 
  to this court which held that the Crown should not have appealed to the Summary 
  Conviction Appeal Court. As there was no valid summary proceeding before the 
  Provincial Court, the Crown should have taken the appropriate proceedings to 
  challenge the dismissal of an indictable offence.</span></p>

  117 C.C.C. 241 (S.C.C.); 1957 S.C.R. 343). Accordingly, Judge Boyd had no jurisdiction 
  to dismiss the charges in the information as he purported to do. The proceedings 
  before Judge Greco did not end in a determination which would support the plea 
  of <u>autrefois acquit</u>. The appeal is allowed and the orders of the learned 
  provincial court judge (Judge Boyd) are set aside as made without jurisdiction. 
  We would suggest to the Crown, in view of the lengthy proceedings that have 
  taken place through no fault of the respondents, they consider whether the interests 
  of justice would be served by proceeding further.&quot;</span></p>

  accused was charged with having committed a sexual assault during the period 
  between June 30, 1984, and March 31, 1985. The information was sworn on November 
  1, 1985. On November 18, 1985, the Crown elected to proceed by way of summary 
  conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the whole period covered by the information 
  was beyond the limitation prescribed by what was then s. 721(2). The trial was 
  set for June 30, 1986, and on that date Crown counsel apparently realized the 
  problem. The information was then quashed prior to any plea. A new information 
  was sworn on June 30, 1986, alleging a sexual assault between June 1, 1983, 
  and August 31, 1984. On September 10, 1986, the Crown elected to proceed by 
  way of indictment. On April 23, 1987, the accused appeared and applied to stay 
  the proceedings on the second information on two alternative grounds, <i>autrefois 
  acquit</i> and abuse of process. The stay was granted on both grounds. With 
  respect to abuse of process, the court said [at p. 332]:</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>When one looks at the reason for which the 
  second information, the information that we are dealing with today, has arrived 
  before this court, one must take into account the fact that the Crown, as mentioned 
  earlier, elected to proceed summarily on the first information. They must have 
  had some good reasons for electing to proceed by way of summary conviction. 
  There are different penalties imposed in respect to the Crown's election by 
  way of summary conviction and to have the matter dealt with at the trial date, 
  it would seem to me that now to come back before the court on the second information 
  alleging the same offence and to elect to proceed by indictment, the only purpose 
  that the Crown has elected to proceed by indictment is to get around the prescription 
  period. It has nothing to do with their discretion in respect to electing to 
  proceed by summary conviction or indictment vis-à-vis the penalties involved 
  upon a conviction. In my view, the defendant has met the challenge of the allegation 
  of the Crown on the first information in which the Crown elected to proceed 
  summarily, that the matter was disposed of at that stage and to allow the Crown 
  now to bring forth another information and to elect to proceed by indictment 
  for the sole purposes indicated earlier, to avoid the prescription period, would 
  place the defendant in an unfair position in the eyes of the law.</span></p>

<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>I confess that I was initially attracted by 
  the submission of respondent's counsel that Crown counsel had assessed the offence 
  as not being sufficiently grave to warrant proceeding by indictment, and that 
  his failure to notice, prior to electing to proceed by way of summary conviction, 
  that proceedings by way of summary conviction were precluded by s. 721(2), resulted 
  in the laying of a second information, which had the potential effect of subjecting 
  the respondent to an increased penalty. On more considered reflection, however, 
  I have concluded that this argument is unsound. The offence charged was at all 
  times triable by indictment, and indeed the information charged an indictable 
  offence until the Crown elected to treat the offence as one punishable on summary 
  conviction: see <i>Re Abarca and The Queen</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 410 at 
  pp. 413-4 (Ont. C.A.). The respondent in this case was in no way prejudiced 
  by the error of Crown counsel. If Crown counsel had noticed, prior to electing 
  to proceed by way of summary conviction, that summary conviction proceedings 
  were precluded by s. 721(2), he would, no doubt, have proceeded by indictment, 
  as he ultimately did. The respondent in this case suffered no prejudice as a 
  result of Crown counsel failing to notice prior to election that summary conviction 
  proceedings were barred by s. 721(2). Furthermore, in the view of Mr. Justice 
  Fauteux (with whom Mr. Justice Abbott concurred) in <i>R. v. Karpinski</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, the Crown's purported election, in the circumstances, to proceed 
  by way of summary conviction proceedings was void and of no effect.</span></p>

  he was charged, in error, with failing to stop his motor vehicle after striking 
  another motor vehicle contrary to s. 252(1) of the <i>Code</i>. The Crown elected 
  to proceed summarily. Boutilier pleaded not guilty and a trial date was set. 
  On that date, before any evidence was called, the Crown indicated that the charge 
  should have been one of failing to remain after hitting a pedestrian rather 
  than a motor vehicle. Another information was sworn but it was too late to proceed 
  summarily. The Crown advised that it would proceed by way of indictment and 
  that it intended to stay the original information. The accused applied for, 
  and was granted a stay. The Crown appealed. In dismissing the appeal, Freeman 
  J.A., speaking for the court, said at pp. 331-336:</span></p>
<div0> 
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>Nowhere in the Crown's brief to the trial 
  judge, nor in this appeal, is it alleged that the involvement of a pedestrian 
  rather than a vehicle altered the Crown's understanding of the seriousness of 
  the circumstances so as to justify proceeding by way of indictment rather than 
  by summary conviction. No explanation for proceeding by indictment rather than 
  by summary proceedings is offered, save for the expiration of the limitation 
  period. The Crown's brief addressed this point before the trial judge:</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US>In the present case, the accused alleges that there is &quot;no rational 
  basis&quot; for the Crown's decision to proceed by way of indictment save for 
  the fact that the prescription period contained in Section 786(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> has elapsed.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US>The Crown, however, respectfully submits that there is a rational basis 
  to continue with the prosecution of the accused on the basis that the public 
  has an interest in charges being properly tried. And, in the present circumstances, 
  the trial of this charge would not offend the community's sense of fair play 
  and decency. On the contrary, staying the proceedings would offend the community's 
  sense of justice and thus bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>There is nothing in the submission to suggest 
  that the Crown would not have proceeded by way of summary conviction with respect 
  to the second information if the limitation period had not expired.</span></p>
<p><span>                  </span><b>....</b></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>Therefore, the only issue in this appeal is 
  whether it was an abuse of process warranting a stay of proceedings for the 
  Crown to re-elect to proceed by indictment, having previously elected to treat 
  the matter as a summary conviction offence. In my view, that is a question of 
  law to be determined from the acknowledged facts.</span></p>
<div1> 
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The creation by Parliament of summary conviction 
  offences, indictable offences, and hybrid offences merely reflects the commonplace 
  observation that some offences are more serious than others. The Crown is entrusted 
  with classifying offences and, in the case of hybrid offences, with making the 
  necessary determination whether to proceed summarily or by indictment. The choice 
  is governed by the seriousness of the circumstances of each alleged offence; 
  the object is to do justice expeditiously and fairly. The Crown's discretion 
  in electing between summary proceedings and proceedings by indictment is virtually 
  unfettered, and it is entitled to great respect.</span></p>
<p><span>                  </span><b>....</b></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>In the present appeal, the election to proceed 
  by way of summary conviction, in September, 1994, was a proper and valid one. 
  It must be presumed to have been a reasoned decision, regularly made, based 
  on due consideration of all relevant circumstances, and tested by objective 
  criteria. The offence the respondent was alleged to have committed was, therefore, 
  in the eyes of the legal system and of the world, a summary conviction offence, 
  that is, a relatively minor one, not serious enough to justify proceedings by 
  indictment.</span></p>
<p><span>                  </span><b>....</b></p>
<div2> 
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>In hybrid offences, the same essential elements 
  must be proven whether the Crown elects to proceed by way of indictment or by 
  summary conviction. Once an offence under s. 252 has been determined by the 
  Crown to be a summary conviction offence, the provisions of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> relating to summary conviction offences apply, not procedures relating 
  to indictable offences. The Crown's option has been exercised: the case has 
  been determined to be less serious than an indictable offence and the procedure 
  is less formal. The Crown cannot arbitrarily reverse its decision and arrive 
  at a different result; there must be sound reasons to justify such a change. 
  The Crown's election is protected by a strong presumption of regularity and 
  the offence is deemed to have been correctly characterized. The exercise of 
  the Crown's discretion is subject to judicial review only for flagrant impropriety&quot; 
  (<i>R. v. Balderstone</i> (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 532, 4 D.L.R. (4th) 162, 6 C.R.R. 
  356 (Man. C.A.)) or &quot;improper or arbitrary motives&quot; (<i>R. v. Beare</i> 
  (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 57, 55 D.L.R. (4th) 481, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387).</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The offence with which the respondent was 
  charged was therefore a summary conviction offence because the legal system, 
  by the device of the Crown discretion, had determined it to be a summary conviction 
  offence. It was wrongly described in the information, but the Crown acknowledges 
  that it was not fooled by its own mistake — it was aware throughout the whole 
  matter that an injured pedestrian was involved, not another vehicle. The circumstances 
  to which the Crown initially applied its criteria for exercising its discretion 
  did not change. It would strike at the integrity of the system if the Crown 
  is permitted to disavow its original election, in the absence of supporting 
  circumstances related to the offence itself, and make a second election which 
  necessarily disregards its own criteria, simply to patch up a drafting mistake 
  in one information. (The same criteria, applied to the same circumstances, could 
  not yield a conficting result.) It is very clear that the Crown's motives were 
  arbitrary. In my view, this system is too important, and works too well, to 
  expose it to public disrepute in this way.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>To permit proceedings by indictment in the 
  circumstances of this case would, in my view, damage the integrity of the system: 
  integrity cannot be slightly violated any more than an eggshell can be slightly 
  broken. It is an absolute concept. Either it is intact or it is not.</span></p>
<div3> 
<p style='
'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>Fairness to the accused is a consideration 
  in every case. There can be no doubt that proceedings by way of indictment are 
  more prejudicial to an accused person than summary proceedings, if for no other 
  reason than that the respondent in the present case would be liable to imprisonment 
  for five years on indictment instead of a maximum sentence of six months in 
  jail and a fine of $2,000 for a summary conviction offence. The additional procedural 
  safeguards for indictable offences, the preliminary inquiry, and the right to 
  a jury trial, attest to their seriousness and confront the accused with greater 
  expense and delay. Indictable offences carry a greater stigma, of potential 
  relevance to foreign travel, future employment, security clearance, and in the 
  event of a subsequent offence. A pardon can be sought three years after conviction 
  for a summary offence, but only after five years for an indictable offence. 
  It would be callous to suggest the respondent's position has not worsened substantially 
  if proceedings are not to be summary but by indictment. If the stay imposed 
  by the trial judge is set aside, the respondent would be required to bear serious 
  consequences flowing not from his own alleged misdeeds but merely from the Crown's, 
  that is, the judicial system's, own inadvertence.</span></p>

  a difficult one to meet, I am satisfied that the present appeal is sufficiently 
  clear to justify a finding of abuse of process. The facts are acknowledged. 
  There is no question as to what the Crown did, or any need to second-guess its 
  intentions. More importantly, the detrimental effect of the proposed proceedings 
  by indictment on the integrity of the system is equally clear. It is not reprehensible 
  nor shocking nor likely to give rise to community outrage, but it is clear. 
  The Crown discretion was to be used for the wrong purpose, a purpose precluded 
  by its previous valid exercise, and one that could not stand up to objective 
  scrutiny. Its use for an inappropriate purpose would be unfair and oppressive.</span></p>

  pedestrian in the crosswalk was a wrongful act subjecting the accused to prosecution 
  for a summary conviction offence, not, as determined by the Crown in the valid 
  exercise of its discretion, to proceedings by indictment. Assuming a prosecution 
  would succeed on the evidence, the accused has done nothing to entitle him to 
  an acquittal on a summary conviction offence, but the state has done something 
  which disentitles it to a conviction on indictment. What the Crown did, and 
  what motivated its actions, could not be more clear.</span></p>

  a pedestrian. There was nothing arbitrary in seeking to correct that error.</span></p>

  in these reasons, the Attorney-General is a member of the executive and as such 
  reflects, through his or her prosecutorial function, the interest of the community 
  to see that justice is properly done. The Attorney-General's role in this regard 
  is not only to protect the public, but also to honour and express the community's 
  sense of justice. Accordingly, courts should be careful before they attempt 
  to &quot;second-guess&quot; the prosecutor's motives when he or she makes a 
  decision. Where there is conspicuous evidence of improper motives or of bad 
  faith or of an act so wrong that it violates the conscience of the community, 
  such that it would genuinely be unfair and indecent to proceed, then, and only 
  then, should courts intervene to prevent an abuse of process which could bring 
  the administration of justice into disrepute. Cases of this nature will be extremely 
  rare.</span></p>

  only an error or oversight on the part of the prosecution. That error or oversight 
  may have some negative consequences for the respondent. The significance of 
  that risk, however, is a relatively minor matter when compared with the interest 
  of the public in having the charge prosecuted.</span></p>
