</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal was heard on May 4 and 5, 1998.  This court's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons for judgment were ready for release on July 9, 1998 when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties contacted the court to request that this not be done.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">On the basis of the reasons given by the parties for this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request, the court agreed to refrain from releasing its judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until November 1, 1998 but made clear that the judgment would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then be released unless prior to October 31, 1998 both parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notified the court in writing that the matter had been fully and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finally settled and that the appellant wished to withdraw the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.  This has not happened and these reasons are therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being released.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant Scott's Food is the largest Kentucky Fried</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chicken (&quot;KFC&quot;) franchisee in the world.  Its franchise agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(the &quot;license agreement&quot;) with the respondent covers some four</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hundred outlets, approximately half of all KFC outlets in Canada.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Up until 1996, Scott's Food was owned by the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Hospitality whose other major business was a school bus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operation.  At that point, as part of a transaction with Laidlaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Inc. (&quot;Laidlaw&quot;) in which Laidlaw acquired the school bus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business, the shareholders of Scott's Hospitality replaced it as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the sole shareholder of the franchisee with a new company,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Restaurants.  As a result, these shareholders then owned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Restaurants which in turn owned Scott's Food.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change was made without the respondent's consent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  There were two main issues at trial.  The second, which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties call the enhancement issue, was whether, apart altogether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the corporate changes entailed by the Laidlaw transaction,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food had upgraded its outlets as required by its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract.  At trial, Steele J. found that it had not.  I will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">come in due course to the limited appeal taken from the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below on this issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The first and indeed the fundamental issue at trial, called</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the transfer issue, was whether the license agreement required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants (to whom I will refer jointly as &quot;Scott's&quot;) to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtain the respondent's consent to the change in ownership of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee failing which the respondent could terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  Steele J. interpreted the contract as requiring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent, thereby giving the respondent the right to terminate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since no consent was obtained.  For the reasons that follow, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have come to the opposite conclusion and I would therefore allow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appeal on the transfer issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE TRANSFER ISSUE

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Relevant Facts

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The license agreement that is the subject of this litigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was signed on June 9, 1989, effective January 1, 1989.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was the franchisor and the appellant Scott's Food the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee.  The latter was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospitality which was not a party to the agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  At the time the license agreement was made, Scott's operated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about one-half of all the KFC outlets in Canada and more than ten</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">times as many as the next largest franchisee in the country.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Unlike most franchisees, Scott's had very significant bargaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">power in the negotiations which led up to the agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  For the purposes of the transfer issue, the critical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs of the license agreement are the following:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.  Transfer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.1 The grant of the License hereunder is
          personal to Licensee.  The grant of the
          License hereunder is based upon full
          disclosure in writing by the Licensee to KFC,
          and approval by KFC, of all directors and
          holders of majority control of the voting
          shares of Licensee and of any corporation or
          corporations which directly or indirectly
          (whether by means of any intermediate
          corporations or otherwise) own or control or
          have an interest in the shares of the
          Licensee.  Licensee acknowledges that the
          restrictions provided in this Paragraph 16
          are reasonable and necessary to protect the
          KFC System and the KFC Marks and are for the
          benefit and protection of all KFC licensees
          as well as KFC.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.2 Licensee agrees that it shall not sell,
          transfer, assign, encumber, sub-license or
          otherwise deal with this Agreement or its
          rights or interest hereunder (hereinafter
          referred to as &quot;transfer&quot;), without KFC's
          prior written consent and Licensee's
          compliance in all respects with the terms and
          conditions of this Paragraph 16.  Any
          transfer or any attempt to do so, contrary to
          Paragraph 16 shall be a breach of this
          Agreement and shall be void but shall give
          KFC the right of termination as provided in
          Paragraph 17.2(d).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Paragraph  17.2(d) reads as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          17.2 KFC may, without prejudice to any other
          rights or remedies contained in this
          Agreement or at law or in equity, terminate
          the License upon immediate notice (or in the
          event advance notice is required by law, upon
          the giving of such notice) in the event that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                             . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  Licensee makes or permits a transfer
          contrary to the provision of Paragraph 16;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The history of Scott's as a KFC franchisee predates the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">license agreement by twenty years.  It goes back to 1969 when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Hospitality entered into an agreement to become a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee operating KFC outlets in Canada.  The franchisor then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was Col. Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken Limited (&quot;Colonel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sanders&quot;), the owner of the KFC trademarks in Canada.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement was to run until January 1, 1994.  It is noteworthy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it contained no clause like the current paragraph 16.1.  It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not specify that the rights of Scott's Hospitality were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal to it, nor were there any provisions restricting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer of its shares.  There was, however, a provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restricting the transfer of the license without the prior written</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent of the franchisor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] By 1985, the franchisor had developed a standard franchise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement (&quot;the 1985 Agreement&quot;) containing certain restrictions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the transfer of shares in the franchisee which, at that point,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were standard in all KFC franchise agreements in Canada except</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that with Scott's Hospitality.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] While paragraph 16.1 of the 1985 Agreement reads identically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to paragraph 16.1 in the license agreement, paragraph 16.2 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1985 Agreement when coupled with paragraph 16.4 contains</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant differences.  These two paragraphs are reproduced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below, highlighting the words that do not appear in the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.2 The Franchisee agrees that it shall not
          sell, transfer, assign, encumber, sub-license
          or otherwise deal with this Agreement or its
          rights or interest hereunder (hereinafter
          referred to as &quot;transfer&quot;), and shall not
          suffer or permit any deemed sale, transfer or
          assignment of this Agreement or its rights or
          interest hereunder (hereinafter referred to
          as &quot;deemed transfer&quot; and more particularly
          defined in paragraph 16.4), without KFC's
          prior written consent and Franchisee's
          compliance in all respects with the terms and
          conditions of this Paragraph 16.  Any
          transfer or deemed transfer, or any attempt
          to do so, contrary to this Paragraph 16 shall
          be a breach of this Agreement and shall be
          void but shall give KFC the right of
          termination as provided in paragraph 17.2(d).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.4 For the purposes of this Paragraph 16, a

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  in the event that Franchisee is a
          corporation, any change (including but
          without limitation any issuance, sale,

          cancellation of, or conversion of any
          securities into, voting shares of the
          corporate Franchisee or any other corporation
          referred to in paragraph 16.1, or any
          amalgamation, merger or other reorganization
          of the corporate Franchisee or any such other
          corporation) in any of the holdings of voting
          shares referred to in paragraph 16.1;
          provided that, in the case of any such
          corporation the voting shares of which are
          listed and publicly traded on a stock
          exchange, no such change in any of the
          holdings of its voting shares shall
          constitute a deemed transfer unless, in the
          sole opinion of KFC, direct or indirect
          control of the corporate Franchisee would
          thereby be changed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In 1987, Col. Sanders sold its entire interest in the KFC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trademarks in Canada to Kentucky Fried Chicken's corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(&quot;KFC Corp.&quot; or &quot;KFC&quot;) which held those rights for the rest of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the world.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Just prior to this sale, by letter agreement dated July 16,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1987, KFC Corp. agreed that when the sale from Col. Sanders was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded, it would grant Scott's Hospitality a ten-year renewal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the 1969 agreement.  This letter agreement suggested no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constraint on the transfer of shares of the franchisee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Pursuant to the 1987 letter agreement, negotiations ensued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between KFC and Scott's Hospitality.  In these negotiations,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Hospitality refused to agree to terms in the language of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the 1985 agreement, just as it had previously refused to do with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Col. Sanders.  The Scott's representative made clear to KFC that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's would not agree to any restrictions on changes of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ownership in the licensee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The relative bargaining power of Scott's and KFC in these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negotiations was the subject of some considerable attention at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial.  The chief KFC negotiator testified that Scott's was at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">least the equal of KFC in bargaining power.  The leading expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for KFC testified that it was unusual for a franchisee to be in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such a position.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Because of these unique circumstances, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that the evidence of the experts as to the usual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practice in the franchising industry must be applied with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">caution.  Ultimately, he found that Scott's had sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bargaining power to negotiate a contract in which there would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no restriction on the transferability of shares.  The question he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to decide was whether the resulting license agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contained such a restriction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The first of the two Laidlaw transactions, which triggered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the need to answer this question, began in January 1996 with an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsolicited offer from Laidlaw to purchase all of the shares of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Hospitality.  Laidlaw's intention was that following a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">successful takeover, it would sell off Scott's Food and retain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the school bus business operated by Scott's Hospitality.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw's offer contained a condition that it be satisfied that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was no impediment to its disposing of the shares of Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Food to a third party without affecting the franchisee's rights</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the license agreement.  KFC was not prepared to give its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent to this transaction and indeed commenced this litigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in response.  As a result, this Laidlaw proposal could not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">completed within its time frame and hence it did not proceed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Rather, a second Laidlaw transaction was structured in which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Restaurants was incorporated as a subsidiary of Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospitality.  Scott's Hospitality then transferred its shares in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food to Scott's Restaurants in exchange for shares of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Restaurants which were dividended out to the shareholders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Scott's Hospitality.  The shareholders of Scott's Hospitality</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thereby became the owners of Scott's Restaurants which, in turn,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became the owner of the franchisee, Scott's Food.  Laidlaw then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchased the shares of Scott's Hospitality thereby acquiring the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">school bus business.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] KFC was kept fully informed of this transaction but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuously opposed it.  Indeed, its consent was never expressly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought.  The simple question at trial was whether that consent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was required.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Judgment Below

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The trial judge found that while Scott's Food as franchisee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was bound by the license agreement, Scott's Hospitality was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bound by its terms.  He concluded that Scott's Food was neither</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the alter ego nor the agent of Scott's Hospitality.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent does not contest this conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] He then went on to his core finding on the transfer issue,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">namely, the construction of paragraph 16.1 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  He construed that paragraph to contain a continuing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation on the part of the franchisee to obtain approval of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">KFC to any transfer of the shares of either Scott's Food or its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlling shareholder.  He put his findings in these terms:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In my opinion the disclosure and
          approval of the directors and holders of
          majority control would be meaningless unless
          it was a continuing obligation and not merely
          at the time of execution.  Based on good
          business sense section 16.1 must be construed
          as being a continuing obligation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In my opinion there is nothing in
          section 16 that prohibits or gives the right
          of approval to KFC of trading of shares of
          Scott's Food or Hospitality provided that
          there is no issue of a change of control.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               There are no clearly expressed words
          requiring the approval of KFC to any transfer
          of the shares of Scott's Food or its
          controlling shareholders.  However
          section 16.1 referring to the grant being
          personal and the reference to the directors
          and holders of majority control of the shares
          of Scott's Food and the broad reference to
          any other corporations with control make it
          clear that any transfer of the controlling
          shares of Scott's Food or Hospitality are
          subject thereto.  To interpret the section
          otherwise would defeat the personal aspect
          and not make good business sense and would be
          contrary to the generally accepted practice
          in the franchise industry.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] He then moved directly and without elaboration to a finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that paragraph 16.2 prohibits a transfer or an attempted transfer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the license agreement without consent and since the first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw proposal was an attempted transfer and the second was an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actual transfer, each breached paragraph 16.2 and gave KFC the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 17.2(d).

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Analysis

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The question to be determined on the transfer issue is one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of contractual interpretation: properly construed, does either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 or paragraph 16.2 of the license agreement require</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">KFC's consent to either Laidlaw transaction?  The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined that this was not a case of ambiguity and on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis, he declined to consider evidence of the subjective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intentions of the parties which were not communicated to each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other.  Equally he excluded the various draft documents leading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">up to the license agreement.  He did, however, consider the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship between the parties and the custom of the industry,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">including the license agreements between the respondent and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisees in Canada, as part of the factual matrix that must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">looked at in interpreting the agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] I agree with this approach.  While the task of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation must begin with the words of the document and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their ordinary meaning, the general context that gave birth to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the document or its &quot;factual matrix&quot; will also provide the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with useful assistance.  In the famous passage in Reardon Smith</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Line Ltd. v. Yngvar Hansen-Tangen, [1976] 1 W.L.R. 989 at 995-96</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(H.L.) Lord Wilberforce said this:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          No contracts are made in a vacuum: there is
          always a setting in which they have to be
          placed.  The nature of what is legitimate to
          have regard to is usually described as &quot;the
          surrounding circumstances&quot; but this phrase is
          imprecise: it can be illustrated but hardly
          defined.  In a commercial contract it is
          certainly right that the court should know
          the commercial purpose of the contract and
          this in turn presupposes knowledge of the
          genesis of the transaction, the background,
          the context, the market in which the parties
          are operating.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The scope of the surrounding circumstances to be considered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will vary from case to case but generally will encompass those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors which assist the court &quot;... to search for an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation which, from the whole of the contract, would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties at</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Where, as here, the document to be construed is a negotiated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial document, the court should avoid an interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that would result in a commercial absurdity1.  Rather, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">document should be construed in accordance with sound commercial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles and good business sense2.  Care must be taken,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, to do this objectively rather than from the perspective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of one contracting party or the other, since what might make good</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business sense to one party would not necessarily do so for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] With these broad principles of interpretation in mind, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">turn first to the construction to be given to paragraph 16.1 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the license agreement.  Properly construed, does it give KFC the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">right to approve a change in the controlling shareholder of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee?  It is the second Laidlaw transaction that requires</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this question to be answered.  Given that the first Laidlaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction was not proceeded with, KFC did not argue at trial or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on appeal that it breached paragraph 16.1.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] It is helpful at this point to set out the provision again:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.1 The grant of the License hereunder is
          personal to Licensee.  The grant of the
          License hereunder is based upon full
          disclosure in writing by the Licensee to KFC,
          and approval by KFC, of all directors and
          holders of majority control of the voting
          shares of Licensee and of any corporation or
          corporations which directly or indirectly
          (whether by means of any intermediate
          corporations or otherwise) own or control or
          have an interest in the shares of the
          Licensee.  Licensee acknowledges that the
          restrictions provided in this Paragraph 16
          are reasonable and necessary to protect the
          KFC System and the KFC Marks and are for the
          benefit and protection of all KFC licensees
          as well as KFC.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] I have concluded that this clause does not give KFC a right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to approve a change in the controlling shareholder of its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee Scott's Food.  In other words, paragraph 16.1 does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extend to the second Laidlaw transaction.  I say this for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] First, the license agreement was signed in 1989.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transactions occurred in 1996.  The ordinary meaning of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the language used in paragraph 16.1 suggests that the franchisor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">KFC had the right on entering the contract to know and approve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the shareholders of the franchisee.  There is nothing to suggest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a right to approve a change in those shareholders some seven</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years later.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] Second, such a right would mean a significant change from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the agreement which had governed this franchise relationship</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since 1969 which clearly contained no such right.  Moreover,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's had refused to enter into an agreement like the 1985</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standard franchise agreement which did provide the franchisor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with this right.  The trial judge found that prior to executing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the license agreement, KFC knew this and had been told that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's would not agree to any restriction on changes of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ownership in the franchisee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Third, the language of the 1985 standard franchise agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is revealing.  In 1989, when the license agreement was concluded,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">every other KFC franchise agreement in Canada expressly provided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the franchisor's right to approve a change in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders of the franchisee.  This was done not by means of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 but rather through the &quot;deemed transfer&quot; language</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of paragraphs 16.2 and 16.4.  Paragraph 16.1 in the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement ought not to be construed to provide the franchisor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with this right where the identical language in the 1985 standard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchise agreement was clearly not intended to have that effect.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The corollary to this is that the deemed transfer language which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does provide this right to the franchisor in the 1985 standard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchise agreement is conspicuously absent from the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Fourth, paragraph 16.1 extends the right of approval to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">holders of majority control of the franchisee and any corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which has an interest in the shares of the franchisee.  If this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">language is read to give KFC a right to approve any subsequent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change in the majority shareholder of the franchisee, it must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also give KFC the right to approve a subsequent change in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholder control of any corporation which owns any interest in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the franchisee, even if it is only a single share.  In argument,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent conceded that this would be a commercial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absurdity.  To find, as the trial judge did, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisor's right of approval is limited to a change of control</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the franchisee is, in my opinion, to read out of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 the phrase &quot;have an interest in&quot;.  By contrast, to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extend this right of approval to the majority shareholder and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also to shareholders who have an interest in the shares of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee does not create a commercial absurdity if that right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applies simply at the point of entering the license agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Fifth, paragraph 16.4 provides support for this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation.  It requires the franchisee to seek KFC's consent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a transfer to a third party of the franchisee's interest under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the license agreement.  To allow an informed consent, this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph expressly obliges the franchisee to give KFC the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information about the shareholders of the third party that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 provided concerning the franchisee.  However, if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 contained an ongoing right of KFC to be informed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of and approve the shareholders of the party holding the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchise, paragraph 16.4 would be superfluous.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] Finally, and with respect, it is my view that the three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons offered by the trial judge for the opposite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation of paragraph 16.1 do not withstand scrutiny.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] The first reason given by the trial judge was that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning I would accord to paragraph 16.1 would defeat the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal aspect of the license agreement.  That paragraph</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certainly makes clear that the grant of the license is personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the licensee.  However, that licensee is clearly and expressly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food, not its controlling shareholder.  A change in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">latter leaves the licensee unchanged.  Following the second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transaction, the license is still granted personally to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The second reason was that it would not make good business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sense to read paragraph 16.1 so that it did not extend to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change in the shareholders of the franchisee.  While this might</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not make good business sense from the perspective of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisor, it might well make good business sense for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee.  In my view, neither of these is helpful in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required task of contractual interpretation.  Rather, in applying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objectively the interpretive principle of what accords with sound</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial principles and good business sense, the key fact is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that for twenty years, from 1969 to 1989, this franchise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship operated with apparent viability without the right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of approval contended for by the respondent.  In light of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">history, it cannot be concluded that the meaning I give to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 would not make good business sense.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Finally, it was said that reading paragraph 16.1 as I do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be contrary to the generally accepted practice in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchise industry.  The fallacy in this reasoning is that, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge recognized, this was a very unusual franchising</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship.  This franchisee appeared to have bargaining power</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at least equal to that of KFC and certainly sufficient power to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">achieve a contract with no restriction on the transferability of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares.  By contrast, the trial judge found the industry standard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be that the franchisor has control over the franchisee.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these circumstances, the generally accepted industry practice is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of little use in interpreting this particular license agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] Hence, I conclude that paragraph 16.1 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement cannot be construed to give KFC the right to approve a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change in the shareholders of Scott's Food.  This paragraph,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore, was not breached when Scott's did not obtain KFC's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approval of the second Laidlaw transaction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] It is next necessary to consider the proper interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be given to paragraph 16.2 of the license agreement.  It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">helpful to reproduce this provision a second time:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.2 Licensee agrees that it shall not sell,
          transfer, assign, encumber, sub-license or
          otherwise deal with this Agreement or its
          rights or interest hereunder (hereinafter
          referred to as &quot;transfer&quot;), without KFC's
          prior written consent and Licensee's
          compliance in all respects with the terms and
          conditions of this Paragraph 16.  Any
          transfer or any attempt to do so, contrary to
          Paragraph 16 shall be a breach of this
          Agreement and shall be void but shall give
          KFC the right of termination as provided in
          Paragraph 17.2(d).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] The respondent's primary argument was that the second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transaction engaged the last sentence of this paragraph.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It was said to be a transfer contrary to paragraph 16.1 which,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of paragraph 16.2, triggered the right of termination in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 17.2(d).  Given the conclusion I have reached</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerning paragraph 16.1, this argument must fail.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Apart altogether from paragraph 16.1, however, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent also argues that for the purposes of paragraph 16.2,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first Laidlaw transaction was an attempted transfer and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second was an actual transfer and that KFC's prior written</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent was therefore required.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] In my view, this argument also must fail.  On the ordinary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of the words used in paragraph 16.2, it is the licensee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food that is constrained from dealing with its interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the license agreement.  Once the alter ego argument is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed, this paragraph simply cannot reach Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospitality, the shareholder of the franchisee.  Nor does it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reach the shareholders of Scott's Hospitality.  Neither an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attempted change nor an actual change in the shareholders of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee constitutes the franchisee dealing with its interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the license agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] This conclusion is assisted by examining the language of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counterpart paragraph 16.2 in the 1985 standard franchise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  The two Laidlaw transactions would be encompassed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that provision only because of the inclusion of the &quot;deemed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer&quot; concept.  As I have said, this concept is conspicuously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absent from paragraph 16.2 of this license agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The respondent argues that its proposed reading of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.2 is consistent with good business sense and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">industry practice.  However, as I have indicated in connection</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the argument on paragraph 16.1, in the circumstances of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, neither of these aids to interpretation requires that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.2 be read to give KFC the right to consent to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change in the shareholders of its franchisee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Finally, the respondent relies on GATX v. Hawker-Siddely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada Inc. (1996), 27 D.L.R. (2d) 251 (Ont. Gen. Div.) to assert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a broad meaning for the phrase &quot;or otherwise deal with&quot; as found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in paragraph 16.2.  That case is different from this one in that,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there, the contracting party was clearly dealing indirectly with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its interest under the agreement.  Here, neither Laidlaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction involved the franchisee dealing in any way with its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest under the license agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] I therefore find that, properly construed, paragraph 16.2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not give KFC the right to prior written consent to either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transaction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Given my conclusions about paragraphs 16.1 and 16.2 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">license agreement, it is unnecessary to deal with the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative arguments: that paragraph 16.1 is limited to a change</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in ultimate control of the franchisee; that KFC could not have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably refused its approval of the second Laidlaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction; that a breach of paragraph 16.1 entitles KFC to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate only if it was a fundamental breach of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement; but in any event, for KFC to terminate would be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of its good faith duty under the license agreement; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finally, that the appellants are entitled to relief from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forfeiture.  Nor is it necessary to deal with the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative argument that a breach of paragraph 16.1 allows it to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate through direct resort to paragraph 17.3 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] Before leaving the transfer issue, the remaining matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to be dealt with arises from the finding below that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant to paragraph 16.3 of the license agreement, KFC had a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">right of first refusal in the circumstances of both Laidlaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions.  That paragraph reads in part as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.3  In the event that Licensee receives a
          bona fide offer, which licensee is willing to
          accept, from a third party to purchase or
          otherwise acquire any of the Licensee's
          rights and interest in this Agreement, ...,
          Licensee shall first offer to sell the same
          to KFC at the same price and on the same
          terms and conditions as in the third party's
          offer ... In the event that KFC so accepts
          such offer to sell, a binding agreement of
          purchase and sale shall thereby be
          constituted between Licensee and KFC at the
          said price and upon the said terms and
          conditions.... [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The reasons below reveal no analysis of the language in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph by the trial judge in reaching his conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] In my opinion, the ordinary meaning of the words used in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph dictates the opposite conclusion -- that neither</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transaction triggered a right of first refusal.  Neither</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an offer to purchase the shares of Scott's Hospitality nor an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer to change the controlling shareholder of Scott's Food is an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer which the franchisee receives or one which the franchisee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can accept.  The licensee cannot receive a takeover bid for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licensee's parent or for the licensee itself.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] In summary, therefore, the appellant did not breach either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 16.1 or paragraph 16.2 of the license agreement because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Laidlaw transactions and KFC does not have the right to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate the license agreement as a result.  Nor did either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laidlaw transaction give KFC a right of first refusal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] I would accordingly allow the appeal on the transfer issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and set aside the declarations in paras. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment below.  Instead, an order will go dismissing the claims</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for these declarations.  Finally, I would set aside para. 13 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judgment below and would grant the declaration sought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therein.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE ENHANCEMENT ISSUE

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] The other major issue at trial was whether Scott's Food had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failed to meet its obligations to enhance its KFC outlets.  These</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations are contained in the license agreement and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addendum to it, the Master Development Agreement, signed at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same time.  The trial judge's two principal findings on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue were that Scott's Food had failed to enhance its outlets as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required by paragraph 7.2 of the Master Development Agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, secondly, because more than five to ten per cent of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outlets had not been enhanced as required, the failure was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">material and substantive, thereby entitling KFC to terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">license agreement pursuant to paragraph 17.2(e) unless Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Food corrects the failure within three months.  The appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal neither of these findings.  Indeed, they raise only two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grounds of appeal in connection with the enhancement issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] Firstly, they appeal the declaration that KFC is also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to terminate the license agreement pursuant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs 17.2(e) and 17.3 because Scott's Food's enhancement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failures were breaches of paragraphs 3.2, 5 and 6 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  While the judgment contains this declaration, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons for judgment do not reveal the basis upon which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration was made.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] Second, they appeal the finding that to avoid KFC's right to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate under paragraph 17.2(e), Scott's Food must, within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three months, enhance all of its outlets, not just a sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number that the failure becomes less than material and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantive.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Turning to the first of these two grounds of appeal, it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">helpful to set out paragraphs 17.2(e) and 17.3 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          17.2 KFC may, without prejudice to any other
          rights or remedies contained in this
          Agreement or at law or in equity, terminate
          the License upon immediate notice (or in the
          event advance notice is required by law, upon
          the giving of such notice) in the event that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                             . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (e)  Licensee fails to satisfy, in a material
          and substantive manner, the requirements for
          enhancement and development contained in
          Articles 3.3, 3.4, 7.2 and 7.3 of the
          Addendum, provided that notice of any such
          failure is delivered to Licensee and Licensee
          shall not have corrected such failure within
          (3) months from the delivery of such notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          17.3 The License will terminate on the
          termination date specified in any notice by
          KFC to Licensee (without any further notice
          of termination unless required by law),
          provided that (a) the notice is hand
          delivered or mailed at least thirty (30) days
          (or such longer period as may be required by
          law) in advance of the termination date, (b)
          the notice reasonably identifies one or more
          breaches or defaults in Licensee's
          obligations or performance hereunder, (c) the
          notice specifies the manner in which the
          breach(es) or default(s) are not fully
          remedied before, and as of, the termination
          date.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] In my view, paragraph 17.2(e) deals explicitly and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exhaustively with the enhancement obligations on the franchisee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, if not met, give KFC the right to terminate the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  None of paragraphs 3.2, 5 or 6 of the license</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement is included in that list.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Moreover, as indicated by the trial judge, paragraph 17.3</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merely sets out the procedure of formal notice.  It does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accord to KFC a substantive right to terminate for any failure by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Scott's Food to discharge its enhancement obligations.  To so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpret paragraph 17.3 would fly in the face of paragraph 17.2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the parties have carefully selected the enhancement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations that, if breached, justify termination.  Hence I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would reverse the declaration that because the franchisee's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enhancement failures breached paragraphs 3.2, 5 and 6 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">license agreement, KFC is entitled to terminate pursuant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraphs 17.2(e) and 17.3.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] As to the second ground of appeal on the enhancement issue,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 17.2(e) of the license agreement provides that failure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in a material and substantive manner (my emphasis) to meet the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">franchisee's enhancement obligations as specified therein gives</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">KFC the right to terminate if the failure is not corrected within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three months.  As I have said, the trial judge found that where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more than five to ten per cent of the outlets fall below this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required standard, Scott's Food was in substantial breach for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes of this paragraph.  He went on to say this:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... KFC must give three months' notice from
          the date of this judgment to Scott's to allow
          it to remedy the default found in this
          decision on the enhancement issue.  In other
          words, Scott's must be given three months in
          which to upgrade all of its remaining outlets
          to certification standards.  If it chooses
          not to do so, it may close those stores under
          other termination procedures.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] There is nothing in the actual judgment appealed from that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires the franchisee to enhance or close all of its remaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outlets to avoid termination.  Hence, I propose to make no order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] However, in my opinion, if failure in a material and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantive manner to meet the enhancement requirements occurs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when five to ten per cent of the outlets are below standard,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correcting that failure means enhancing at least enough outlets</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so that there is no possibility of this line being crossed.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">means that to correct that failure within three months, Scott's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Food must ensure that no more than five per cent of its outlets</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are substandard.  I would therefore not think it necessary that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to correct the failure, the franchisee must sufficiently upgrade</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all its remaining outlets.  To do so would make the correction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incongruent with the failure contrary to what I think is meant by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the final phrase of paragraph 17.2(e).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] The view I have expressed is also consistent with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 6.3 of the Master Development Agreement.  It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplates that the franchisee could operate outlets for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited period of time even if they had not been enhanced to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required standard.  This paragraph is inconsistent with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correction requirement that would compel the franchisee to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properly enhance all of its remaining outlets.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] In summary, I would allow the appeal on the enhancement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue.  I would set aside the declaration in para. 9 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment below and order that the claim for this declaration be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">COSTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] The trial judge ordered that there be no costs of the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the basis of paragraph 18.3 of the license agreement which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required this result unless one party prevailed entirely,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">something that did not occur at this trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] Before us, neither party sought to disturb this order and I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do not do so.  Both parties submitted that costs of the appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should follow the result.  I can see no reason why this should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not happen.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] In conclusion, I would allow the appeals with costs on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer issue and the enhancement issue in accordance with these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons.  The trial judgment is otherwise undisturbed.
