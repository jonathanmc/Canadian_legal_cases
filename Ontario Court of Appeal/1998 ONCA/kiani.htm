  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>We did not call on 
  the respondents on the two issues of liability argued by the appellant. In our 
  opinion the trial judge's finding that the appellant's failure to erect a guardrail 
  caused the accident and his finding that the respondent Kiani was 30% responsible 
  for the accident were reasonably supported by the evidence.</span></p>
<p class=Level1> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The appellant made 
  four submissions on damages. We did not call on the respondents on the first 
  two issues, that is whether the trial judge erred in finding that Kiani could 
  only work at a minimum wage job and whether he erred in finding that Kiani could 
  no longer work as a taxi driver. Those findings were also reasonably supported 
  by the evidence and we see no basis to interfere with them. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>We called on the respondent 
  on the remaining two damages issues argued by the appellant.</span></p>
<p><b>(1)      <u>Did the trial judge err in finding that Kiani would never find 
  work as a convenience store operator or manager</u>? </b><span lang=EN-US

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The trial judge held 
  that Kiani was capable of working as a convenience store manager. But he also 
  held that &quot;the vagaries of the economy&quot; were too uncertain to permit 
  him to conclude that Kiani could realistically find work as a convenience store 
  manager. We think that the trial judge was entitled to reach this conclusion. 
  Although his reasons could have been more detailed he was in the best position 
  to assess Kiani's job prospects. He heard considerable evidence about Kiani's 
  background, age, experience, education and work history. All these considerations 
  factored into his conclusion that Kiani would not find work as a convenience 
  store manager.</span></p>
<p><b>(ii)      <u>Did the trial judge err in finding that Kiani's claim for past 
  and future loss of income was barred by the rule in <i>Hall v. Hebert</i> preventing 
  recovery for illegal activity</u>?</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'></span></p>
<p class=Level1> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The trial judge awarded Kiani past and future income 
  loss based on driving a taxi. The appellant's highest position is that Kiani 
  was driving his taxi in Ontario with a Quebec licence obtained by misrepresentation 
  at a time when he did not have an Ontario driver's licence. <i>Hall v. Hebert</i> 
  reflects the underlying principle that a plaintiff will not be allowed to profit 
  from his or her wrongdoing. That principle cannot be invoked here because the 
  evidence does not establish that Kiani could not lawfully work as a taxi driver 
  from the date of the accident. Therefore, we are not prepared to interfere with 
  the trial judge's award of past and future loss of income. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>We find no merit in 
  the other points raised in the appellant's factum, but not argued orally.</span></p>
