    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury presided over by Whealy J. of the Ontario Court (General</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division), on an indictment charging them with conspiracy to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts. They appeal their convictions and sentences.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  This appeal involves convictions arising from what the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has indicated is the largest seizure of heroin destined for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada. At trial, evidence was led that suggested that the street</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value of the seized shipment was up to $145 million.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Overview of the facts

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In March of 1995, the ship Sea Lotus left Thailand and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrived in Tacoma, Washington on April 9, 1995, where U.S.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Customs officials intercepted it and detained part of its cargo.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The bill of lading described the cargo in issue as 25 wooden</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">crates of ceramic dolls and ceramic vases and the consignee as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lim Chai Heng, 3 Massey Square, Apt. No. 3203, Toronto, Ontario.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Each of the wooden crates contained a cardboard box as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">container for each doll and vase. The cardboard boxes were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protected by a wooden framework and stood on wooden pallets. Each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the wooden pallets had nine wooden blocks holding the cargo</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">off the ground. An examination of the 225 blocks disclosed a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">total of 58.345 kilos of heroin secreted therein. The cargo and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the heroin were turned over to the United States Drug Enforcement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Agency and secured by them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Upon being notified of the seizure, a number of R.C.M.P.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers, including P.C. Nicholson and Cpl.. Penny, attended in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Washington and 41.4 grams of this heroin was released into their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">custody. These officers reassembled the materials for &quot;a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlled delivery&quot; to Lim Chai Heng, the consignee in Toronto.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A small amount of the seized heroin was placed in the blocks</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forming part of the pallets for this delivery. The R.C.M.P.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers also installed listening devices into the pallets for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the interception of communications. The shipment was then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transported to Toronto. On April 20, 1995, Nicholson and Penny</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">observed the appellant Koh (who had identified himself to Customs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as Lim Chai Heng) and Austin Chan at Canada Customs, where they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arranged to have the goods released from the bonded warehouse in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which they were stored.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On April 25, police officers disguised as delivery personnel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attended at 3 Massey Square to complete the controlled delivery.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When the goods would not fit in the apartment, Koh rented some</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  After trial, the appellant Lu was convicted of conspiracy to</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  A number of grounds of appeal were argued but the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">called on the Crown with respect to only three. The first was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to sentence for all three appellants. In the second,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant Lu took issue with the instruction of the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge with respect to his participation on the charge of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conspiracy to import the heroin. These reasons concern themselves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with what I consider to be the main ground of appeal against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction, namely the refusal of the trial judge to permit a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting the racial and national origin of all the appellants.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The question is similar to that permitted in R. v. Parks</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellants filed materials in support of the challenge in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form of an Application Record. This Record contained, inter alia,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the affidavit of Professor Cynthia Peterson referred to by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Doherty J.A. in Parks, supra, at p. 378; an affidavit of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (Ont. C.A.). Additionally, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants filed an Angus Reid Group Poll of April 18, 1995 that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">canvassed attitudes in Metro Toronto on the relationship between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">race and crime. It included the finding that 45 percent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents believed that there was a linkage between race and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the commission of crimes. Portions of a text entitled The Colour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society (Toronto: Harcourt,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Brace &amp; Company) which dealt in part with the treatment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chinese Canadians historically, was also part of the Record.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] All of this evidence was proffered in order to meet the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threshold 'air of reality' test laid out in R. v. Sherratt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.). L'Heureux-DubJ J. set out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the test at 211:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The threshold question is not
          whether the ground of alleged partiality
          would will create such partiality in a juror,
          but rather whether it could create that
          partiality which would prevent a juror from
          being indifferent as to the result. In the
          end, there must exist a realistic potential
          for the existence of partiality, on a ground
          sufficiently articulated in the application,
          before the challenger should be allowed to
          proceed. [Emphasis in the original.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Ruling of the trial judge

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellants had asked that they be permitted to pose two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questions to the jury, the second relating to possible prejudice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the event that the appellants testified and required the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assistance of an interpreter. The treatment of this second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question is well within the discretion of the trial judge. In my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion, the challenge based on the second question trivialises</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the very real problem of how to deal with the spectre of racial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prejudice that hangs over the trial of visible minorities. As to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first question, the one I have set out above, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In respect of the question that
          was, in fact, argued and that I set out
          first, I would first observe that there is a
          distinction to be made between the concept of
          racial prejudice in a social sense, that is,
          in terms of obtaining jobs or rental
          premises, and that sort of thing, and a
          racial bias in the judicial setting of a jury
          trial. It is very important that this
          distinction be made. The former may only mean
          that one favours one's own race in preference
          to others. It may be a little stronger than
          that. The reverse image might be expressed,
          that one does not like or admire other races
          as compared to one's own. The latter goes a
          good deal further, in my view. It suggests
          that one is prepared to act on one's
          prejudices against the interests of other
          races, in particular, in this issue, Chinese,
          rather than one's own race.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
[12] The trial judge then discussed this court's judgment in R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Parks, supra, and subsequent judgments by this court. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continued:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Parks also recognizes racial groups
          other than the black races may suffer from a
          level of prejudice in a social sense, and
          that there may arise a reasonable
          apprehension or air of reality that bias in
          the judicial setting exists as well. If so,
          the challenge for cause in the same limited
          scope should be granted if the evidence links
          the accused to such a group. There must be
          evidence in the latter case establishing not
          only the first proposition, that is, racial
          prejudice in the social sense, but it must be
          sufficient to create an apprehension of the
          latter, that is, racial bias in the judicial
          setting. The apprehension must be linked to
          the accused making the application before the
          court.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    I do not think the evidence here
          establishes a social level of prejudice
          against &quot;Asians&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; so great as to
          raise an apprehension of bias in the judicial
          setting.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
[13] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred by drawing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a distinction between &quot;social prejudice&quot; and &quot;prejudice in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicial setting&quot;. That the trial judge applied the wrong test is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supported by R. v. Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of the Supreme Court of Canada released subsequent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the ruling on appeal. In Williams, the Court considered the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">propriety of a similar distinction between &quot;general&quot; prejudice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and prejudice that can be equated with partiality. In that case,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the courts below had held that evidence of a general prejudice in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the community against persons of the accused's race was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insufficient to justify a challenge for cause. Rather, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused was required to adduce evidence that racist attitudes had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significance in relation to a criminal trial. The Supreme Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected this distinction. Writing for a unanimous Court,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McLachlin J. stated at 493-4:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The [British Columbia] Court of
          Appeal, per Macfarlane J.A., stated that the
          existence of a significant degree of racial
          bias in the community from which the panel is
          drawn is, by itself, not sufficient to allow
          a challenge for cause because bias cannot be
          equated with partiality. The court held that
          in order for the appellant to be successful,
          there must be some evidence of bias against
          aboriginal persons which is of a particular
          nature and extent; evidence which only
          displays a &quot;general bias&quot; against a racial
          group is insufficient to warrant a challenge
          for cause. The Crown goes even further,
          arguing that racial prejudice in the
          community must be linked to specific aspects
          of the trial in order to support a challenge
          for cause. More particularly, it asserts that
          where, as here, the defence as that another
          aboriginal committed the crime, race could
          have no relevance because the jury was
          obliged to decide between two aboriginals.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    I cannot, with respect, accept this
          distinction. In my view, it is unduly
          restrictive. Evidence of widespread racial
          prejudice may, depending on the nature of the
          evidence and the circumstances of the case,
          lead to a conclusion that there is a
          realistic potential for partiality. The
          potential for partiality is irrefutable where
          the prejudice can be linked to specific
          aspects of the trial, like a widespread
          belief that people of the accused's race are
          more likely to commit the crime charged. But
          it may be made out in the absence of such
          links.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
[14] McLachlin J. went on to confirm the proper test at 495:</font></pre>

          the community in which the court lives, that
          there is a noticeable and substantial
          Oriental-looking resident population. It is,

          what is said to be the typical Chinese that
          is the subject of prejudice? Is there a
          profile? The simple answer is no. Chinese
          people in this community seemed to be judged
          individually and not are classed as a race.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is a paucity of such evidence available. This is in part due to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be established in the manner normally associated with the proof</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The affidavit of Dr. Frances Henry, a professor of social</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anthropology at York University, was submitted in Ho, supra, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support of the application to challenge jurors for cause. Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Henry discussed in some detail the various stereotypes that have</font></pre>

          to anti-black racism. The affidavit of Dr.
          Frances Henry satisfies me that racism is not
          unique or indigenous to anti-black racism.
          Racism exists in relation to persons of
          Asian/Chinese origin. It may not be quite so
          broadly based as in the case of anti-black
          racism, but is nonetheless extant. Its
          influence is as insidious in the one case, as
          it is in the other.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Unfortunately, the decision in Ho does not appear to have</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position in the present appeal, and the fact that the Sherratt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threshold test was found to have been met in Ho, there is little</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">point in going through this exercise again at a new trial with</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">having regard to the amorphous nature of what is termed evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the issue of racism generally, we might now ask the question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as to whether the issue of prejudice against visible minorities</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has been the subject of sufficient judicial concern that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration can be given to accepting similar challenges</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without formal proof of community prejudice in the case of all</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] This court, supported by the judgment of the Supreme Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Williams, has decided that racism is a fact of judicial life</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that it must be addressed directly through court approved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenges to members of the jury pool. In doing so we have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared to make an exception to the traditional approach that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury panels can be trusted to be true to their individual oaths</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and try the case on the evidence in accordance with the law as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given to them by the trial judge. This conclusion was arrived at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incrementally and on the accepted wisdom that racism is</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">showing with respect to a specific race, need not be the subject</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of formal proof in subsequent proceedings involving the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">race.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Indeed, in this jurisdiction, I think we have arrived at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stage in the development of the law relating to challenges for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause for racial prejudice that, absent sustainable objection</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the Crown, the trial judge should allow a challenge for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause by a member of a visible racial minority without strict</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compliance with Sherratt, supra. I stress visible when referring</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to minorities, because I accept the submission of the intervener</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that distinctions between the various ethnic groups that make up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Asian community are unhelpful. The prejudice, where it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occurs, is triggered by skin colour. The same would apply to all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">visible non-Caucasian minorities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] It might be said that this opinion does away with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement laid down by the Sherratt threshold test. I disagree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The &quot;air of reality&quot; test must still be met wherever an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application for a challenge for cause is made under s. 638(1)(b)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Criminal Code. The effect of this holding is not to do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">away with this requirement generally, but rather, is to find that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the light of the numerous trial and appellate decisions in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this jurisdiction concerning various categories of visible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minorities, this test has been met wherever the accused is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member of a visible racial minority. After all, Sherratt was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">triggered by pre-trial publicity, which is distinctive to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual case. The potential for racism pervades all cases</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involving minority accused.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In my opinion, such a result is consistent with a natural</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extension of the principles established in Sherratt,  Williams,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the jurisprudence of this court. It is to be remembered that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Sherratt, L'Heureux-DubJ J. indicated at 211 that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threshold test was not to be set inordinately high; rather, As.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[638] places little, if any, burden on the challengerY[t]hus,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">while there must be an 'air of reality' to the application, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">need not be an 'extreme' case.&quot;  At 212, L'Heureux-DubJ J. went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on to state that &quot;the ability to challenge for cause rests upon a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">showing by the challenger of a realistic potential for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partiality. The process is neither 'extraordinary' nor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">'exceptional'.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] McLachlin J., writing in Williams, supra, had this to say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about the appropriate level at which to set the Sherratt</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Racial prejudice and its effects
          are as invasive and elusive as they are
          corrosive. We should not assume that
          instruction from the judge or other
          safeguards will eliminate biases that may be
          deeply ingrained in the subconscious psyches
          of jurors. Rather, we should acknowledge the
          destructive potential of subconscious racial
          prejudice by recognizing that  the post-jury
          selection safeguards may not suffice. Where
          doubts are raised, the better policy is to
          err on the side of caution and permit
          prejudices to be examined. Only then can we
          know with any certainty whether they exist
          and whether they can be set aside or not. It
          is better to risk allowing what are in fact
          unnecessary challenges than to risk
          prohibiting challenges which are necessary:

          conflicts from a methodological point of
          view with the approach in Sherratt, supra,
          that an accused may challenge for cause only
          upon establishing that there is a realistic
          potential for juror partialityYit is not
          always correct to assume that membership in

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">JJ. in R. v. S.(R.D.) (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 that relate to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pp.394-95. McLachlin and L'Heureux-DubJ JJ. said at pp. 372-3:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The reasonable person must be taken
          to be aware of the history of discrimination
          faced by disadvantaged groups in Canadian
          society protected by the Charter's equality
          provisions. These are matters of which
          judicial notice may be taken. In Parks,
          supra, at p. 342, Doherty J.A., did just
          this, stating:
                              Racism, and in particular
               anti-black racism, is a part of our
               community's psyche. A significant
               segment of our community holds overtly
               racist views. A much larger segment
               subconsciously operates on the basis of
               negative racial stereotypes.
               Furthermore, our institutions, including
               the criminal justice system, reflect and
               perpetuate those negative stereotypes.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    [47]  The reasonable person is not
          only a member of the Canadian community, but
          also, more specifically, is a member of the
          local communities in which the case at issue
          arose (in this case, the Nova Scotia and
          Halifax communities). Such a person must be
          taken to possess knowledge of the local
          population and its racial dynamics, including
          the existence in the community of a history
          of widespread and systemic discrimination
          against black and aboriginal people, and high
          profile clashes between the police and the
          visible minority population over policing
          issues: Royal Commission on the Donald
          Marshall, Jr., Prosecution (1989); R. v.
          Smith (M.) and Thompson (1991), 109 N.S.R.
          (2d) 394 (Co. Ct.). The reasonable person
          must thus be deemed to be cognizant of the
          existence of racism in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
          It follows that judges may take notice of
          actual racism known to exist in a particular
          society. Judges have done so with respect to
          racism in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia
          (Minister of Community Services) v. S. (S.M.)
          (1992), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 91 (Fam. Ct.), it was
          stated at p. 108:
                              [Racism] is a pernicious
               reality. The issue of racism existing in
               Nova Scotia has been well documented in
               the Marshall Inquiry Report (sub. nom.
               Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall,
               Jr., Prosecution). A person would have
               to be stupid, complacent or ignorant not
               to acknowledge its presence, not only
               individually, but also systemically and
               institutionally.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    [48]  We conclude that the
          reasonable person contemplated by de GrandprJ
          J., and endorsed by Canadian courts is a
          person who approaches the question of whether
          there exists a reasonable apprehension of
          bias with a complex and contextualized
          understanding of the issues in the case. The
          reasonable person understands the
          impossibility of judicial neutrality, but
          demands judicial impartiality. The reasonable
          person is cognizant of the racial dynamics in
          the local community, and, as a member of the
          Canadian community, is supportive of the
          principles of equality.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] This court has already applied the doctrine of judicial</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] My suggestion that courts in this jurisdiction may now take</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the history of discrimination against visible minorities finds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practical support in the reality that an accused will often face</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forward in this demeaning process wherein they ask for judicial</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated above, the available evidence in this regard is often</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insufficient to the task. Indeed, given the nature of our multi-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cultural nation, it is possible to imagine that there are racial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minorities about which there exists little to no research that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would satisfy the admittedly low evidentiary burden of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sherratt test. Moreover, to require each and every visible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minority accused to adduce evidence in support of an application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not strike me as consonant with the s. 11(d) Charter right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal: Williams,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supra, at 499-500.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] Allowing a challenge for cause where requested by an accused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who is a member of a visible minority will not unduly prolong the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time-consuming U.S. tactics, in which jurors are lengthily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questioned, if not in fact tried themselves. The question or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questions that are to be put to prospective jurors will remain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the discretion of the presiding trial judge, who will also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possess the residual discretion with respect to the conduct of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">279 at 291 (Ont. C.A.); Williams, supra, at 489-490. Experience</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shows that our current practice, once challenges for cause are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permitted, does not greatly extend the conduct of a criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial. Indeed, in Williams, the Supreme Court was advised that,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on average, a challenge for cause procedure adds only some 35 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">45 minutes to a criminal trial; see Williams, supra, at 503. What</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inconveniences, if any, that might arise from an increased</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incidence of challenges for cause are to be tolerated in the name</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of preserving the impartiality of the jury and the respect that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it requires in order to discharge its task. As L'Heureux-DubJ J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrote in Sherratt, supra, at 210:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    If the challenge process is used in
          a principled fashion, according to its
          underlying rationales, possible inconvenience
          to potential jurors or the possibility of
          slightly lengthening trials is not too great
          a price for society to pay in ensuring that
          accused persons in this country have, and
          appear to have, a fair trial before an
          impartial tribunal, in this case, the jury.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Finally, any opposition to extending the opportunities in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which challenges for cause may be undertaken is more than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">countered by the salutary effects that these challenges have both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on an individual trial and with respect to the criminal justice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">system as a whole. These include the removal of jurors who are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forthright about their racist views; the sensitization of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remaining jurors; and the enhancement of the appearance of trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fairness, both in the eyes of the accused and members of minority</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">groups. See Williams at 500-501; Parks at 379-380.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] In conclusion, then, I can see no compelling reason why all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused who are members of visible racial minorities should not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have a right to challenge prospective jurors for cause. Indeed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such a right is required as a natural extension of the principles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outlined in Sherratt, Parks, and Williams, and gives full effect</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Disposition

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] As I indicated, a new trial is required. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should allow challenges for cause on behalf of all accused who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">desire to make them related to their membership in a visible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">racial minority. The challenge for cause can only relate to race</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and should not incorporate other features that are subsidiary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">race. For instance, in this case I would delete the limiting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">description of &quot;from Singapore&quot; from the proposed challenge. Any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prejudice in this case is racial not geographical. Moreover, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact that these appellants came from Singapore is an element of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown's case. The Crown asked the jury to draw inferences</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from this fact relative to the source and timing of the delivery</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the Sea Lotus and the appellants' departure from Singapore.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellants would have to comply with Sherratt, supra, if they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wished to maintain that the geographic origins of the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could in any way lead to partiality or bias on the part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurors. The question I would permit, based on R. v. Ho, supra,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Would your ability to judge the
          evidence in this case without bias, prejudice
          or partiality be affected by the fact that
          the person charged with the offence is of
          East Asian/Chinese origin?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would allow the</font></pre>
