    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge very carefully analyzed the question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty and a possible breach of that duty. He found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts of the case, but that there was no breach of that duty by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants. There was more than adequate evidence to support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both of those findings, and we would not interfere with them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge did find, however, that the appellants were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligent in carrying out their contractual obligations to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents. Unfortunately, his reasons, on pages 16 and 17,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicate that the trial judge based this portion of his decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the fact that Merrill Lynch failed to obtain an independent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appraisal of the real property involved. There was no expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence at trial of the normal practice of persons or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations acting as sales agents of securities (as Merrill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lynch did in this case) with respect to obtaining appraisals.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There was a prospectus which was delivered to the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which clearly set out the acquisition price of the property,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information as to the tenants, and other details. There was no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that any of this information was false or misleading in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any way. In our view, without the assistance of expert evidence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in requiring an independent appraisal of real property to be done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the circumstances of this case, the court would be imposing an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unrealistically high standard of investigation on persons in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position of the appellants.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  This was one of the many unfortunate situations where</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty on the part of the appellant Beaver, relied on by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents, in our view, they do not raise the facts to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">level of a failure to meet the standard of care required in the</font></pre>
