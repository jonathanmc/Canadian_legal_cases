    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal deals with the calculation of fees &quot;earned in
a year&quot; when one works less than a year.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Mr. Kowaleski was a bailiff in Hamilton from 1975 to
1993. On April 1, 1993, he began employment with the Ministry
of the Attorney General as an &quot;enforcement officer.&quot; As
bailiff, his earnings were determined pursuant to Schedule 4
of Ontario Regulation 585/91 made under the Administration of
Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.6. Schedule 4 provided as
follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                     BAILIFF'S ALLOWANCES
            1.       A bailiff is entitled to
              retain for his or her own use all
              gross fees earned in a year up to
              and including $75,000, and 75 per
              cent of the excess over $75,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            2.       If the gross fees earned by
              a bailiff in a year are $45,000 or
              less, the bailiff shall be paid an
              additional allowance equal to 30
              per cent of the gross fees earned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            3.       If the gross fees earned by
              a bailiff in a year are $60,000 or
              less, but more than $45,000, the
              bailiff shall be paid an additional
              allowance equal to 10 per cent of
              the gross fees earned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            4.       If the gross fees earned by
              a bailiff in a year are $75,000 or
              less, but more than $60,000, the
              bailiff shall be paid an additional
              allowance equal to 5 per cent of
              the gross fees earned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            5.       If the gross fees earned by
              a bailiff in a territorial district
              in a year are $75,000 or less, the
              bailiff shall be paid an additional
              allowance equal to 40 per cent of
              the gross fees earned, up to a
              maximum of $15,000, and items 2, 3
              and 4 do not apply. O. Reg. 585/91,
              Sched. 4

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  This Schedule has since been revoked.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In practice, what happened was that a bailiff retained
the fees he or she collected, subject to allowances (or &quot;top-
ups&quot;) and &quot;claw-backs.&quot; To illustrate, if a bailiff's gross
fees were $50,000, he or she would be entitled to keep $50,000
and, in addition, would be entitled to an allowance or top-up
of $5,000 (10% of $50,000). If the gross fees were $85,000,
the bailiff's total earnings would be $82,500 ($75,000 plus
$10,000 less a claw-back of 25%).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Although the schedule spoke of &quot;years&quot; in each of its
five parts, each of which covered a different situation, it
was the practice in 1993, and had been for some years, for
bailiffs to report on a quarterly basis. One reason suggested
for this was to enable the bailiffs to get their allowances
earlier or on a more current basis. Mr. Kowaleski's evidence
suggests that, while allowances were paid on a quarterly
basis, claw-backs were done on an annual basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  To accommodate this approach, the report form was set up
on a quarterly basis. For instance, Section B read in part as
follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            Quarterly Surplus Fees Payable
            If quarterly fees exceed $18,750 (i.e. $75,000 ¸
            4 = $18,750),
complete this section

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Mr. Kowaleski's report for the period January 1, 1993, to
March 31, 1993, was on the usual form. As this was the only
return he was going to make in 1993, he amended it by striking
out the word &quot;quarterly&quot; wherever it appeared and substituting
therefor the word &quot;yearly.&quot; He also crossed out the figure
$18,750 and substituted $75,000 for it. He reported receipt of
fees of $21,009 and claimed an allowance due to him of
$6,302.70 (30% of $21,009), following section 2 of Schedule 4.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The Ministry rejected his claim. It took the position
that as Mr. Kowaleski had worked for only a quarter of a year,
he should be paid accordingly. The Ministry approached the
question by multiplying the fees of $21,009 by 4 to get an
annualized figure of $84,036. From this, it subtracted
$75,000, calculated 25% of the excess ($2,259) and divided
that by 4 to produce an excess or claw-back figure for the
first one-quarter of 1993 in the amount of $564.75.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  If Mr. Kowaleski had treated his last report as a
quarterly report, and had filled in the blanks and made the
calculations anticipated by the form, he would have come to
the same conclusion, namely, that he had on his hands an
excess of $564.75 in fees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] When Mr. Kowaleski sued for $6,000 (abandoning his claim
for $302.70 in order to fit into the jurisdiction of the Small
Claims Court), the Ministry counterclaimed for a claw-back of
$564.75. Both claim and counterclaim were dismissed at trial.
The trial judge held that while a strict interpretation of the
Regulation might tend to support Mr. Kowaleski's position, the
result would lead to an absurdity. The trial judge's reasoning
was that, on the basis of Mr. Kowaleski's interpretation, &quot;it
would mean that a bailiff [who] only worked one day and was
terminated, he would be entitled to receive an allowance for
the whole year.&quot;  As to the counterclaim, the trial judge was
not satisfied that it had been proved.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Mr. Kowaleski's appeal was allowed and the Ministry's
cross-appeal dismissed by Fedak J., sitting in the Divisional
Court. He gave no reasons for either disposition. Leave to
appeal was granted by this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The Ministry appealed both the allowance of Mr.
Kowaleski's claim and the disallowance of the Ministry's
counterclaim. The latter, however, was abandoned in this court
so I am not concerned with the question whether any claw-back
is owing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] On behalf of Mr. Kowaleski, it was argued that the trial
judge misread the schedule in reaching the conclusion that the
result would be absurd. I agree. The trial judge assumed that
if a bailiff only worked one day, he would be entitled to
receive an allowance &quot;for the whole year.&quot; That is not what
the schedule provides. It provides that he shall be paid &quot;an
additional allowance equal to 30% of the gross fees earned.&quot;
Thus, if he earned gross fees of $100 in the one day, his
allowance would be based only on that $100 and would amount to
$30 — which cannot be said to be absurd.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Counsel for Mr. Kowaleski also relied upon the definition
of &quot;year&quot; in the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, s.
29(1). That section says that &quot;'year' means a calendar year.&quot;
In my view, this provides no assistance. The question here is
not whether or not the period in question means a &quot;calendar
year.&quot; In addition, s. 29(1) begins with the words &quot;[i]n every
Act, unless the context otherwise requires.&quot; The issue here is
precisely that — does the context otherwise require?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] It was argued on behalf of Her Majesty that, in
interpreting Schedule 4, regard should be had to the purpose
of the Schedule, the context in which this question is raised,
and the consequences of accepting the interpretation urged
upon the court on behalf of Mr. Kowaleski.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] None of these approaches is strongly persuasive. The
context is the abolition of the post of bailiff and the
&quot;conversion&quot; of persons who had been bailiffs to the status of
&quot;enforcement officers&quot; who carry out the same duties as
bailiffs. The conversion came about as a result of a decision
of the Ontario Public Service Labour Relations Tribunal.
Bailiffs were akin to independent contractors, whereas
enforcement officers are employees of the provincial
government.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The purpose of Schedule 4 was to provide for the
remuneration of bailiffs. According to the testimony of Peter
Jackson, an employee of the Courts Administration Division of
the Ministry of the Attorney General, bailiffs were paid by
way of the fees they charged for their services. Those fees
were kept low deliberately to make it less expensive for
litigants in Small Claims courts. Because of the low level of
fees, bailiffs' earnings had to be supplemented. Some of the
bailiffs' offices were large and generated large amounts of
fees. Others were smaller and generated smaller amounts of
fees. Schedule 4 was designed to accommodate a range of sizes
of offices and to provide a balancing or levelling system for
bailiffs' earnings in varying circumstances over time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Bailiffs had worked part years and the allowances paid to
them were calculated on the basis of the part or parts of the
year worked.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The central point of the system was an earnings level of
about $75,000 per year. Accordingly, an interpretation
consistent and supportive of the system would be preferable to
one which would run counter to it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In my view, the language of Schedule 4, and,
specifically, the amounts of $75,000, $45,000 and $60,000,
clearly contemplate amounts of fees earned during a year's
work. Although none of the examples of part years put to the
court could be said to yield absurd or ludicrous results, it
is apparent that Mr. Kowaleski's approach would distort the
intention of the Regulation and of the Legislature.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
order below in favour of Mr. Kowaleski, and restore the trial
judge's order dismissing the claim. The trial judge awarded a
counsel fee of $100 to the Ministry. I would also restore that
order and would dismiss the Ministry's appeal with respect to
its counterclaim but without costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                           - 1 -</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McKINLAY J.A. (dissenting):
[22] I have read the reasons of my colleague. Austin J.A.,
and while I do not take issue with anything he has stated as
background and outline of the argument before us, I do not,
with respect, agree with the result.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In my view, the wording of Schedule 4 of Ontario
Regulation 585/91 is not ambiguous, and does not require the
assistance of context or purpose analysis for its
interpretation. In my view, what the respondent &quot;earned in a
year&quot; in this case was $21,009, and that entitles him to the
amount claimed. Had the result of this clear reading of the
provision been absurd, further consideration might have been
called for but, as pointed out by Austin J.A., the result
was not absurd.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
