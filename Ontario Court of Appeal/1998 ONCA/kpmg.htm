</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  By order dated August 19, 1997, Farley J. declared that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (the “Bank”) had no valid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge as a secured creditor against the sum $66,704.59, together</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with interest, presently being held by the Bank’s solicitors, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust, and that the said funds were to be paid to the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">KPMG Inc. as trustee of the estate of Ralph Ferracuti and Sons,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Builders, Limited, the bankrupt (“Ferracuti and Sons”). The Bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeals from that decision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The issue before the learned motions judge was whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bank could look to a guarantee provided by Ferracuti and Sons as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security for the $150,000 advanced to Deluth Investments Limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(“Deluth”) pursuant to a loan transaction that was separate and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinct from the initial two loan transactions for which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee had been requested and provided. The resolution of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue turned on the proper construction of the guarantee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The motions judge analyzed the guarantee agreement and he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that it did not extend to the $150,000 Deluth loan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction. In coming to this conclusion, he looked beyond the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four corners of the agreement and relied upon the April 22, 1991</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“terms” letter from the Bank to show that the Ferracuti and Sons’</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee was only intended to secure the initial two loans. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge further found that the Bank had, by virtue of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“terms” letter, innocently misrepresented the nature of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee being sought from Ferracuti and Sons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  With respect, we are of the view that the motions judged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in relying upon the “terms” letter to discover the true</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention of the parties to the guarantee agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The cardinal interpretive rule of contracts, including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee contracts, is that the court should give effect to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention of the parties as expressed in their written agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Where that intention is plainly expressed in the language of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement, the court should not stray beyond the four corners of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The language used in the instant guarantee agreement was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plain and straightforward. It suffered from no ambiguity and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent did not suggest otherwise. Subject to a right of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">termination, the guarantee was a continuing one, under which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ferracuti and Sons assumed responsibility for all present and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future debts and liabilities incurred by Deluth, “including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without limitation those in respect of business transactions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the customer [Deluth] and the Bank as well as any other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions by which the customer may become liable to the Bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in any manner whatever (the “customer’s liabilities”).”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  In his reasons for judgment, the motions judge characterized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the wording of the agreement as being both “broad” and “general.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">While we agree that the wording was  broad, it was by no means</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general. To the contrary, it was very specific and it clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">spelled out the intention of the parties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  We note as well that the agreement contained an “entire</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement” clause. While the motions judge reproduced that clause</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in his reasons, he failed to address its significance in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining the use, if any, that he could make of the “terms”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter in determining the intention of the parties to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Given that the intention of the parties was clearly spelled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out in the guarantee agreement, the motions judge erred in using</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the “terms” letter to contradict the plain language of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The remaining question is whether the motions judge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct in finding that the Bank had, by virtue of the “terms”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter, innocently misrepresented the nature of the guarantee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required. With respect, we do not believe that the evidence bears</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out this finding.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The letter in question was addressed to the principal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debtors, not the guarantor, and it is not at all clear that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantor was even aware of the letter when it executed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantee agreement. Thus, there is no clear evidence of reliance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the guarantor on the term letter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Apart from this, there is nothing in the letter to suggest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the guarantee being sought was to be limited to the initial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two loan transactions. Nor did the letter contain any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation that was untrue in fact. Under these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, there is simply no basis for concluding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter created a misimpression in the mind of the guarantor as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the nature of the guarantee being sought and the motions judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in holding otherwise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] For these reasons, we are of the view that the appeal must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be allowed. Accordingly, the order under review is set aside and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in its place an order will go, in accordance with the relief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought in the appellant’s factum, dismissing the trustee’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The Bank is entitled to its costs of the motion and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.</font></pre></td>
