[1]  The appellant attempts to upset the order below annulling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his discharge based on an argument that while he was obliged to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclose property that he received after the order of conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharge was made but before it became final, he was not obliged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by law to deliver that property up to the trustee. While</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledging that he could not take issue with the fact that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had received funds from his father's estate and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds of a life insurance policy on his step-mother's life,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his counsel submitted that since the appellant had disclosed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these receipts to the Trustee, there was no basis in law for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">setting aside the discharge once the conditions had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharged and the discharge had become final. The ability of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trustee to recover these assets was a separate matter that should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not concern the court.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  However, the appellant had made the above disclosures</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because he mistakenly believed that the order of discharge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absolute and that he was entitled to receive and retain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properties. When he realized that he was mistaken, he then took</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the position that, as far as the insurance proceeds were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned, he did not beneficially receive them because he had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acted as trustee on behalf of his children and had remitted the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds to them. The motions judge, quite properly, rejected his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explanation and there was no attempt in this court to argue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the soundness of that finding.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In the circumstances, we agree that the motions judge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct in his finding that the appellant &quot;has failed, even to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this date, to make full disclosure concerning the insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds&quot; and that it was necessary that the discharge of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant be annulled in order to assist the Trustee in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recovering the funds disbursed by the appellant to his children.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
