    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in his
finding of liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    On the question of damages, although we agree that the
respondent is entitled to some compensation, we think that the
trial judge's award was too high.  In addition to some small
mathematical errors that are easily corrected, we are of the view
that the trial judge made three errors of substance in his award.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    First, he permitted the respondent to recover his carrying
costs for the period in question with only a partial offset for
notional occupation rent.  No evidence was led to support a
figure for occupation rent.  Moreover, the respondent has stayed
in the house and enjoyed the benefit of the house without any
apparent effort to seek lower priced accommodation.  In these
circumstances, we think that the occupation rent should be
equivalent to the carrying costs and we therefore make no
allowance for carrying costs in the award.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    Second, the trial judge erred in awarding interest over
the five-year period on the loss in value of the house.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Third, the trial judge erred in awarding an interest rate
of 10% when the average  rate for the period was only 6%.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    In the result, in our opinion, the respondent was entitled
to  damages as follows:
       (1)  $113,000 (the loss in value of the house) plus pre-
            judgment interest of 6% on that amount from January
            1, 1996 to the date of trial; and
       (2)  an amount equal to 6% of $62,000 (the notional net
            proceeds of the loss of sale) from December 1990 to
            the date of trial.
The appeal is allowed in part in accordance with this
endorsement.  The appellant is entitled to 50% of its costs of
the appeal.</font></pre></td>
