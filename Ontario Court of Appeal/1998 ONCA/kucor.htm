          partnership  is a &quot;person liable  to  pay  or
          entitled to redeem&quot; the mortgage and  whether
          the mortgage, which is the subject matter  of
          this application, was &quot;given by a joint stock
          company  or  other corporation&quot;.   Subsidiary
          issues  to be determined are whether  parties
          may  contract  out of the provisions  of  the
          Mortgages Act and the significance,  if  any,
          of  the corporate seal of Kucor being affixed

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  With  respect,  Ground J.'s broad characterization  of  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation,  and application, of s.18 of the  Mortgages  Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  its counterpart, s.10 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1995, c.I-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">15,  to  three mortgages.  As I will elaborate, Robins  J.A.,  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">behalf of the court, held at pp.585 and 591, that the only issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  determine in deciding whether s.18(1) applies to a particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage are by whom the mortgage was &quot;given&quot; within the  meaning</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other corporation&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Instead of focusing on the issues identified by Robins J.A.,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ground J. first considered who was &quot;liable to pay or entitled  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">redeem&quot;  the  mortgage for the purpose of s.18(1).  He  concluded</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;collectively&quot;  were persons liable to pay the  mortgage  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis of their guarantees and, therefore, were entitled to prepay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  mortgage under s.18(1).  He also concluded that there is  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authority  &quot;for the proposition that a limited partnership  is  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">joint  stock company or would be included within the  term  joint</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stock company&quot;.  (p.554)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Ground J. then concluded that a limited partnership is not a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal  entity  capable  of holding title  to  real  property  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgaging it.  His analysis supporting this conclusion  and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissal of the application is found at pp.554-5:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          To  revert to basic legal principles, the law
          regards as persons with distinct and separate
          legal    rights    only    individuals    and
          corporations.    A   partnership    may    be
          recognized  in  law  as  an  association   of
          persons      with     certain     distinctive
          characteristics and one which, in  accordance
          with   rule  8.01  of  the  Rules  of   Civil
          Procedure,    is   entitled    to    commence
          proceedings  or  have  proceedings  commenced
          against  it  in the name of the  partnership.
          The  concept of partnership property is  also
          recognized in law but this does not mean that
          it  is property owned by the partnership  but
          rather  property in which all of the partners
          have   undivided  interests.   In  a  limited
          partnership, the legal title is held  by  the
          general partner for the benefit of all of the
          partners.  None of these factors, in my view,
          constitutes a partnership a legal  entity  or
          person having a separate existence recognized
          in  law  and  accordingly  being  capable  of
          holding  title to property and mortgaging  or
          creating security on such property.  I  find,
          therefore,  that the limited  partnership  is
          incapable  of holding title to the  mortgaged
          property and accordingly the deed from  Kucor
          to  the  limited partnership must be regarded
          as  a  nullity  and  the title  to  the  real
          property  remains with Kucor which holds  the
          property  for  the  benefit  of  all  of  the
          partners  in  the limited partnership.   With
          respect to the mortgage documents, they must,
          in  my  view,  be interpreted as having  been
          entered  into  by  Kucor in its  capacity  as
          general partner of the limited partnership on
          behalf  of  all  of  the partners.   This  is
          consistent  with  the terms  of  the  limited
          partnership agreement and with the resolution
          passed   by  the  partners  authorizing   the
          mortgage.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In addition, the motions judge considered the ability of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties  to  contract out of the provisions  of  s.18(1)  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mortgages Act, although he recognized that this issue was moot as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  result  of his finding that s.18(1) was not available  to  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]  In respect to a procedural point, Ground J. expressed doubt</font></pre>

          be  granted to amend the application to  show
          the  general  partner as  a  co-applicant  on
          behalf  of itself and the individual  limited

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A   limited  partnership  is  a  creation  of
          statute,  consisting of one or  more  general
          partners  and  one or more limited  partners.
          The  limited  partnership  is  an  investment
          vehicle  for  passive investment  by  limited
          partners.   It in essence combines  the  flow
          through   concept  of  tax  depreciation   or
          credits   available  to  &quot;ordinary&quot;  partners
          under  general partnership law  with  limited
          liability  available  to  shareholders  under
          corporate law.  See Ontario LPA sections 2(2)
          and   3(1)  and  Lyle  R.  Hepburn,   Limited
          Partnerships,  (Toronto:  De Boo,  1991),  at
          p.1-2 and p.1-12....A general partner has all
          the  rights and powers and is subject to  all
          the restrictions and liabilities of a partner
          in  a  partnership.  In particular a  general
          partner  is fully liable to each creditor  of
          the business of the limited partnership.  The
          general  partner  has sole control  over  the
          property   and   business  of   the   limited
          partnership:   See Ontario LPA ss.8  and  13.
          Limited  partners  have no liability  to  the
          creditors   of   the  limited   partnership's
          business;  the  limited  partners'  financial
          exposure  is  limited to their  contribution.
          The   limited  partners  do  not   have   any
          &quot;independent&quot;   ownership   rights   in   the
          property  of  the  limited partnership.   The
          entitlement   of  the  limited  partners   is
          limited   to  their  contribution  plus   any
          profits thereon, after satisfaction of claims
          of  the  creditors.  See Ontario LPA sections
          9,  11, 12(1), 13, 15(2) and 24.  The process
          of    debtor   and   creditor   relationships
          associated  with  the  limited  partnership's
          business are between the general partner  and
          the  creditors of the business.  In the event
          of  the  creditors  collecting  on  debt  and
          enforcing  security, the creditors  can  only
          look to the assets of the limited partnership
          together  with  the  assets  of  the  general
          partner   including  the  general   partner's
          interest  in  the limited partnership.   This
          relationship   is   recognized   under    the
          Bankruptcy Act (now the BIA) sections 85  and
          142.</font></pre>

          limited  partnership in the  ordinary  course

          completely  passive role (they must  or  they
          will  otherwise lose their limited  liability
          protection  which would have been their  sole

          vehicle   as   opposed   to   an   &quot;ordinary&quot;
          partnership vehicle)....The limited  partners
          leave  the  running of the  business  to  the
          general partner and in that respect the care,
          custody  and the maintenance of the property,
          assets   and   undertaking  of  the   limited
          partnership in which the limited partners and
          the  general  partner hold an interest.   The
          ownership   of   this   limited   partnership
          property,  assets  and  undertaking   is   an
          undivided interest which cannot be segregated
          for   the  purpose  of  legal  process....The
          limited  partners have two courses of  action
          to  take  if they are dissatisfied  with  the
          general  partner  or  the  operation  of  the
          limited  partnership as  carried  on  by  the
          general  partner - the limited  partners  can
          vote  to  (a) remove the general partner  and
          replace  it with another or (b) dissolve  the
          limited partnership....

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39]  To  resolve the problem, it is necessary to  determine  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause this court any difficulty as the record, which contains  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disputed evidence, points to only one conclusion.  From the  land</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer tax affidavit in the deed, it is learned that Kucor Ltd.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had  acquired the property in trust for a limited partnership  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  formed and that the intent and purpose of the conveyance were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  convey the land to the limited partnership which, as  I  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated, had been formed.  The difficulty, of course, was  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the grantee should not have been the limited partnership as such.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It  should  have been either the general partner, or all  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partners.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]  In  my  view,  the intent of the deed  was  to  convey  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  from Kucor Ltd., which had acquired it in trust  for  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited  partnership to be formed, to itself in its  capacity  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  general partner of the limited partnership.  Any doubt  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  was the intent of the deed is resolved by the mortgage  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  extension.   The mortgage and the extension agreements  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executed  by Kucor Ltd., in its capacity as general partner.   If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  deed had been intended to be a deed to each limited partner,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then each of them would necessarily have executed these documents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  mortgagors, whereas they executed them as guarantors.   Thus,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]  Although  by the form of the conveyance the  deed  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">capable  of  fulfilling its intended purpose, taking a functional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach, based on the above analysis it is clear that in fact it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did.   Its purpose was to regularize the commercial reality  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the land was no longer solely the property of Kucor Ltd., but was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the property of the limited partnership, and that in its capacity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  general partner, Kucor Ltd. held title to it on behalf of all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  partners.  In my view, it was unnecessary to treat the  deed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  a nullity.  It should be regarded as an ill-conceived attempt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  convey  title to the limited partnership.  As this  could  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accomplished either by a conveyance to the general partner, or to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion  is  found in 68 Corpus Juris Secundum, &quot;Partnership&quot;,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">506-507  where it is stated that a deed to a limited  partnership</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]  In the passage from Ground J.'s reasons which I have quoted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  paragraph  [24], he expressed the view that  the  application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;may  be  technically flawed&quot; as it was commenced by the  limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partnership  rather than by the general partner.   As  a  limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partnership is a partnership,  rule 8.01(1) of the Rules of Civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Procedure applies.  It states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.01(1)   A  proceeding by or against two  or
                    more  persons  as partners  may  be
                    commenced  using the firm  name  of
                    the partnership.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Neither  the Partnerships Act, nor the Limited Partnerships  Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affects  the application of this rule.  Because a partnership  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  a  legal entity, it has no capacity to sue or be sued,  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  result  that proceedings must be brought by or  against  all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">members  of  the  partnership  individually.   To  overcome   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practical  problems  of litigation involving  partnerships  whose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">membership  is  large,  or when some partners  live  outside  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction, rule 8.01(1), and its predecessors, was  introduced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  recognize a partnership as a legal entity for the  procedural</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose  of  suing  or  being  sued  in  the  firm  name  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partnership.  See G.D. Watson, S. Borins, N.J. Williams, Canadian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Civil  Procedure,  (1973, Butterworths)  560-563.   Although  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">choice  remains whether a proceeding will be brought in the  name</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the partnership or in the name of the individual partners, it</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1923), 54 D.L.R. 640 (C.A.).  Therefore, it is my view that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application  was properly commenced in the name  of  the  limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partnership  and it would be improper to add the general  partner</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] As a result of my conclusion that the mortgage was given  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  corporation and that, therefore, s.18(1) of the Mortgages  Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has  no  application,  it is unnecessary to  consider  whether  a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44]  Considerable  argument was directed to  whether  the  short</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage was not open for repayment before its maturity.  It  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the position of the appellant that this provision was inoperative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the  authority of the decision of this court in the  Litowitz</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter of public policy it cannot be contracted out of or waived.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">On  the  other hand, the respondents took the position that  this</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial mortgages, such as the mortgage in this appeal.  In my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion, this is an issue which it is unnecessary to consider, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  decide,  because of my conclusion that s.18(2) precludes  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45]  In  the  Litowitz  case, this court  heard  together  three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeals  involving different factual situations,  concerning  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of s.18 of the Mortgages Act and s.10 of the Interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act.   For the sake of convenience, I will refer to them  as  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Litowitz,  the Vale and the Glied appeals.  In each  appeal,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagor sought a declaration that it was entitled to  prepay  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">long-term closed commercial mortgage.  In none of the appeals was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mortgagor a limited partnership.  As I have indicated, in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons  for judgment Robins J.A. provided a thorough and helpful</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discussion  of the history, the evolution and the policy  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant legislation at pp.582-7.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The circumstances of the Litowitz appeal closely approximate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those  of  this appeal.  In Litowitz, the project in  respect  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which  the mortgage was given was promoted by a prospectus  as  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multi-unit  residential apartment building (&quot;MURB&quot;) and  involved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   construction,  ownership  and  operation  of  a   20-storey</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apartment building.  By way of the issue of securities, some  310</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">units  of  ownership were sold, mainly to individuals.   However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  property was owned by a corporation, which gave the mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was the subject of the application.  As in this appeal, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unitholders   chose   to  conduct  their   business   through   a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation.  In my view, the reasoning applied by Robins J.A. at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pp.591-594  in  holding that s.18(2) precluded  prepayment  under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.18(1)   has  direct  application  to  this  appeal.   I   would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respectfully adopt and apply his reasoning.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47]  In this appeal, the limited partners chose to conduct their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business  through  a  general partner, Kucor  Ltd.,  which  is  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation.  There is no question that the general  partner  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorized by the limited partners to arrange the financing  and,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the Limited Partnerships Act, was empowered and required to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do  so.  Therefore, it was intended that the mortgage would be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation  enforceable against the general  partner.   The  fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  beneficial ownership of the property was  made  up  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited  partners  who  were individual, non-corporate  investors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not detract from the fact that the mortgage was given by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate  general partner, and accordingly, does not remove  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage from the exemption in s.18(2) of the Mortgages  Act,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitle  the  limited partners to the right of  prepayment  under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.18(1).   It  is  not  appropriate to look  past  the  corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entity.   Lenders  are  entitled to rely on  title  documents  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine  the mortgagor's prepayment rights.  The mortgage  was,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  remains, a mortgage given by a corporation, with the  result</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that prepayment is precluded by s.18(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Assuming, without deciding, that because of their individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantees  of the mortgage the limited partners may be  &quot;persons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liable  to pay or entitled to redeem&quot; the mortgage under s.18(1),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  essential  question in the application of s.18  remains  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identity  of the person, or entity, that gave the mortgage.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion  of Robins J.A. in Litowitz at p.594 is determinative  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this issue:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The  scope of the right of prepayment is cast
          so  as to include anyone who is liable to pay
          or  entitled to redeem a mortgage.   However,
          this right is subject to the exemption clause
          - and that clause is based on the identity of
          the  party who gives a mortgage.  A  mortgage
          can  be  given only by a titleholder and,  if
          the  titleholder is a corporation, a mortgage
          given  by the corporation will, by virtue  of
          the   exemption,   be   excluded   from   the
          protection afforded by s-s.(1).  Liability to
          pay  or  entitlement to redeem a mortgage  is
          not   the   criterion  for  determining   the
          applicability of s-s.(1).  Thus, accepting as
          I  do  that  the unitholders may be  &quot;persons
          liable  to  pay or entitled to  redeem&quot;,  the
          fact  that  the  mortgages were  given  by  a
          company  precludes them from  exercising  the
          prepayment  rights  to which  they  would  be
          entitled had the mortgage been given by a non-
          corporate mortgagor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49]  In  the  first paragraph of my reasons, I stated  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue   raised  by  this  appeal  is  whether,  or   under   what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances,  a  limited partner is entitled  to  rely  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statutory right of prepayment in s.18(1) to discharge a long-term</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">closed  commercial mortgage purported to have been given  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited partnership.  I would respond to this issue as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (1)  A  limited  partnership, because  it  is  not  a  legal</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          gives  a  mortgage  is precluded by  s.18(2)  from  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          operation  of s.18(1) and, therefore, cannot  prepay  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          long-term closed mortgage.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (3)  A  general  partner  which is an individual  and  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          gives   a  mortgage  is  not  subject  to  the  s.18(2)</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          for  the  entire mortgage debt, is not subject  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s.18(2)  exemption,  and,  therefore,  is  entitled  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          prepay the mortgage.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (5)  The   fact  that  a  mortgage  is  a  long-term  closed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          commercial  mortgage is not relevant to the application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          of  s.18(2).  The relevant issue is the identity of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          person who gave the mortgage.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50]  For all of the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed  with</font></pre>
