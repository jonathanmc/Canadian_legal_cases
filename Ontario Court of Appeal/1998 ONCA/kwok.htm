CHARRON J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.   Overview</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Paul Yick Wai Kwok faces extradition proceedings to the
United States of America on two drug charges. Wein J. committed
him for extradition and the Minister of Justice (“the Minister”)
ordered his surrender on both charges. Kwok appeals against the
committal order and seeks a judicial review of the Minister’s
decision.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Kwok concedes that the requesting state has presented
sufficient evidence to warrant a committal. However, he argues
that the committal and the surrender orders should be quashed and
the matter sent back for reconsideration following appropriate
disclosure and review of material relevant to his right, as a
citizen of Canada, “to remain in Canada”, as guaranteed by s.6(1)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Kwok sought disclosure of this additional material before
the extradition judge and again before the Minister and his
request was refused at both stages of the extradition process.
His application for disclosure becomes pivotal to both the appeal
and the application for judicial review because he claims that,
without access to the requested material, the effect of a
surrender on his s.6(1) mobility rights cannot be properly
assessed. Kwok also raises an issue as to the appropriate forum
for the consideration of his intended Charter application.</font></pre>
    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">B.   The Allegations and the Proceedings Below</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Kwok is a citizen of Canada. The request for extradition
relates to allegations that Kwok, while in Canada, supplied
heroin from Canada on numerous occasions to co-conspirators who
distributed that heroin within the United States, and that, on
numerous other occasions while not supplying heroin, he played a
critical role in bringing together customers and suppliers and
received a share of the resulting profits.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  A significant portion of the evidence in the American
prosecution is in the form of intercepted telephone conversations
involving various co-conspirators, including Kwok, who himself
remained in Canada throughout the relevant period. At the time of
these interceptions by the American authorities, Kwok was also
the object of two authorizations to intercept private
communications granted in Canada. As part of the investigation by
the American authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(“F.B.I.”) sought and received information regarding Kwok from
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“R.C.M.P.”).  The R.C.M.P.
also volunteered information to the F.B.I. about their own
ongoing investigation into Kwok’s activities and conducted
regular surveillance of Kwok and his residence during the
relevant period of time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In September 1995, a grand jury in New York returned an
indictment with one count of conspiracy to distribute and to
possess with intent to distribute heroin and in October 1995, a
second count of conspiracy to import heroin into the United
States. The United States of America sought Kwok’s extradition by
Diplomatic Note dated November 14, 1995. Before the commencement
of the extradition hearing, Kwok sought from Crown counsel in
Canada, acting on behalf of the requesting state, “complete
disclosure of [the] Canadian police investigation”, including the
applicable authorizations and affidavits used to obtain the
authorizations. Crown counsel refused to provide disclosure on
the basis that the American prosecution was not relying on the
fruits of the Canadian investigation, nor did it intend to rely
on this evidence in the future.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Kwok therefore brought an application for disclosure before
the extradition judge and requested the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This Application seeks an order directing
          disclosure of all of the Canadian
          investigation into the Applicant’s alleged
          involvement in the trafficking of narcotics,
          all discussions between Canadian police and
          American investigating authorities, and all
          discussions between Canadian police and both
          Canadian and American prosecuting authorities
          concerning the decision by which Canadian
          proceedings against the Applicant were not
          initiated, in favour of American charges
          being initiated instead. This material is
          directly relevant to the Applicant’s claim
          that his extradition to the United States in
          connection with the outstanding charges
          violates his right to remain in Canada,
          pursuant to s.6 of the Charter of Rights and
          Freedoms, in that the allegations subsumed in
          the outstanding American charges are properly
          prosecutable in Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The extradition judge dismissed the application for
disclosure. She held that the disclosure which was sought fell
outside the limited scope of disclosure to which a fugitive is
entitled in the context of extradition hearings.  Further, she
held that any application under s.6(1) of the Charter would be
either premature or beyond the function of the extradition judge.
Finally, the extradition judge refused to exercise any residual
discretion she might have to order disclosure for the purpose of
preparing submissions to the Minister.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The extradition hearing proceeded and Kwok was committed for
extradition under s.18 of the Extradition Act, R.S., c. E-21;
R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203; S.C. 1992, c. 13, s. 2
(“the Act”). A certificate of the committal and the evidence was
transmitted to the Minister pursuant to s.19 of the Act for his
consideration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Following his committal, Kwok renewed his request for
disclosure by letter to counsel acting on behalf of the Minister.
His request was refused. In his later submissions to the Minister
made pursuant to s.19.1 of the Act, Kwok raised his concerns
about the application of s.6(1) of the Charter as a primary issue
and argued that he could not make effective representations on
this issue without access to the requested material. He outlined
the gist of his position on this matter and, in addition,
provided information about ongoing settlement negotiations with
the American prosecuting authorities whereby the extradition
proceedings would be withdrawn in return for Kwok’s plea of
guilty to Canadian charges and his undertaking to testify in
American proceedings against other persons. The negotiations were
not yet completed at the time the submissions were made to the
Minister and no further evidence on this matter is before the
court. In his submissions, Kwok also raised a secondary issue
which does not form part of the application for judicial review
in this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In his reasons for surrender, the Minister rejected Kwok’s
submission that he was unable to make effective representations
without the requested disclosure. After reviewing relevant
jurisprudence, the Minister noted that the American authorities
confirmed that they had not relied upon any Canadian wiretaps in
the investigation of Kwok and that it was not their intention to
do so in the future. Hence the Minister was satisfied that Kwok
had been provided with adequate disclosure of the case and that
he had been given an opportunity to state his case. He proceeded
to consider Kwok’s mobility rights and concluded that his
surrender to the requesting state would not be unconstitutional.
The Minister made no reference in his reasons to the additional
information about ongoing settlement negotiations. The Minister
also dismissed the second concern raised in the submissions.
Having determined that there was no ground which would allow him
to refuse extradition, the Minister signed the warrants ordering
Kwok’s immediate surrender.</font></pre>
    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.   The Issues Before This Court</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] On his appeal from the committal order, Kwok argues that the
extradition judge erred in refusing his application for
disclosure. He submits that the requested material was necessary
to enable him to effectively assert his rights in relation to the
extradition process and that, consequently, he had a right to the
requested disclosure at the extradition hearing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Kwok argues further that the extradition judge erred in
finding that any potential s.6(1) Charter application was either
premature or beyond the purview of the extradition hearing. He
submits that s.9(3) of the Act confers this Charter jurisdiction
upon the extradition judge and that the extradition hearing is
the appropriate forum for the determination of all Charter issues
arising out of the extradition process. Section 9(3) was enacted
in 1992 and it provides as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s.9(3) For the purposes of the Constitution
          Act, 1982, a judge who is a superior court
          judge or a county court judge has, with
          respect to the functions that that judge is
          required to perform in applying this Act, the
          same competence that that judge possesses by
          virtue of being a superior court judge or a
          county court judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In support of this contention, Kwok relies heavily on the
decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in U.S.A. v. Cazzetta
(1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 536 (Que. C.A.), leave to appeal refused
on December 5, 1996. The court in Cazzetta interpreted s.9(3) as
conferring upon the extradition judge an extensive Charter
jurisdiction. A brief mention of the legislative history may
assist in understanding the gist of the finding in Cazzetta and
consequently, the thrust of Kwok’s position on this issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Prior to the amendments to the Act that came into force on
December 1, 1992, it was well settled that the extradition
judge’s jurisdiction was akin to that of a preliminary inquiry
judge and that it did not include the power to adjudicate on
Charter issues.  In the “rare cases where the actions of Canadian
executives or officials may give rise to the need for Charter
review” the matter could properly be brought by application for
habeas corpus before a superior court judge: see Republic of
Argentina v. Mellino (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 334 at 352 and
generally at 349-354 (S.C.C.). With the enactment of s.9(3), the
functions of both the extradition judge and of the habeas corpus
judge are now collapsed into one and can be exercised by the
extradition judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In Cazzetta, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the
meaning of the words “with respect to the functions that that
judge is required to perform in applying this Act” in s.9(3)
should be given a broad meaning and that it would be a mistake to
limit this jurisdiction solely to issues concerning the
extradition judge’s role in determining the sufficiency of the
evidence produced. The Court stated that  one “must be leery” of
the cases dealing with the jurisdiction of the extradition judge
prior to the 1992 amendments. The Court was of the view that
there must always be a court of competent jurisdiction to grant
and enforce a remedy where a Charter right is infringed and that
the Minister of Justice, despite his role under the Act, cannot
fulfill this function. Consequently, the court held that the
extradition hearing was the appropriate forum to determine
whether the fugitive’s rights under s.6 and s.7 of the Charter
were violated as a result of the conduct of Canadian officials.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Kwok urges this court to adopt the reasoning in Cazzetta. He
therefore submits that the extradition judge has the power to
grant a stay of the extradition proceedings where the surrender
of the fugitive would constitute a violation of any of his rights
guaranteed under the Charter. Kwok concedes that any such
judicial order would effectively pre-empt the executive in the
exercise of its role under the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Kwok raises related issues in his application for judicial
review. He argues that the Minister erred in refusing his request
for disclosure and reiterates his argument that the extradition
hearing is the appropriate forum to determine whether his
surrender would result in an infringement of his mobility rights.
He argues further that the Minister erred in failing to give
appropriate consideration to the s.6(1) concerns raised in this
case.</font></pre>
    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">D.   Analysis and Disposition</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In my view, the extradition judge and the Minister were
correct in denying Kwok’s request for additional disclosure. The
material sought by Kwok fell outside the scope of disclosure to
which a fugitive is entitled in extradition proceedings. Kwok’s
submission in this court that the underlying rationale for
imposing a duty of disclosure upon the state, as recognized by
the Supreme Court in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, is
directly applicable to extradition proceedings runs counter to
settled authority. Reference need only be made to U.S.A. v. Dynar
(1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) on this issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Kwok requested this disclosure in anticipation of a
potential application for a stay of the extradition proceedings
on the ground that his surrender to the requesting state would
constitute a breach of his s.6(1) Charter mobility rights. The
only remedy sought on the appeal and on the application for
judicial review is a reconsideration of the committal and the
surrender decision in light of the new information which may be
uncovered as a result of this disclosure. I can only infer from
the remedy sought that Kwok essentially concedes that, without
this evidentiary basis, his claim to a s.6(1) Charter breach is
without support. However, whether this conclusion is conceded or
not, it is, in my view, the only result which can follow on the
facts of this case from the application of the principles in the
leading case on mobility rights and extradition, U.S.A. v.
Cotroni (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In accordance with Cotroni, the question whether Kwok’s
mobility rights would be infringed by his surrender to the
requesting state was one for the Minister to consider. In my
view, s.6(1) considerations are not engaged at the committal
stage and, consequently, I am of the view that the extradition
judge was correct in her conclusion that any application based on
s.6(1) Charter rights would be premature and, in any event,
beyond her jurisdiction as extradition judge. With the greatest
of respect, I believe Cazzetta was wrongly decided. The Supreme
Court of Canada decision in Dynar, which was decided after
Cazzetta, is instructive on this issue. While the Court in Dynar
did not find it necessary to define the scope of the Charter
jurisdiction conferred upon the extradition judge by s.9(3), it
is clear from the reasons in the majority judgment that the pre-
amendment cases on the modest role of the judiciary in the
extradition process are still applicable. Whatever Charter
jurisdiction is conferred upon the extradition judge by s.9(3)
must be read in the light of this limited role.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In the result, I am not satisfied that there are any grounds
to warrant interference with either the committal or the
surrender order. I will review some of the relevant jurisprudence
in support of these conclusions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     <strong>1. The appeal against committal</strong></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] As I have indicated, I find the recent decision of the
Supreme Court in Dynar instructive on both the disclosure and the
jurisdictional issues. In my view, reference need only be made to
this case to dispose of the appeal. Much of the reasoning on the
cross-appeal in Dynar is apposite to this case and I will
therefore make extensive reference to the majority judgment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The cross-appeal in Dynar raises issues that are similar in
many respects to those raised in this proceeding. Dynar, a
Canadian citizen, faced extradition proceedings to the United
States based on alleged criminal activities conducted in Canada.
In support of the request for extradition, the United States
relied solely on evidence gathered by the American authorities.
However, there was evidence of some involvement in the
investigation by the Canadian authorities. Dynar argued that, in
order to receive a fair committal hearing, he was entitled to
full disclosure of all materials gathered in the course of the
investigation in the possession of the requesting state or the
Canadian authorities. More specifically, he sought disclosure of
information regarding the involvement of the Canadian authorities
in the investigation with a view to establishing a violation of
his Charter rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The authorities refused to make the requested disclosure.
Consequently, Dynar submitted that this lack of disclosure
justified a new hearing at which full disclosure should be given,
which in turn might provide him with the basis for arguing that a
stay of proceedings should be granted or alternatively, that the
evidence should be excluded because it was gathered in violation
of his s.8 Charter right to be free from unreasonable search and
seizure. It is not clear from the reasons on what ground Dynar
expected his potential request for a stay would be based, however
mention is made at p.491 that his counsel, in his submissions to
the Minister, argued that Dynar should be prosecuted in Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The Supreme Court noted  that the essence of Dynar’s
argument on the issue of disclosure was that an attenuated
version of the rules in Stinchcombe and other relevant cases
should apply. The court rejected this argument. While it is clear
that the extradition hearing must be conducted in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice, these principles vary
according to the context of the proceedings in which they are
raised. The court reviewed the nature of the extradition hearing
as part of the two-step process for determining whether a
particular fugitive should be surrendered to a foreign
jurisdiction for trial (at p. 520):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The first step, the committal hearing, is the
          judicial phase of the process in which the
          fugitive is brought before a judge who
          determines whether the evidence justifies the
          surrender of the fugitive. If the Requesting
          State has made out its case, the fugitive is
          committed. If not, the fugitive is
          discharged. If the fugitive is committed for
          surrender, the warrant of committal, as well
          as any report from the judge presiding over
          the committal hearing, is forwarded to the
          Minister of Justice, who then makes the final
          decision whether the fugitive should be
          surrendered. This second phase of the process
          is political in nature...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
The court in discussing some of the relevant jurisprudence,
including cases decided before the 1992 amendments to the Act,
reiterated that the judicial role is a limited one and that an
importation of “trial-like” procedures was inappropriate  (at p.
521):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The jurisdiction of the extradition judge is
          derived entirely from the statute and the
          relevant treaty. Pursuant to s.3 of the Act,
          the statute must be interpreted as giving
          effect to the terms of the applicable treaty.
          La Forest J., writing for the majority in
          [Re] McVey [[1992] 2 S.C.R. 475] at p.519,
          stated that courts must find a statutory
          source for attributing a particular function
          to the extradition judge, and that “courts
          should not reach out to bring within their
          jurisdictional ambit matters that the Act has
          not assigned them”. In particular, it was
          held in Republic of Argentina v. Mellino,
          [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536 at p.553, 33 C.C.C. (3d)
          334, 40 D.L.R. (4th) 74 that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               absent express statutory or treaty
               authorization, the sole purpose of an
               extradition hearing is to ensure that
               the evidence establishes a prima facie
               case that the extradition crime has been
               committed.[Emphasis added in Dynar.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As a result, the role of the extradition
          judge has been held to be a “modest one”,
          limited to the determination of whether or
          not the evidence is sufficient to justify
          committing the fugitive for surrender: see
          for example, United States of America v.
          Lépine, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 286 at p.296, 87
          C.C.C. (3d) 385, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 31;
          Mellino, supra, at p.553; McVey, supra, at
          p.526.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               One of the most important functions of
          the extradition hearing is the protection of
          the liberty of the individual. It ensures
          that an individual will not be surrendered
          for trial in a foreign jurisdiction unless,
          as previously mentioned, the Requesting State
          presents evidence that demonstrates on a
          prima facie basis that the individual has
          committed acts in the foreign jurisdiction
          that would constitute criminal conduct in
          Canada. ...The extradition judge may also
          have limited Charter jurisdiction under
          s.9(3) of the amended Extradition Act,
          although it is not necessary to delineate the
          scope of that jurisdiction in this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               A judge hearing an application for
          extradition has an important role to fulfil.
          Yet it cannot be forgotten that the hearing
          is intended to be an expedited process,
          designed to keep expenses to a minimum and
          ensure prompt compliance with Canada’s
          international obligations. As La Forest J.
          stated for the majority in McVey, supra, at
          p.551, “extradition proceedings are not
          trials. They are intended to be expeditious
          procedures to determine whether a trial
          should be held.” In fact, in some contexts, a
          requirement for more “trial-like” procedures
          at the extradition committal stage may
          “cripple the operation of the extradition
          proceedings”: McVey, supra, at p.528.  See
          also Schmidt [[1987] 1 S.C.R. 500] at p.516.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The court recognized that the Charter applies to extradition
proceedings but only in so far as the “Canadian state actors” are
concerned. The Minister’s discretion in deciding to surrender can
also attract Charter scrutiny. The court cautioned however
against unwarranted judicial intervention  (at p. 522):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Even where there is a sufficient involvement
          of Canadian authorities in the proceedings to
          justify applying the Charter, courts must
          proceed with caution. It has been observed
          that “judicial intervention must be limited
          to cases of real substance”: Schmidt, supra,
          at p.523. To do otherwise might all too
          easily place Canada in a position of
          violating its international obligations: see
          La Forest’s Extradition,...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] More specifically on the issue of disclosure, the court
confirmed earlier cases where it was established that it is
neither necessary nor appropriate to transplant into the
extradition process all the disclosure requirements referred to
in Stinchcombe and similar cases. The court stated (at p.524-25):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The statutory powers of an extradition judge
          are limited. The hearing judge may receive
          sworn evidence offered to show the truth of
          the charge or conviction (s.14), receive
          evidence to show that the particular crime is
          not an extradition crime (s.15), and take
          into account sworn, duly authenticated
          depositions or statements taken in a foreign
          state (s.16). The obligation on the
          Requesting State is simply to establish a
          prima facie case for the surrender of the
          fugitive and it not required to go further
          than this. The committal hearing is neither
          intended nor designed to provide the
          discovery function of a domestic preliminary
          inquiry. See Philippines (Republic of) v.
          Pacificador (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 321(C.A.),
          at pp.328-39, 83 C.C.C. (3d) 210, leave to
          appeal refused, [1994] 1 S.C.R. x, 87 C.C.C.
          (3d) vi. Specifically, disclosure of the
          relationship between United States and
          Canadian authorities in an investigation is
          not a requirement imposed on the Requesting
          State under either the Act or the treaty.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Any requirement for disclosure that is
          read into the Act as a matter of fundamental
          justice under s.7 of the Charter will
          therefore necessarily be constrained by the
          limited function of the extradition judge
          under the Act, and by the need to avoid
          imposing Canadian notions of procedural
          fairness on foreign authorities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Requesting State concedes that the
          fugitive is entitled to know the case against
          him.... In light of the purpose of the
          hearing, however, this would simply entitle
          him to disclosure of materials on which the
          Requesting State is relying to establish its
          prima facie case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and at p. 528:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Mr. Dynar was entitled to a fair hearing
          before the extradition judge, and in our
          opinion he received one. He was not entitled
          to disclosure from the Requesting State
          beyond the production of the evidence that it
          was relying upon to establish its prima facie
          case. In any event, the evidence provided by
          the Requesting State did contain sufficient
          information to conclude that the evidence was
          gathered entirely in the United States, by
          American officials, for an American trial. It
          follows that no justiciable Charter issue can
          arise in this case. In these circumstances, a
          new hearing is simply not justified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] The court also found that Dynar was not entitled to
additional disclosure from the Canadian authorities (at p.528):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...  Since no justiciable Charter issue can
          arise from the potential involvement of the
          Canadian authorities in the gathering of
          evidence in this case, it is not necessary to
          consider the degree of disclosure that might
          be required in other circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Similarly, it is not necessary to resolve the
          scope of the jurisdiction of the extradition
          judge under s.9(3) of the amended Extradition
          Act in a case where sufficient Canadian state
          involvement could be demonstrated. Perhaps it
          will suffice to observe that as a result of
          the enactment of the section, the extradition
          judge is a “court of competent jurisdiction”
          pursuant to s.24 of the Charter, provided
          that the presiding judge normally fulfills
          that function.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In my view, the same result should follow on the appeal in this
case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Kwok was entitled to know the case against him at the
extradition hearing. This entitled him to disclosure of the
material on which the requesting state is relying to establish
its prima facie case. The requesting state was not and is not
relying on any of the material sought on the application for
disclosure. There was therefore no obligation on the requesting
state to provide further disclosure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Further, there was no justiciable issue raised at the
extradition hearing. Section 6(1) mobility rights are not engaged
at the committal stage of the extradition proceedings. They are
only engaged in the Minister’s decision to surrender. The
requested disclosure was only relevant to s.6(1) issues. Given
the limited purpose of the extradition hearing as confirmed in
Dynar, the extradition judge was correct in dismissing Kwok’s
application for disclosure and in refusing to embark upon a
discovery process into mobility rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Since it is conceded that the committal is otherwise
justified on the evidence, I would dismiss the appeal from the
committal order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     <strong>2. The application for judicial review of the surrender
decision</strong></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] Kwok’s application for judicial review is also focussed on
the effect of the surrender decision on his right to remain in
Canada. A fugitive’s mobility rights under s.6(1) of the Charter
are engaged in the decision to surrender: Cotroni. It is
therefore incumbent upon the Minister, who is bound to act in
accordance with the Charter, to consider the effect of his
decision on the fugitive’s s.6(1) rights. His decision is
reviewable by the courts. However, Kwok concedes that the
appropriate standard of review is one of deference: see U.S.A. v.
Whitley (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 (Ont. C.A.); affirmed (1996),
104 C.C.C. (3d) 447 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Kwok submits that the Minister breached principles of
natural justice in refusing to provide him with disclosure of the
involvement of the Canadian authorities, in the investigation and
in the decision to permit the extradition proceeding to go
forward as opposed to instituting Canadian proceedings. He argues
that, without this material, he cannot assess whether his s.6
rights were infringed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Kwok argues further that it was incumbent upon the Minister
personally to consider whether prosecution in Canada for the
alleged criminal conduct would be “a realistic option” or
“equally effective”. He submits that in the absence of evidence
that it is not, his surrender constitutes a breach of his s.6(1)
rights which cannot be justified under s.1 of the Charter. Kwok
relies on the following passage in the majority judgment in
Cotroni in support of his argument (at p. 225):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Of course, the authorities must give due
          weight to the constitutional right of a
          citizen to remain in Canada. They must in
          good faith direct their minds to whether
          prosecution would be equally effective in
          Canada, given the existing domestic laws and
          international co-operative arrangements. They
          have an obligation flowing from s.6(1) to
          assure themselves that prosecution in Canada
          is not a realistic option. As the court
          observed in Beare [(1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 57
          at 76 (S.C.C.)], “if, in a particular case,
          it was established that a discretion was
          exercised for improper or arbitrary motives,
          a remedy under s.24 of the Charter would
          lie”...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kwok submits that the Minister did not give due consideration to
this matter and that he, in effect, delegated the task to local
prosecutors. Finally, he submits that the Minister erred in his
assessment of the scope and effect of Article 17 of the Canada-
U.S. Extradition Treaty (by Protocol dated Janury 11, 1988,
Article VII) (&quot;the Treaty&quot;).  Section 17 reads as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               If both contracting Parties have
          jurisdiction to prosecute the person for the
          offense for which extradition is sought, the
          executive authority of the requested State,
          after consulting with the executive authority
          of the requesting State, shall decide whether
          to extradite the person or to submit the case
          to its competent authorities for the purpose
          of prosecution.  In making its decision, the
          requested State shall consider all relevant
          factors, including but not limited to:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)  the place where the act was committed or
               intended to be committed or the injury
               occurred or was intended to occur;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) the respective interests of the
               Contracting Parties;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iii)     the nationality of the victim or
               the intended victim; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iv) the availability and location of the
               evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Minister’s reasons on the question of mobility rights read as
follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Mr. Kwok's surrender is governed by the
          principles laid down in the Supreme Court of
          Canada decision in U.S.A. v. Cotroni ... The
          Supreme Court of Canada found that
          extradition is a reasonable limit to the
          Canadian citizen's right to remain in Canada
          even if that person could be charged in
          Canada in relation to the facts supporting
          the request for extradition.  The Court
          determined that &quot;the infringement to s. 6(1)
          that results from extradition lies at the
          outer edges of the core values sought to be
          protected by that provision&quot; and since the
          objectives of extradition are essential to
          the maintenance of a free and democratic
          society&quot;, they &quot;warrant the limited
          interference with the right guaranteed by
          s. 6(1) to remain in Canada&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               There is no charge pending in Canada
          against Mr. Kwok in relation to the conduct
          for which his extradition is requested.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I am informed that my authorized
          representatives in the Ontario Regional
          Office - Toronto, acting on my behalf in my
          capacity as Attorney General of Canada, the
          competent authority to conduct a prosecution
          against Mr. Kwok in this matter, have
          considered this case in view of the dicta of
          the Supreme Court of Canada in U.S.A. v.
          Cotroni and decided not to proceed with
          prosecution in Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               My role as Minister of Justice acting
          under section 25 of the Extradition Act is
          not to revisit that discretionary decision of
          the prosecution.  However, I must ensure that
          the surrender of Mr. Kwok would be in
          accordance with the Charter.  In that
          respect, I have noted that the United States
          has a clear interest in prosecuting this case
          and it is appropriate that your client be
          prosecuted where most of the acts in
          furtherance of the offences took place,
          charges are pending and the evidence is
          either located or available.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               While the actions of Mr. Kwok and those
          involved with him in this criminal activity
          may create a Canadian interest in a
          prosecution, this interest does not limit
          that of the United States which in this case
          is greater as most of the actions in
          furtherance of the alleged crime were
          committed there.  Canada and the United
          States have an interest in stopping and
          prosecuting those involved in the pursuit of
          a drug enterprise.  Extradition is, for this
          purpose, an important tool of cooperation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Article 17 (bis) provides a procedure
          for consultation which the contracting states
          may choose to follow when both have
          jurisdiction to prosecute a fugitive with
          respect to the same conduct.  Article 17
          (bis) does not create a right which can be
          claimed by the fugitive.  It does not limit,
          suppress or alter my discretion to decide
          whether or not to order surrender.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In the circumstances, I have concluded
          that, with reference to his right to remain
          in Canada, to surrender Mr. Kwok to the
          United States of America would not be
          unconstitutional.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In my view, the main thrust of Kwok’s argument is ill-
founded. It does not follow from Cotroni that, in the absence of
positive evidence that prosecution in Canada is not “a realistic
option” or that it would not be “equally effective”, a surrender
is unconstitutional. La Forest J.’s reasons in the passage relied
upon must be considered in context.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] First, his reasons do not at all detract from the fact that
the decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute in this country
but to allow the authorities in another country to seek
extradition, is one of prosecutorial discretion. This decision
may involve the consideration of several factors which include a
consideration of Canada’s international obligations. These
factors are set out by Hanssen J. in Swystun v. United States of
America (1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 222 (Man. Q.B.) and are reviewed
by La Forest J. in his reasons in Cotroni (at p. 225):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - where was the impact of the offence felt or likely to
       have been felt;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - which jurisdiction has the greater interest in
       prosecuting the offence;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - which police force played the major role in the
       development of the case;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - which jurisdiction has laid charges;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - which jurisdiction has the most comprehensive case;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - which jurisdiction is ready to proceed to trial;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - where is the evidence located;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - whether the evidence is mobile;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - the number of accused involved and whether they can be
       gathered together in one place for trial;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - in what jurisdiction were most of the acts in furtherance
       of the crime committed;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - the nationality and residence of the accused;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     - the severity of the sentence the accused is likely to
       receive in each jurisdiction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Some of the same factors are found in Article 17 of the Treaty.
La Forest J. states that it is imperative that the effective
prosecution and the suppression of crime be pursued on the
international as well as the national plane. It is therefore
clear that any consideration by the executive of whether a
prosecution in Canada is “a realistic option” or “equally
effective” has to be made, not just in a domestic sense, but in
the context of this country’s international obligations (at p.
226):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       In the absence of proceedings against the accused
       in this country, Canada is under an international
       obligation to surrender a person accused of having
       committed a crime listed in an extradition treaty
       if it meets the requirements of the treaty, in
       particular presenting sufficient evidence before a
       judge to satisfy the requirements of a prima facie
       case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He notes that there is an executive discretion to refuse
surrender in exceptional circumstances but that this discretion
would be rarely exercised.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Second, La Forest J.’s reasons in Cotroni do not abrogate
established principles on the narrow scope of review of
prosecutorial discretion: see Whitley. La Forest J., at the
conclusion of the passage relied upon by Kwok, makes reference to
the need to show improper or arbitrary motives before a remedy
under s.24 of the Charter would lie.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] Finally, La Forest J. does not in any way suggest that every
case should be reviewed to determine whether it would be
realistic or effective to prosecute in Canada. To the contrary,
the suggestion that a general exception to extradition should be
recognized in the case of a Canadian citizen who could be charged
in Canada was expressly rejected (at p. 222):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       A general exception for a Canadian citizen who
       could be charged in Canada would, in my view,
       interfere unduly with the objectives of the system
       of extradition. ... [T]o require judicial
       examination of each individual case to see which
       could more effectively and fairly be tried in one
       country or the other would pose an impossible task
       and seriously interfere with the workings of the
       system.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] In this case, Kwok, in essence, was seeking to obtain
information which would permit a review of the prosecutorial
decision not to prosecute in Canada. While this decision may be
reviewable on grounds of bad faith or improper motives, there
must be an air of reality to the application. There is none here.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In the circumstances, the Minister made no error in his
exercise of discretion in refusing Kwok’s request for further
disclosure. Nor did he err in his consideration of Kwok’s s.6(1)
rights. He considered relevant principles in accordance with
correct principles of law. The Minister’s reliance on the advice
of his authorized representatives did not amount to an improper
delegation of his duty. His reasons make it clear that he
understood that it was his role to ensure that the surrender of
Mr. Kwok would be in accordance with the Charter. On the facts of
this case, there was nothing to indicate that Kwok’s surrender
would be unconstitutional.</font></pre>
        <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Consequently, there is no reason to interfere with the
Minister’s discretion and I would dismiss the application for
judicial review.</font></pre>
