</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   On  October  13,  1987 the Ontario  Ministry  of  Municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Affairs  approved  a draft plan of subdivision  for  a  piece  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  in the Village of Lakefield.  It did so after receiving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a   representation  from  Lakefield,  the  appellant   in   these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings, that municipal water services would be available  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  property  when  needed and that  it  was  not  premature  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivide  the  land.  Armed with this draft plan  approval,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  Black met with his lawyer and determined to  purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the property for development.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   This  representation was made negligently  and  was  false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When this became apparent and thus the property could not then be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivided,  the respondent disposed of it, suffering significant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses as a result.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The central issue in this case is whether Black can recover</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  Lakefield's negligent misrepresentation.  In particular, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there a sufficient proximity between the two that Lakefield  owed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a duty of care to Black, despite the fact that the representation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was  not addressed to him but rather to the Ministry of Municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Affairs.  At trial Black succeeded.  For the reasons that  follow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I  have  concluded  that the trial judge was correct  in  finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lakefield liable to Black for negligent misrepresentation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE RELEVANT FACTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   The original owners of the property were George Miller  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  wife.   On  July 14, 1986 they applied to  the  Ministry  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Municipal Affairs for approval of a draft plan of subdivision  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  property.  The Ministry then elicited responses to the draft</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan from various agencies that might be affected by the plan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The  Village of Lakefield was one of these  agencies.   Its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response  to  the Ministry's questionnaire, sent to the  Ministry</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a covering letter acknowledging that it was with respect  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the proposed draft plan of subdivision, contained the following:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Question  1:  Which of the following services
          will be available to this subdivision?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Municipal Water Supply?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Answer: Yes.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Question 16: Is it too soon to subdivide this
          land?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Answer: No.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The  trial  judge found that the meaning conveyed  by  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response  was  that municipal water services would  be  available</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when  needed  by  the  subdivider and that  the  subdivision  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore not premature.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On October 13, 1987 the Ministry approved the draft plan  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivision.   The only conditions attached to the approval  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standard conditions unrelated to water supply.  Nothing in  those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditions  indicated  that there was a  problem  with  municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">water  service  to the property.  The trial judge concluded  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  Ministry  would  not  have  approved  this  draft  plan   of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivision  if Lakefield had indicated that the subdivision  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premature  or that it would not be served by the municipal  water</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supply.   On  the evidence before him this inference was  clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   When  it made its representation to the Ministry, Lakefield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was,  however,  well  aware that there was  a  significant  water</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">service problem.  Indeed, because of long-standing problems  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">low  water pressure and the water distribution system,  both  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">own  professional staff and its planning consultant  had  advised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that   Lakefield  should  consider  the  subdivision  application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premature  until further studies had provided a solution  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision of water services to the property.  Nonetheless,  after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting  with the owners' solicitor, the Village Council  decided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  proceed  without  any  studies and  returned  the  Ministry's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questionnaire with the representations quoted above.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   In  December 1988 the respondent met with his solicitor  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discuss acquiring the property, given the existence of the  draft</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan  approval.  His solicitor was a very experienced real estate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practitioner  whose  evidence  was  that  where  there  had  been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approval  by  the  Ministry of a draft plan of subdivision,  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meant that the municipality concerned had been consulted and  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">returned its questionnaire to the Ministry indicating no  problem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  providing  the  necessary municipal  services.   He  and  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent reviewed the draft plan approval for the property  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  solicitor advised that the conditions attached  were  simply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the standard conditions.  It was the solicitor's opinion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">draft plan approval indicated that municipal water services would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  available  when  needed  and that  the  subdivision  was  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premature.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  On  the basis of the advice he received from his solicitor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent  purchased the property from  the  Millers.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">importance  of Lakefield's representation to Black's decision  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchase was put this way by the trial judge:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I  find  that Mr. Black would  not  have
          entered  into  the assignment  of  the  Howe-
          Kingdon  agreement of purchase of the  Miller
          lands  but  for the draft-approved status  of
          this  land and lack of any references in  the
          conditions    to    the    water    servicing
          deficiencies and requirements.  I  find  that
          Mr.  Black entered into the assignment of the
          Howe-Kingdon  agreement of  purchase  of  the
          Miller lands as a result of the misstatements
          in  the questionnaire that were reflected  in
          the draft plan approval conditions.  He would
          not  have completed the purchase but for  the
          Village's negligent statements.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Subsequent to his purchase, it became apparent to Black that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lakefield  had  a  serious problem in supplying  municipal  water</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">services  to  the property C a problem the Village had  known  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">well before responding to the Ministry questionnaire.  By June of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1990,  Lakefield was advising the respondent that  it  could  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provide   water  service  without  significant  new  water   main</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">construction  which it was unable to finance.  Without  municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">water  servicing the property could not be subdivided.  In  these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances  the  respondent was  obliged  to  dispose  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property incurring significant losses as a result.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  The trial judge determined that the representation made  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lakefield  to  the  Ministry concerning the supply  of  municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">water  service was false and was made negligently.  He then found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Black was in a position of proximity to Lakefield sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  trigger a duty of care on the appellant and that there was no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy  reason for concluding otherwise.  Lakefield's  breach  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this  duty  caused the respondent to purchase the property  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimately  resulted in loss to him because of the unavailability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of   municipal  water  supply.   He  summarized  his  finding  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In summary, I find that there was a duty
          of  care  owed by the municipality to persons
          in  the position of this Plaintiff, that  the
          Village   breached  this  duty  of  care   by
          misrepresenting  negligently  the   servicing
          issue   confronting  this   draft   plan   of
          subdivision,  that  this was  an  operational
          function  and  not  one of policy,  that  the
          Plaintiff  relied  on the resulting  approved
          status and conditions in agreeing to purchase
          the land, that the Plaintiff suffered loss as
          a  result,  and  that there  are  no  further
          limiting   considerations   save   that   the
          Plaintiff should be entitled to no more  than
          to  be put in the position financially as  if
          he had not entered the contract of purchase.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  He then went on to award damages to the respondent for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss  sustained in disposing of the property and for the carrying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cost  he  had incurred since its purchase.  He declined to  award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent compensation for the profit he would have made  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdividing the property.  In making these calculations the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  accepted  the  respondent's evidence  that  while  he  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">originally purchased the property in partnership with his brother-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in-law,   when  difficulties  arose  with  the  development   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent took over that interest to ensure that his brother-in-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law   suffered  no  loss.   As  the  full  beneficial  owner  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent received judgment for the full damage award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUES
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The appellant raises two issues on this appeal.  Firstly, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argues  that on these facts the respondent cannot recover on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis  of  negligent  misrepresentation  primarily  because   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation in question was directed not to the respondent but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  Secondly, it argues that the trial judge erred  in  several</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respects in his approach to damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  The respondent cross-appeals from the refusal of the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  to  award damages for the profits lost when  the  property</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not be subdivided.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  I  turn  first to the issue of negligent misrepresentation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The elements or general requirements of this tort were set out by</font></pre>

          decisions  of this court cited above  suggest
          five general requirements:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1)  there must be a duty of care based on  a

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  the  representation in question must  be
               untrue, inaccurate, or misleading;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)  the    representor   must   have   acted
               negligently      in     making      said
               misrepresentation;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (4)  the  representee must have relied, in  a
               reasonable  manner,  on  said  negligent
               misrepresentation; and
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (5)  the  reliance must have been detrimental

          by the plaintiff, in the circumstances, would
          be reasonable.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  Finally,  he addressed the second or policy  considerations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">branch  of the test.  He explained the rationale for this  branch</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as follows at 192:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As  Cardozo C.J. explained in Ultramares
          Corp.  v.  Touche,  174  N.E.  441  (N.Y.C.A.
          1931),  at  p.  444,  the fundamental  policy
          consideration  that  must  be  addressed   in
          negligent  misrepresentation actions  centres
          around  the  possibility that  the  defendant
          might   be  exposed  to  &quot;liability   in   an
          indeterminate  amount  for  an  indeterminate
          time to an indeterminate class&quot;.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He  then  went  on  to explain how in a given case  these  policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerns might indeed be satisfied.  At 197-198 he said this:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As discussed earlier, looking to factors
          such  as &quot;knowledge of the plaintiff  (or  an
          identifiable class of plaintiffs) on the part
          of  the defendant&quot; and &quot;use of the statements
          at   issue   for  the  precise   purpose   or
          transaction  for  which they  were  prepared&quot;
          really  amounts  to an attempt  to  limit  or
          constrain the scope of the duty of care  owed
          by  the  defendants.  If the purpose  of  the
          Anns/Kamloops   test  is  to  determine   (a)
          whether  or  not a prima facie duty  of  care
          exists and then (b) whether or not that  duty
          ought  to be negated or limited, then factors
          such as these ought properly to be considered
          in  the  second branch of the test  once  the
          first branch concerning &quot;proximity&quot; has  been
          found  to  be  satisfied.  To  my  mind,  the
          presence of such factors in a given situation
          will   mean   that  worries   stemming   from
          indeterminacy  should not  arise,  since  the
          scope  of potential liability is sufficiently
          delimited.   In other words, in  cases  where
          the  defendant  knows  the  identity  of  the
          plaintiff  (or of a class of plaintiffs)  and
          where the defendant's statements are used for
          the specific purpose or transaction for which
          they   were   made,   policy   considerations
          surrounding indeterminate liability will  not
          be   of  any  concern  since  the  scope   of
          liability   can   readily  be  circumscribed.
          Consequently,  such considerations  will  not
          override  a  positive finding  on  the  first
          branch  of the Anns/Kamloops test and a  duty
          of care may quite properly be found to exist.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]  What  remains, then, is to apply these  principles  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts of this case to determine whether the trial judge's finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of liability against Lakefield can stand.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22]  Setting  aside for the moment the duty of care requirement,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there  is  no  question that the representation here was  untrue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When  Lakefield represented in its response to the Ministry  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal  water services would be available as needed  and  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  planned  subdivision  was not premature,  that  was  clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">false.   Significant water main construction was  required  first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which Lakefield had no ability to finance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  There is also no doubt that Lakefield acted negligently  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">making this representation.  It did so having known for some time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  water  servicing problem and against the advice  of  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">professional staff and consultant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]   The  evidence  also  sustains  the  conclusion  that   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent    relied   in   a   reasonable    manner    on    the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation.  He relied on his lawyer who knew, because  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his experience, that draft plan approval meant that Lakefield had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made  the  representation that municipal water services would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available  when  needed.   As the trial judge  said,  Lakefield's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation about water supply was reflected in the draft plan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approval.   Since  the lawyer knew from that  approval  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation  had  indeed  been  made  by  Lakefield,   it   is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant  that the representation was directed to the  Ministry</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather than the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25]  The facts supporting the reasonableness of the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reliance  can  be  summarized as follows.  The representation  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lakefield  concerning municipal water supply had been made.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's  solicitor  knew  it  had  been  made,  advised  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  to  buy  on that basis, and the  respondent  did  so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Without  an  assurance  that municipal water  services  would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available  the respondent would not have purchased the  property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He was entitled to act on the basis that Lakefield would do as it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said.  In my view, given these circumstances, the respondent  can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clearly be said to have relied on the negligent misrepresentation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the appellant in a reasonable manner.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26]  Finally,  there  is no doubt that the  respondent  suffered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damage  as a result of this reliance.  The property could not  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivided  because  municipal water  services  were  unavailable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contrary  to  the appellant's representation.  As  a  result  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent  had to dispose of the property, which  he  did  at  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]  This, then, leaves for analysis the requirement that  there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  a duty of care owed by Lakefield to Black.  As set out above,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this requires the application of the two-part Anns/Kamloops test.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28]  As  to the first branch of the test, in my opinion a  prima</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facie  duty of care arises on the facts of this case.   Lakefield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ought  reasonably to have foreseen that Black would rely  on  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation.  Lakefield made the representation based  on  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">special  knowledge of the circumstances and as a formal  response</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  permit  evaluation of a request for approval  of  a  plan  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivide  this  property.  It ought to have  foreseen  that  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation  would be relied on by someone seeking  to  effect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that very subdivision, particularly where its representation  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reflected  in  the  draft plan approval which resulted  from  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation.   Moreover,  for the  reasons  I  have  indicated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier,  the  respondent's reliance on  the  representation  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entirely reasonable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]  As to the second branch of the test, in my view it  too  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">met.  The class of those who might rely on the representation  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondent did is strictly limited.  It is those  who  could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seek to proceed with the subdivision of the property.  Given that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lakefield was fully aware that its representation was being  made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  the  context of a proposed plan of subdivision,  it  must  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken  to  know of the class of those who could properly complain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about  its  misrepresentation, namely those  who  would  seek  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivide  the property.  Moreover, the representation  was  made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  the  very  purpose of facilitating the  subdivision  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.   It was in just this context that the respondent  used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the representation.  He relied on it to purchase the property for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">development.  Hence, there is no risk here of indeterminacy.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scope  of Lakefield's liability is readily circumscribed.   There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  no  policy basis, therefore, for overriding the  prima  facie</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty of care resting on the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]  I  therefore conclude that the trial judge was  correct  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding  the  appellant  liable to the respondent  for  negligent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation in the circumstances of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31]  The second issue raised by the appellant is that the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  erred in several respects in his award of damages.  First,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it  is argued that the trial judge should have determined damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the  basis of the difference between the price paid  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property  and the market value of the property without  municipal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">water.  Second, the appellant says that the trial judge erred  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding the respondent entitled to the entire loss despite  being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shown on title as merely a co-owner.  Third, it is said that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial  judge  erred in including in the damage award compensation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a sum which the respondent had not yet paid to the mortgagee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]  In  my  view,  none of these arguments  can  succeed.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">measure  of damages for negligent misrepresentation is  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff is to be put in the position he would have been in  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the   misrepresentation  not  been  made.   See   B.   G.   Checo</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1993]  1  S.C.R. 12 at 37.  The appellant's argument erroneously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assumes  that  if the misrepresentation had not  been  made,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent would have purchased the property but at a lower price</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  reflect the absence of municipal water.  In this case, if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentation had not been made the respondent would not have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchased the property at all because it could not be subdivided.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The damage award was correctly made on this basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Nor did the trial judge err in allowing full recovery to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent.  The evidence clearly demonstrated that although  his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brother-in-law  remained on title, the respondent  was  the  full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficial owner of the property.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34]  Finally, although the respondent had not yet paid a sum  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mortgagee which the trial judge included in the damage award,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  the  respondent  admitted,  he  was  clearly  liable  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgagee  for  this sum and was entitled to recover  damages  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compensate for it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] I would therefore dismiss the appeal as to damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36]  Equally I would dismiss the cross-appeal.  The trial  judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found  that there was not satisfactory proof that Black  had  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial  ability to complete the project and as  a  consequence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declined  to  award damages for lost profits in  subdividing  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.   There was ample evidence on which this finding  could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be made.  In addition, as I have said, the respondent is entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  be  put  in  the  position he would  have  been  in  had  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representation not been made, not in the position he  would  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been in if the representation were true.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37]  In  the result, I would dismiss the appeal with  costs.   I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would  dismiss the cross-appeal but since it constituted  only  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">very small part of the proceedings I would do so without costs.
