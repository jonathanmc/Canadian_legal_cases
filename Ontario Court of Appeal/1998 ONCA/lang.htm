    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    In his reasons for judgment, Ground J. stated that the
parties agreed that the only issues which may constitute genuine
issues for trial were whether Robert Kligerman (&quot;Kligerman&quot;) was
ever retained by HJD Financial Services Inc. (&quot;HJD&quot;) and the
extent of the retainer, and the actual knowledge of Kligerman and
HJD of the existence of the Lang Agreement and the plaintiffs'
life interest in the property created by it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The evidence before the motions judge consisted of the
denials of Kligerman and HJD of any knowledge of the Lang
Agreement or the plaintiffs' life interest, together with
evidence of surrounding circumstances from which Mr. Pinos
submitted the knowledge of Kligerman and HJD could be inferred.
The evidence of the surrounding circumstances is summarized in
paragraph 68 of Mr. Pinos' amended factum.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    At pp.2-3 of his reasons, Ground J. concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            ...the preponderance of evidence before
            me appears to indicate that Mr.
            Kligerman's firm was retained by Fogler,
            Rubinoff, the solicitors for HJD, to
            provide a title opinion and that the
            title opinion was addressed to Fogler,
            Rubinoff.  In this situation, I am not
            certain that any actual knowledge of Mr.
            Kligerman obtained as a result of his
            friendship with Daniel or his having
            acted for Daniel in the past, as to the
            existence of the life interest of the
            plaintiffs in the property can be
            attributed to HJD.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                     [emphasis added]

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    After reference to some of the evidence of the surrounding
circumstances, the motions judge continued at p.3:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            I do not think I can draw any
            conclusion, from that evidence, that
            Kligerman had actual knowledge of the
            life interest of the plaintiffs in the
            subject lands.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                     [emphasis added]

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    It is implicit from the above reasons that the motions
judge considered that there was evidence capable of supporting a
finding that Kligerman and HJD possessed the requisite knowledge.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    In reaching the conclusions quoted above, the motions
judge assumed the role of a trial judge because he considered the
sufficiency of the evidence relating to the knowledge of
Kligerman and HJD.  Being of the view that there was evidence
which he considered capable of supporting a finding that
Kligerman and HJD possessed the requisite knowledge, he was
obliged to dismiss the motion for summary judgment and direct
that the action proceed to trial to permit the trial judge to
consider the evidence and come to his or her findings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    Thus, rather than limiting his role to assessing the
threshold issue of whether a genuine issue existed as to material
facts which required a trial, he proceeded to decide the issues
to which I have referred in paragraph 1, and granted summary
judgment allowing HJD's counterclaim against the plaintiffs and
dismissing their claim against HJD.  See: Aguonie v. Galion Solid
Waste Materials Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 at 173 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    As well, in considering the evidence concerning these
issues, the motions judge held, incorrectly, that the plaintiffs,
as responding parties were:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            required to bring to the court a
            coherent set of facts constituting
            evidence conflicting with evidence
            presented by the moving party and
            establishing that there is a genuine
            issue for trial on a material fact.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                          [emphasis added]

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    The authorities are clear that the onus is on the moving
party to establish that there is no genuine issue for trial with
respect to a claim or defence.  There is no onus on the
responding party.  However, where the evidence presented by the
moving party prima facie establishes that there is no genuine
issue for trial, and the moving party is entitled to summary
judgment as a matter of law, to preclude the granting of summary
judgment the responding party assumes the evidentiary burden of
presenting evidence which is capable of supporting the position
advanced by the responding party in its pleading.  On the basis
of this evidence, when considered with all the evidence before
the motions judge, it will then be for the motions judge to
determine whether the evidentiary record raises a genuine issue
for trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   Therefore, we would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the motions judge and direct that the action and the
counterclaim proceed to trial.  The appellants are to have the
costs of the motion and the appeal.</font></pre></td>
