    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was tried before Whealy J. and a jury on an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conspiracy to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts 4 and 5 alleged a conspiracy to smuggle named persons into</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  During the trial, a mistrial was declared with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts 4 and 5. A re-trial on those counts is scheduled to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">held in the near future. The jury found the appellant guilty of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all of the remaining counts. His application, following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction, for a stay of proceedings on the ground that he had</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Court:     It is. It is a head covering,

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Mr. Kellerman: If I could speak, Your Honour.
          It is a   religious matter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Court:     I do not care.  I am not
          quarrelling with his religion, he is just not
          going to be in the court room.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">After several further exchanges between the trial judge, counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and an unidentified spectator, the trial judge concluded as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Court:     I won't have any comments from
          the audience.  You are more than welcome to
          be here, it is a public court room, but the
          rules are made by me and I just made the
          first ruling.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On November 22, 1993 the trial judge made a more formal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order in relation to the acceptable headwear of spectators, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Attire normally acceptable in school should
          be the standard.  However, male heads must be
          bare and if females wear head cover, it must
          not interfere with other members of the
          public or be flamboyant.
                            . . . .
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Some head coverings, by their shape, colour
          and design, are obvious and easily
          recognizable as signalling to the eye an
          adherent of a well-established and
          recognizable race, culture, national or
          religious community; one of those communities
          who is clearly within the purview of the
          Charter.  I am unable to think of any such
          community who has adapted a headdress which
          lacks the dignity and uniformity that I have
          been speaking of.  Even among those
          communities, headdress in court will only be
          permitted if it is an article of faith
          demanded by that well established and
          recognizable religious community. [Emphasis
          added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On January 5, 1994 the trial judge made a further ruling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to the wearing of headdresses as well as a ruling in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relation to the application of behalf of the appellant that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter proceed before another trial judge on the basis of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable apprehension of bias related to his earlier rulings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to the wearing of headdresses and other matters.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  As part of his ruling, the trial judge made the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">observations:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As yet the court has not called upon the
          Crown to make any submissions, and in my view
          would not be of any assistance.  Furthermore,
          to do so would be to dignify these
          submissions with some sense of reality.
          These submissions have no more substance than
          shadows which, when examined in the light of
          day, disappear without a trace.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The right of an individual spectator to enter
          a court is by no means absolute.  If refused
          entry by the order of the presiding judge, on
          any basis, an application for violation of
          the Charter of Right belongs to the spectator
          and not to any party to the proceedings.  In
          my view, only if the public is wholly or
          substantially excluded from the court can the
          accused in the criminal case raise any such
          issue under s.11(d) of the Charter. [Emphasis

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1993 which was filed before the trial judge deposed, in part, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          On Monday, November 22, 1993, I attended the
          court of Justice A.C. Whealy at the
          Metropolitan Toronto Court House, at about
          12:15 p.m. and sat in the court.  After 5
          minutes or so, I was approached by the court
          bailiff and was told that the judge did not
          allow &quot;hats&quot; in his court.  I asked the
          officer &quot;is the judge aware that I am a
          Muslim and that my headdress is a part of my
          religious practice?&quot;  The officer said that
          there were no exceptions and that I would
          either have to take my &quot;hat&quot; off or leave the
          court.  I refused to take my headdress off
          and was therefore asked to leave the court,
          which I did peacefully.  On my way out of the
          courtroom I heard Justice Whealy saying,
          &quot;Muslims do not wear hats.&quot;  I wear my
          headdress daily and regard it as part of my
          religious practice and not a &quot;hat&quot; or
          something to protect my head from the
          elements.  I wear a headdress as it is
          regarded as a symbolic act to identify myself
          as a Muslim and because it is an act of
          religious merit and piety.

          attempted to attend the court of Justice
          Whealy but I was prevented from entering by a
          uniformed police officer who advised me that
          &quot;no hats&quot; were permitted in the courtroom of
          Justice Whealy.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In R. v. S. (R.D.) (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 385</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(S.C.C.), Cory J. wrote of the importance of the court's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognizing the pluralistic nature of Canada:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Canada is not an insular, homogeneous
          society.  It is enriched by the presence and
          contributions of citizens of many different
          races, nationalities and ethnic origins.  The
          multicultural nature of Canadian society has
          been recognized in s. 27 of the Charter.
          Section 27 provides that the Charter itself
          is to be interpreted in a manner that is
          consistent with the preservation and
          enhancement of the multicultural heritage of
          Canadians. Yet our judges must be
          particularly sensitive to the need not only
          be fair but also to appear to all reasonable
          observers to be fair to all Canadians of
          every race, religion, nationality and ethnic
          origin.  This is a far more difficult task in
          Canada than it would be in a homogeneous
          society.  Remarks which would pass unnoticed
          in other societies could well raise a
          reasonable apprehension of bias in Canada.

          maintenance of order or the proper

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There can be no doubt that the openness of
          the courts to the public is one of the
          hallmarks of a democratic society.  Public
          accessibility to the courts was and is felt a
          necessity;  it is a restraint on arbitrary
          action by those who govern and by the
          powerful.

          the Court system and understanding of the
          administration of justice are thereby
          fostered. As a general rule the sensibilities
          of the individuals involved are no basis for
          exclusion of the public from judicial
          proceedings.

          few well-recognized exceptions, as in the
          case of infants, mentally disordered persons
          or secret processes, all judicial proceedings
          must be held in public.  The editor of
          Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed. vol. 10,
          para. 705, p. 316, states the rule in these
          terms:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In general, all cases, both civil and
               criminal, must be heard in open court,
               but in certain exceptional cases, where
               the administration of justice would be
               rendered impracticable by the presence
               of the public, the court may sit in
               camera.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          At every stage the rule should be one of
          public accessibility and concomitant judicial
          accountability...
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my view, curtailment of public
          accessibility can only be justified where
          there is present the need to protect social
          values of superordinate importance.  One of
          these is the protection of the innocent.

          fundamental principle that a trial should be
          held in public are similar to those contained
          in s.486(1), with the addition of the

          that respect.  He or she may do so only if
          the interest of justice requires it having

               give any reasons.  He can direct the

               the Director of Public Prosecutions to
               take over the conduct of any criminal

          not only to protect the public, but also to
          honour and express the community's sense of

          careful before they attempt to &quot;second-guess&quot;

          a decision.  Where there is conspicuous

          doctrine of separation of powers as well as a
          matter of policy founded on the efficiency of

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant's appeal.  Rosenberg J.A. stated at p. 61:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The justification for the representative
          nature of the jury is not simply to assure
          that the case is tried by an impartial
          tribunal.  The representative character of
          the jury also furthers important societal or
          community interests by instilling confidence
          in the criminal justice system and acting as
          a check against oppression.  The accused and
          the community have an interest in maintaining
          the representative character of the jury
          system.  In Sherratt [(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d)
          193], L'Heureux-DubJ J. made several other
          comments concerning the nature of the
          representative character of the jury.  Thus,
          she stated at p. 524 that the modern jury was
          not meant to be a tool of either the Crown or
          the defence but rather &quot;was envisioned as a
          representative cross-section of society,
          honestly and fairly chosen&quot;.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and at p. 62:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The right to a representative jury roll is
          not absolute in the sense that the accused is
          entitled to a roll representative of all of
          the many groups that make up Canadian
          society.  This level of representativeness
          would be impossible to obtain.  There are a
          number of practical barriers inherent in the
          selection process that make complete
          representativeness impossible.  The roll is
          selected from a discrete geographical
          district which itself may or may not be
          representative of the broader Canadian
          society.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and at pp. 64-65:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The essential quality that the
          representativeness requirement brings to the
          jury function is the possibility of different
          perspectives from a diverse group of persons.
          The representativeness requirement seeks to
          avoid the risk that persons with these
          different perspectives, and who are otherwise
          available, will be systemically excluded from
          the jury roll.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Exclusion of non-citizens does not infringe
          the representativeness or fair cross-section
          requirement in this sense.  There was no
          evidence that non-citizens as a group share
          any common thread or basic similarity in
          attitude, ideas or experience that would not
          be brought to the jury process by citizens.
          The expert evidence led by the appellants was
          somewhat misleading in this respect.  From my
          review of the evidence, it seems that the
          expert tended to use non-citizenship opinion
          as a proxy for minority opinion.  The
          evidence, however, simply does not bear out
          the inference that exclusion of non-citizens
          disproportionately excludes minorities from
          the jury.  As pointed out above, almost one-
          half of the 1.7 million residents of
          Metropolitan Toronto over the age of 18 were
          not born in Canada but most, close to three-
          quarters, have become Canadian citizens.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the context of jury representativeness,
          citizenship, like residency in the province,
          is not an improper basis for defining the
          parameters of the jury roll.  As La Forest J.
          wrote in Andrews v. Law Society of British
          Columbia [[1989] 1 S.C.R. 143] at p. 196,
          &quot;[C]itizenship is a very special status that
          not only incorporates rights and duties but
          serves a highly important symbolic function
          as a badge identifying people as members of
          the Canadian polity.&quot;  All free and
          democratic societies have established a
          unique status like citizenship to which
          attach certain rights, privileges and
          obligations closely related to the concept of
          self-government.  It will be recalled that in
          speaking of the importance of the jury
          function, L'Heureux-DubJ J. held in Sherratt
          that the jury can act as the conscience of
          the community and as the final bulwark
          against oppressive laws or their enforcement.
          I see no reason why this important aspect of
          self-government should not be reserved for
          citizens, where, as here, exclusion of non-
          citizens does not affect the
          representativeness of the jury roll.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The intervener Laws argues that immigration
          status is a proxy for other potentially
          relevant characteristics, especially
          colour... Thus, he argues that exclusion of
          non-citizens undermines the
          representativeness of the jury especially as
          regards colour.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The evidence presented here, however, fails
          to demonstrate the point.  As noted above,
          citizens, at least in Metropolitan Toronto,
          are of all races, colours and national
          origin.  According to the evidence adduced in
          the Laws case itself, including non-citizens
          in the panel would increase the likelihood of
          selecting a black person for the panel by
          only .9%.  In my view, this cannot affect the
          representative nature of the array.  The
          deliberate exclusion of distinctive groups
          based on characteristics such as race, sex,
          colour, religion or national origin might
          well infringe the requirement of a jury
          selected from a fair cross-section of the

          the panel.  I make no comment on whether or
          not this is a valid argument in the Laws

          ... The absence of jurors of their own race
          increases the likelihood that there will be
          barriers to their ability to convey their
          version of the facts.  In particular, it

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The perceived importance of the jury and the
          Charter right to jury trial is meaningless
          without some guarantee that it will perform
          its duties impartially and represent as far
          as is possible and appropriate in the
          circumstances, the larger community.  Indeed,
          without the two characteristics of
          impartiality and representativeness, a jury
          would be unable to perform properly many of
          the functions that make its existence
          desirable in the first place.  Provincial
          legislation guarantees representativeness, at
          least in the initial array.  The random
          selection process, coupled with the sources
          from which this selection is made, ensures
          the representativeness of Canadian criminal
          juries: see the provincial Jury Acts.  Thus,
          little if any objection can be made regarding
          this crucial characteristic of juries.

          right to demand that members of his race be
          included on the jury.  To so interpret the
          Charter would run counter to Canada's
          multicultural and multiracial heritage and
          the right of every person to serve as a juror
          (unless otherwise disqualified).  It would
          mean the imposition of inequality.  See the

               presence on the jury of persons from the
               same demographic group as the litigant.
               The difficulties of that position are

          discrimination.  Mere assertion is not proof.
          The jurors' list in the case at bar is
          racially neutral and must be presumed to
          provide a fair cross-section of the community

          seen as an anti-discrimination right.  The
          application, intentional or unintentional, of
          racial stereotypes to the detriment of an
          accused person ranks among the most
          destructive forms of discrimination.  The
          result of the discrimination may not be the
          loss of a benefit or a job or housing in the
          area of choice, but the loss of the accused's
          very liberty.  The right must fall at the
          core of the guarantee in s. 15 of the Charter
          that &quot;[e]very individual is equal before and

          not going to include any of that information
          in the judicial summaries.  I am equally
          persuaded that it is most unlikely that any
          of the information which is not disclosed
          could form any substantial or even remote
          part of the defence to the allegations that
          are on the indictment (except that it is not
          my role to advise the defence in any case).
          But nevertheless I think it worthwhile to
          mention that I have tried to play that role,
          I could not conceive that the information
          being of any use at all.  So under the
          circumstances the second judicial summary
          will be identical to the first and that is
          Exhibit A on the motion.

          an application should be made by the Crown
          suggesting the nature of the matters to be
          edited and the basis therefor.  Only Crown
          counsel will have the affidavit at this
          point.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   The trial judge should then edit the
          affidavit as proposed by Crown counsel and
          furnish a copy as edited to counsel for the
          accused.  Submissions should then be
          entertained from counsel for the accused.  If
          the trial judge is of the view that counsel
          for the accused will not be able to
          appreciate the nature of the deletions from
          the submissions of Crown counsel and the
          edited affidavit, a form of judicial summary
          as to the general nature of the deletions
          should be provided.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   After hearing counsel for the accused
          and reply from the Crown, the trial judge
          should make a final determination as to
          editing, bearing in mind that editing is to
          be kept to a minimum and applying the factors
          listed above.

          done in secret in order to permit effective
          police investigation of suspected crimes.
          That secrecy should, however, be maintained
          only as long as it is essential to the
          effective operation of the process.  When a
          judicial process such as the granting of a
          &quot;wiretap&quot; authorization is, of necessity,
          done out of the public sight, the opportunity
          for subsequent public examination of that
          process becomes very important.  Public
          scrutiny of that secret process after the
          need for secrecy is gone enhances public
          confidence in the criminal justice system,
          and encourages those who resort to this
          invasive investigative tool to do so in a
          manner that will withstand the light of open
          court and the heat of the adversary process.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Martin J.A. in Hertrich identified two
          important principles that underlie s. 577
          [now s. 650].  First, the accused is present
          to hear the case he or she faces and is
          thereby able to put forward a defence.
          Secondly, the accused sees the entire process
          by which he or she is tried and is able to
          see that the correct procedure is followed
          and the trial fair.  For Martin J.A., the
          second principle was the more important one.
          I agree with him that this second value is of
          enormous importance to the perceived fairness
          of the Canadian criminal justice system.  The
          sight of a judge conferring in private with
          jurors on issues that go to the partiality of
          the trier of fact can only prompt cynicism in
          an accused.  It should be avoided.

          appellant suffered no real prejudice as a
          result of such exclusion.  Nevertheless, it
          seems to me that in such circumstances the
          Court of Appeal may refuse to exercise the
          discretion given to it under s. 613(1)(b)(iv)
          [now s. 686(1)(b)(iv)] to dismiss the appeal
          so that justice will not only be done but
          will be seen to be done.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] We agree.  The perceived fairness of the criminal justice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">system is its most vital characteristic.  Public confidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires public scrutiny wherever possible.  Private trials which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclude the accused are antithetical to this core value.  Where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances of the exclusion of the accused are such as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inflict significant damage on the appearance of justice, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question is not whether there is prejudice to the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rather, the issue is the harm to the criminal justice system</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">itself.  In such cases the court should refuse to apply this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proviso.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[97] In our view, this is such a case.  The three private ex</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parte meetings between the trial judge and Crown counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constituted an important part of the trial resulting in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant disclosure decisions affecting the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ability to make full answer and defence.  Both the appellant and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his counsel were excluded from these meetings.  The appellant,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore, had absolutely no window on this part of his trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There was no transcript kept so that this court is equally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without the ability to know what went on.  The exclusion of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was not due to mere inadvertence.  Important decisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affecting the trial were made in his absence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[98] Since no transcript was kept, we do not know what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submissions were made by the Crown, and so do not know the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon which the decisions were made.  We cannot, therefore,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclude that the appellant suffered no prejudice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] More importantly, and apart from the question of prejudice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the appellant, the circumstances of his exclusion from his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial are so at odds with the perceived fairness we require of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">our criminal justice system that s. 686(1)(b)(iv) is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inapplicable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[100]     We therefore conclude that the appellant was wrongly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">excluded from a part of his trial and that this error in law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be cured by the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iv).  On this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis the appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE USE TO WHICH THE JURY COULD PUT THE EVIDENCE RESPECTING THE
MISTRIED COUNTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[101]     During the course of the trial, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declared a mistrial with respect to counts 4 and 5 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indictment when the testimony of an expert witness with respect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to American immigration law changed at trial from the testimony</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had given at the preliminary inquiry. The trial continued with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to the remaining counts in the indictment. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge instructed the jury that it could consider the evidence on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts 4 and 5 to show a system or, as he described it, a &quot;modus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operandi&quot; on the part of the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[102]     Having regard to our disposition of this appeal, we do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not find it necessary to deal with the submission of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant that this instruction was erroneous. The mistried</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts, 4 and 5, are proceeding to a separate trial in the near</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future and the issue will not arise on the new trial that, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have concluded, must be held with respect to the remaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONSPIRACY AND THE SUBSTANTIVE OFFENCE
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[103]     In his factum, the appellant submitted that the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge erred in instructing the jury that the appellant could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found guilty of conspiracy even if the conduct attributed to him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not support a conviction for the substantive offence. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ground of appeal was abandoned in argument in light of the recent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision in United States of America v. Dynar (1997), 115 C.C.C.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3d) 481 (S.C.C.), and neither the appellant nor the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addressed any submissions to the court on the subject.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ENTRAPMENT
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[104]     The appellant alleged a number of errors said to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been made by the trial judge in his disposition of the post-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction entrapment hearing. It was submitted that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  he improperly restricted cross-
          examination respecting the informer who
          supplied information to the police at the
          initial stages of the investigation;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  he failed to admit evidence that was
          admissible for the purpose of the entrapment
          hearing;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  he misstated and misapplied the test for
          entrapment set out in R. v. Mack (1988), 44
          C.C.C. (3d) 513 (S.C.C.); and
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  having misstated and misapplied the test
          for entrapment, he failed to order a stay of
          the proceedings against the appellant.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[105]     The respondent conceded that the trial judge erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ruling that the appellant had to satisfy both branches of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">test formulated in Mack in order to succeed on the entrapment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application, but argued that the error was immaterial because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had satisfied neither branch of the test. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's submission, there was no relevant error and thus no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[106]     While the manner in which the trial judge dealt with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue of entrapment was in some respects erroneous, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider that it would be inappropriate, on the state of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record before us, to endeavour to make our own independent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding regarding that issue. As we have concluded that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be a new trial, we are of the view that the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entrapment, if it is pursued, should be left for determination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and disposition by the judge presiding at that trial on the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of such evidence as may be adduced before him or her with respect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to that issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">SENTENCE
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[107]     In addition to a fine of $5,000, the appellant was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentenced to nine months' imprisonment on each of counts 1, 6 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">7, to be served concurrently.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[108]     On the appeal, the appellant submitted that he should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been allowed to serve his sentence in the community through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the imposition of a conditional sentence. The respondent argued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that a term of imprisonment was an entirely fit response to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's established, long-term, conspiracy, conducted for his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">own private financial gain, to undermine the immigration systems</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Canada and the United States.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[110]     For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against</font></pre>
