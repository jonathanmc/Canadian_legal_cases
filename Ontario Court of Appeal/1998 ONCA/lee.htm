    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction for robbery, possession
of property obtained during the commission of an offence, and
driving while disqualified.  He was sentenced to five years and
nine months' imprisonment and the trial judge imposed an order
delaying the appellant's eligibility for parole until he had
served at least one-half of his sentence.   The appellant appeals
his conviction and sentence.
[2]  The Crown presented a strong case against the appellant.  It
was a combination of eyewitness identification evidence together
with a powerful circumstantial case against the appellant which
covered events prior to the robbery, the robbery itself, and
events subsequent to the robbery, leading to the appellant's
arrest.
[3]  The only ground advanced on the appeal relates to the late
disclosure of exculpatory fingerprint evidence found on a garbage
bag in the stolen getaway vehicle.  The essence of the
appellant's argument is that trial counsel was under an
obligation to consult with the appellant when this evidence was
disclosed, and to raise with him the possibility that he may wish
to choose to re-elect the mode of trial.  In the circumstances of
this case, and particularly in light of the appellant's extensive
criminal record which caused him to elect to be tried by judge
alone in the first place, we do not believe that there is an air
of reality that either counsel or the appellant would have wished
to re-elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.
We would dismiss the appeal as to conviction.
[4]  With respect to sentence, we are of the view that, in all
the circumstances of this case, the period of imprisonment of
five years for the robbery falls outside the acceptable range for
this type of offence.  The trial judge does not appear to have
sufficiently considered that the appellant, although pretending
to be armed, did not have any weapon and no actual violence was
used during the robbery.  We agree that the appellant has a very
bad criminal record, however, we note that he had only been in
the penitentiary on one previous occasion.  We also note that he
has been in an apparently stable relationship since 1993.  In
addition, the fresh evidence provides a more favourable basis for
his rehabilitation.  In our view, a fit sentence is one of four
years' imprisonment for the offence of robbery.  The sentence of
three months for the offence of possession of property obtained
during the commission of an offence is to be concurrent to the
four-year sentence.  The sentence of six months to be served
consecutively for the offence of driving while disqualified will
remain unchanged.  The total sentence is therefore four years and
six months.
[5]  The order fixing the appellant's parole eligibility at one-
half of his sentence was justified and we see no basis to
interfere except to the extent that it purported to apply to the
sentence imposed for the non-scheduled offences.  The Crown
concedes that to that extent the order was illegal and must be
vacated.
[6]  In the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
The appeal against sentence is allowed to the extent that the
sentence for robbery is reduced to four years' imprisonment, the
three-month sentence is to be concurrent to the four-year
sentence, and the s. 743.6 order is varied to apply only to the
four-year sentence.</font></pre></td>
