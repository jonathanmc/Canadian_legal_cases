    </center></div><pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1] In our view the trial judge erred in principle in imposing 
a lengthy sentence on this appellant as a matter of specific
deterrence because the appellant had committed thirty-two
prior offences.  The trial judge, in his reasons for
sentence, said in part as follows:</font></pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This accused, although only a young man, has 
thirty-two previous criminal convictions, eight 
of them - and not including this one - breaking 
and entering, which is a very serious offence.  
And he has spent a lot of time in jail and
he hasn't learned.  He hasn't been deterred from 
committing serious criminal offences by the 
sentences heretofore imposed by the courts.</font></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]     In fact, the longest prior jail sentence imposed on
this appellant as an adult prior to committing these
offences was sixty days which was imposed in 1995.  The
lengthy sentence for a large number of offences including
break and enter was imposed on the appellant following the
commission of these offences.

[3]     In our view, a fit sentence for the offence of break
and enter would be twelve months' imprisonment.  In all
other respects the appeal is dismissed.

[4]     Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to a total of
fifteen months' imprisonment.</font></pre></td>
