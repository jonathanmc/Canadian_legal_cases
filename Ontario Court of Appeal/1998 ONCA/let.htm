    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted on one count of aggravated

sexual assault (count 1) and one count of threatening (count 17).

He was acquitted on the other 15 counts in the indictment.

[2]  The trial judge misapprehended the evidence when he said

that the appellant's nephew had testified that the appellant had

caused certain marks on the nephew's back. These marks were

similar to injuries on the complainant's back which she testified

were inflicted by the appellant in the course of the alleged

sexual assault for which the appellant was convicted. The nephew

testified that he told the police that the appellant had

inflicted these marks, but then went on to testify that the

appellant had not in fact done so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  This misapprehension of the evidence figured prominently in

the trial judge's determination that the Crown had established

the case on the charge of aggravated sexual assault beyond a

reasonable doubt. The evidence of the threat referred to in count

17 was closely connected to the sexual assault alleged in count 1

by the complainant in her evidence. In our view, the

misapprehension of the nephew's evidence necessitates a new trial

on both counts 1 and 17.</font></pre>

[4]  The appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside and a new

trial ordered.</font></pre></td>
