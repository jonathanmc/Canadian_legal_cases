    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    On this motion to lift the stay of execution pending
appeal the defendant, appellant, conceded that some amount should
be paid on the judgment. The suggestion was $100,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The appellant's potential to reduce the judgment of
$730,000 plus costs estimated at $150,000 is hard to estimate
without the specifics that will be revealed in the factums. On
the other side, the respondent might have provided a more
specific itemization of debts and current needs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    I think it can be taken as a given that trial costs of at
least $100,000 will remain the entitlement of the plaintiffs and
the stay will be lifted to permit recovery of that amount to go
to the solicitors to pay disbursements and on account of fees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    Turning to the judgment and interest, it appears to me
that a base of $250,000 is a conservative estimate of the least
the respondent Eric Lewis is likely to recover, given success on
all the appellant's points of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    I therefore order that, in addition to the costs to be
recovered, the stay be lifted to permit the recovery of $250,000
by Eric Lewis on terms that should the judgment after appeal or a
new trial be less than that amount the deficiency shall be repaid
to the appellant. It is a term of this order that the $250,000 is
to be applied for the support of the respondents and the payment
of their debts, other than their legal fees (which are separately
provided for).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    If, at a later date, this order proves to be insufficient
to meet the needs of the respondents and there is convincing
argument that the appellant is unlikely to reduce the recovery to
a level above $250,000, the application may be renewed.
Similarly, if the costs of trial are assessed at a greater amount
than $100,000, a renewal application will be heard.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    Costs of this motion shall be paid by the appellant to
Eric Lewis in the amount of $1,000.00.</font></pre>
