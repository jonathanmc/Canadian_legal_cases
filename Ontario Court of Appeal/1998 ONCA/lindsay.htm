    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The respondent’s duties as the Assistant Chief Revenue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Collector were primarily supervisory and included maintaining and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlling staff, resolving problems, promoting morale and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">handling and securing large amounts of money and fares. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge found that an essential element of the employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship was mutual trust; this would obviously include trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the appellant in the respondent’s ability and integrity to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carry out his duties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge found that the conduct of the appellant in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">January and February 1990 undermined this essential element of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relationship.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Prior to the alleged theft, on November 29, 1989, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was well respected as a reliable and conscientious</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee. After being interviewed on December 17th during the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">course of the ensuing investigation, the respondent was told that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sthis seems to be the end of it.”  In actual fact, he remained a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prime suspect and rumours continued in the workplace about his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involvement in the alleged theft. A division developed within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">crew members between those who believed the respondent’s denial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of involvement and those who did not.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On December 28th, the respondent’s solicitor wrote the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant complaining of the tarnishing of the respondent’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reputation, requesting a vindication and warning of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possibility of a constructive dismissal action. Although the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigation continued through January and early February, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant did not respond to this letter, did not do anything to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quell the rumours and kept the respondent in the dark about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether there was an ongoing investigation and if so when it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">might end.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Prior to these events, the appellant’s practice was to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consult the respondent about changes in his work schedule. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">January 1990 schedule, which had been set in early December, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">changed at the end of December without any discussion with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent because of its security concerns relating to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged theft. The appellant reduced the number of supervisory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shifts for the respondent in January.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In answer to his inquiry about the reason for the change,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent was advised that the changes were made for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee training purposes. There was no mention of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuing investigation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On February 2, 1990, the respondent’s schedule for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period of February 4 to March 3, 1990 was changed by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant; again this was done without prior consultation. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time the changes resulted in the respondent having four single</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">days off in the first two weeks; clearly an arrangement that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant knew was undesirable to the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  When asked the reason, the respondent’s supervisor, Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ainsley, showed the respondent a memo from his superior Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Henderson, which sent Mr. Ainsley a rather ominous message, “You</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">created the problem – you fix it.”  Again, the respondent was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advised that he continued to be under investigation or that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be finality to the situation that had developed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Shortly afterwards, the respondent resigned. He was never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charged and the appellant does not argue that there is evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to support a conclusion that he is in fact guilty.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We are satisfied that the trial judge had sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence to make the finding that the appellant’s conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resulted in a loss of the essential element of trust in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment relationship. It was clearly open to the appellant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thoroughly investigate the alleged theft. However, it was open to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge to find that the imperfectly concealed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigation, the lack of candour, and the last minute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unilateral changes to the schedule undermined the trust that had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">existed between the appellant and the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In our view, on the facts of this case, that finding of loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of trust is capable of supporting a conclusion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was constructively dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] We arrive at this conclusion without accepting the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge’s finding that the rescheduling of the respondent’s days</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">off and supervisory days in January and February 1990 were in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">themselves, breaches of an express or implied term of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment agreement. Rather, we find that those unilateral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scheduling changes in the context of the suspicions and rumours</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involving the respondent contributed to the breach of what was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition of the employment trust.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Finally, we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluding that the respondent’s failure to continue his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment with the appellant until he found another job, in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of this case, amount to a failure to mitigate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
