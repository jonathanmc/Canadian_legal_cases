    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]   There are two questions of law of general importance raised</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">!    What is the appropriate standard of appellate review of an
audit judge's assessment of what constitutes fair and reasonable
compensation?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   These  two issues were also raised in Re Estate  of  Astrid</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mary  Gordon (C30225). The three appeals were heard together  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these reasons reflect submissions made in all the appeals.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Applicable Principles

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Section 61(1) of the Trustee Act provides:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          61.(1)      A   trustee,   guardian   or
               personal representative is entitled
               to   such   fair   and   reasonable
               allowance  for the care, pains  and
               trouble,  and the time expended  in
               and  about  the estate, as  may  be
               allowed  by a judge of the  Ontario
               Court (General Division).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The language of the statute is, of necessity, broad. Modern</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicial  efforts to structure the assessment required  under  s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">61(1)  so as to yield results which were fair to the trustee  and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Teetzel J. said, at p. 354:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          From  the  American and Canadian  precedents,
          based    upon    statutory   provision    for
          compensation   to  trustees,  the   following
          circumstances appear proper to be taken  into
          consideration   in  fixing  the   amount   of
          compensation: (1) the magnitude of the trust;
          (2)  the  care  and responsibility  springing
          therefrom;   (3)   the   time   occupied   in
          performing  its  duties; (4)  the  skill  and
          ability displayed; (5) the success which  has
          attended its administration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The five factors set out by Teetzel J. have been recognized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as   appropriate   considerations  in   determining   &quot;fair   and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable&quot; compensation under s. 61 of the Trustee Act: e.g. see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Re Mortimer, [1936] O.R. 438 at 441 (C.A.).

          categories   of  capital  receipts,   capital

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The issue to be determined here is the manner in which  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors  identified  in  Re Toronto General  Trusts  and  Central</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario  Railway,  supra, and the tariff  guidelines  are  to  be</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these  appeals, considered the oral submissions and examined  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant  authorities,  it appears that all  parties  favour  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach  set down by Killeen J. in Re Jeffery Estate, supra,  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p. 179:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          To  me, the case law and common sense dictate
          that  the  audit judge should first test  the
          compensation  claims using the  &quot;percentages&quot;
          approach and then, as it were, cross-check or
          confirm  the mathematical result against  the
          &quot;five-factors&quot; approach set out in Re Toronto
          General  Trusts and Central Ontario  Railway,
          supra.  Usually, counsel will,  in  argument,
          set  out  a factual background against  which
          the  five factors can be brought to  bear  on
          the  case  at hand. Additionally,  the  judge
          will  consider  whether  an  extra  allowance
          should  be  made  for  management,  based  on
          special  circumstances. The  result  of  this
          testing  process should enable the  judge  to
          determine whether the claims are excessive or
          not and, in the result, will enable the judge
          to  make adjustments as required. The process
          is  not scientific but is not intended to be:
          in  the estate context, it is a search for an
          award   which   reflects  fairness   to   the
          executor; in a real sense, the search is  for
          an  appropriate  quantum meruit  award  in  a
          unique setting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   Adams  J.  and  Steele J. (in dissent), in  their  reasons,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clearly  followed  the  approach set out in  Re  Jeffery  Estate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Certain passages in the reasons of Corbett J. (e.g. at pp. 282-3)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggest  some  departure from that approach. We  agree  with  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopt  the approach taken in Re Jeffery Estate. In our  view,  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">best achieves the appropriate balance between the need to provide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">predictability while, at the same time, tailoring compensation to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances of each case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Standard of Appellate Review

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The fixing of compensation under s. 61(1) of the Trustee Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is far from an exact science. As Adams J. observed, at p. 284, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;is  an  issue over which reasonable minds may differ.&quot; Appellate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review of that assessment must be restrained so that it does  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">become  merely the substitution of one reasonable assessment  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another  reasonable assessment. In Re Smith, [1953] O.R.  185  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">189 (C.A.), Pickup C.J.O. observed:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...  but the Court of Appeal should interfere
          if there is any error in principle, or if, in
          its  opinion, the amount allowed  is  grossly
          insufficient or excessive.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In addition to appellate review to determine compliance with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  applicable principles and to ensure that the result  is  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grossly insufficient or excessive, an appellate court may  review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings of fact upon which an assessment under s. 61(1)  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trustee Act is based. It will interfere with those findings  only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where   they  can  be  said  to  be  unreasonable:  Equity  Waste</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">335-6 (C.A.).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  If  an appellate court determines that the audit judge  has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made  an  unreasonable finding of fact, erred  in  principle,  or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reached a manifestly wrong result, it should, if possible, go  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  determine  the  appropriate compensation. In  doing  so,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellate  court  will accept any findings of fact  made  by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment  judge which the appellate court has not found  to  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unreasonable.  On  occasion  when  the  appellate   court   finds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reversible error, it will be necessary to order a new hearing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  In  his  written submissions, Mr. Mercer, counsel  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant   in  Re  Estate  of  Astrid  Haugen  Flaska  (C29542),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggested  that  the  Supreme Court of Canada  had  sanctioned  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">broader ambit of review in Re Atkinson, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 41. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">true  that  Kerwin J., for the majority, at p.  44,  rejected  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsound  the contention that the Court of Appeal could  interfere</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  the decision of the Surrogate Court judge only if it  found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  he had erred in principle. In Atkinson, however, the  Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Appeal had directed a reference to the master when  the  case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first  came  before that court ([1952], O.R.  685  at  692).  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">master  had  heard  several days of evidence  and,  as  required,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">returned that evidence, the exhibits and his report to the  Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  Appeal.  The court then determined the matter based  on  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expanded  record. In those circumstances, the court could  hardly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  limited to an examination of the record before the  Surrogate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court  judge. Re Atkinson is, however, the exception  and  should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not be confused with the rule as described in Re Smith, supra.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Did  the Divisional Court err in holding that Wright J. erred  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  The Divisional Court was divided on this question.  Corbett</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.  and  Adams J. found error in principle. Steele J. could  find</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">none.  It is apparent from the reasons of Wright J. that  he  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">primarily  concerned with the respondent's inability  to  provide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">even  a  relatively accurate estimate of the time  spent  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administration of the estate. Wright J. was also concerned  about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the absence of any documentation evidencing the time spent in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administration  of the estate. He focussed on these  inadequacies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  allowing the respondent only about 35% of the amount he would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been entitled to under the tariff guidelines. In fixing  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's  compensation,  it  appears  that  Wright   J.   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motivated,  in part, by a desire to encourage trustees  in  large</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estates   to  keep  detailed  records  of  time  spent   on   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administration of the estate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] There can be no doubt that time spent is one of the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors  in  fixing compensation. Nor could one  argue  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposition that trustees of large estates would be well  advised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  thoroughly document their time spent on work related  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estate.  We  cannot,  however,  agree  that  time  spent  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">administration of the estate can be the dominant consideration in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fixing  compensation, or that compensation should be  reduced  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;punish&quot;  a trustee who has not kept adequate records.  The  time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">spent  by the trustee on the estate is but one factor and  cannot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">become the ultimate measuring stick against which compensation is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined  any  more than any one of the other relevant  factors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can  be  given  a  dominant  position.  Reducing  the  assessment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required  by s. 61(1) of the Trustee Act to the mere  product  of</font></pre>
