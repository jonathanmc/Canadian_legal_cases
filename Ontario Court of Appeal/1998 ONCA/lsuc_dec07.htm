</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Between December 16, 1990 and September 24, 1991 Philip</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upshall, a solicitor, misappropriated over $900,000 from his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clients' trust account at the TD Bank. This appeal involves the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims of competing beneficiaries to the shortfall of funds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remaining in that trust account when it was frozen on October 2,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1991, and the manner in which their respective shares are to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined. It raises issues concerning what is known as &quot;the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rule in Clayton's Case&quot; and a descendant concept called &quot;the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lowest intermediate balance rule&quot; (frequently referred to by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acronym &quot;LIBR&quot;).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The account was frozen after the Bank was advised that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upshall had been hospitalized in a psychiatric ward and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Law Society would be managing the operation of his trust account</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from that point on. Mr. Upshall was subsequently found guilty of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misappropriating client monies by the Law Society of Upper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada, and disbarred. He made an assignment into bankruptcy on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 21, 1993.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  As is customary in the case of lawyers' trust accounts, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds deposited for the account of Mr. Upshall's clients were co-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mingled.  Clients' claims to the trust funds in the account as at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">October 2, 1991 total $656,703.06, and there is a significant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shortfall in what remains for distribution to the claimants. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence is that both the list of clients and the amounts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credited to each client as deposits are known and not in dispute.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The last misappropriation from the trust fund occurred on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">September 24, 1991. At the time, the balance in the account was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$66,242.68. On September 25th the TD Bank deposited the sum of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$173,000 into the trust account. It did so to enable Mr. Upshall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to advance mortgage funds to its client, Douglas Crump. Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upshall was acting as solicitor for the Bank and for Mr. Crump in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">connection with this mortgage transaction. The funds were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposited on condition that they be released by Mr. Upshall to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the borrower, or as the borrower may direct, once the solicitor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was satisfied that the the Bank would have a good and valid first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge on title. The account was frozen before this transaction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was completed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On October 2nd B immediately following notification that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upshall had been hospitalized and that the Law Society would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thereafter be managing the account B the Bank withdrew the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$173,000 from the trust account, without authorization, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transferred it to another solicitor to complete the mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction. On the Application by the Law Society before Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice Farley the appropriateness of the Bank's conduct in doing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this was very much in issue (he held it was inappropriate).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Before this Court, the Bank took the position that the appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be decided on the basis that the monies which had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">removed by it from the account were still in the account and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available for distribution. It is therefore unnecessary to deal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the grounds of appeal initially raised which relate to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue of the Bank's removal of the funds from the trust account.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The question on this appeal is whether all clients of Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upshall with funds deposited in the trust account have a claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the whole of the funds standing to the credit of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account as at the date of its being frozen (including the Bank's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposit of $173,000 made after the misappropriations had ceased),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or whether the claims of those clients other than the Bank are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confined to a smaller sum no larger than the $66,242.68 balance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which existed at the time the last funds were wrongly removed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant Bank argues for the latter position, on the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the lowest intermediate balance rule. The Law Society submits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appropriate approach is that of a pro rata distribution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">based upon the entirety of the fund as at the date the account</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was frozen.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Farley J. held that the lowest intermediate balance rule did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not apply in the circumstances of this case, and ordered that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">co-mingled funds should be distributed on a pro rata basis. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary, his reasoning was:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     a)   that once trust funds are co-mingled in an account they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          lose their &quot;earmarked&quot; identity to particular clients</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and become a single mixed trust fund;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     b)   that each client B although possessed of an individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          trust claim against the trustee for the funds advanced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          to the trustee B then has an equal claim against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          mixed account;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     c)   that the timing of the misappropriations is irrelevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and the appropriate point in time for determining the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          claimants' entitlement is the date on which the trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          account was frozen (or more technically, perhaps, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          time when the last injection of funds was made),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          because it is the money in the mixed trust account</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          which has been stolen and not that of any particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          client B &quot;the mixed trust account cannot be segregated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          into a 'tainted' pot (of X$) and an 'untainted' pot (of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          $173,000)&quot;; and,

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     d)   that a trust account which involves co-mingled funds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          should be distributed on a pro rata basis in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          circumstances where the account is in a shortfall</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The Bank's attempt to invoke the lowest intermediate balance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rule in the circumstances of this case amounts to nothing more,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in my opinion, than an attempt to re-invoke the rule in Clayton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Case, which was rejected by this Court and by the Supreme Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Canada in Re Ontario Securities Commission and Greymac Credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation, supra. The effect of applying the &quot;lowest</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fund beneficiaries is to permit the Bank B the last contributor B</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to recover what for practical purposes is all of its deposit1,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exactly the result which would transpire upon the application of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the rule in Clayton's Case. I do not think that result is called</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for in the circumstances of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Rule in Clayton's Case

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] What is known as the rule in Clayton's Case derives from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of the English Court of Appeal in Devaynes v. Noble,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Baring v. Noble; Clayton's Case (1816), 1 Mer. 572, 35 E.R. 781.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The so-called rule B which is really a statement of evidentiary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle B presumes that in the state of accounts as between a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank and its customer the sums first paid in are the sums first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drawn out, absent evidence of an agreement or any presumed intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the contrary: see Clayton's Case, per Sir William Grant, at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pp. 608 - 609, Mer. As Morden J.A. remarked in Greymac, (p. 677)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;the short form statement of the rule ... is 'first in, first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out' &quot;. In the result, where there are competing claims against a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shortfall, the shortfall is applied first to the first deposits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made, and later contributors to the fund take the benefit of what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remains.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The role of the rule in Clayton's Case in competing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiary cases, and its history, were examined thoroughly by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this Court in Greymac. The application of the rule was rejected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as being &quot;unfair and arbitrary&quot; and &quot;based on a fiction&quot; (p.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">686). The Court concluded that it was not bound to apply the rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Clayton's Case, and it did not do so. Nor, for that matter,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did it apply the lowest intermediate balance rule.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Speaking for a unanimous Court in Greymac, Morden J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resolved that as a general rule the mechanism of pro rata sharing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the basis of tracing was the preferable approach to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">followed, although he left room for other possibilities such as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those circumstances where it is not practically possible to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine what proportion the mixed funds bear to each other, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the claimants have either expressly or by implication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreed among themselves to a distribution based otherwise than on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a pro rata division following equitable tracing of contributions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(pp. 685-90). Whatever approach was chosen, Morden J.A. was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned that it should be one which met the test of convenience</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">B or &quot;workability&quot;, as he termed it (p. 688). The core of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court's conclusions is to be found in the following passage from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his judgment, at p. 685:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The foregoing indicates to me that the
          fundamental question is not whether the rule
          in Clayton's Case can properly be used for
          tracing purposes, as well as for loss
          allocation, but, rather, whether the rule
          should have any application at all to the
          resolution of problems connected with
          competing beneficial entitlements to a
          mingled trust fund where there have been
          withdrawals from the fund. From the
          perspective of basic concepts I do not think
          that is should. The better approach is that
          which recognizes the continuation, on a pro
          rata basis, of the respective property
          interests in the total amount of trust moneys
          or property available. [Underlining and
          underlining with italics added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Having determined that the rule in Clayton's Case ought not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be applied in cases involving the claims of competing trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiaries, Morden J.A. concluded in Greymac that pro rata</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sharing based on the respective property interests of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimants in the total amount of trust money or property</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available, should be applied. He accepted such pro rata sharing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as the general method of determining such competing claims.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Whether, as some have suggested2, he also recognized and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incorporated into the pro rata sharing exercise the concept of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lowest intermediate balance rule, and if so to what extent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is an issue that will be dealt with momentarily. First, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I propose to turn to an analysis of the history and application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the LIBR notion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule: An Outline

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The &quot;lowest intermediate balance rule&quot; states that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimant to a mixed fund cannot assert a proprietary interest in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that fund in excess of the smallest balance in the fund during</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the interval between the original contribution and the time when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a claim with respect to that contribution is being made against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fund: see Maddaugh and McCamus, The Law of Restitution, at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pp. 153 -154.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The LIBR concept is a descendant of the rule in Clayton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Case. It was originally articulated by Sargant J. in James Roscoe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Bolton), Limited v. Winder [1915] 1 Ch. 62. In that case the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchaser of a business, Mr. Winder, who had contracted to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collect the outstanding book debts of the business and to pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them to the company, did the former but not the latter. Over time</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eventually putting in more monies of his own and, again, drawing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the account for his own purposes. There was a credit balance</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contributions made by others to that fund (in the absence of some</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a rejection of the notion that the account may be treated as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a whole and the balance from time to time standing to the credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of that account viewed as being subject to one continual charge</font></pre>

          claimants] had $4,683,000 in the account.
          Regardless of how much they had earlier in
          the account, they cannot say that they had a
          proprietary interest in any more than the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foregoing comments of Morden J.A. as referring as much to timing</font></pre>

          &quot;rateably&quot;, and &quot;proportionately&quot; are
          inherently ambiguous. Do they mean that
          shortfalls or accretions to a fund are shared
          in proportion to the original interests
          claimants to that fund possessed? Or do they

          claimants to that fund possess after each
          transaction made with respect to that fund is
          taken into account? In the Working Paper we
          tentatively concluded that the latter meaning
          was fairest. [Underlining and italics added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               For example, A, a trustee, deposits
          $1,000 of B's money in his account, mixing it
          with $1,000 of his own money. A removes
          $1,500. A then deposits $1,000 of C's money.
          B and C should not share the fund of $1,500
          equally, notwithstanding that B's original
          interest in the fund was $1,000 and that C's
          current interest is $1,000. B's interest in
          the fund has been reduced by $500. B's lien
          should be reduced from securing $1,000 to now
          securing $500, the minimum balance of the
          fund following the deposit of his money and
          prededing the deposit of C's money. C would
          be entitled to a lien of $1,000. No
          transactions have occurred yet to reduce his
          interest in the fund. To avoid confusion,
          legislation enacting these recom-mendations
          should define exactly how &quot;pari passu&quot;
          sharing takes place. One possible formulation
          is as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If there are two or more persons with
          interests in a fund, the amount of any
          shortfall from or accretion to the fund which
          would have affected their respective
          interests, and which is not appropriated to a
          specific interest or interests, is divided
          and attributed to their respective interests
          in such proportion as their respective
          interests bore to the sum of those interests
          before the shortfall or accretion occurred.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Where, then, does all of this lead?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In the end, there remain two general approaches which may be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken to the resolution of how pro rata distributions are to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made in circumstances such as this case -- the rule in Clayton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Case having now been discarded for such purposes. The first is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that of applying the lowest intermediate balance rule. The second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is that of applying what Woolf L.J. called the &quot;pari passu ex</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">post facto&quot; approach, in Barlow Clowes International. There seems</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be no binding authority compelling the application of one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach or the other to circumstances such as those in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case. The Court should therefore seek to apply the method which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is the more just, convenient and equitable in the circumstances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] No authority has ever applied the lowest intermediate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">balance rule in circumstances involving the rival claims of trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiaries, as I have already noted. The mechanics of how the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lowest intermediate balance rule actually works have never been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fully explained. Indeed, even in situations concerning defaulting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trustees and beneficiaries, where the rule has been invoked, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not appear to have been implemented in any case involving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more than a small number of competing beneficiaries and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correspondingly small number of transactions. This, I suspect, is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because although LIBR may be &quot;manifestly fairer&quot;6 in the pure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sense of a tracing analysis, it is manifestly more complicated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and more difficult to apply than other solutions.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] What LIBR involves B as best I can ascertain it from the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] In my view, the method which should generally be followed in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases of pro rata sharing as between beneficiaries is not the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">LIBR approach but the pari passu ex post facto approach, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has the advantage of relative simplicity. This approach involves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taking the claim or contribution of the individual beneficiary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mixed fund as a percentage of the total contributions of all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those with claims against the fund at the time of distribution,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and multiplying that factor against the total assets available</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for distribution, in order to determine the claimant's pro rata</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">share of those remaining funds.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35]  This solution is the type of resolution which has been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopted, on a practical basis, in most cases involving more than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two or three competing beneficiaries. It is the solution applied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by this Court in Greymac, and by the English Court of Appeal in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Barlow Clowes International. It is the solution applied in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of other recent decisions at the superior court level in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this Province involving mixed trust funds,7 and it is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solution applied by Farley J. in the case under appeal.  But it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is not LIBR.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] It is, however, the approach which I favour.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] My conclusion in this regard is based both upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;convenience&quot; aspect (or the &quot;workability&quot; aspect, as Morden J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterized it in Greymac) pertaining to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of the LIBR principle, and upon my analysis of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concept of a mixed trust account and of its nature and purpose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The &quot;Convenience&quot; Rationale

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] First, with regard to &quot;convenience&quot;, I note the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comment of Morden J.A. in Greymac, at pp. 688 - 689:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          While acknowledging the basic truth of Lord
          Atkin's observation that &quot;[c]onvenience and
          justice are often not on speaking terms&quot;
          (General Medical Council v. Spackman, [1943]
          A.C. 627 at p. 638), I accept that
          convenience, perhaps more accurately
          workability, can be an important
          consideration in the determination of legal
          rules. A rule that is in accord with abstract
          justice but which for one or more reasons, is
          not capable of practical application, may
          not, when larger considerations of judicial
          administration are taken into account, be a
          suitable rule to adopt.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] LIBR is difficult to apply in cases involving any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant number of beneficiaries and transactions. Even in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this age of computer technology, I am not convinced that trustees</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of mixed funds B who might be in a position of having to sort out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misappropriation transactions on such an account and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distribution of what remains B should be assumed or required to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possess the software to enable a LIBR type of calculation to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">done in the myriad of situations that might arise. Indeed, there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is no evidence that such software programs exist, although it may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">well be that they do B at what cost and difficulty we do not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">know.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In this case it is not practicable to conduct the LIBR</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exercise. There are over 100 claimants. There were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misappropriations in the area of $900,000.00 in bits and pieces.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It is not even clear that each deposit and debit can be looked at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individually, on the state of the record, although the total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amounts deposited by each of the claimants are apparently known.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Notwithstanding this, if the LIBR principle is to be applied to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pro rata distribution in the circumstances of this case, it would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be necessary to consider not only the deposits of each individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimant and the timing of such deposits, but also what was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lowest balance in the Upshall account between each deposit and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the imposition of the freeze. This would involve analysing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pattern and timing of each misappropriation and applying the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results to each individual depositor's circumstances. It is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at all clear on the evidence that this exercise can be done.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The Rationale Based Upon the Nature and Purpose of a &quot;Mixed&quot;
     Trust Fund
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] On broader principles as well, in my opinion, the preferred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach in cases involving competing beneficiaries is that of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pro rata sharing based upon the proportion of a claimant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contributions to the total contributions of all claimants,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplied by the amount to be shared B i.e., the &quot;pari passu ex</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">post facto&quot; approach. This method spreads the misappropriations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rateably amongst the contributors who remain, but at the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time does not arbitrarily affect earlier contributors adversely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by limiting their charge or constructive trust in relation to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fund to the lowest balance in the account. It preserves what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Morden J.A. referred to in Greymac (at p. 684) as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">participant's claim to &quot;an equitable lien . . . to secure the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of its total contribution&quot;, and it is consistent with his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement (at p. 685) that,

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The better approach is that which recognizes
          the continuation, on a pro rata basis, of the
          respective property interests in the total
          amount of trust moneys or property available.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (Emphasis in both citations added.)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] In regard to this conclusion, it is useful to consider both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the practical considerations pertaining to a mixed trust fund and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the nature of such a fund itself.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] A mixed trust fund is a device whereby a trustee B</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">typically, but by no means exclusively, a lawyer B holds funds in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust for different persons or entities. It is in many ways a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mechanism of convenience, i.e., it avoids the necessity, and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cost, and the cumbersome administrative aspects of having to set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">up individual trust accounts, and the records relating to such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accounts, for the transactions relating to every beneficiary.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This practical characteristic of mixed trust funds should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognized in considering the nature of such funds. It provides</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an economic and organizational benefit to the public. As Farley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. noted, in the context of this case, &quot;Upshall was effectively</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acting as a banker in a safekeeping capacity&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] What follows from this, it seems to me, is that a mixed fund</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this nature should be considered as a whole fund, at any given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">point in time, and that the particular moment when a particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiary's contribution was made and the particular moment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the defalcation occurred, should make no difference. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">happenstance of timing is irrelevant. The fund itself B although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an asset in the hands of the trustee to which the contributors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have recourse B is an indistinguishable blend of debits and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credits reflected in an account held by the trustee in a bank or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other financial institution. It is a blended fund. Once the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contribution is made and deposited it is no longer possible to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identify the claimant's funds, as the claimant's funds. All that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can be identified, in terms of an asset to which recourse may be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had, is the trust account itself, and its balance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] The theme of a co-mingled trust account as a blended fund is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reflected in the reasons of Woolf L.J. and Dillon L.J. in Barlow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Clowes International (at pp. 27 and 35) and in those of Morden</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.A. in Greymac (at p. 6828). In Clayton's Case itself, Sir</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">William Grant, in introducing his &quot;first in, first out&quot; concept,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated (at p. 608, Mer):



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          But this is the case of a banking account,
          where all the sums paid in form one blended
          fund, the parts of which have no longer any
          distinct existence. Neither the banker nor
          customer ever thinks of saying, this draft is
          to be placed to the account of the ,500 paid
          in on Monday, and this other to the account
          of the ,500 paid in on Tuesday. There is a
          fund of ,1000 to draw upon, and that is
          enough. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     This notion of co-mingled sums as being &quot;in form one blended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fund, the parts of which have no longer any distinct existence&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continues to describe correctly the nature of a mixed trust fund,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in my view.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] In contrast to the blended fund concept is that of the mixed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fund as an amalgam of the contributions which have been placed in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it, identifiable for some purposes. This approach is reflected in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such decisions as Re Diplock's Estate, [1948] 2 All E.R. 318</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(C.A.). In that case, Lord Greene M.R. attributed to Equity the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adoption of &quot;a more metaphysical approach&quot; to the nature of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mixed fund. &quot;[Equity] found no difficulty, he said (at p. 346),
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          in regarding a composite fund as an amalgam
          constituting the mixture of two or more funds
          each of which could be regarded as having,
          for certain purposes, a continued separate
          existence. Putting it in another way, equity
          regarded the amalgam as capable, in proper
          circumstances, of being resolved into its
          component parts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] It is noteworthy that both the &quot;fund as amalgam&quot; and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;fund as a blend&quot; approaches enable equity to offer the remedy of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a charge, lien or constructive trust vis  vis the remaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">balance in the fund. The former has the affect, however, of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limiting the reach of these proprietary remedies. To my mind such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a restriction is not necessary. While &quot;proprietary tracing&quot; may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serve as the equitable vehicle which enables a claimant to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recourse to a mixed trust fund in the first place, equity can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">move beyond the strictures of that doctrine to provide a remedy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the claimant once the connection to the fund has been made.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The nexus is to be found in the concept of the equitable charge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lien or constructive trust. These concepts need not, in my view,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be confined to any part of the fund because, by their very</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature, they have always been applied against the whole of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fund.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The alternative conceptualization of
          equitable tracing in this context is implied
          in the notion of a charge on the mixed fund.
          Rather than purporting to distinguish parts
          of the funds and attribute them to particular
          claimants, this approach sees the claimants
          as having a proportional claim on the whole
          fund. If the whole diminishes in extent or
          value, the proportional claims remain the
          same, albeit that what the claimants get will
          be less because the fund is reduced.
          Arguably, this does not, strictly speaking,
          involve &quot;tracing&quot; because there is no
          pretence that that fund is being divided and
          a particular claimant's property identified.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] I accept, and adopt, the blended fund approach. At the end</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the day, when the trust account has been frozen and there is a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not think that an analysis which is based on the premise that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some beneficiaries' interests in the fund have been reduced by</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which simply says that each beneficiary has suffered a loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relating to the same misappropriations from the same mixed fund</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The fund is still the fund, and as Farley J. noted in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, it is not the Bank's money or the money of any particular</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If the Bank had insisted upon a separate
          trust bank account being set up, then it need
          not be worried about the claims of other
          clients. However all funds advanced by those
          concerned were deposited by Upshall in a
          mixed trust bank account at the Bank. As a
          result each client (including the Bank) had a
          claim concerning that mixed account. When the
          Bank's funds went into that account they went
          the same way as other fungible funds
          attributable to the other clients. The funds
          in that account were not individually ear-
          marked dollar by dollar for any particular
          client. Rather all clients as beneficiaries
          would have a claim against all the funds . . .

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Let me observe that a bank account involves a
          debtor (bank) - creditor (depositor)
          relationship. . . . When funds are deposited
          to a mixed trust account they lose their
          earmarked identity. Thus each client through
          the trust relationship with Upshall/Society
          has a claim upon the loan granted to the Bank
          through the operation of this mixed trust
          account. . . . It is the money in the mixed
          trust account which has been stolen; not that
          of any particular client. (emphasis added)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The significant problem with LIBR is that its application,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in a form true to its tracing origins and rationale, is too</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complicated. It may be &quot;manifestly fairer&quot; than the rule in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Clayton's Case in the sense that it attributes debits from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account equally and proportionately amongst the contributors.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Fairness&quot; may be relative, however. Is the rule necessarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;fairer&quot; when it limits contributors to the lowest intermediate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">balance in the account between the times of contribution and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distribution? The rule in Clayton's Case works &quot;unfairly&quot; against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first contributors to the fund, because it attributes the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first wrongful withdrawals to those contributions, eliminating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some claims but allowing others to be compensated in full. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of LIBR can have a similar effect, as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of this case indicate, because its &quot;last in, first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out&quot; regime favours later contributors. At the same time, a pro</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rata sharing based simply on the claimants' contributions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">measured proportionately to the assets available for distribution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can work against late depositors, as the circumstances of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case also illustrate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] What is at play here, in reality, is a choice of fictions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The rule in Clayton's Case and LIBR are both fictions. Any other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rationale which endeavours to establish a rule or principle on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which equity will divide a shortfall amongst those entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim against it is a fiction. Farley J. recognized the role of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fictions, or &quot;artificial rules&quot; when he said, in his second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Reasons, at pp. 6-7:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I do not see it as fair, equitable or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          practicable in the circumstances (and more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          especially since the Bank effected an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          claimants) to invoke libr. It seems to me</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          somewhat artificial (recognizing that all the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          rules involved in this area are artificial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          rules which must be applied with caution so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          as to maintain the closest approximation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          fairness, equity and reasonability, while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          recognizing practicality) to invoke libr</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          which by its very nature &quot;rewards&quot; those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          innocents who are later on the scene as</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          fortuitous accident of timing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] I agree. Earlier in these reasons I alluded to this Court's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejection, in Greymac, of the rule in Clayton's Case as &quot;unfair</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and arbitrary&quot; and &quot;based on a fiction&quot;. In this latter regard,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Morden J.A. cited (supra, at p. 686) the following oft-quoted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passage from the decision of Learned Hand J. in Re Walter J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schmidt &amp; Co. (1923), 298 Fed. 314, at p. 316:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The rule in Clayton's Case is to allocate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          payments upon an account. Some rule had to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          adopted, and though any presumption of intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          was a fiction, priority in time was the most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          natural basis of allocation. It has no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          relevancy whatever to a case like this. Here</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          two people are jointly interested in a fund</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          held for them by a common trustee. There is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          no reason in law or justice why his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          depredations upon the fund should not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          borne equally between them. To throw all the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          loss upon one, through the mere chance of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          being earlier in time, is irrational and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          arbitrary, and is equally a fiction as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          rule in Clayton's Case, supra. When the law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          adopts a fiction, it is, or at least it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          should be, for some purpose of justice. To</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          adopt it here is to apportion a common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          misfortune through a test which has no</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          relation to the situation. [Emphasis added.]

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] Such is the case here, in my view. To apply the LIBR</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle in the circumstances of this case would be &quot;to throw</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which has no relation whatever to the justice of the case&quot;. I do</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] In Greymac, Morden J.A. observed that &quot;if the application of</font></pre>
