[1]  Counsel for the appellants concedes that there are too many</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings involving the appellants Chavali and the companies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlled by them. He concedes further that the proceedings are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multiplicitous,  confusing and, in many instances, ill-advised.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He concludes &quot;that they are a mess&quot;. He agreed with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion from the bench that what the appellants require in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct of their litigation is a good editor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  It appears to the panel that it is in the best interests of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants as well as the respondents and those involved in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the administration of justice that any litigation involving the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants should proceed under the aegis of the court. This is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precisely the result that is achieved by the judgment under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In so far as the specific judgment under appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned, Cumming J. went through the various pieces of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation and, save for some inconsequential misstatements of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact, he concluded fairly that the various proceedings under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review were vexatious. He said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         In my view, and I so find, the
          Respondents [appellants] have persistently
          and without reasonable cause instituted
          vexatious court proceedings. I also find that
          they have persistently and without reasonable
          grounds conducted proceedings in court in a
          vexatious manner.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
[4]  Cumming J. then correctly addressed the consequence of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The consequence of an order
          under s. 140 [Courts of Justice Act] is that
          the Chavalis may apply for leave to the
          Court. However, the Court will serve as the
          needed screening device and gatekeeper to
          ensure that actions with a plausible claim
          can proceed while vexatious proceedings will
          be thwarted. The essential point is that a s.
          140 order does not prevent access to the
          courts. Rather, the order puts the Court in
          control of the process. The abuse of process
          and chaos seen in the proceedings to date
          will be brought under control. In reality
          (although the Chavalis would disagree) this
          will be to the gain of all parties, including
          the Chavalis. They have undoubtedly put
          considerable wasted time, money, and effort
          into an unfocussed and self-defeating
          pursuit.

[5]  Counsel objects to the stigma of having the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declared vexatious litigants, but aside from that, we note that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel welcomes a court mandated case management of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation. He submits that it would demonstrate that his clients</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are not entirely to blame for what has taken place and that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be up to the court to determine fault as between the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties and assist in moving the litigation forward. Counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wanted this panel to authorize the appellants to proceed with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three actions which he identified out of the many that are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outstanding in one form or another. However, this court is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appropriate forum for such an undertaking. It must be handled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on an on-going basis by a trial judge.
