    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Mr. Steep raised two issues on the argument of this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The first was that the reasonable notice period was too long and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was based, incorrectly, on the trial judge's mischaracterization</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the length of the respondent's employment with the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The second was that this was not a case in which punitive damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should have been awarded.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We did not call upon Mr. Gorodensky to respond to Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Steep's first submission. The trial judge found that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was employed by the appellant for 17 years, with a 5</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">year period of absence. That finding is supported in the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted by the trial judge. We would not interfere with it or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the award of damages made on the basis of reasonable notice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">having regard to such a period of employment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We did hear from Mr. Gorodensky and Ms. Hoffer in response</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Mr. Steep's second submission. In our view, the award of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive damages can be sustained on the basis of an independent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actionable wrong. That independent actionable wrong was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separate cause of action for misrepresentations made to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent by Mr. Todd on behalf of the appellant with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">job security when the respondent was rehired in 1987. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge found that the respondent was induced to leave another job</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in order to return to the appellant's employ. The last time he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had left that company he had made up his mind not to return, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in fact he declined Mr. Todd's overtures twice before agreeing to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">return. He finally agreed after Mr. Todd told him that he would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be a permanent employee with job security and full benefits, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he would not have to worry about lay-offs and that he would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employed until he retired. Although the trial judge found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these representations did not change the contract of employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from one of indefinite hiring to one for a fixed term, they were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inducements that led the respondent to act by changing jobs and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">joining the appellant again. Having induced him to come, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant then had him sign a letter with a 30-day notice clause</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that was contrary to the representations and inducements made to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him and that (as the trial judge found) was inserted without the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's knowledge in order to implement company policy to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minimize the cost of terminations. This was an act of bad faith</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and transformed Mr. Todd's representations into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misrepresentations. When the appellant terminated the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's employment summarily, without explanation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without reasonable notice, these representations became</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actionable as misrepresentations, an independent actionable wrong</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that properly founded the respondent's claim for punitive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages. We would not disturb the trial judge's decision as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the quantum of that award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The respondent brought a cross-appeal in which he sought an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase in the award of damages with respect to the reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice period if the award of punitive damages was disturbed. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we do not propose to disturb that award, it becomes unnecessary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to consider the arguments advanced with respect to the cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs. The cross-appeal is also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed but, in the circumstances, without costs.</font></pre></td>
