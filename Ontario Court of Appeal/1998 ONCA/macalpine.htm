</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  June MacAlpine, a registered nurse, had worked at the

Stratford General Hospital for 26 years when she learned that her

employment would be terminated.  She was 61 years old and 7

months away from being entitled to an unreduced lifetime pension.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  For the last twenty years she worked as an evening

supervisor or coordinator.  It was a permanent position but not

full-time.  Ms. MacAlpine worked a minimum of two 8-hour shifts

per week, including 3 weekends per month, and replaced the full-

time evening coordinator whenever she had days off, holidays, or

was ill.  Her working hours were from 4 p.m. until midnight.  She

earned $542.66 weekly, including 9% in lieu of benefits such as

vacation pay.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  As the evening coordinator, Ms. MacAlpine was in charge of

the 230 bed hospital.  She was responsible for the patients and

their families, any emergencies, the pharmacy, medical records,

supplies, the media, and instructing and disciplining a staff of

60.  She reported to the assistant director of nursing, who was

not at the hospital during the evenings.  Ms. MacAlpine, in other

words, was in charge of the administration of the hospital when

she was there.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In November, 1991, at a meeting with other part-time

coordinators, she was told by the Director of Nursing, Doug

Pinder, that the position of part-time coordinator would

eventually be phased out.  On January 20, 1992, she received the

following letter:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Dear Mrs. McAlpine:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As previously discussed the position of the
          Co-ordinator at Stratford General Hospital
          will become redundant.  It is the intention
          of this facility to eliminate the Co-
          ordinator hours 24:00 - 08:00 Monday to
          Friday, and 20:00 to 08:00 on week-ends and
          Statutory Holidays effective 1992 06 15.  In
          addition, the role of the Co-ordinator
          between 16:00 - 24:00 will change to reflect
          those Quality Assurance and Risk Management
          needs of the Nursing Department.  That is,
          the position of &quot;Manager, Nursing Quality
          Assurance/Risk Management (16:00 - 24:00),
          will be a contract position from 1992 06 15
          through to 1993 03 01.</font></pre>

          in 1992 06 and would at this time like to

          interested, to apply for this vacancy.</font></pre>

          1992 02 01.  Both positions will be posted
          internally and your application will be
          considered along with any other applicants.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  At the meeting on January 23, 1992 referred to in the last

paragraph of the letter, she met with Mr. Pinder and Sandra

Hanmer, the Assistant Executive Director of Patient Care

Services.  According to Ms. MacAlpine, it was &quot;a very vague

meeting.&quot;  In her words:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... It was -- nobody sort of initiated
          anything, it was, um, I was told at the
          meeting that perhaps that Miss Hanmer had
          been to hospitals before where the nursing
          people got into laundry or housekeeping and
          jobs not related to nursing.  And I asked if
          any of the jobs would be posted.  They said
          we were welcome to apply to anything within
          the hospital.  I asked if there was a
          management bulletin board.  I had never seen
          one.  And they said, &quot;No, there's just union
          bulletin boards.&quot;  And that was really about
          the extent of the meeting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Were you told at that meeting that your
          job was terminated?</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The trial judge, Kennedy J., found that Ms. MacAlpine's

employment was terminated on June 21, 1992. Based on the nature

of her duties as well as the length of her employment, he

concluded that she was entitled to 20 months' notice. She was

also awarded the following: vacation pay in the statutory amount

of $37 per week, an amount which had always been included in her

$542.66 weekly pay cheque; an amount equal to the difference

between the value of the lifetime pension and the refund of

contributions made; and solicitor/client costs based on the trial

judge's finding that the hospital gave misleading information

about the possibility of alternative employment, and had

terminated Ms. MacAlpine's employment in a &quot;callous manner.&quot; He

found that she had discharged her duty to mitigate her damages.

Her damages totalled $44,006.67, including prejudgment interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  The hospital appealed.

Notice Period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] The appellant's first submission is that 20 months is an

inordinately long notice period in the circumstances. While I

agree that it represents a notice period in the higher end of the

range for wrongful dismissal, it is not, in my view, so

unreasonable a period in the circumstances of this case as to

warrant appellate intervention.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] On the continuum along which notice periods are measured,

lengthening factors can include an employee's age, experience,

work record, and responsibility (Bardal v. Globe and Mail, [1960]

24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] In this case Ms. MacAlpine had devoted her entire working

life to this employer. She enjoyed a reputation for reliability,

and had no expectation at her age that she would ever - or would

ever have to - seek work anywhere else. Hers was a position of

enormous responsibility, with 60 staff and 230 patients dependent

on her judgment every evening she was at the hospital.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] This was a permanent job. Its part-time nature should not

interfere with an objective assessment of her actual duties and

how long she had been performing them. The fact that her position

meant that she was in charge of the hospital on a permanent and

regular basis is of far greater relevance than how many days per

week or month she worked. I see no error, therefore, in Kennedy

J.'s determination that 20 months is a reasonable period of

notice for the calculation of damages resulting from Ms.

MacAlpine's wrongful dismissal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Date of Notice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] I am not, however, in agreement with the trial judge's

conclusion that notice of termination was not unequivocally given

until June 21, 1992. The opening of the January 20th letter is:

&quot;As previously discussed, the position of Co-ordinator at

Stratford General Hospital will become redundant ... effective

1992 06 15.&quot; Ms. MacAlpine was a coordinator. The letter makes it

clear that her position would end June 15, 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] Ms. MacAlpine was not employed in any capacity other than as

a coordinator. The redundancy, therefore, of her position is the

termination of her employment relationship with the hospital. The

reference in the letter to the possibility of other jobs does

not, on a plain reading, detract from the clarity of the notice.

There was no alternative employment offered, only the invitation

to apply for other available jobs, for which she would be

considered &quot;along with any other applicants.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] The January letter is a clear expression that Ms.

MacAlpine's employment as nursing coordinator would be terminated

in June, 1992. The June letter merely confirms this. I would,

therefore, respectfully disagree with the trial judge's

interpretation of the two letters, and conclude that actual

notice was unambiguously given in the first letter on January 20,

1992 (Ahmad v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Inc. (1991), 1 O.R. (3d) 491

(C.A.)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] I would not, however, disturb the trial judge's findings

with respect to mitigation, vacation pay or pension losses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Mitigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] Kennedy J. made findings of fact for which there was an

evidentiary foundation with respect to the availability of

alternative employment. Ms. MacAlpine was 61 when her employment

was terminated. Given her age, as well as the employment

uncertainties and competition created by the hospital's

restructuring, the trial judge's conclusion that Ms. MacAlpine

had discharged her duty to mitigate her damages, was reasonable

and factually justified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Vacation Pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] Instead of taking holidays, Ms. MacAlpine always received

her vacation pay in the statutory amount as part of her weekly

salary. This pattern of vacation pay in lieu of vacation time

continued throughout her tenure at the hospital and was part of

her contract of employment. It follows that had she not been

wrongfully terminated, she would inevitably have continued to

receive this statutory payment rather than taking vacation time.

This distinguishes Ms. MacAlpine's case from Cronk v. Canadian

General Insurance Co. (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 505 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] To the extent possible, Ms. MacAlpine was entitled to be

&quot;made whole&quot; financially by recovering any income and benefits to

which she would have been entitled during the notice period. That

entitlement in this case includes the vacation pay she had always

received in lieu of time off.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Pension Losses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] It also, in my view, includes damages for pension losses

(McDonald v. Lac Minerals Ltd., [1987] O.J. No. 1216). The

hospital led no evidence on this issue. The trial judge

accordingly accepted the undisputed evidence as to vesting and

quantum provided by Ms. MacAlpine. Had she not been terminated

when she was, Ms. MacAlpine would have been entitled to an

unreduced lifetime pension in 1993. This is a recoverable loss,

compensable in damages, and properly included in the award to Ms.

MacAlpine. I see no basis therefore for interfering with Kennedy

J.'s approach or conclusion on this point.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22] Kennedy J. based his award of solicitor/client costs on

strong findings critical of the employer relating to its honesty,

fairness and general conduct in terminating Ms. MacAlpine. In so

doing, the trial judge displayed no errors in law or principle,

nor did he misappreciate the evidence. His order, however rare,

does not reflect an error in the exercise of his discretion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] I would allow the appeal only to the extent of adjusting the

damages to reflect a notice period commencing January 20, 1991

rather than June 21, 1991. The appeal is otherwise dismissed with

costs.
