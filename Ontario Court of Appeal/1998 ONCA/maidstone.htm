    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">granting the Township of Maidstone judgment against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor Loosemore Excavating Inc. in the amount of $61,793.54</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plus interest and granting the contractor judgment on its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counterclaim against the Township in the amount of $4,484.44. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action arises from the design and construction of a drain and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pumping station and related work.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The Township's claim against the contractor and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor's counterclaim both required an assessment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">competing opinion evidence as to the quality of the contractor's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work and the steps needed to correct deficiencies in that work.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That evidence was directed to numerous aspects of the work done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and was both detailed and technical. The trial judge made a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">careful item-by-item assessment of the claims and the competing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. Apart from two relatively minor matters, we see no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis upon which we can interfere with his findings. Those two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matters are:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    Item 20 - concrete under the CNR bridge ($8,560.00): The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     trial judge found that the contractor's work was below the</font></pre>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     standard required under the contract. He disallowed this claim

     on the basis that the Township had failed to show that it had

     used</font> <font face="Courier New" size="3">the &quot;most reasonable&quot; means available to correct the</font></pre>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     deficiency in the work. In our view, the Township was not </font></pre>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     required to meet</font> <font face="Courier New" size="3">that onus, but was only required to show that </font></pre>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     the steps taken were an appropriate response to the problem </font></pre>
      <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     created by the deficiency. The Township met that standard.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">*    Drain excavation on County Road 46 ($1,926.00): This claim

     was not referred to by the trial judge in his reasons. His

     failure to allow this claim was clearly an oversight in that </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     he did allow an identical claim relating to drain excavation </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     on another county road.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We would vary the award made in favour of the Township</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the contractor by adding $10,486.00 ($8,560.00 plus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$1,926.00). We would not otherwise disturb the amounts awarded on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claim or the counterclaim.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In its cross-appeal on the counterclaim, the contractor also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contended that as the engineer approved its work, there could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no finding that its work failed to meet the standard set out in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contract absent a finding that the engineer was negligent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Not only was there no such finding, the trial judge found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the engineer was not negligent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  It does not follow that a failure to prove that the engineer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fell below the applicable standard in approving work done by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor necessitates a finding that the work done was in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordance with the standards set in the contract. These are two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinct issues. There was ample evidence that parts of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor's work fell below the standard required by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract. Indeed, the real question at trial was not whether any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the work fell below that standard but rather, how much of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work failed to meet that standard.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  There was also a claim by the Township and a cross-claim by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contractor against the project engineer. Both were dismissed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the engineer was awarded costs as against the Township, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs were added to the costs awarded to the Township against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor. The Township appeals from the trial judge's finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it had not shown that the engineer was negligent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The allegation that the engineer was negligent was fully</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">canvassed by the trial judge who properly concluded that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no expert evidence as to the applicable standard of care and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no evidence that the standard was not met by the engineer. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence of such evidence, we can find no error in the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge's conclusion that the Township failed to prove that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">engineer was negligent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Finally, we see no error in the trial judge's disposition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the costs. In particular, we are not satisfied that he erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the exercise of his discretion in refusing to grant the engineer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor and client costs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Save for the relatively minor variation in the amount</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">awarded to the Township on its claim against the contractor, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would dismiss the appeal and the cross appeals. The successful</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties on each of the appeals are entitled to their costs of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that appeal.</font></pre></td>
