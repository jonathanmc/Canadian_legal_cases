    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one seeking such a judgment. The transcript of the hearing confirms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the bank was not given proper notice of this particular claim. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is not necessary to decide whether, on the materials before him, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">otherwise, it was open to the judge to grant a summary judgment for</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  It was reasonably open to the judge to make the findings that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did on the application to discharge the mortgages and we are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persuaded that he erred in arriving at his ultimate conclusions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Specifically, it was open to him to make the following finding:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... I am satisfied that Mr. Kelly thought that all
          he owed at the time of the mortgage statement was
          the amount shown on the mortgage statement itself.
          He did not think of the letter of credit as money
          owing because it had not become a debt to be paid.
          I would conclude that the person providing the
          statement from the bank no doubt had that same
          conclusion and had a reconsideration of that later
          on. The actual money that was outstanding on the
          mortgages at the time was in the neighbourhood of
          the $350,000. I think $355,537.90 was what was
          actually paid.
