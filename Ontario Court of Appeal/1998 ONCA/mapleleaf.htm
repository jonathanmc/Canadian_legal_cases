WEILER J.A.:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">OVERVIEW

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   The appellants are Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (&quot;Maple Leaf&quot;), a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bidder for the shares of Schneider Corporation (&quot;Schneider&quot;), and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two small shareholders of Schneider who are supporting Maple</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leaf. They raise two principal issues. The first concerns the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duties of a Special Committee of the Board of Directors of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider Corporation and of the Board itself when dealing with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid for change of control of the company. The second involves the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation of a provision in the articles of a company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commonly known as the &quot;coattail provision&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Schneider Corporation is an 108 year old Ontario corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is controlled by members of the Schneider Family (&quot;the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family&quot;)1 through a holding company. The issued share capital of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider consists of common voting shares and Class A non-voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares. Both classes of shares trade on the Toronto Stock</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Exchange, with the Class A shares representing most of the equity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the company. Although the Family only owns 17% of the non-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">voting shares, the Family controls the company because it owns</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately 75% of the common voting shares.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  On November 5, 1997, Maple Leaf, a competitor of Schneider,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">announced its intention to make an unsolicited take-over bid for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider at $19 a share, through its holding company SCH. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">response, the Board established a Special Committee consisting of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the independent non-family directors to review the Maple Leaf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer and to consider other alternatives. Subsequently Maple Leaf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">itself made an offer of $22 a share, but this offer was rejected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the Family. Ultimately, the Family told the Special Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the only offer it would accept was an offer made by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield Foods, an American company that, at the time, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equal to $25 a share. In order for the Family to accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer, which would have had the effect of enabling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield to &quot;lock-up&quot; control of Schneider, the Board had to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">take certain steps which, on the advice of the Special Committee,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it took. Despite this, and after the Family had agreed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer, on December 22, 1997, Maple Leaf made a further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer of $29 a share to Schneider's common and Class A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The law as it relates to the general duties of the directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a company is well known. The directors of a company have an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation to act honestly and in good faith in the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of the corporation: s. 134(1)(a) Business Corporations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (the &quot;OBCA&quot;). Further, in discharging</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their obligations, the directors must exercise the care,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exercise in comparable circumstances: s. 134(1)(b). If the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actions of the directors unfairly disregard the interests of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholder, unfairly prejudiced those interests, or are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">oppressive to them, s. 248 of the OBCA comes into play and allows</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the court to grant any remedy it thinks fit.2

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellants attack the actions of the Special Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the basis, first, that it was not in fact independent, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second, that the advice given by the Special Committee to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board was not in the best interests of Schneider and its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders. The appellants allege that the Special Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not act independently because it allowed Dodds, the Chief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Executive Officer of Schneider, to negotiate on the Committee's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">behalf with potential bidders. Furthermore, the appellants submit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Dodds and the members of the Special Committee were unduly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deferential to the wishes of the Family. The appellants' position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is that public statements made by the Family created an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expectation that an auction for the controlling block of shares</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Schneider (the Family Shares) would be held and that those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares would be sold to the highest bidder. The appellants say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, because Maple Leaf was not given a chance to bid after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer of $25 a share was received, the Special</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee, in acceding to the Family's request to accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer, truncated the auction process. Maple Leaf and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the other appellants seek to have this court invalidate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement between the Family and Smithfield on the basis that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process undertaken by the Special Committee and the Board, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">led to the Family's agreement with Smithfield, unfairly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disregarded the interests of the non-Family shareholders and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfairly prejudiced them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The second issue involves the coattail provision in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider's articles. A typical coattail provision provides that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if an offer is made for the voting shares of a corporation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the non-voting shareholders are excluded from that offer because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an identical bid is not made for their shares, the non-voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders have the right to convert their non-voting shares to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common voting shares. They can then tender to the offer for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common shares.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Maple Leaf offered the same premium to the Class A non-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">voting shareholders as it did to the holders of common voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares. But Maple Leaf claims that its bid nonetheless triggered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the coattail provision in Schneider's articles because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition attached to its bid for the non-voting shares was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identical to the condition attached to its bid for the common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares. As a result, Maple Leaf says that the effect of its bid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was to convert the non-voting Class A shares into common voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares. If all Class A non-voting shares were converted into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common voting shares the Family's percentage of common voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares would be diluted to a level where the Family's support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">might not be necessary for Maple Leaf's bid to be successful.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Maple Leaf might then be able to gain control of Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">despite the Family's lock-up agreement with Smithfield.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Farley J. dismissed the appellants' actions. In relation to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first issue, he concluded that the Special Committee and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors &quot;exercised their powers and discharged their duties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">honestly, and in good faith, with a view to the best interests of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider and that they exercised the care, diligence and skill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that a reasonable and prudent person would exercise in comparable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances in relation to dealing with the take over bid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation.&quot; He also found that because Schneider was known to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlled by the Family which could decide whether or not to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sell its shares, the company was never truly in play and no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public expectation was created that an auction would be held.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In relation to the second issue, Farley J. found that to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent that Maple Leaf's bid did not exclude the Class A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders from the premium being offered for the Family's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares, the coattail provisions were not triggered. Even if Maple</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leaf's offers were exclusionary, he held that the conversion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights did not arise because, pursuant to Schneider's articles,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Family had filed certificates undertaking not to accept an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclusionary offer without giving written notice to its transfer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agent. For the reasons which follow, I am of the opinion that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Farley J. was correct.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The Board of Schneider consists of nine persons: two members</font></pre>

          connection, the Corporation and Nesbitt Burns

          parties concerning possible transactions
          which would result in Shareholders receiving
          greater value for their Shares than under the
          Maple Leaf Offers. The Board of Directors and
          Nesbitt Burns are actively exploring
          alternatives to maximize Shareholder value.
          The Schneider family, which collectively
          beneficially owns or controls approximately
          75% of the Common Shares and approximately
          17% of the Class A shares on a fully-diluted
          basis, has advised the Board of Directors

          on the recommendation of its Special
          Committee, the Corporation has adopted a
          temporary Shareholder Rights Plan. This
          measure has been enacted to ensure that the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiving shares exchangeable into shares of Smithfield. Based on</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relevant exchange rate on that date, the Smithfield proposal</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leaf's subsidiary on November 5, 1997, the Family had no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention of selling its shares. By December 13, 1997, the Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had indicated a tentative preference to sell its shares to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield and doubted that either Booth Creek or Maple Leaf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would enhance their offers sufficiently that the Family would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender to them. However, the Family had made no decision to sell,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and if they were to sell, to whom, or at what price. The criteria</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">used by the Family to evaluate offers were first arrived at on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 13.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] On December 14, 1997, at a meeting of the Board of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Directors, management advised that it believed that Schneider was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;too big to be small and too small to be big&quot;, and that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strategic merger was in the best long-term interests of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider. The Family stated that it shared this belief. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family also advised the board of directors that it had reviewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amended Maple Leaf offer as well as the proposals from Booth</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Creek and Smithfield in terms of three factors: financial value,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuity of Schneider in a manner consistent with the Family's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">desires, and the effect of any transaction on customers and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suppliers. The Family told the Board that, while the Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal did not meet its financial adequacy criteria, it did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meet the Family's other two criteria and that, assuming the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield could satisfy the Family's financial adequacy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria, a strategic merger would be in the best interests of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Following this, a meeting was held by a working group that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">included Dodds and advisers from Nesbitt Burns and Goodman's.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This group made the decision that Dodds should go to see Luter,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield, and enter into negotiations with Booth Creek.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] On December 15, Dodds conducted further negotiations with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Booth Creek and on the morning of December 16, he met with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representatives of Smithfield, including Luter. Dodds explained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">why Schneider was historically undervalued.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  Around lunchtime, Smithfield increased the value of its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer to $25 per share on the basis of the price of Smithfield's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares and the relevant exchange rate on that date. In addition,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dodds obtained Smithfield's agreement that it would not sell</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider for at least two years, and would allow the Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">family to appoint a representative to Smithfield's board of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors. Luter told Dodds that this was his best, last offer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that if he had any suspicion Schneider was using Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">'s offer to try to obtain higher offers from others, he would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">withdraw his offer and make a public announcement disclaiming any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in the company. The Smithfield offer was open until 8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a.m. on December 18. That same day, Dodds reported this offer to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Family and Mida, the director of mergers and acquisitions at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nesbitt Burns and an adviser to the Special Committee.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] After Dodd's meeting with Luter, the Board issued an amended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors' circular recommending that Schneider shareholders not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender to the revised Maple Leaf offers. The Board of Directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not disclose that the Family would evaluate the offers using</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria additional to financial considerations. Under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heading &quot;Alternative Transactions&quot; the circular stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The Board of Directors has been actively
          engaged in a process of identifying other
          transactions that might result in greater
          value to Shareholders than was offered under
          the Original Offers. On December 12, 1997,
          the Board of Directors received proposals
          for, and is in the process of negotiating ,
          alternative transactions which might result
          in greater value to Shareholders than is
          being offered under the Amended Maple Leaf
          Offers.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] At 5 p.m. on December 17, 1997, Booth Creek made a revised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">written proposal to Schneider increasing the value of its offer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to $25.50 cash and stated that its offer was open until 8 p.m.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that same evening. At $25.50 the Booth Creek proposal was less</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attractive financially to the Family than the Smithfield share</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exchange proposal, which would yield them a tax saving of $4 per</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">share. Non-family shareholders, depending on their individual tax</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position, might or might not be in the same position. Booth</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Creek, a private company, could not offer a share exchange</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] At the meeting of the Board on December 17, 1997, the Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">announced that it wanted to accept the revised offer from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield. Among other things, the Family stated to the Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               We also think that it is important to
          reiterate that we as a family did not seek to
          sell this company but that through the
          process of the last 6 weeks we have come to
          the conclusion that now is the time to sell
          the control of the company.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] At a subsequent meeting of the Special Committee that night,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nesbitt Burns advised that while the Smithfield proposal was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the $25-29 fair price range, the risk associated with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adverse share price movement and exchange rate movement during</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the short period until the offer could be formally accepted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be reflected by applying a 6% discount to the offer so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that its present value was $23.50. Nesbitt Burns also told the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Special Committee that, in its view, if the Smithfield offer were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permitted to expire and no other change of control transaction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involving Schneider were consummated, the shares of Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would settle in a trading range between $18 and $20 a share.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] The Special Committee then recessed and Dodds made enquiries</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Smithfield as to whether it would raise its offer. Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused to pay more but Dodds was successful in negotiating a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">slight improvement in the exchange rate aspect of the offer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] The original proposal, as submitted by Smithfield,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated that the transaction would proceed by way of a plan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of arrangement or merger. That is, the Board would approve of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family entering into a lock-up agreement for its shares with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield, then the merger proposal would be voted upon by all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders and approved by the court. Before asking the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders and the court to approve the merger the Board would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have had to provide an opinion that the transaction was fair. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">light of Nesbitt Burns' discounted valuation of the Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal, the Board was unwilling to do so.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] To avoid the Board having to issue an opinion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposed transaction was fair, Smithfield made offers by way of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">take-over bids to acquire any and all common voting shares and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all Class A shares of Schneider on the condition that the Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agree to tender its shares. The shares of Schneider were to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exchanged for .5415 of a share in a newly incorporated, wholly-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">owned Canadian subsidiary of Smithfield. Each whole exchangeable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">share would then be exchangeable for one common share in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield. The structure of this second transaction meant that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield might not be able to acquire two-thirds of the Class A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shares and, therefore, might not be able to take Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">private.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In order for the Family to accept the offer from Smithfield,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was still necessary for the Board to waive the standstill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision in the confidentiality agreement Smithfield signed and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to remove the rights plan. The Family asked the board to do this.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so. On December 18, 1997, the Family entered into the lock-up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] On December 22, 1997, Maple Leaf announced that, despite the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family's lock-up agreement with Smithfield, it was increasing its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer to $29 per share, cash, conditional on obtaining two-thirds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of each class of share. Prior to this, Maple Leaf entered into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deposit agreements with two funds to buy Maple Leaf's shares at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$29, no matter what the outcome of its latest bid was. On</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Class A shares outstanding, wrote a letter to Schneider's Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Directors complaining that &quot;the actions or inaction of the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The law as it has evolved in Ontario and Delaware has the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common requirements that the court must be satisfied that the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a situation where a change of control transaction is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated, the special committee can only agree to a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The duty of directors when dealing with a bid that will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change control of a company is a rapidly developing area of law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, as I have indicated, Canadian authorities dealing with the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.A., at 311-312, found it unnecessary to decide the question</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case.4 I would add, however, that it may be that the burden of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proof may not always rest on the same party when a change of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control transaction is challenged. The real question is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the directors of the target company successfully took steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">avoid a conflict of interest. If so, the rationale for shifting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the burden of proof to the directors may not exist. If a board of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors has acted on the advice of a committee composed of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recommendation as to the best available transaction for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders in the circumstances, the business judgment rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applies. The burden of proof is not an issue in such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] The members of the committee acted in good faith in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sense that they acted honestly. The Committee's decision was also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">informed, in the sense that the Committee was aware that any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer for Schneider's shares might be bettered by Maple Leaf, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the Family would not sell to Maple Leaf. While the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants have challenged Farley J.'s finding that the Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not sell to Maple Leaf, there is ample evidence to support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this finding. Even at $29 a share, when tax considerations were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factored in, the Maple Leaf offer was only as advantageous as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer to the Family, not more advantageous. Apart from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial criteria, Maple Leaf did not meet the Family's</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuity of employment for Schneider's employees, the welfare</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of suppliers, and the relationship with its customers, whereas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield did. Once again, the real questions are whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee was independent and whether the process undertaken by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Special Committee was in the best interests of Schneider and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its shareholders in the circumstances. While Paramount, supra,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in determining the best transaction available in the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] The proposed evidence of Messrs. Cameron and Beck was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a statement of his views on the legal rights and obligations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which arose under Ontario law from a set of facts communicated to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] Farley J. ruled that the qualifications of the experts</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reports on three bases: 1) that the opinions expressed related to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he did not need the assistance of the experts in understanding</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (ii) Should members of Schneider's senior
               management, particularly Dodds, have been
               permitted to have a significant role in the sale
               negotiations with potential bidders?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] The appellants submit that Dodds had a conflict of interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because he had an interest in continued employment with Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and a further conflict arising out of his loyalty to the Family.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] A potential conflict of interest arises because as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">director of a target company, the senior executive has a duty to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">act in the best interests of the shareholders, but as a member of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">senior management the executive retains an interest in continued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment. In actively negotiating with a potential bidder the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executive is negotiating with his potential boss or executioner.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellants rely on the decision of Blair J. in CW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shareholdings Inc., supra., for the proposition that no senior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">executive of a company being sold should be permitted to have a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant role in the sale process.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The raison d'tre of a Special Committee independent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">management and the controlling shareholder is to protect the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of minority shareholders and to bring a measure of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objectivity to the assessment of bids. If, as was the case in CW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shareholdings, senior management in the target company is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member of the Special Committee, the purpose in setting up the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Special Committee might be compromised and less reliance placed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on its assessment of a particular bid than if the committee were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">truly independent. Blair J. recognized this and he was critical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the role played by senior management in CW Shareholdings. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the end, however, he concluded that the involvement of management</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the Special Committee did not so taint its approval of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shaw Communications bid as to undermine the transaction. He also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that the committee had conducted itself in a fashion that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enabled the directors to carry out their objective of maximizing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholder value. In that case, Blair J. upheld the Board's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision, based upon the Special Committee's recommendation to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enter into an agreement with Shaw that provided for a break fee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and asset agreement in the event that its bid was not accepted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] A major distinction between the CW Shareholdings decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and this case is that senior management, including Dodds, was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part of the Special Committee that was set up, and consequently</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had no vote as to whether to recommend a bid. A potential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conflict of interest still existed, however, because of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">active role Dodds played in negotiating with the bidders.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Farley J. recognized that in allowing Dodds and, to a lesser</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent, Hooper, the Chief Financial Officer of Schneider, to deal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with bidders directly, a potential conflict of interest existed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but that this had to be balanced against the benefits to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained. He stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It would be appropriate, however, to
          comment as well [th]at the use of the two
          management directors, Dodds and Hooper, in
          dealing with the bidders and advisors
          directly, would not seem inappropriate.
          Potentially there could be conflict, but that
          must be balanced against the reasonable
          benefits to be obtained. They knew the
          operations of the business -- what the
          bidders would be interested in and they were
          guided by the advisors. They reported to the
          Special Committee which could make the
          'final' decisions and give directions.
          Potential conflict was minimized by the bail-
          out packages granted them. From the material
          before me it would not appear that these
          management persons acted or behaved
          inappropriately overall. It would be
          undesirable to subject each step they took to
          isolated microscopic inspection. I note in
          passing that Dodds would have received
          approximately $1,000.000 in stock and options
          value extra if the Maple Leaf $29 offer had
          been accepted as opposed to the Smithfield
          one; of course no one but Maple Leaf knew how
          much it would have offered if it had been
          solicited on December 17th.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Dodds' employment agreement entitled him to resign within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two years following a change of control transaction with 30</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months severance. In CW Shareholdings, Blair J. commented that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">golden parachute did not eliminate the potential for conflict of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest that exists when a member of senior management</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negotiates directly with bidders. Here, however, Dodds was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given any assurances by Smithfield of continued employment,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although he knew that Smithfield intended to leave Schneider's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">management in place and allow it to operate as an autonomous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unit. On the other hand, Dodds was given some assurance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continued employment by Maple Leaf if Schneider was taken over by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it. He was told that he would manage the integration of Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for two years, and be a candidate to head the meat operations of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two companies. He was also told that he would retain his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">salary and be issued additional options in Maple Leaf. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition, at the time, Dodds held 250,000 options in Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a strike price of $13 and it was believed that Maple Leaf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would top any bid that was openly made for Schneider. It seems</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that if there was any financial bias arising out of Dodds' self</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in continued employment it would have been a bias in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour of Maple Leaf.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The appellants also submit that Dodds had a conflict of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in conducting the negotiations because his loyalties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were to the Schneider Family. But the Family did not ask Dodds to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negotiate with potential bidders. After Nesbitt Burns suggested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Smithfield might be a potential bidder, Dodds' meetings with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield were at the behest of the Special Committee, or its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advisers, Nesbitt Burns and Goodman, Phillips &amp; Vineberg. Farley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. found that the deadline for considering bids had been set by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mida, the Vice-President of Nesbitt Burns and its director of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mergers and acquisitions, as an appropriate deadline in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prevent the process from stalling. He also found that it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate for Dodds to keep the Family informed of the progress</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the negotiations since they could veto any sale. Counsel for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants strenuously submitted that inasmuch as Dodds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advised the Family of the result of his negotiations with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield on December 16th, and did not advise any member of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Special Committee of the negotiations, an inference should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drawn that Dodds' loyalties were to the Family and that this was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">illustrative of yet another conflict that Dodds had. The evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicates that although Dodds did not advise any members of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Special Committee directly on the 16th, he called Mida of Nesbitt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Burns, the adviser to the Special Committee. It does not appear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mida told anyone on the Special Committee of the Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal, as the evidence indicates that the Committee was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unaware of it until it met on the evening of the 17th. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances there would appear to be no reason to impute bias</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Dodds because of this omission.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The appellants also allege that it was Dodds' suggestion to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Luter that Smithfield proceed by way of a takeover for any and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all shares of Schneider -- as opposed to a plan of arrangement --</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that this suggestion also indicates Dodds' bias against Maple</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leaf. The proposal to proceed by way of takeover as opposed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">merger was not a suggestion that came from Dodds, but one that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been identified previously as the alternative Luter was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared to pursue if the Board could not recommend the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] The appellants submit that by creating a special committee,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hiring advisers, and setting up a data room, the Family used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider's money to better the offer from Maple Leaf, which it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not entitled to do. In addition to being rejected by Farley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J., a similar argument was rejected by Montgomery J. in Olympia</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and York, supra, at p. 272. The reason is obvious; the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appointment of a special committee is intended to ensure that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of those the oppression remedy is intended to protect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are not unfairly disregarded or prejudiced. It is clearly in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of a company, and of all shareholders, for alternatives</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to an unsolicited takeover offer to be explored. It might give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the shareholders a higher price for their shares. The creation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a Special Committee was part of the process undertaken by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board to obtain the best transaction available in the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dissipated must also fail. As Farley J. pointed out, access to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the data room was essential in order to conduct a market canvass</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for alternative offers. Other bidders, particularly those who had</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That could only be obtained with access to Schneider's</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its stake. Indeed, Farley J. found as a fact that the Family's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision to sell was highly conditional on a satisfactory offer</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the competing offers that the market canvass had generated</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and ask it to make another offer. A market canvass and not an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">auction was being conducted; the Special Committee and the Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only had a short time within which to consider Maple Leaf's</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that any expectations of the claimants, who were non-Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders, were not reasonable or founded in fact.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] A summary of his findings on this point is as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the Family's position on selling its controlling
     shareholding in Schneider was always conditional to a high
     degree. The Family only said that they &quot;might consider&quot;
     selling. The conditional nature of the Family's position was
     always clearly expressed by the Board in its public
     statements.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    it was inappropriate for Maple Leaf to ignore the plain
     meaning of the public statements made by the Family and the
     Board. Maple Leaf &quot;wished&quot; that there was an unrestricted
     auction for Schneider but in fact there never was.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the claimants had not proved that their reasonable
     expectations were thwarted. &quot;When the gatekeeper shareholder
     merely indicates that it 'might consider' accepting a more
     financially attractive offer, then the shareholders are
     speculating that a deal on that basis may come to pass in
     which they could participate.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[70] There was more than adequate evidence to support these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings and they cannot be disturbed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] Inasmuch as there was no reasonable expectation on the part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the non-Family shareholders that an auction would be held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after receiving the last Smithfield bid, the Special Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not obliged to give Maple Leaf an opportunity to make a third</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid for Schneider's shares.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Was the course of action and the advice given by the Special
     Committee in the best interests of Schneider and its
     shareholders? Should the Special Committee and the Board of
     Directors have refused to waive the standstill provisions in
     the confidentiality agreement with Smithfield?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] The appellants allege that the advice given by the Special</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee to the Board of Schneider was not in Schneider's best</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Special Committee should have refused to waive the standstill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions in the confidentiality agreement with Schneider,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thereby preventing the agreement between the Family and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schneider could not enter into a share exchange with Smithfield</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of fairness concerns it could not agree to a takeover</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid. These submissions are really alternative ways of saying that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the transaction with Smithfield was unfair to the non-Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders, that it was not in the best interests of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] If the Smithfield offer can reasonably be considered to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the best available offer in the circumstances, then the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield offer was not unfair or contrary to the best interests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the company. This is also essentially a fact driven question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on which Farley J. made the following findings:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the Smithfield offer was solicited by Schneider.
     Smithfield, a reluctant suitor, had to be &quot;coaxed&quot; to make a
     bid. Smithfield imposed a &quot;no-shop&quot; condition on its offer
     to the Schneider Family and did not want to haggle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    there was no breach of confidence in the communications
     between Smithfield, and the Schneider Board and the Family.
     The spirit of the standstill provision between Smithfield
     and Schneider was honoured. Confidential information was
     used appropriately in the best interests of the
     shareholders. At all times the Schneider Board remained in
     control of the process dealing with the Smithfield offer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    it was reasonable for the Board to accommodate a
     transaction between Smithfield and the Family by waiving the
     standstill provision contained in the Smithfield
     confidentiality agreement in view of advice received that
     the share price of Schneider would fall back to a range of
     $18 to $20 per share in the absence of a change of control
     transaction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    Maple Leaf could not have made an offer that would have
     been satisfactory to the Schneider Family at that time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the Board exercised their powers and discharged their
     duties honestly and in good faith.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the Board pursued all available opportunities to
     maximize shareholder value and achieved reasonable results
     for all of the shareholders of Schneider.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    it was unfair to say that the Special Committee had the
     Family's interests uppermost in its mind not those of the
     shareholders generally, or the non-Family shareholders
     specifically. It was beyond the power of the Special
     Committee to insist that the Family give up its veto power
     and the Special Committee realized this.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] As Farley J. emphasized, one of the particular circumstances</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">having a bearing on a board of directors' attempts to obtain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">best deal available in the circumstances was whether the company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has a controlling shareholder. For example, in Paramount, supra,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control of the corporation was not vested in a single person,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entity, or group, but was widely held by a number of unaffiliated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders. In that case, the proposed sale of shares</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">represented a premium for the change and consolidation of control</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the company in a group that would have the power to materially</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alter the interests of the widely dispersed shareholders. Here,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the control premium for the shares of Schneider belongs to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family. The unaffiliated shareholders do not own, and are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">giving up, the power to control the company's future.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] Another distinction between this case and Paramount is that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the offer from Maple Leaf, which was before the Special Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the time it was asked to make its decision, was considerably</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">less than the Smithfield offer. In coming to its conclusion that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was not in the interests of the non-Family shareholders to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prevent the Family from entering into a lockup agreement with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield the Special Committee considered, among other things:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          a)   that the shares would likely trade in
          the $18 to$20 range if no sale was effected;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          b)   the position of the Family that it would
          not accept the Maple Leaf offer at $22 or the
          Booth Creek offer -- or indeed any other
          offers from them;6</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          c)    that Smithfield would publicly withdraw
          its offer if the offer was shopped and, if
          this happened, the amount that Maple Leaf
          would be prepared to offer was problematic.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] While Smithfield's offer was not within the range that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nesbitt Burns had placed on the shares as fair value,&quot; 'a decent</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">forthcoming over an extended period of time: these facts support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the decision to proceed with the impugned transaction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] The Board acted on the advice of the Special Committee in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreeing to facilitate the Smithfield bid by passing a resolution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">waiving the standstill provision, thereby allowing Smithfield to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid and to enter into the lock-up agreement with the Schneider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Family. Unless another bid was received that was not conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the tender of any of the Schneider Family shares, which was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">highly unlikely, this decision by the Board had the effect of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">making the Smithfield bid the only one which would effectively be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available to the shareholders. Implicit in the steps taken by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board was a decision by the Board that the Smithfield bid was in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the best interests of all the shareholders and therefore a bid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which the Board could recomemnd to the shareholders.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] The Special Committee was entitled to make, and did make,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business and negotiating judgment calls which, having regard to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the intense and time-limit-driven context. The deal with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield was the only deal that the controlling shareholder was</font></pre>

          was tested.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">If Maple Leaf was given an opportunity to top the Smithfield bid</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficial to Schneider and all its shareholders than the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Smithfield bid. The Board acted on the advice of the Special</font></pre>

          variation is an omission of a material fact,
          and if so, what the remedy should be.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  Facts re interpretation of coattail provisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] Coattail provisions are designed to ensure that if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common voting shareholders wish to accept an offer that will lead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a change in control and if the price or terms offered to the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then be given a right of conversion of their restricted or non-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">voting shares into common voting shares. Coattail provisions are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended to encourage non- exclusionary bids. When triggered, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">non-voting shareholders then have the opportunity to participate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the take-over bid.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] The Schneider Family proposed that a coattail provision be</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Stock Exchange (&quot;TSE&quot;) was not required to have a coattail</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision at that time. The Schneider coattails are consistent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the present TSE policy requirements. Mr. MacKay, Schneider's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lawyer at the time, obtained the particular wording for the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">control premium only if the requisite number of common voting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholders accepted the offer and the premium was in fact paid</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the so called &quot;flaw&quot; in the coattail was recognized by
     Maple Leaf well before it made its offer;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    a literal or technical interpretation of the wording of
     the Schneider coattail would be impractical and lead to a
     commercial absurdity;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    when Maple Leaf made its offer, the intention and the

     its offers identical for both the voting and non-voting
     shares of Schneider;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    Maple Leaf did not disclose to the shareholders that
     its offer was exclusionary in its original take-over bid
     circular or in any subsequent amendment to that circular
     prior to the announcement of the Smithfield lock-up
     agreement with Schneider on December 19, 1997. It was not
     until January 8, 1998, that Maple Leaf issued a Notice of
     Variation which disclosed to all shareholders for the first
     time its belief that its Offer was exclusionary;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    Schneider's directors, on the other hand, described the
     Maple Leaf offer as a non-exclusionary offer in the

     November 23, 1997;</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    Maple Leaf put too narrow a focus on its obligation to
     disclose that its bid was designed to be exclusionary. It
     was inappropriate and misleading for Maple Leaf not to set
     out in an obvious fashion the information which a reasonable
     shareholder requires to make an informed decision;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    Maple Leaf &quot;lay in the weeds&quot; about its interpretation
     of the coattail, notwithstanding its knowledge of the
     Schneider directors' statement that Maple Leaf's offer was
     non-exclusionary. Maple Leaf did so because it did not want
     other competitive offerors to &quot;twig&quot; to its scheme;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    the technical interpretation now urged by Maple Leaf
     was not consistent with the intention of instituting the
     coattail at any time leading up to and including the time of
     the takeover.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[89] In view of his findings, Farley J. held that the word

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    The interpretation of a word or words is not a
     technical exercise undertaken in isolation from the
     objective or purpose sought to be accomplished : See
     Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes 3rd ed. (Toronto:
     Butterworths, 1994) at 131; thus, where giving a word its
     ordinary grammatical construction would lead to a
     contradiction of its apparent purpose or to a commercial
     absurdity, a construction may be put upon it which modifies
     the meaning of the word: P. St. J. Langan, Maxwell on the
     Interpretation of Statutes 12th ed. (London: Sweet &amp;
     Maxwell, 1969), at p. 228.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    A purposive approach is to be used whether one is
     interpreting a provision of a statute, a contract or other
     form of private legal document. In many respects the
     problems are the same in all three. A document is also a
     form of &quot;sub-legislation&quot; respecting those governed by its
     provisions: see Morden, &quot;The Partnership of Bench and Bar&quot;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     -    The words of a statute to be interpreted are to be read

     ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
     object of the Act and the intention of Parliament: Rizzo v.
     Rizzo Shoes Ltd., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27. (This decision holds
     that although the literal reading of the words in the
     Employment Standards Act entitling an employee to severance,
     termination or vacation pay upon termination by the employer
     would not include the employer's bankruptcy, when the words
     are examined in their entire context they must be
     interpreted to include a termination resulting from the
     bankruptcy of the employer.) So, too, here, the wording of
     the coattail provision must be given an interpretation which
     accords with its object and the intention of the framers of
     the provision.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">completely different as to its terms. This interpretation is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supported by regard to Article 16(b). Under Article 16(b), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anti-conversion certificate must be delivered within seven days</font></pre>

_____________________________
     1     There  are four branches of the Schneider  Family.  In
this  appeal,  &quot;Family&quot; refers to: the collective family  holding
company J.M. Schneider Family Holdings Limited (Family Holdings);
the  four  individual  family  holding  companies  (Harbour  Glen
Securities  Limited,  Kinspan Investments Limited,  Laurel  Ridge
Investments Limited, and Jadebridge Holdings Limited); and  seven
of  the  eight  Family members who serve as directors  of  Family
Holdings, Herbert J. Schneider, Frederick P. Schneider,  Jean  M.
Hawkings,  Betty L.Schneider, Anne Fontana, Eric  Schneider,  and
Bruce Hawkings.
     2    For the sake of convenience I will refer to s.248 as
the &quot;oppression remedy&quot;. For ease of reference the text of ss.134
and 248 is attached to these reasons as an appendix.
     3    Reversing the burden of proof was rejected by Farley J.
in this case. He declined to adopt the test in this case and to
place the burden of proof on the directors. He indicated that the
rights of shareholders in Ontario were protected by s.248 of the
OBCA and he would apply it. The enhanced scrutiny standard was
also rejected by Blair J. in CW Shareholdings Inc., supra, at 27,
in dealing with an application under the Canadian Business
Corporations Act to set aside defensive measures taken by a
company respecting a takeover. He commented that to the extent
&quot;enhanced scrutiny&quot; imposed the initial evidentiary burden on the
directors of a target company to justify their actions and their
business decisions it went too far and did not represent the law
in Ontario. While s.248 of the OBCA does not clearly state on
whom the onus lies, the use of the term &quot;complainant&quot; in s.248
and the broad definition of a &quot;complainant&quot;, which includes any
other person whom the court considers a proper person, suggest
that the onus is on the person alleging that the directors have
unfairly prejudiced, disregarded, or acted oppressively towards
the person. In many cases the facts necessary to found such a
complaint will be in the knowledge of the person alleging them
and the burden of adducing evidence on those facts should rest on
that person. The cases arising under these sections are, however,
fact specific. In cases where trust property is the subject of
the litigation and it is alleged that a personal benefit has been
given to members of the Board as a result of its actions, the
Board may bear the burden of adducing evidence as to the nature
of the transaction.
     4    There are fewer and fewer situations today where the
resolution of the question turns on the onus of proof. See the
comments of Sopinka J. in Amchem Products Inc. v. British
Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897.
     5    It is worthwhile noting however that on a subjective
basis no shareholder testified that any public pronouncement made
by the family created an expectation that an auction would be
conducted.
     6    Recall that the Maple Leaf and the Booth Creek offers
were worth considerably less to the Family and to the non-Family
shareholders, provided they were in a similar tax position to the
family. Smithfield's share exchange offer was worth approximately
$4 a share more to them.</font></pre></td>
