[1]  The appellant was charged with one count of attempted
murder by wounding, contrary to s. 239 of the Criminal Code,
and one count of trafficking in narcotics, contrary to s.
4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act. He appeals his conviction
and sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On April 6, 1993, the appellant pleaded guilty to the
charge of trafficking before Judge Charlton of the Ontario
Court (Provincial Division). On August 29, 1994, he was
tried before Chapnik J. and a jury in the Ontario Court
(General Division) and convicted on the attempted murder
charge. He was sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment for
the attempted murder and 2 years consecutive for the
trafficking offence. He had served ten and one half months
of pre-trial custody. In addition, the trial judge made an
order under s. 741.2 of the Code (now s. 743.6) delaying the
appellant=s eligibility for parole until he had served at
least one half of his sentence. Finally, the trial judge
imposed an order under s. 100(1)(b) of the Code prohibiting
the appellant from owning or possessing any firearm or
explosive for life.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The events giving rise to the charges and the
subsequent convictions involve an undercover police &gt;sting=
operation in the Regent Park area of Toronto. On November
17, 1993, the appellant was engaged in the sale of crack
cocaine in the vicinity of Dundas and Sherbourne. Constable
Ward, the victim of the attempted murder, was one member of
a four member undercover team that was planning to buy a
small quantity of crack. Through an informant, the team
learned that the appellant was indeed selling crack.
Constable Ward approached the appellant, who agreed to sell
him 4 rocks of cocaine for $100. The two men hailed a taxi
so that the appellant could obtain the crack from his stash.
Upon arriving at the appellant=s building, the appellant
left to get the crack. Ward remained in the taxi, during
which time he noticed that the remainder of the team, who
were to have been tailing him in two unmarked cars to
witness the purchase, were not yet in view.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant returned to the taxi, entered it, and
gave Ward the crack. Ward, while aware that the remainder of
the undercover team was still not in view, decided to arrest
the
appellant on his own.
[5]  According to Ward, he identified himself as a police
officer and told the appellant that he was under arrest for
trafficking. The appellant denies that he was told at any
time by Ward that he was a police officer, and states that,
throughout the subsequent events and until his arrest, he
thought that Ward was trying to rob him of his drugs. A
struggle ensued in the taxi, which then spilt into the
parking lot. A number of blows were exchanged. According to
Ward, during the struggle the appellant said  Alet go, I=ll
fucking kill you@. He then produced a knife and hit Ward in
the head with it; the blow drew blood. Ward, in attempt to
drag the appellant across the lot and into the view of the
undercover team, pulled the jacket over the appellant=s
head. At that point, the appellant opened the blade of the
knife and stabbed Ward once in the lower back.  The 3 to 4
inch deep wound was later described at trial as a serious
injury.
[6]  At trial, the defendant testified that he had acted in
selfdefence. According to him, Ward had never identified
himself as a police officer. The appellant believed that
Ward was trying to Arip him off@ for the rest of the cocaine
on his person. He testified that after the struggle, the
knife Afell from him@. He also stated that at no time until
his arrest did any of the police officers identify
themselves as such, which testimony was countered by the
officers, who testified that they identified themselves as
police as soon as they left their car.
[7]  In its closing address, the Crown suggested to the jury
that the appellant=s after the fact conduct in fleeing the
scene and the disposal of the knife revealed his Aguilty
mind@. Whereas the appellant testified that the knife fell
from his hand, the Crown suggested that he had in fact
thrown it away, which was not consistent with the
appellant=s explanation that he thought that he was the
victim of a robbery attempt. In addition, the Crown
suggested that the appellant=s decision to run down a dark
laneway, rather than seeking help in a nearby grocery store,
was also inconsistent with his testimony that he thought
himself to be the victim of a robbery.
[8]  The appellant now raises three issues in his appeal
against conviction.
     Issue 1:  Consciousness of Guilt
[9]  The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in not
instructing the jury on the relevance of the appellant=s
after the fact conduct. However, the trial judge=s
instruction to the jury followed a meeting in her chambers
where it was agreed with counsel that she not put s. 34(1)
of the Code to the jury or any charge relating to
consciousness of guilt.
[10] This decision appears to have reflected the considered
judgment of defence counsel. While counsel on appeal now
says that the Crown=s address to the jury on the flight of
the appellant mandated an instruction on consciousness of
guilt, trial counsel who was in the position to ask for such
an instruction was not prepared to change his mind as to his
initial strategy and made no such request.
    Issue Two:     Failure to give R. v. W. (D.) warning
[11] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not
instructing the jury in accordance with R. v. W.(D) (1991),
63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). Once again, however, trial
counsel for the accused made no objection as to this
omission. In our view,
the jury instruction, taken as a whole, emphasised the
burden on the Crown to establish that the appellant had the
necessary intent to commit murder, and that on the issue of
self-defence, the burden remained on the Crown to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not act in
self-defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Accordingly, we do not think that the appellant was
prejudiced by the lack of a R. v. W. (D.) instruction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Issue Three:   Failure to respond adequately to the
questions of the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge
erred in her response to the question from the jury
regarding the necessary intent to kill. We find no such
error. The reinstruction was correct in law. The complaint
now made concerns the trial judge=s review of the facts.
Once again, defence counsel agreed with the trial judge that
the answer that she had given to the question asked was
entirely sufficient.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Sentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The appellant is 29 years of age and has a lengthy
criminal record, but the conviction for trafficking in
narcotics to which he pleaded guilty was part of the same
transaction that resulted in the conviction for attempted
murder. Having regard to the total sentence imposed, as well
as the substantial pre-trial custody, in the circumstances,
the sentences should not have been consecutive, but
concurrent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] We would also strike down the order made under s. 741.2
(now s. 743.6) of the Code restricting the appellant's
eligibility for parole. No separate reasons are given for
making such an order and none appear in the body of the
reasons as to sentence generally.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence of 2 years
for trafficking will be concurrent with the sentence of 13
years for attempted murder so that the totality of the
sentences will be 13 years and not 15. The order under s.
741.2 of the Code (now s. 743.6) is quashed.</font></pre></td>
