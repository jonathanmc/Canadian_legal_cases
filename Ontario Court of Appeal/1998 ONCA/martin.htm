</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  After a lengthy trial, Lederman J. of the Ontario Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(General Division) found that the respondent Robert E. Martin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(&quot;Martin&quot;) suffered personal losses following a breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty owed to him by the appellants Clifford Goldfarb</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(&quot;Goldfarb&quot;) and his law firm, Farano, Green. He awarded damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against them for $5,949,447.00 together with pre-judgment</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The nature of the breach

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Nigel Stephen Axton (&quot;Axton&quot;) was a client of Farano, Green.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He was a disbarred lawyer who had been convicted of numerous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counts of fraud in 1985 and sentenced to four years and six</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months in the penitentiary. Goldfarb knew about Axton's past and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had told members of his firm of what he knew. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that Goldfarb became responsible for the conduct of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton which led to Martin's financial ruin by concealing Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">past from Martin and by permitting Axton, without objection, to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refer to himself as Nigel Stephens, and variations thereof.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb appeared to think that he was justified in suppressing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton's background because he believed Axton when Axton told him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had reformed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Martin met Axton under the name of Nigel Stephens in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">course of business dealings and it was Axton who referred Martin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Goldfarb as a client. At the time that Goldfarb started acting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for Martin, Goldfarb knew that Axton had become the financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advisor to Martin and his various corporations. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found, and the appellants now concede, that the failure of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb to advise Martin of what he knew of Axton's background</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a breach of his fiduciary duty as a solicitor to both Martin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and his corporations. Martin asserts that had he known of Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">past, he would have terminated his relationship with him or at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the very least he would have been more careful before accepting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his advice. He asserts that he was ruined because of Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direct actions or that of his associates, known as the Frog Pond</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Group. In the end, Martin and his companies were petitioned into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Issues in appeal

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There are three issues in this appeal. They are interrelated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and none is simple. The first relates to establishing a causal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">connection between Goldfarb's breach of fiduciary duty in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">narrow area of the breach found by the trial judge and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages suffered by Martin's corporations because of frauds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perpetrated by Axton and his associates. The second addresses the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure of the trial judge to distinguish the losses suffered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin personally from those suffered by the corporations he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlled. The third addresses the lack of cogent evidence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this trial record to support the quantum of damages in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial award made by the trial judge. For the reasons that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follow, I am of the opinion that Martin is entitled to only those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses he incurred personally in respect of transactions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involving Axton that occurred after July 28, 1988. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identification and quantification of damages in this case is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wholly unsatisfactory and I would remit the matter back to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge to determine the proper award of damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Overview of the facts

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The respondent Martin was a successful owner and operator of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a number of nursing homes, the first of which he purchased in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Newmarket from his father and the rest he acquired systematically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by conventional financing methods. He mortgaged or re-financed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">existing properties or sold them and utilized the proceeds to buy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new nursing homes. In addition, he inherited his father's 75 per</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cent share interest in the company that owned the Newmarket Golf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Country Club and later acquired 150 acres of land adjacent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the golf course known as the Golf Course House lands. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apparent that while Martin was land rich and cash poor, he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">well to do by any standard before the happening of the events</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that I will briefly relate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Martin's assets were by and large owned by various</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations of which he was the controlling shareholder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, by 1986 these corporations were generating significant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negative cash flows on operations. Accordingly, he made a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fundamental decision in late 1986 to seek public financing. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was introduced to a solicitor who specialized in initial public</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offerings and from that point forward the entire nature of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business changed. He became engaged in what is known as a reverse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">take-over whereby he incorporated a public company, TLC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Properties Inc., and caused it to acquire from him two of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nursing homes. Martin became Chief Executive Officer and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal shareholder of TLC Properties. Shortly thereafter, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was introduced to the concept of acquiring nursing homes for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">syndication to limited partnerships.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Martin engaged in an aggressive expansion program utilizing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these financial initiatives and almost immediately encountered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serious economic set backs. In May of 1987 he acquired a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">partially completed retirement home in Sudbury called Champlain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lodge. It was immediately syndicated to a limited partnership,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">TLC Sudbury Retirement Lodges L.P. with a Martin corporation,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">716255 Ontario Limited, as the general partner. Martin's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation was to complete the remaining construction. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became more expensive than anticipated. We do not have proper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial records of what occurred but it is apparent that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became a substantial cash drain to Martin during 1987 and 1988.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In 1987, Martin decided to enter the Toronto nursing home</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">market and was persuaded to make a substantial investment for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimate syndication in a property at 500-504 Kingston Road. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate vehicle he used was TLC Properties. The vendor was 500</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kingston Road Properties Limited, a company owned by Garth</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Anthony, who was in business with Axton and others in what is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to as the Frog Pond Group. Goldfarb had acted for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Anthony on his initial acquisition of this property and again on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its sale to Martin. At the closing of the Kingston Road</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acquisition, Martin met Axton under the name Nigel Stephens. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knew that Axton was then acting for the landlord (Anthony) in  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dispute with the tenants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Once again, Martin had to undertake to complete substantial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renovations. One of his companies entered into a contract with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company of Anthony's called Burbrook Developments Inc. to do the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work at a fixed price of $1,600,000. This acquisition was replete</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with problems. They included difficulty in the removal of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">existing tenants. There was delay in obtaining a building permit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and a permit for above grade work was never obtained.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Applications were made to the Committee of Adjustments for ten</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separate variances including a variance to increase the number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beds in the renovated nursing home. The problem with the limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of beds was never resolved. Martin accused Burbrook of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cheating him. The trial judge found that the whole project was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disaster.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Another venture was 412-14 Jarvis Street in Toronto. It also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved Anthony and the Frog Pond Group. After completing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negotiations for the purchase with Anthony, Martin accepted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Anthony's suggestion to consult Goldfarb. On July 28, 1988,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin caused Martinvale Estates to retain Goldfarb for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose of closing the deal. This transaction had striking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">similarities to Kingston Road. Without going into them in detail,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is apparent that it was a most unwise investment. As the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge found:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The Jarvis Street project
          turned out to be perhaps even a greater
          nightmare and financial disaster than that of
          Kingston Road. There were ongoing problems of
          trying to evict the tenants; there was a
          significant cash drain on Martin's resources
          in the form of legal fees for landlord and
          tenant applications and for work orders and
          by-law infractions, providing security for
          the building, repairing fire escape systems
          and furnace/boiler systems; and generally
          dealing with the advanced state of the
          deterioration of the building.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] What is important to remember at this stage is that Martin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had made the decision to embark upon this vigorous expansion plan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior to meeting Axton or Goldfarb. His initial advisors were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unrelated to the Frog Pond Group or to the law firm of Farano,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Green. While he came into contact with the Frog Pond Group in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kingston Road project, his dealings with them were at arms'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">length and he employed his own solicitors and financial advisors.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin dealt with the Group as vendors again in the Jarvis Street</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">project and for the first time retained Goldfarb to close the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction. The trial judge deducted the losses on the Kingston</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Road and Jarvis projects and others from his computation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages arising out of the misconduct of Axton for which he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prepared to make Goldfarb and his firm liable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Axton has been described as a charmer and a master</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manipulator. It did not take the relatively unsophisticated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin long to fall under his spell. Shortly after Goldfarb</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">started acting for Martin, Martin moved into the building that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">housed Axton and the Frog Pond Group. He very soon became totally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dependent upon Axton for his financial advice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Under Axton's ministrations, a program for rapid expansion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that had its own frailties when supported by honest advisors,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quickly became a race to the bankruptcy courts. Axton reverted to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his old criminal ways and he and the Frog Pond Group engaged in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succession of schemes whereby the value of the assets of Martin's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations were artificially inflated to secure additional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage financing. Some of these mortgages were guaranteed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin personally. In many instances, the mortgages were supplied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by corporations controlled by the Frog Pond Group and the spread</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the true value of the properties and the inflated value</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was siphoned off by the Group.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] During this period, Goldfarb and his law firm acted for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin and his corporations on acquisitions but Farano, Green did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not act for the Frog Pond Group on its financing of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acquisitions. These were handled by in-house counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Group, Aleksandra Kurowska-Barrie, another defendant in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action. There were also legitimate financial deals with bona fide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financing with which Martin corporations became involved and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb acted in these transactions, as well. It is unnecessary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">here to refer to all the transactions in which Martin was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved with Axton when he was represented by Goldfarb. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffices to say that during the period beginning July 28, 1988</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and ending in the fall of 1989, Goldfarb represented various</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">companies in which Martin had a direct or beneficial interest on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a transaction-by-transaction basis. One of the principal tasks</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge undertook was to attempt to sort out from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">multitude of complex transactions those which were bona fide and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those which caused ruin to Martin because of the actions of Axton</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and his associates.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chronology of the litigation

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In November of 1989, Martin, Newmarket Golf and Country Club</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Limited, and Martinvale Estates Limited commenced an action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(#43071/89) in the Ontario Court (General Division) against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton, his associates and numerous corporations that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">controlled, claiming damages for fraud, misappropriation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conversion with respect to a number of the above referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions. In early 1990, the plaintiffs obtained a Mareva</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injunction. On September 6, 1990, Martin was petitioned into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy along with Newmarket Golf and Country Club and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martinvale Estates by the Royal Bank of Canada.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The defendant Kurowska-
          Barrie's second ground for a stay is a
          reference to s. 245(1) of the Business
          Corporations Act which requires a shareholder
          to apply to the Court for leave to bring an
          action in the name of or on behalf of a
          corporation. The defendant argues that the
          wrongs complained of by the plaintiff are
          claims of his corporation and not his
          personal claims. The defendant argues that
          the plaintiff has not sought leave of this
          Court to commence the action and if leave was
          requested, it would not be granted. In my
          view, s. 245(1) of the Business Corporations
          Act does not apply to a sole shareholder
          situation as the plaintiff in this case Y and
          he has a right to bring this action in his
          personal capacity.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] It was the evidence of Martin that had he known the truth</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about Axton's background, he would never have become involved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with him let alone entrusted control over his entire finances to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him. Moreover, had Goldfarb told Martin what he knew of Axton at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any time during the fiduciary relationship, Martin said he would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have terminated his association with Axton and the Frog Pond</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Group immediately, or at the very least, have made arrangements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to carefully scrutinize their activities. However, this position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ignores the fact that Martin was involved with Axton before he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">met Goldfarb. Indeed it was Axton who introduced Martin to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb, not the other way around. As the trial judge found:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         By the time Goldfarb had
          started to act for him, Martin was deep into
          the Kingston Road and Jarvis Street projects.
          Even if he had learned from Goldfarb about
          Axton's identity and past, any bail out of
          the projects would have still resulted in
          heavy losses for Martin. The extreme costs
          incurred in the two projects, which
          ultimately resulted in the loss of the
          properties, no doubt are attributable to the
          risks of the development business and are not
          causally connected to any non-disclosure of
          the defendants. These losses are too remote
          from the breach of duty by the defendants.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The trial judge accepted Martin's evidence as to his growing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dependency upon Axton and his ultimate loss of control of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal and corporate assets to Axton and his associates. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted that Goldfarb should have told him about Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">background. As to Goldfarb, the trial judge found:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         Goldfarb was obviously
          persuaded by Axton that he was truly reformed
          and would pursue only legitimate real estate
          activities. Goldfarb believed that Axton had
          paid his debt to society and was entitled to
          have the opportunity to earn a livelihood.
          Goldfarb testified that throughout the series
          of transactions in which he acted for Martin,
          during the height of the real estate boom B
          the freewheeling late 1980's, characterized
          by the Royal Bank's La Roche as &quot;the glorious
          days&quot; B he had no reason to believe that the
          Axton's transactions were anything but
          proper. Unfortunately, by not sharing what he
          knew about Axton with Martin, he deprived
          Martin of the opportunity of making his own
          business judgment about becoming involved
          with Axton and the transactions. Goldfarb
          should have so informed Martin the moment he
          accepted a retainer to act for any of the
          Martin companies.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         By failing to disclose this
          material fact, Goldfarb concealed facts
          material to Martin's well-being and thereby
          violated his duty of loyalty to Martin and is
          in breach of his fiduciary duty.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] It is significant that the trial judge relied solely upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of fiduciary duty as the basis for finding liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the appellants. The original claim in negligence is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ignored, indeed it appears to have been abandoned by Martin. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         In the instant case, Martin is
          not complaining about the quality of
          Goldfarb's legal work. The claim is not that
          Goldfarb negligently performed legal services
          or neglected to properly inform the client or
          explain important facts pertaining to the
          transactions themselves. Rather it is that
          Goldfarb deliberately failed to disclose an
          important piece of information to his client:
          namely, the history of Axton.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Perhaps because of this position taken by Martin in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation, the trial judge did not make specific findings of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligence against Goldfarb. He seems content to observe that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;there were a number of factors which should have set off alarm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bells and must have created suspicion in Goldfarb and Kurowska-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Barrie's minds&quot;. (Kurowska-Barrie also knew of Axton's past). The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge commented further that &quot;their antennae would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been sensitive to the possibility of abuse by Axton in the sheer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of transactions that he was carrying on behalf of Martin&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He also noted that they did not take any steps to learn about the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">details and business merits of the numerous purchases and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financings despite their knowledge of Axton's past criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">practices. He concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         Axton used the faHade of
          solicitors such as Goldfarb and Kurowska-
          Barrie to give Martin a false sense that his
          affairs were being handled honestly by the FP
          Group and overseen by solicitors.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] More important than the absence of a finding of negligence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against Goldfarb and his firm, the trial judge was not prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to find that Goldfarb was complicit in the various frauds being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perpetrated by Axton and the Frog Pond Group on Martin and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations. Specifically, the trial judge found that once Axton</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acquired control, neither Goldfarb nor Martin's other advisors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">really knew what was going on. Consequently, we are left with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threshold finding of breach of fiduciary duty by the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but nothing seems to flow from that finding. However, in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment of damages, the trial judge does follow, with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant modifications, the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; approach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin in determining the quantum of damages such that Martin's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses reflect the diminution of the value of his personal and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate assets beginning in July of 1988 and terminating in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimate insolvency in September of 1990. Martin testified that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was a rich man before meeting Axton and now he is destitute.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He seeks to be restored by Goldfarb and his law firm to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial position he enjoyed prior to his becoming involved with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton albeit conceding as a matter of law that Goldfarb is only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">responsible for the deterioration of his fortunes following July</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">28, 1988 when Martin became a client of Farano, Green. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">problems inherent in the trial judge's assessment of the quantum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of damages will be considered in a later section. I am concerned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">here with causation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Remedies in the nature of restitution are usually premised</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the circumstance that the fiduciary has misused confidential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information to his or her advantage and to the detriment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person to whom a fiduciary duty is owed. Such a remedy might be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate in assessing damages against Axton, but here it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conceded, and so found by the trial judge, that Goldfarb did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">profit personally from his relationship with Martin except to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent that his law firm obtained legal fees for providing legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">services. Failing a finding that Goldfarb was complicit in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton's fraud, I cannot see a basis for directly attributing to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb all of the consequences of Axton's conduct that post</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dated July 28, 1988. Goldfarb and Axton were not co-conspirators</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or joint tort feasors. Indeed, far from being involved in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fraud, the reasons of the trial judge suggest that Goldfarb too</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a victim of Axton's manipulation. He was not prepared to say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">even that Goldfarb and other members of his law firm, forewarned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Axton's criminal past, were negligent in failing to recognize</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicia of fraud in the impugned transactions which Farano, Green</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">handled as solicitors for Martin's corporations. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         Once Axton obtained control,
          he embarked upon a scheme so clever and
          devious that neither Martin nor, indeed, the
          professionals, such as Goldfarb or Kurowska-
          Barrie, really knew what was going on. Axton
          used Martin's assets for his and FP's own
          self interest by making false claims and
          exorbitant claims for fees and disbursements
          and obtaining mortgages as security for them;
          making secret profits; creating false
          mortgages and trying to mask the entire
          scheme by utilizing a vast array of shell
          companies.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Notwithstanding his inability to tie Goldfarb into Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fraud, in his analysis of the evidence as to the responsibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Goldfarb for Martin's losses, the trial judge concentrated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon the evidence of the actions of Axton and his associates. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that they were acting in a fiduciary capacity to Martin and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his corporations. He held that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         Martin had in a sense,
          completely delegated to them all his
          financial assets and followed their
          instructions and directions slavishly. He was
          completely dependent upon them for advice and
          deferred to their expertise in matters of
          land acquisition, financing and development.
                               . . . .
                         They [the Frog Pond Group]
          thereby acquired total control over his
          assets and monies and purportedly acted on
          his behalf.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In support of this analysis respecting Axton and his</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99 at p.136 where she held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that relationships in which a fiduciary obligation have been</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    1.   The fiduciary has scope for
          the exercise of some discretion or power,
                    2.   The fiduciary can unilaterally
          exercise that power or discretion so as to
          affect the beneficiary's legal or practical
          interests,
                    3.   The beneficiary is peculiarly
          vulnerable to or at the mercy of the
          fiduciary holding the discretion or power.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] The trial judge held that these features were present in the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust&quot;. Taking the trial judge's analysis to this point, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal fiduciary duty is that of Axton and his associates to</font></pre>

          impact on the question of the stranger's
          knowledge of the trust. If the trust was
          imposed by statute, then he or she will be
          deemed to have known of it. If the trust was
          contractually created, then whether the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the owner and vendor. Wollen was aware that the property was not</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the process of reselling it in Henderson's name at a higher</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Wollen paid over the secret profit to the intermediary company</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] In the Supreme Court, there were two sets of judgments, La</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Forest J. for the majority and McLachlin J. for the minority</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view. Both groups were of one mind in the result. The breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty was conceded as was the finding that Canson would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not have bought an interest in this property and the joint</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">venture had there been no breach. This established that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of trust resulted in the acquisition of this joint venture</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest. However, applying a common sense view of causation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further losses sustained in the construction of the warehouse did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not result from the breach of the fiduciary duty. McLachlin J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated it this way at p. 557:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The construction loss was
          caused by third parties. There is no link
          between the breach of fiduciary duty and this
          loss. The solicitor's duty had come to an end
          and the plaintiffs had assumed control of the
          property. This loss was the result, not of
          the solicitor's breach of duty, but of
          decisions made by the plaintiffs and those
          they chose to hire. To put in the terms of
          Wilson J. in Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2
          S.C.R. 335, what the plaintiffs lost as a
          result of the breach of fiduciary duty was
          the opportunity to say no to acquisition of
          the property represented by the joint
          venture. The difference in the price
          represented by the secret profit, together
          with expenditures incidental to the
          acquisition, restores the lost opportunity.
          Thereafter, recourse does not lie against the
          solicitor, whose duty and control had ended,
          but against others.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] La Forest J. addressed the difference in the manner of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calculating compensation for breach of fiduciary duty as opposed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a traditional breach of trust with a clearly defined res</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(object of the trust), a trustee and a cestui que trust. He said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at p. 578:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The appellant urged us to
          accept the manner of calculating compensation
          adopted by the courts in trust cases or
          situations akin to a trust, and they relied
          in particular on the Guerin case, supra. I
          think the courts below were perfectly right
          to reject that proposition. There is a sharp
          divide between a situation where a person has
          control of property which in the view of the
          court belongs to another, and one where a
          person is under a fiduciary duty to perform
          an obligation where equity's concern is
          simply that the duty be performed honestly
          and in accordance with the undertaking the
          fiduciary has taken on; see Sealy, &quot;Some
          Principles of Fiduciary Obligation&quot;, [1963]
          Cambridge L.J. 119; Sealy, &quot;Fiduciary
          Relationships&quot;, [1962] Cambridge L.J. 69. In
          the case of a trust relationship, the
          trustee's obligation is to hold the res or
          object of the trust for his cestui que trust,
          and on breach the concern of equity is that
          it be restored to the cestui que trust or if
          that cannot be done to afford compensation
          for what the object would be worth. In the
          case of a mere breach of duty, the concern of
          equity is to ascertain the loss resulting
          from the breach of the particular duty. Where
          the wrongdoer has received some benefit, that
          benefit can be disgorged, but the measure of
          compensation where no such benefit has been
          obtained by the wrongdoer raises different
          issues. I turn then specifically to that
          situation. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    At p. 580:
                    We have been given no case where
          the principles applicable to trusts have been
          applied to a breach of fiduciary duty of the
          type in question here, and for reasons
          already given, I see no reason why they
          should be transposed here. The harshness of
          the result is reason alone, but apart from
          this, I do not think that the claim for the
          harm resulting from the action of third
          parties can fairly be looked upon as falling
          within what is encompassed in restoration for
          the harm suffered from the breach. This is
          the view taken in all the Canadian courts
          that have dealt with the issue. [Emphasis
          added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] La Forest then goes on to state that the fusion of law and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equity provides a general but flexible approach that allows for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direct application of the experience and best features of law and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equity whether the cause of action or remedy originates in one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">system or the other. He suggests that the equitable remedy of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restitution is not likely to be resorted to frequently, except as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an adjunct to some equitable remedy, and concludes that there is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no reason why equity should not borrow from the common law. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appears to be of the view that the distinction between equity and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the law is largely meaningless in cases involving breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty such as Canson (and I would add the case in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal) since the objectives of both equity and the law are the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same. Consequently, it is appropriate to award damages in breach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of fiduciary duty cases as in common law actions. The court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should determine the loss occasioned by the breach where there is</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in these areas. On his advice, Hodgkinson invested in a number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MURBs as tax shelters and lost heavily when the value of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MURBs fell during a decline in the market. Unknown to Hodgkinson,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Simms was also acting for the developers in structuring these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MURBs and did not disclose that fact to Hodgkinson. It was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] Speaking for the majority of the Supreme Court, La Forest J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">held that the proper approach to damages for breach of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty is restitutionary. The appellant was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be placed in as good a position as he would have been in if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach had not occurred. Hodgkinson was found at trial to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">changed his position because of a material non-disclosure and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Simms did not meet the burden of proving that the victim would</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. stated that mere speculation is not enough. However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notwithstanding the general economic recession, the particular</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss in full.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] On the findings made by the trial judge, it is not possible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to make a direct application of the above principles to the case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in appeal. The trial judge found that it was the breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty by Axton and his group which caused the damage. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not prepared to attribute all of Martin's losses to Goldfarb</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because some occurred before Goldfarb's fiduciary duty arose or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was unrelated to Axton's conduct. To find Goldfarb liable for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton's breach of trust, under Air Canada, it is necessary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">find that Goldfarb knowingly assisted in Axton's dishonest and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fraudulent design. No such finding was made. To the contrary, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge appears to be of the view that Goldfarb was himself</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dupe of Axton in finding that he and his firm were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manipulated to provide a veneer of respectability to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions Axton caused Martin to enter into.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] In Hodgkinson, the measure of damages is more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">straightforward. The person owing the duty, Simms, recommended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four distinct purchases which Hodgkinson would not have made had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he known of Simms' interest in them. The MURBs suffered losses by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason of market forces. Had Hodgkinson not made the purchases he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not have incurred the market losses. To restore Hodgkinson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to his original position, the court awarded damages equivalent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his market losses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] What made Hodgkinson so straightforward was the fact that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was but one breach of duty, that of Simms. But for Simms'</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The solicitor, Wollen, acted for both parties and he was aware</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that an intermediary party, for whom he also acted, was making a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secret profit. He not only actively participated in this</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">services rendered to that intermediary. The Supreme Court had no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty in determining the damages to Canson once they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted that Canson would not have entered into the purchase had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canson known of the secret profit. The breach of duty led to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canson losing the opportunity to say no to the purchase.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly the lost opportunity could be restored by returning</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">real estate transactions had been commenced prior to Goldfarb's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrival on the scene. On the findings of the trial judge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considerable harm had already occurred. Certainly the groundwork</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been laid for Martin's ultimate ruin. Here, there never was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an opportunity to say no: at best there was the loss of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opportunity to say no more. The burden rested on Martin to show</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there was a causal connection between the breach of duty by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb and the actions of the third party Axton. I think that</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] Unlike Canson, the solicitor Goldfarb should have</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Moreover, Goldfarb's duties as solicitor continued. He had more</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] This case is not like Air Canada. There is no finding of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actual knowledge or willful blindness or even recklessness on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part of Goldfarb respecting the activities of Axton. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">similar to Canson in that Goldfarb found himself in a conflict of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in representing both Martin and Axton and he committed a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of fiduciary duty in not telling Martin what he knew of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton's criminal past, a lack of disclosure that is related to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton's dishonesty and consequent harm.. It is dissimilar,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, in that there is no finding that Goldfarb knew that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton was making a secret profit at Martin's expense.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] I think that Canson combined with Hodgkinson provides the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">casual connection in this case. The consequence of Goldfarb's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of fiduciary duty was that Martin was not given the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opportunity to say no in the limited sense of being able to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review his relationship with Axton and the Frog Pond Group in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">light of the knowledge that he should have had of Axton's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">background. There is a causal connection between the breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty and the harm done but the harm cannot be quantified by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; approach advocated by Martin. He is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to blame his solicitors for his total ruin. It is not at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all clear that his initial decisions to expand and &quot;go public&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were not fatal to the financial health of his corporations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Moreover, he must show a direct personal loss that is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attributable to transactions that his corporations entered into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following July 28, 1988.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] I will make some suggestions later as to what could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fruitful lines of inquiry. There is certainly nothing in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record which is helpful. As I will develop, the record before the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition of Martin and his corporations on July 28, 1988. We</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">know that Martin's personal resources were badly depleted because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the two transactions, Kingston Road and Jarvis Street in which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was already involved with Axton, and that those resources were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further eroded by later and separate transactions that Axton had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing to do with such as a nursing home in St. Petersburg,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Florida and an investment in a plastic engine being developed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin's friend Dr. Kerr.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] In my opinion, the damages in this case are limited to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direct loss caused to Martin personally by the transactions where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he and his individual corporations dealt with Axton and the Frog</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pond Group after July 28, 1988, the point at which Martin engaged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Goldfarb to provide legal advice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Second issue: the failure of the trial judge to distinguish the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses suffered by Martin personally from those suffered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations he controlled.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] The reasons of the trial judge demonstrate that he was alive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the fact that most, if not all of the transactions under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review, were carried out by corporations controlled by Martin.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, the significance of this fact is not developed. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treated all the damages suffered by the aggregate of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations as if they were the losses of Martin personally.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, under corporation law, Martin and his corporations are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separate legal personalities. The fact that he is the principal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shareholder and the directing mind of the corporations does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expose him to personal liability for the corporate losses and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conversely does not entitle him to personal compensation from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those inflicting harm on the corporations. In making his claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for compensation, Martin ignores the reality that, in most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, it was the corporations, not the shareholders,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that suffered the losses because of Axton's conduct. This point</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is in no manner an academic one. The corporate losses are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">translated into losses to those who looked to the corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assets for payment of loans and trade debts. Upon a realization</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of these assets in a bankruptcy, the creditors are paid first, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order of priority, and the shareholders are paid last. By</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purporting to compensate Martin for what are in fact and law the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses of the corporations, the trial judge permitted Martin to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jump to the front of the queue to the prejudice of all creditors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of these corporations: see R. v. Rukland (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d)</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] It is true that as a guarantor of some of the corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages, Martin was exposed to personal liability on those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages. Had he paid the amounts owing on them, he would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been entitled to claim against the corporations for indemnity and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would become a creditor himself. However, there is no evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he did pay on his personal guarantees and this potential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">source of damage was not developed factually at trial.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.C.R. 165, the Supreme Court of Canada re-affirmed the principle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Foss v. Harbottle. Speaking for the court, La Forest J. stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at pp. 211-212:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The rule in Foss v. Harbottle
          provides that individual shareholders have no
          cause of action in law for any wrongs done to
          the corporation and that if an action is to
          be brought in respect of such losses, it must
          be brought either by the corporation itself
          (through management) or by way of a
          derivative action. The legal rationale behind
          the rule was eloquently set out by the
          English Court of Appeal in Prudential
          Assurance Co. v. Newman Industries Ltd. (No.
          2), [1982] 1 All E.R. 354, at p. 367, as
          follows:
                         The rule [in Foss v.
          Harbottle] is the consequence of the fact
          that a corporation is a separate legal
          entity. Other consequences are limited
          liability and limited rights. The company is
          liable for its contracts and torts; the
          shareholder has no such liability. The
          company acquires causes of action for
          breaches of contract and for torts which
          damage the company. No cause of action vests
          in the shareholder. When the shareholder
          acquires a share he accepts the fact that the
          value of his investment follows the fortunes
          of the company and that he can only exercise
          his influence over the fortunes of the
          company by the exercise of his voting rights
          in general meeting. The law confers on him
          the right to ensure that the company observes
          the limitations of its memorandum of
          association and the right to ensure that
          other shareholders observe the rule, imposed
          on them by the articles of association. If it
          is right that the law has conferred or should
          in certain restricted circumstances confer
          further rights on a shareholder the scope and
          consequences of such further rights require
          careful consideration.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] The exception to the rule is also stated by La Forest J. at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p. 214:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         One final point should be made
          here. Referring to the case of Goldex Mines
          Ltd. v. Revill (1974), 7 O.R. (2d) 216
          (C.A.), the appellants submit that where a
          shareholder has been directly and
          individually harmed, that shareholder may
          have a personal cause of action even though
          the corporation may also have a separate and
          distinct cause of action. Nothing in the
          foregoing paragraphs should be understood to
          detract from this principle. In finding that
          claims in respect of losses stemming from an
          alleged inability to oversee or supervise
          management are really derivative and not
          personal in nature, I have found only that
          shareholders cannot raise individual claims
          in respect of a wrong done to the
          corporation. Indeed, this is the limit of the
          rule in Foss v. Harbottle. Where, however, a
          separate and distinct claim (say, in tort)
          can be raised with respect to a wrong done to
          a shareholder qua individual, a personal
          action may well lie, assuming that all the
          requisite elements of a cause of action can
          be made out. [Emphasis in the original.]

          the facts of that case, to consider a
          situation where the same wrongful act is both
          a wrong to the company and a wrong to each
          individual shareholder. In one sense every
          injury to a company is indirectly an injury
          to its shareholders. On the other hand, if
          one applies the test: &quot;Is this wrongful act
          one in respect of which the company could
          sue?&quot;, a shareholder who is personally and
          directly injured must surely be entitled to

               damage to the company and also to
               shareholders or a class of them, is a
               shareholder's cause of action for the
               wrong done to him derivative?
                         At p. 221 of that case the
          court, after referring to the constituents of
          a personal action, answered that question as
          follows:
                                   A derivative action,
               on the other hand, is one in which the

               always a class action, brought in
               representative form, thereby binding all
               the shareholders.
                         It is our view that the
          plaintiff's action is in substance a
          derivative action, that is, an action in
          which the damages sought arise simply because
          Unit Step has allegedly suffered a loss
          because of the pleaded wrongful acts of the
          defendants. The endorsement on the writ of
          summons claims damages for negligence,
          incompetence and breach of fiduciary duties
          owed by the defendants to the plaintiff as a
          shareholder of Unit Step. The original and
          amended statements of claim quantify the
          damages sought at $600,000. All of the facts
          referred to, and the losses claimed in both
          the original amended statement of claim are
          incidental to the losses of Unit Step, except
          for those claims referred to in para. 23 of
          the original statement of claim, and in
          paras. 22 and 23 of the amended statement of
          claim. Those paragraphs relate to claims
          asserted by the plaintiff as to damage to his
          reputation and credit, as well as claims that
          the plaintiff has been exposed to potentially
          larger claims under guarantees he signed then
          would have been the case were it not for the
          alleged wrongful acts of the defendants.
          Those claims are not derivative; they are
          personal. I observe, however, that the
          pleaded contention that the defendants'
          wrongful actions or omissions have exposed
          the plaintiff to an increased loss under
          guarantees he has signed represents a loss
          that the plaintiff has not yet incurred. The
          plaintiff has not paid anything under those
          guarantees. The plaintiff has not claimed an
          entitlement to a declaration as to the
          validity of the bank guarantees or indemnity
          from the defendants' on the Unit Step trade
          creditor guarantees.[Emphasis added.]
                               . . . .
                         Having determined that the
          plaintiff's claim is essentially and
          substantially derivative, there remains to be
          considered what should be done with it.
          Although the preliminary narrative paragraphs
          of the statement of claim might be looked at
          as supporting the plaintiff's personal
          claims, being claims for damages for damages
          to reputation and credit and claims
          peripherally made as to increased exposure
          under guarantees executed by the plaintiff,
          it is nevertheless our view that the
          statement of claim is so saturated by
          derivative claims that it cannot be allowed
          to stand.

          properties, thereby exposing himself and his
          assets to personal liability and he was
          ultimately driven into bankruptcy. More
          importantly, this issue was raised earlier
          before Wright J. on June 23, 1995 as a basis
          for a motion to stay Martin's action. Wright
          J. dismissed the motion on the ground that s.
          246 did not apply to the case where the
          plaintiff is the sole shareholder of the
          company which possesses the cause of action.
          He stated:
                                   In my view, the loss
               suffered by the plaintiff as a result of
               the alleged negligence of the defendants
               is personal to the plaintiff sole

               this action in his personal capacity.
                         Leave to appeal this decision
          was dismissed by Lissaman J. In the
          circumstances, whether the defendants'
          argument has merit or not, the issue is res
          judicata and cannot be raised afresh before
          the trial judge (Newmarch Mechanical

          me clearly laid down there by the learned

          &quot;relieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of
          paying damages for his breach of contract&quot;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, that a litigant is relieved of his or her duty to prove</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the facts upon which the damages are estimated. The distinction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drawn in the various authorities, as I see it, is that where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proved, the difficulty of assessment is no ground for refusing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial damages even to the point of resorting to guess work.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, where the absence of evidence makes it impossible to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assess damages, the litigant is entitled to nominal damages at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">best.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] In my opinion, the case in appeal is in the latter category.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent called no evidence that would assist in proving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and identifying losses on a transaction by transaction basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Instead, Martin testified and gave evidence of having a net worth</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of approximately $18 million as of August 1, 1988. His position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at trial was that he had been rendered insolvent by October of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1989 as a result of the previously described machinations of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Axton. A net worth statement was introduced into evidence on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis of the respondent's testimony that it had been prepared in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">August of 1988 and not for the purposes of the litigation. On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cross-examination, he agreed that the statement had not in fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been made until 1990 and that it was not only unsupported by any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion evidence of value but contained &quot;inaccuracies&quot; such as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fact that one asset (Halsey Lodge) which supposedly accounted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for approximately $1 million of equity had been disposed of in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1987.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] The respondent called the evidence of one Phillips, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chartered Business Valuator, whose report was entered in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. Phillips, by agreement of counsel and a specific ruling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the trial judge, did not testify as an expert and all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">references to opinions in his report were to be ignored. Phillips</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reviewed documents supplied by the respondent's counsel and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrived at certain conclusions as to payments flowing or possibly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flowing to Frog Pond companies from Martin companies. He did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">go behind the documents to see if the flow of money actually took</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">place. He had no idea whether the respondent received any benefit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in return for whatever the flow was. He assumed that mortgages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that in fact were never paid had indeed been paid. He made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unwarranted assumptions as for example the estimate of a flow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from Martin to Axton of some $1,780,000 which was advanced by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Royal Bank of Canada to The Frog Pond Group on the security of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage on nursing home property owned by TLC Retirement Centre</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Windsor Limited. The Royal Bank ended up writing off the entire</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loan and it was the bank that sued Farano, Green (who also acted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the bank in this instance) respecting this loss and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action was settled. There was no evidence whether this mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">created a loss to Martin.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Even accepting that it was appropriate for Martin to equate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his personal losses to the aggregate of the losses suffered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his corporations because of the diminution of his equity interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the corporations as shareholder, the record does not disclose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any reliable evidence of what were the values of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations before July 28, 1988. Without that initial aggregate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">figure, we have no bench mark from which to deduct pre-Goldfarb</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and non Axton transactions to arrive at the aggregate loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffered at the hands of Axton. For example, Martin offered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way of evidence of the value of the Newmarket Golf and Country</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Club and Golf Course House lands, certain agreements of purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and sale of the corporations. Offers came in as described by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin for &quot;$8 million one time, $10 million, $12 million&quot;. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated that property values were going up at a very rapid rate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and in significant amounts. These offers came in from mid-1988 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">late-1989 although the only offers produced were in April of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1989. The offers ranged up to $15 million. The conditions placed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on these offers, several of which were advanced by small</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations, were never removed and in many cases these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations were unable to obtain financing. The last completed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arm's length transaction relating to any corporate property was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin's purchase, as the majority shareholder, of the remaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">25% minority interest in Newmarket Golf and Country Club Limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for approximately $396,000 in March of 1986.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] Another example is TLC Properties Inc. The sole evidence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value regarding the shares of this corporation consisted of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin's evidence that the shares were trading on the Toronto</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Stock Exchange at approximately $1.00 per share in the summer of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1988. He himself re-purchased certain shares in TLC Properties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Inc. as part of the consideration for a real estate transaction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the Frog Pond group in early 1989 at $0.30 per share. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was challenged on proof of the share prices and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledged that records of any share sales for TLC Properties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Inc. are kept at the Toronto Stock Exchange. He acknowledged that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">TLC Properties Inc. went from losing $0.05 per share in 1987 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losing $0.27 per share in 1988. He agreed there was a Stop</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trading Order in place in the summer of 1988 which would not have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">helped share prices. He further acknowledged that share prices</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be negatively affected by the Bradford and Newmarket</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nursing homes losing money and the problems with Kingston Road.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finally, he agreed that during the year 1988, 5,000 options at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prices in the order of $0.50 per share were exercised and 107,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">options were terminated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] There is simply no excuse for such a shoddy proffer of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence by a plaintiff in an action is which he seeks damages in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the millions. Assuming without acknowledging that Martin is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to be directly compensated for the loss of his corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assets as a means of recognizing the reduced value of his equity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in the various companies, the means to value those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assets prior to July 28, 1988 was fully within the control of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Martin. We have in evidence the unaudited financial statements of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these corporations and with respect to all of them, their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">underlying worth was in real estate consisting of nursing homes,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the golf course and other land. The explanation that Martin is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankrupt because of the activities of Axton and cannot afford to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retain forensic experts to put together a credible estimate of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages does not justify his counsel dumping on the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the responsibility for pulling a figure out of the air.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] One would have though that where, as here, the businesses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are private companies owning land as their major corporate asset,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the value of the corporations as going concerns prior to July 28,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1988, could be determined in one or more of the ways private</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations are valued for purposes of sale, winding up or to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calculate income tax and succession duties. This is at least a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">starting point and in a proper case, experts would have little</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty in then calculating the value of Martin's equity in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these corporations.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] However, as I explained in my analysis of issue two, this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach is inappropriate as the damages suffered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's corporations are not, in law, losses to Martin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personally. If Martin had not been forced into personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy, no one can suggest that he could have valued his loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of equity in his bankrupt corporations and have been paid out by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellants for that value in priority to the creditors of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankrupt corporations. Martin seems to think that since he is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharged bankrupt that he is in a different position. His</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel submits that the trustees of his bankrupt corporations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave up their remedy on behalf of the corporate creditors when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they sold their cause of action against Axton (but not Goldfarb)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for $2,500. The estates are for all practical purposes wound up.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, counsel submits, Martin is the only one interested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in pursuing the remedy against Goldfarb that was available to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both him personally and his corporations. That may be so, but the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inactivity of the trustees of the bankrupt corporations, for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whatever reason, does not place Martin in the position where he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can claim as personal losses, losses which are those of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations he owned and controlled.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] As I have indicated, Martin's approach to damages was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misguided from the outset in that he equated his personal losses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with those of his corporations. Accordingly, I am of the opinion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the present assessment of damages cannot stand and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfortunately a new assessment will be necessary. On this new</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment, the onus will remain on Martin to establish his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal losses arising from those transactions he and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual corporations engaged in with Axton and the Frog Pond</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Group after July 28, 1988. The corporate transactions are still</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant because Martin personally guaranteed some of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[84] My analysis to this point has been largely negative as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what damages Martin suffered, but I do believe that he did suffer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal damages and that they were substantial. I think evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to support a personal claim is available and for this reason, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decline to suggest a nominal award and would order a new trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited to determining the nature and quantum of the personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages. Without limiting the scope of the evidence on the new</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment, it seems to me that the most fruitful area of inquiry</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is with respect to the personal guarantees Martin gave on his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations' mortgages. I am at a loss to understand why there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no analysis of Martin's personal bankruptcy to determine if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his insolvency was brought about by his exposure on these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guarantees or to what extent he was called upon to respond to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them. Further to this line of inquiry, there was a suggestion in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the argument on appeal that Martin was obliged to provide fresh</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infusions of his personal resources to shore up his corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operations where those corporations had suffered losses at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hands of Axton. In short, the starting point, I would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thought, was the bankrupt estate. An analysis should be provided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as to what precipitated it in order to trace, if possible, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal indebtedness of Martin back to the fraudulent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transactions of Axton that happened during the relevant time.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[85] I also think that Martin is entitled to something for &quot;the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insult&quot;, as they say in settlement discussions. He did maintain a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certain standard of living before the bankruptcy and he works now</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as a security guard at a motel in Florida. It may well be that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judge on the assessment would want to consider, if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence warrants it, general damages for loss of reputation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credit arising out of the bankruptcy itself: see Hoskins v. Price</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Waterhouse Ltd. et al., supra

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] In my opinion, the damage award cannot stand. Accordingly, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would allow the appeal in part, set aside the judgment below as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it relates to damages, and order a new trial limited to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment of damages to Martin personally following the breach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of fiduciary duty as found by the trial judge. I would allow the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants their costs of the appeal. While the issues in appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were restricted to damages, liability was contested at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, the respondent should be entitled to retain his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award of costs at trial relating to liability, the amount to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessed. The costs of the new assessment of damages should be in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the discretion of the judge hearing the assessment.
