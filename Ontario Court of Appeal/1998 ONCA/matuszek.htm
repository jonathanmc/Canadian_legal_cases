</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Whether the appellant's major knee injury was caused by the

accident was an issue on which there was conflicting medical

evidence at trial. No specific question on that aspect of

causation was put to the jury and the jury's assessment of non-

pecuniary general damages of $25,000 is not an assessment from

which it can be concluded with certainty that the jury found, or

did not find, that the accident caused the appellant's torn ACL.

For purposes of the determination of the issues raised in this

appeal, we are prepared to proceed on the premise that the jury

did find that the accident caused the appellant's knee injury,

that is her torn ACL.


A.   The Jury's Assessment of Non-Pecuniary General Damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  Although the jury's $25,000 assessment for non-pecuniary

general damages is at the low end of the scale it is not, in our

view, so inordinately low as to justify our interfering with it.

We would, therefore, not give effect to this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
B.   The charge as related to the appellant's claims for loss of
     past and future Income and the jury's assessment of the loss
     of past and future income</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  The other grounds of appeal, which concern the jury's zero

assessment for loss of past and future income require

consideration of the trial judge's charge to the jury. In our

view, the charge was fair. In it the trial judge alerted the jury

to all elements of the appellant's claim for loss of past and

future income, including the loss of the appellant's opportunity

to have worked and thus earned income as a police officer, or

otherwise. The jury obviously concluded that in light of the

appellant's pre-existing physical problems (which included

difficulties with her knees) and her accident-related injuries

she sustained no pre-trial loss of income, or post-trial loss of

capacity to earn income. In our view, it was open to the jury to

answer the loss of past and future income questions as the jury

did. Thus, we are of the view that this ground of appeal fails.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The Family Law Act Claims</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  The jury assessed the claims of the three Family Law Act

(&quot;FLA&quot;) claimants (the appellant's mother, father and sister) at

zero. The evidence of the three FLA plaintiffs mainly concerned

the appellant's activities before the accident and the affect on

her of the injuries she sustained in the accident. These

witnesses also testified about the appellant's pre-accident

physical condition. There was a brief reference in the evidence

of the appellant's father and mother about the assistance they

provided for the appellant for a few days after the accident.

However, the evidence on this issue was meagre. The appellant's

sister was 10 years old at the time of the accident. Her evidence

focused virtually exclusively on the appellant's activities

before and after the accident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  In our view, it was open to he jury to conclude that the FLA

plaintiffs sustained no compensable loss. This ground of appeal

must fail.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  In summary, we are not prepared to interfere with the jury's

assessment of non-pecuniary general damages. We see no error in

the charge on the issues of lost past and future income. We think

that it was open to the jury to conclude that the injuries, found

by the jury to have been caused by the accident, resulted in no

loss of past or future income.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  We would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  The respondent seeks leave to appeal and if leave is granted

to cross-appeal on the issue of costs. The respondent submits

that the trial judge erred in granting costs of the trial to the

appellants having regard to the fact that the respondent's offer

to settle of $20,000 was within $5,000 of the jury's assessment

of damages and the appellant's last offer of settlement of

$175,000 was substantially higher than the jury's assessment. The

respondent thus submits that the appellant's settlement offer was

manifestly unreasonable and the defence settlement offer,

although lower than the jury's assessment, was reasonable. The

respondent contends that the trial judge erred in not taking

these factors into account when he dealt with the trial costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  We see no merit in the cross-appeal. The trial judge was

alert to each side's settlement offer and we think that he was

entitled to exercise his discretion on costs as he did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] Leave to cross-appeal on the issue of costs is granted and

the cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
