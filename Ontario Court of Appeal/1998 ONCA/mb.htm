    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]       The appellant, B.M., was tried by Murphy J. and a jury
in Gore Bay on a forty-nine count indictment. He was charged with
offences ranging from failing to comply with a recognizance to
the former offence of rape. The indictment included allegations
of indecent assault, invitation to sexual touching, detaining for
illicit sexual intercourse, gross indecency, buggery, incest,
assault causing bodily harm, weapons offences and bestiality. The
charges span a 39-year period from 1955 to 1994 and relate to
four daughters, one spouse, a stepson, a babysitter, a family
friend, a cousin and two dogs. The appellant testified and,
except for admitting several minor physical assaults, denied the
allegations.
[2]       The appellant appeals on seven grounds. The
determinative issue in this appeal is the trial judge's failure
to adequately instruct the jury on the use to be made of the
evidence of the different counts and, in particular, the trial
judge's failure to instruct the jury to deal with each count
separately. In light of these errors, this appeal must be
allowed, the convictions set aside, and a new trial ordered. In
addition to this ground of appeal, however, this case raises many
issues which I believe I must address as they will likely arise
again at the new trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       In light of my conclusion that there must be a new
trial, I will only give a brief overview of the facts. By the
time of the trial, the appellant was 63 years of age and living
on a disability pension. The allegations against the appellant
date back to a time shortly after the appellant married his first
wife, B.M.
[4]       The earliest allegation concerned a cousin of the
appellant’s wife. It was her evidence that the appellant
indecently assaulted her on one occasion in 1955 when he was
visiting her home. She was fourteen years of age.
[5]       The appellant has four daughters. He allegedly sexually
assaulted all of them at various times. In 1962 or 1963, when the
eldest daughter, J.W., was approximately seven years of age, the
appellant entered her bed and indecently assaulted her.  J.W.
shared her bed with her sister D.L. J.W. attempted to resist the
appellant’s assault. Eventually the appellant moved to the bed
her sister J.L. shared with her brother. J.W. heard J.L..
whimpering. J.L. was 5 or 6 years of age at the time. None of the
other siblings woke up during the assaults. The following day,
J.L. and J.W. complained to their mother and she took them to a
physician. According to J.W., the physician found no evidence of
abuse. J.W. heard the appellant go into J.L.’s bed on
approximately ten occasions, both before and after this incident.
[6]       J.W. also heard, but did not see, the appellant assault
a babysitter, S.E..  S.E. testified that the appellant indecently
assaulted her on two occasions between 1965 and 1966 when she was
between 12 and 13 years of age. S.E. testified that the day after
the first incident, her mother came and took her out of school
and asked her if something had happened. The mother was called as
a defence witness and denied that this occurred. The second
incident was said to have occurred at a carnival that she
attended with a friend and the appellant. The friend was also
called as a defence witness and denied having attended a
carnival.
[7]       J.L., the second eldest daughter, testified that she
had a very clear recollection of the appellant sexually
assaulting her on two occasions when she was two years of age in
1960-61. The appellant assaulted her again when she was five
years of age, and then yet again over the period from 1967 to
1971 when she was between the ages of 9 and 13 years. The
assaults occurred in different locations and included full
intercourse. She also gave evidence of what she referred to as
“bed-hopping” — the appellant going from one daughter’s bed to
that of another during the night. J.L. saw the appellant go to
J.W. bed and the bed of another sister, D.L..  J.L. testified that
there were approximately 200 bed-hopping incidents.
[8]       J.L. also witnessed an incident involving her friend
S.R..  S.R. testified that in 1969, when she was 10 years of age and
visiting the M. home, the appellant took her into the bathroom
and committed acts of indecent assault and buggery. J.L.
testified that she saw Susan run by her in hysterics.
[9]       Further, J.L. testified that in 1968 or 1969 she
observed the appellant commit an act of bestiality on the family
dog.
[10] D.L. is the third eldest daughter. She testified that the
appellant repeatedly indecently assaulted her when she was
between the ages of 7 and 14 years, in 1967 to 1974. The assaults
occurred in various parts of the house, including the bedroom
that she shared with her brother and sisters. D.L. testified that
there was constant violence in the home and on many occasions the
appellant would fire his guns in the backyard. A police officer
testified that there were no reported occurrences of guns being
discharged at the appellant's residence.
[11] The youngest daughter, L.W., testified that the appellant
committed acts of indecent assault and gross indecency on her
when she was between 8 and 10 years of age, in 1973 to 1976.
[12] B.M. married the appellant in 1955. She testified to
numerous physical and sexual assaults on her by the appellant
until they separated in 1976. She also testified to one incident
where the appellant pointed a rifle at her. K.K., an employee of
the dairy bar where B.M. also worked, testified that she saw the
appellant physically assault B.M.. As well, there were a number
of occasions when B.M. came to the K.K. home with various bruises
and scratches. On one occasion, B.M. was naked when she arrived
at their home.
[13] The appellant’s children also testified to witnessing the
appellant beating B.M..  J.W. testified that the appellant
severely beat B.M. virtually every weekend. The son, E.M.,
testified that he too saw the appellant beat his mother on at
least two occasions between 1967 and 1975;  he also saw him point
a rifle at her. J.L. saw the appellant assault her mother and
point a firearm at her. D.L. saw the appellant sexually assault
and beat her mother.
[14] J.W.’s husband used to hunt with the appellant. He testified
that in 1991, he arrived at the hunting camp unexpectedly and
observed the appellant committing an act of bestiality on the
family dog.
[15] The complaints concerning the appellant’s daughters and B.M.
came to light in May or June 1992. J.W. testified that she became
concerned about B.S., the young grandson of the appellant’s third
wife, L.M., both of whom were living in the appellant’s home.
J.W. contacted the police and then contacted her mother and her
siblings. She arranged for them to speak to the police. She and
her sisters also commenced a $2 million lawsuit against the
appellant, B.M. and L.M..
[16] In the spring of 1992, the daughters decided to meet with
the appellant at his home. The daughters confronted the appellant
with the abuse he had inflicted upon them when they were
children. The appellant’s only response was:  “Well, I’ve lived
without you before, I can do it again.”  The appellant confirmed
making this response in his evidence. He claimed, however, that
at the time of the meeting he was not wearing his hearing aids
and thought they were referring to abuse of B.M. and his second
wife, E.A..
[17] The final set of allegations concerns B.S., the fifteen year-
old grandson of L.M.. In June 1994, he lived with the appellant
and his grandmother. By this time, the charges relating to the
appellant’s daughters had been laid. B.S. testified that, on many
occasions, the appellant paid him $5.00 to masturbate him. B.S.
disclosed these assaults in December 1994. Before this time, B.S.
had regular contact with a police officer and a social worker.
Despite being specifically asked if the appellant had sexually
assaulted him, B.S. did not disclose this information.
[18] L.M. was a defence witness. She testified that B.S. was
difficult to control and would swear at her, fight and steal.
Once, when the appellant beat B.S. with a belt, the Children’s
Aid Society became involved. The social worker spoke to the
appellant about using excessive force to discipline B.S.
[19] The appellant confirmed that he struck B.S. once with a
belt. Other than admitting that he &quot;pushed&quot; B.M. &quot;around&quot;, the
appellant denied all of the other allegations.
[20] The appellant was convicted of 33 counts. A number of counts
were withdrawn, and he was acquitted of four counts. He was
sentenced to a total of nine years and three months'
imprisonment. He appeals the convictions and the sentence.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     i.   Severance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The appellant was charged with two counts of bestiality. At
the opening of the trial, counsel for the appellant applied to
sever these counts. The appellant's daughter J.L. gave evidence
of one incident that occurred in 1968 or 1969; the second
incident was witnessed by J.W.’s husband in 1991. The appellant
was acquitted of the latter charge.
[23] The trial judge dismissed the application for two reasons.
First, he referred to the delay in making the application. The
appellant had been committed for trial in January 1995 and the
first trial commenced in April 1996. No question of severance was
raised. It ended in a mistrial shortly after jury selection. The
second trial commenced in October 1996. Notice of the severance
application was served just two weeks before its commencement.
[24] Second, the trial judge dismissed the application as he did
not believe the jury would be any more inflamed by the bestiality
allegations than by the allegations of abuse of the appellant’s
children. The trial judge reasoned:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It might be different if the accused here were charged with
          something different, as the Crown pointed out, if it were a
          charge of break and entry or a charge of theft or a charge of
          common assault or an assault bodily harm or dangerous driving or
          all of those, to throw in bestiality with those, that type of
          charge, might be considered an act which would be inflammatory.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in refusing
to sever the bestiality counts. The remaining bestiality count
should be severed at the new trial. The delay in bringing the
application was not a relevant consideration in the
circumstances. This is not a case where the application for
severance is brought for the first time in the course of the
trial. In such cases there is a heavier burden on the accused to
demonstrate some prejudice has arisen in the course of the trial:
R. v. Cuthbert (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (B.C.C.A.) affirmed by
the Supreme Court of Canada (1997), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 96; R. v.
Cross (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 410 (Que. C.A.), leave to appeal to
S.C.C. refused (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) vi. In the present case,
the application was brought prior to trial. It did not result in
any prejudice to the Crown, nor did it interfere with the
presentation of the case.
[26] Cases like this, where the allegations are particularly
sordid and the complainants particularly sympathetic, provide a
severe test of our criminal justice system:  R. v. R. (A.J.)
(1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 168 (Ont. C.A.) at 180. There was a heavy
onus on the Crown and the trial judge to ensure the appellant
received a fair trial. In my view, the trial judge placed too
much emphasis on the similarity of the charges and his view that
the jury would not be inflamed by hearing the bestiality
allegations. The bestiality charges were similar to most of the
other counts only in the broadest sense that they involved a form
of sexual behaviour. They were of a very different nature in all
other ways. There was no need for the bestiality charges to be
tried with the more serious counts: there is no nexus between
them. Neither incident was necessary for the unfolding of the
narrative and the evidence of bestiality was inadmissible on the
other counts. Moreover, the jury was already faced with the
daunting task of attempting to deal with the many other counts.
While objectively less serious than the allegations of sexual and
physical abuse, the allegations of bestiality reveal the
appellant as a person capable of great depravity who seems to be
completely unable to curb his sexual impulses. It was essential
that the jury not be unnecessarily diverted from their task by
evidence calculated only to show the appellant to be a deviant
personality.
[27] Joining the bestiality counts with the other counts served
only to invite the jury to engage in the forbidden line of
reasoning that the appellant was the type of person likely to
commit acts of sexual misconduct. Thus, faced with an indictment
including these charges, the trial judge should have granted the
severance application.
[28] There is one further problem with the bestiality counts –
the trial judge did not give a limiting instruction on the use of
this evidence. Such an instruction is mandatory:  R. v. B.
(F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697 at 733-36; R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2
S.C.R. 111 at 128. It was essential that the jury be instructed
that they could not use that evidence with respect to any of the
other allegations against the appellant. In particular, the jury
should have been told that they could not use the bestiality
evidence as proof that the appellant was the sort of person who
would commit the other offences charged.
[29] The trial judge has the discretion to order a separate trial
on different counts. An appellate court will interfere with this
exercise of discretion only when the trial judge has failed to
act judicially or the ruling resulted in an injustice:  R. v.
Cuthbert (1997), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 96 (S.C.C.). In my view, the
trial judge did not exercise his discretion on proper principles
and the inclusion of these charges, especially in the absence of
a proper limiting instruction, prejudiced the appellant’s right
to a fair trial.
[30] As a new trial is required due to misdirection with respect
to the use of the evidence of the other counts, I need not decide
whether these errors alone would require a new trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ii.  Misdirection on use to be made of evidence of
other counts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
adequately instruct the jury as to the use to be made of the
evidence of the different counts and in particular, failed to
instruct the jury to deal with each count separately. I preface
this discussion by noting that at trial, Crown counsel did not
argue before the trial judge that evidence on any particular
count was admissible as similar fact evidence with respect to the
other counts. It appears that Crown counsel did not even argue
that the various counts involving the same complainant were
admissible as similar fact evidence in relation to that same
complainant.
[32] On appeal, Mr. Trotter (who was not Crown counsel at trial),
did not attempt to support the charge to the jury on the basis
that, in any event, the various counts could be used as similar
fact evidence. Accordingly, we did not hear submissions on which
counts would constitute similar fact evidence. Thus, it would not
be appropriate for me to comment on the matter.
[33] The trial judge gave the following instructions concerning
the use to be made of the evidence of the various counts.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (a)       In order to obtain a conviction, the Crown must
               prove the essential elements of each offence beyond a reasonable
               doubt. When considering your verdict, do not test each piece of
               evidence to see if that piece of evidence is proved beyond a
               reasonable doubt. Consider all of the evidence, the totality of
               the evidence that you find credible and on that basis decide if
               the Crown has proved its case. [Emphasis added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (b)  Now, you consider each count
               separately when you start your
               deliberations. I am going to give an
               outline of how I suggest you do it.
               First of all, what are the charges
               against the accused?  Well, they are
               many, 38 or 39 in all, and as we come to
               them I will tell you what they are and
               what to do with them but I will tell you
               first that you approach these charges
               this way.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               You consider all of the evidence on each
               charge, the totality of the evidence,
               then ask yourself if the explanation
               given by the defence might reasonably be
               true. If the answer to that question is
               “Yes” or if you have a reasonable doubt
               about it, you will acquit the accused on
               that count. Even if you do not actually
               believe the explanation given by the
               accused, you may still be in a state of
               reasonable doubt about the guilt of the
               accused, in which case you will acquit
               the accused on that count because in
               order to obtain a conviction the Crown
               must prove each count beyond a
               reasonable doubt.
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               If you reject the explanation put
               forward by the defence, that is not the
               end of the matter, you will then turn to
               that body of evidence that you find to
               be credible to see if the Crown has
               proved its case. [Emphasis added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (c)  I think that covers everything that
               I have to tell you. I suggest this to
               you, whoever may be your foreperson, go
               one count at a time. Take them in
               whatever order you want, but one count
               at a time, and if you can get unanimity
               one way or the other mark either guilty
               or not guilty beside each count on the
               indictment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] In between the directions I have labeled (b) and (c), the
trial judge reviewed each complainant's evidence pointing out the
conduct that was referable to each count. The trial judge
followed roughly the same format for each complainant. He told
the jury of the counts that related to that complainant and
referred to the offence in short form. The trial judge then
summarized the testimony of the complainant, usually without
relating any particular evidence to a particular count. The trial
judge also briefly related the defence position with respect to
each complainant. An example of the approach can be seen in the
instructions concerning D.L.:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            The final daughter is D.L., at counts 44, 45, 46 and 47.
          Indecent assault, indecent assault, indecent assault, all
          indecent assaults. And D.L. would have been seven years old for
          the first one, eleven years old for the second, for count 45
          eleven years old, for count 46 she would have been seven to 13
          and count 47 she would have been 14. So her allegations are
          regarding offences which occurred between the ages of seven and
          14.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This is the girl that was sat down on
          the corner of the dresser and said that the
          accused rubbed his penis on her vagina until
          he ejaculated. And one time she said the
          accused asked her if he could insert his
          penis and she refused, that’s when she was
          11. She says she was told not to tell anyone.
          This is the case with all of them, they were
          told not to tell anyone.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In another incident between eight and
          12, ’68 to ’72, the accused would come in her
          room at night and lift her nightgown and rub
          his penis on her backside until he
          ejaculated. It happened a number of times.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               At the age 14 she remembered when she
          was grounded. The accused came in the house,
          started to feel her up, she pushed him away
          three or four times and this is when the
          accused said to her, “Why are you pushing me
          away?  You probably let other boys do it, do
          that to you.”  Those are indecent acts, if
          you believe them beyond a reasonable doubt.
          The accused denies, again, having done any of
          that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In his careful and helpful submissions, Mr. Trotter conceded
that if the jury were not adequately instructed to treat the
counts separately, there must be a new trial. He did not suggest
that the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code could
be applied. He argued, however, that the instruction in excerpt
(b) would be understood by the jury as an instruction to treat
the evidence relevant to each count separately. I cannot agree.
The instructions taken as a whole at most made it clear that the
jury must return a separate verdict in relation to each count.
Those directions cannot fairly be read as restricting the
evidence relevant to any particular count to that count alone.
Nothing in the balance of the charge to the jury would lead the
jury to that conclusion.
[36] Moreover, such an approach to the evidence is
counterintuitive. Most of the complainants were related to each
other. Each of the complainants knew at least one other
complainant and many of them knew most of the others. Except for
B.S., all of them went to the police or were contacted by the
police at the same time. All the daughters joined in a single
lawsuit against the appellant. Some of the evidence of one
complainant clearly was admissible in relation to the counts
involving another complainant. For example, the evidence of J.W.
that she heard the appellant go into the bed of her sister J.L.,
if believed, was admissible to prove at least one of the
allegations in relation to J.L.. Since the trial judge left the
evidence to the jury in bulk, however, without any attempt to
isolate the evidence relevant to each count, the jury would have
no way of determining what evidence related to what count. In my
view, the jury would have no reason not to consider all of the
evidence in making their findings of fact.
[37] The problem was aggravated by Crown counsel’s jury address.
On several occasions she referred to patterns in the evidence of
the complainants and consistencies in their evidence. Near the
end of her address, Crown counsel expressly invited the jury to
use the whole body of evidence as proof of all of the
allegations:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               So I guess one person maybe. Two people maybe. In this
          instant we have got ten people who suffered at the hands of the
          accused and some of them are not connected.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               You have out of those people nine people
          who were subjected to sexual abuse when they
          were children. What you have before you is
          the fact that the accused throughout the 50s,
          the 60s and the 70s would sexually assault
          young girls at the time up unto the age of
          about 14.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               …
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               If three people told you the exact same
          thing, you’d have cause to be concerned. What
          you have in this case is you have in total 14
          witnesses but in total ten complainants who
          have come forward and have told you what
          happened to them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] This ground of appeal is governed by the decisions of the
Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Rarru (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 53
and R. v. B. (F.F.). Those cases, like this, involved indictments
charging multiple sexual and other offences and evidence relating
to a number of different victims.
[39] In Rarru, the accused faced 12 counts involving six
complainants. The trial judge initially ruled that the evidence
of the various counts was admissible as similar fact evidence and
he dismissed a severance application. Prior to the charge to the
jury, the trial judge reconsidered his ruling and held that he
would instruct the jury that the evidence of each complainant had
to be dealt with separately. The trial judge gave the following
directions to the jury:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Although I have discussed the ingredients of the sexual
          counts together, I have reviewed the evidence of each of those
          counts separately, and that is what you must do. Evidence of lack
          of consent which might convince you with respect to one
          complainant has little applicability to the issue as it arises on
          the facts of another count, and you are not allowed to use the
          evidence on any one count as evidence on another. Of course, some
          witnesses testified in respect of several counts, which is quite
          a different matter and quite acceptable.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               …
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               And I want to repeat to you that in
          discussing the evidence as it relates to the
          common ingredients of these counts that I
          have just gone through with you in the manner
          that I have, I'm doing it merely for
          convenience, and you must consider the
          evidence that relates to each count
          independently from the evidence that relates
          to each of the other counts. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] The trial judge also told the jury that the addresses of
counsel accurately stated the law. Crown counsel in that case,
like this case, had referred to patterns in the various sexual
assaults. In a very brief decision, the Supreme Court of Canada
held that these directions were inadequate. Speaking for the
court at p. 85, Sopinka J. said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            We agree with the reasons of Rowles J.A., dissenting in the
          Court of Appeal, that the charge to the jury was erroneous. In
          the circumstances of this case, it was incumbent on the trial
          judge to instruct the jury, not only that evidence on one count
          was not to be used on other counts, but further to be warned
          about the dangers of the potential influence of evidence of
          numerous alleged criminal acts which were not the subject of a
          particular count. The charge was inadequate in this respect.
          These omissions were exacerbated by the invitation to the jury to
          consider the address of counsel for the Crown. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Thus, in a case involving multiple counts and complainants,
and where evidence is led of other uncharged misconduct, Sopinka
J. identified two essential elements of a charge to the jury.
First, when evidence of one count is not admissible as similar
fact evidence on the other counts, jurors must be instructed to
consider each charge separately and not to use evidence relating
to one count as evidence on any of the other counts. In this
case, the jury charge does not include this essential element.
The charge does not clearly explain to the jurors that they could
not use the evidence of all the counts to prove any one count.
[42] Second, Rarru requires the trial judge to give the jury a
proper limiting instruction regardless of whether evidence of
other counts or of uncharged misconduct is admissible as similar
fact evidence. The jury charge also fails to meet this standard.
Even if the evidence of the various counts had been admissible as
similar fact evidence, a limiting instruction was required. The
jury had to be warned about misuse of the evidence of criminal
and disreputable conduct. I have already referred to this issue
in relation to the bestiality counts. It was essential that the
jury be instructed that it was not to rely on the evidence of
other counts or other uncharged misconduct as proof that the
accused is the sort of person who would commit the offence or
offences charged: R. v. B. (F.F.) at 733-36 and R. v. D. (L.E.)
at 128.
[43] In view of these errors, the appeal must be allowed and a
new trial ordered. As Mr. Trotter conceded, the proviso in s.
686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code cannot apply: R. v. B. (F.F.)
at 736-38.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     iii. Failure to adequately present the theory of
the defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] In the trial judge's jury charge, he reviewed the evidence
of each complainant and then set out the defence's theory and the
supporting evidence. In most cases, this was relatively
straightforward: often the appellant simply denied the incident.
Where the defence called evidence in relation to a particular
issue, or relied upon parts of the Crown evidence, that evidence
was adequately drawn to the jury’s attention. Thus, I would not
give effect to this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     iv.  The verdict was unreasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] There was evidence to support each of the counts upon which
the appellant was convicted. For example, there was compelling
independent confirmation for the assaults on B.M.. There were
frailties with some of the evidence of the sexual assaults. I
cannot, however, say that the verdicts were unreasonable or that
the jury was not entitled to find the evidence of the
complainants credible and reliable: R. v. W.(R.) (1992), 74
C.C.C. (3d) 134 (S.C.C.) at 141-42.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     v.   Misdirection with respect to the civil suit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The appellant’s four daughters launched a civil suit against
him seeking damages for the assaults he committed. B.M. was also
named as a defendant in the action. As I understand it, it was
the appellant’s theory that his daughters conspired against him,
in part to obtain money from him through this civil lawsuit.
Despite being named as a defendant, B.M. supported her daughters
in the criminal case. Defence counsel focused on this in his jury
address:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            But this is a curious lawsuit. I will leave the jury to figure
          out if they think this is a normal way to proceed. How normal is
          it for one of the defendants to be seated with the four
          plaintiffs, the four daughters are the plaintiffs, they are
          suing. One of the defendants, the mother B.M., is seated out here
          in the jury room, in your room, during the preliminary inquiry of
          January of 1995, which lawsuit is being discussed by the
          daughters’ lawyer. They’ve got the – they got one of the
          defendants sitting in on the discussions about being sued.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Defence counsel concluded the address with the submission
that the prosecution was motivated by jealousy and greed on the
part of the complainants.
[48] Crown counsel replied:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The reason why B.M. is sitting in the room with her
          daughters is because she agrees, she agrees that her daughters
          are entitled to sue the accused for damages, for the damages that
          he inflicted during the time that he was sexually abusing them
          and they have a right to do that and I anticipate that His Honour
          will instruct you on that.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               They have a right, apart from criminal
          proceedings, that would have absolutely
          nothing to do with civil proceedings, a
          person has a right to sue somebody for
          damages. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Crown counsel continued that theme and concluded with her
submission that the lawsuit was evidence of the daughter's
determination, not jealousy and greed.
[50] The trial judge dealt with the civil suit in his
instructions. The appellant objects to the following portions:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Now, there was some talk about a law suit in this case. The
          statement of claim is before you and it is apparent that the four
          daughters are involved in the law suit. They went to a lawyer
          some time in 1994 or 1995. The proceedings were commenced in
          1995, nearly two years after these charges were laid.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Now there are two things here. It has
          been suggested that they are after money and
          that’s why they’re testifying as they do.
          They might say anything for money, because
          this law suit is there and if this accused is
          convicted of these offences they are going to
          end up with a bunch of money.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               That isn’t so. You could acquit the
          accused of every one of the counts on this
          indictment and let him walk out free and they
          would still be able to pursue their law suit
          and stand the chance of winning and
          collecting damages if the civil court is
          satisfied on a balance of probabilities, not
          beyond a reasonable doubt but on a balance of
          probabilities – a lesser onus – that he did
          the things they claim he did. So that really
          the law suit is nothing more than a red
          herring.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The other part of it is the fact that
          the mother is being sued as well as the
          accused. You heard her testify. Her evidence
          is that the only reason she is in there is
          because she is connected with the insurance
          policy that was on the house at the time and
          she has to be sued in order to get at the
          insurance money because the appellant
          probably doesn’t have enough money to take
          care of the suit if they get big damages.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Well, that is not unusual at all…
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The trial judge continued on with an example of a child who
sues her parent if she is injured in a car accident in order to
access insurance money. He then concluded:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            So the whole business of the law suit should not be given much
          attention by you.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] The appellant argues that these comments constituted
misdirection and improperly undermined the theory of the defence.
[53] In my view, it would have been preferable for the trial
judge to merely summarize the positions of the Crown and defence
with respect to the lawsuit. The fine points of civil pleading
and the burden of proof in a civil case were really not
particularly important to resolution of the difficult issues in
the criminal case. Having chosen to delve into these issues,
however, the trial judge should have been even-handed in his
explanation of the law. In Ontario, a criminal conviction is
admissible in subsequent civil proceedings and is prima facie
proof that the party against whom the conviction was rendered
committed the offence: Sopinka, Lederman &amp; Bryant, The Law of
Evidence in Canada, (1992) at 1042-45; Demeter v. British Pacific
Life Insurance Co. (1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 33 (H.C.J.) affirmed 48
O.R. (2d) 266 (C.A.); and R. v. Duong (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 392
(Ont. C.A.) at 404. While it is true that an acquittal would not
have been fatal to the daughters’ civil claim, the judge should
have explained that a conviction would constitute a substantial
advantage in the civil proceedings.
[54] The civil action is not just a “red herring”. The civil
action is capable of being some evidence of a motive on the part
of the appellant’s daughters and could be relevant to their
credibility. Since I would order a new trial on the second ground
of appeal, I need not decide whether this misdirection resulted
in any substantial wrong.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     vi.  Production of the complainants' telephone
records</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] The appellant's sixth issue deals with production of the
telephone records. One of the defence's theories was that the
complainants, particularly the four daughters, collaborated
before providing statements to the police and testifying at the
preliminary inquiry. As I understand it, the defence argued
either that the complainants had deliberately conspired against
the appellant, or that they had unconsciously influenced each
other’s recollection of events. Defence counsel hoped that by
subpoenaing the long distance telephone records of the
complainants, evidence of this collaboration would become clear.
[56] Prior to the first trial, counsel for the appellant
subpoenaed the telephone records of the complainants J. W. and
E.A.. In June 1995, Murphy J. ruled that a subpoena was
sufficient for production of these records. Accordingly, some of
the telephone records had been produced to defence counsel and
were available for use in cross-examining the complainants. Prior
to the second trial, counsel for the appellant subpoenaed the
telephone records of four other complainants. On this occasion,
however, the trial judge ruled that the defence was required to
follow the procedure set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. O’Connor (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 to obtain production of the
records. O'Connor was decided after the mistrial and the trial
judge’s initial ruling. The decision in O'Connor requires that in
addition to a subpoena, the defence must file an application with
supporting material for production. The complainants, who are the
subject of such records, are entitled to receive notice of this
application.
[57] In the present case, when the defence brought an application
for production of the telephone records of the complainants at
the outset of the trial, it was dismissed as the complainants had
not been served with a notice of application. It was, however,
open to the defence to renew the application. For reasons that
are not well explained in the record, the application was not
renewed until after several of the complainants had testified.
The defence, therefore, required both production of the records
and leave of the trial judge to recall these witnesses for
further cross-examination. Ultimately, the trial judge ruled that
the additional records should not be produced:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In my humble opinion, having heard the four complainants
          testify and having heard what they described – their description
          of what conversations took place, despite rigorous cross-
          examination, I can not see that admitting the telephone records
          will have any great significance in proving what the accused
          submits is a conspiracy to “Get” the accused.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               None of the four indicated during their
          cross-examinations or in their examinations-
          in-chief that there was any such conspiracy
          and to put all of these telephone records in
          would be nothing more than to provide
          material which would encourage speculation by
          the jury as to what was said or what was not
          said.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The probative value of the records would
          be tenuous at best and the admission of the
          records, in my opinion, would tend to divert
          the attention of the jury from the main issue
          which they must deal with and that is the
          truth or otherwise of the allegations by the
          complainants. For that reason, the
          application will be dismissed. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Mr. Gold, on behalf of the appellant, made two submissions
on this issue. First, he argued that the O’Connor  procedure had
no application to the telephone records as they were not
therapeutic records or records containing personal information.
Second, he argued that, in any event, the trial judge erred in
applying too strict a test for production of the records, and in
particular, erred in requiring the appellant to demonstrate some
“great significance” in the records.
[59] In my view, the trial judge was right to apply the O'Connor
procedure. Lamer C.J.C. and Sopinka J. wrote the majority reasons
in O'Connor on this issue. Although the case concerned
therapeutic records, their reasons are written in broad terms and
set out the procedure applicable to the production of all third-
party records containing private information. They pointed out
that the disclosure obligations on the Crown, as set out in R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, do not apply to the production
of such records that are in the hands of third parties. While, at
p. 16 of the reasons, they refer to a “constitutional right to
privacy that extends to information contained in many forms of
third party records”, I do not read the reasons as limited to
records which may engage a constitutional privacy right. The
thrust of the majority reasons is to establish two regimes:
(1) where private records, even therapeutic records, are in the
hands of the Crown, the Stinchcombe disclosure criteria and
procedures apply; (2) where private records are in the hands of a
third party, however, the O’Connor production criteria and
procedures apply.1  Accordingly, the trial judge was correct in
requiring the appellant’s trial counsel to comply with the
O’Connor procedure.
[60] On the other hand, Lamer C.J.C. and Sopinka J. also
emphasized that the production procedure must be adapted
depending on the nature of the records. At p. 18, for example,
they pointed out that it would be open to the trial judge to
dispense with the need for a formal application in the interests
of justice. In the present case, the trial judge might well have
dispensed with a formal application as the defence may have been
lulled into a false sense of security by the earlier ruling. The
trial judge was correct, however, in insisting that the
complainants be given notice as their records were the subject of
the application.
[61] Once the procedural steps have been followed, the accused
must then show that the records are likely relevant. This test,
although higher than the test for disclosure, is not an onerous
one and was clearly met in this case. Therefore, the records
should have been produced for examination by the trial judge at
this stage. Next, the judge must examine the records and
determine what should be produced to the defence. This second
stage requires the trial judge to “examine and weigh the salutary
and deleterious effects of a production order and determine
whether a non-production order would constitute a reasonable
limit on the ability of the accused to make full answer and
defence” (at p. 23). The application of this test may vary with
the nature of the records. Lamer C.J.C. and Sopinka J., borrowing
from the reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé J., listed five factors to be
considered at pp. 23-24:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (1) the extent to which the record is necessary for the
          accused to make full answer and defence;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (2) the probative value of the record in
          question;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (3) the nature and extent of the
          reasonable expectation of privacy vested in
          that record;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (4) whether production of the record
          would be premised upon any discriminatory

          complainant's dignity, privacy or security of

          production of the record in question.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] In the appellant's case, only the first two factors were of
any real significance. The third factor — the reasonable
expectation of privacy — does not engage the same privacy
concerns as the types of records, therapeutic records, considered
in O’Connor. The reduced expectation of privacy in these types of
records is demonstrated by reference to the relevant Criminal
Code provision. Section 492.2(2) permits a justice to issue a
warrant to seize telephone records merely on the basis of
reasonable suspicion, a standard less than required for a normal
search warrant under s. 487. In my view, the appellant met the
O'Connor test for production of records.
[63] The trial judge’s ruling, however, occasioned no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice. I have read the transcripts of
the cross-examinations of the four complainants. I agree with the
trial judge that the cross-examination using the available
records had little impact on the credibility of the complainants.
The complainants knew each other – five of them were related.
There was no dispute that they talked to each other by telephone
throughout the relevant period. The records, of course, did not
show what they talked about. While it would have been preferable
for the trial judge to order production of the remaining records,
his failure to do so did not result in a miscarriage of justice.</font></pre>

Bray</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The trial judge’s reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] The final ground of appeal concerns the trial judge’s ruling
refusing to permit Dr. Ruth Bray to testify for the defence.
Since this question will arise at the new trial, I will deal with
it for the assistance of that trial judge, even though I would
allow the appeal on other grounds.
[65] Dr. Bray is a psychologist in private practice. She was
presented by the defence as an expert on memory, sexual abuse,
sexual deviance and proper techniques for forensic interviewing.
The trial judge held a voir dire to determine the admissibility
of this evidence. The defence was only concerned with Dr. Bray’s
opinions regarding memory, although she gave some evidence about
family dynamics. Dr. Bray testified at length and was vigorously
cross-examined. There were difficulties with her evidence: for
example, she had not done any research or writing for at least
ten years and she did not seem to have any special expertise in
the field of memory. Her ability to provide opinion evidence on
memory was essentially based on her reading of the current
psychology literature and her attendance at some conferences. I
have carefully read her testimony on the voir dire. Much of it
was confusing and subject to many qualifications. Nevertheless,
she did offer opinions on the following subjects:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               i.   A memory by persons from when they were two years old
          is extremely suspect.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               ii.  The theory that memory is laid down
          as if the mind was a tape recorder is a
          common misconception.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               iii. It is a common misconception that
          vivid details of the remembered event is a
          good indicator of reliability and that
          traumatic events are well-remembered.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               iv.  The reliability of memory depends
          in part on how often the memory is recalled
          and rehearsed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] The trial judge ruled that Dr. Bray was qualified as an
expert. He excluded her testimony, however, because it failed to
meet the test in R. v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.).
The trial judge reasoned:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            Now, in this case, I think that although [defence counsel]
          urges that what the evidence is being tendered for is to enable
          the jury to have some idea of how the human mind works when it is
          remembering things, the real purpose of introducing it, I
          believe, is to confuse the jury to the point that they would
          wonder “how can we believe any witnesses who are attempting to
          recall, or swearing that they do recall, events which occurred
          20, 30 or more years ago?”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               That, I think is the underlying issue
          and to that extent, I believe, the evidence
          could be described as misleading in the sense
          that its effect on the trier of fact,
          particularly a jury, is out of proportion to
          its reliability.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               …

          assessing the worthiness of other people’s
          memories every day. I do not believe, in this
          type of case, which is not complicated at
          all, that a long lecture on the way we
          remember things and what comes into play in
          arriving at our memories is going to be of
          any real assistance to the jury and I haven’t
          even mentioned the implications of the cost
          benefit analysis. That is the length of time
          which we would be consuming in receiving this
          evidence, having cross-examination and in
          view of the differences of opinion,
          professional opinion, mentioned by the
          witness herself and expended upon by counsel
          for the Crown, there is no doubt in my mind
          that I would be confronted then with
          witnesses with differing views and the jury
          would be left to make a decision as to which
          expert they wished to believe. The thought of
          that horrifies me and I am sure it would
          horrify the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] In summary, the trial judge appears to have excluded the
expert evidence because:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            i.      it was calculated to confuse the jury into believing
          that no one could have a memory of a 20 or 30 year old event;

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               ii.  the case was not complicated and

          own expert; and
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               iv.  the jury would have to decide which

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] As the trial judge held, the resolution of this case depends
on the application of the criteria for admissibility of expert
evidence as explained in Sopinka J.'s reasons in Mohan. Before
applying these criteria, however, I shall make some preliminary
comments. First, the record in this case is not satisfactory.
Although there was a full airing of Dr. Bray’s testimony, she did
not present herself in this case as particularly well qualified
to provide the opinions she offered. In the result, some of her
conclusions are not well expressed and her testimony tends to be
confusing in parts.
[69] Second, while the charges included allegations going back
many years and even decades, this does not appear to be a case of
so-called recovered memories. Further, there were no
circumstances, such as suggestive interviewing techniques or
indications of ideas of abuse having been planted in the minds of
the complainants. In such cases, the admissibility of expert
evidence about memory appears to be well settled.
[70] In this case, the principal concern is whether the expert
evidence about memory is admissible in a case where many of the
allegations of wrong-doing go back several decades and relate to
events which occurred when the complainants were children – in
some cases very young children. In Mohan, Sopinka J. held that
the admission of expert evidence depends on the application of
the following criteria:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               a)   a properly qualified expert;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               b)   relevance;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               c)   necessity in assisting the trier of
          fact;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               d)   the absence of an exclusionary
          rule.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          a)   A properly qualified expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] The trial judge found Dr. Bray to be a qualified expert.
Despite my own reservation about the quality of some of her
testimony, the evidence supports the view that she was capable of
giving expert opinion evidence in some areas of psychology. Her
lack of practical experience and the fact that she had not
written in the area went to the weight of her evidence, not its
admissibility: R. v. Russell (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 190 (Ont.
C.A.) at 191, applying R. v. Marquard (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 193
(S.C.C.) at 224.
[72] However, that does not conclude the issue. R. v. McIntosh
(1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) concerned expert opinion
on the frailties of eyewitness identification, although some of
the expert’s opinion dealt with memory more generally. In
McIntosh, Finlayson J.A. held that the criterion of a properly
qualified expert includes the concept that the expert is
testifying about a recognized body of scientific knowledge.
Finlayson J.A.'s reasons in McIntosh clarify this branch of the
test. In McIntosh, Finlayson J.A. was particularly concerned that
this aspect of expert evidence be kept in mind where the parties
tender expert evidence from a psychologist. He explained the
requirement of a recognized body of scientific knowledge as
applied to psychology, at p. 392:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Paraphrasing freely from the definition of &quot;science&quot; in The
          Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, it
          seems to me that before a witness can be permitted to testify as
          an expert, the court must be satisfied that the subject-matter of
          his or her expertise is a branch of study in psychology concerned
          with a connected body of demonstrated truths or with observed
          facts systematically classified and more or less connected
          together by a common hypothesis operating under general laws. The
          branch should include trustworthy methods for the discovery of
          new truths within its own domain. I should add that it would be
          helpful if there was evidence that the existence of such a branch
          was generally accepted within the science of psychology.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] This court has already held that at least three aspects of
the science of memory are the proper subject of expert testimony:
R. v. Norman (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 153 at 165. In Norman,
Finlayson J.A. held that both the Crown and defence psychiatrists
were properly permitted to testify about the role therapy can
play in the retrieval of memory. Second, Finlayson J.A. accepted,
at pp. 166-68, that the Crown psychiatrist was entitled to
testify about “flashback” memories and the means of evaluating
the reliability of such memories. Third, he accepted, at p. 168,
that it was proper for the defence psychiatrist to testify about
the nature of recovery of memory repressed through post traumatic
stress disorder.
[74] In Norman, the experts were psychiatrists and it may be that
some of the opinions provided, especially concerning the
psychiatric condition of post traumatic stress disorder, can only
be provided by a psychiatrist. Other aspects of the testimony,
such as the influence of therapy and the means of testing the
reliability of the flashback memories, also fall within the
expertise of a qualified psychologist. Indeed, in Russell, this
court held that a psychologist could testify about human memory
and about repressed memory of sexual assault victims in
particular.
[75] Similarly, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed evidence
regarding some aspects of memory in R. v. R. (D.) (1996), 107
C.C.C. (3d) 289. In R. v. R. (D.), the court concluded that the
trial judge erred in refusing to admit certain evidence from a
clinical psychologist concerning the nature of childhood memory.
In that case, the accused were the birth parents of three
children who claimed to have been sexually abused. The
allegations came to light after the children were placed in a
foster home. There was evidence that the children had also been
abused at the foster home. The defence psychologist testified
that children have two types of memory:  visual memory, which is
based on experience, and verbal memory, which is learned. Major
J., writing for the majority, held that the trial judge erred in
refusing to admit the psychologist's evidence regarding what the
complainant children told him, and his conclusions on the
reliability of the children’s memories of specific events.
[76] Dr. Bray's proposed testimony is more problematic, if only
because the issue was not directly addressed at the trial. In
fairness to Dr. Bray and defence counsel at trial, they did not
have the benefit of the reasons in McIntosh. On the basis of this
record, however, it is my view that the defence failed to
establish that several of the areas about which Dr. Bray proposed
to testify were proper fields of expert evidence. I emphasize
that I reach this conclusion solely on the basis of the testimony
of this particular expert in this case. My conclusion should not
be seen as a broad condemnation of the kind of evidence Dr. Bray
proposed to give. Aspects of the testimony that Dr. Bray proposed
to give could fall within the test enunciated in McIntosh.
[77] To illustrate, one part of the Dr. Bray's testimony fell
squarely within the McIntosh test: J. L. claimed to have very
vivid memories of events from when she was two years of age. Dr.
Bray was asked about the memory of a two-year old and gave this
evidence:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               One of the things that I usually go to if I am talking about
          what a two-year-old can remember is psychologists in studying
          development have developed a great number of tests and in the
          tests every test involves memory items and short term memory in
          two-year-olds is limited but accurate but the general agreement
          in learning in mental circles is that most people at two years
          old may, as I say, in very short term memory they can be accurate
          and, obviously, what they store and what they recall is limited
          by their vocabulary and their ability to express themselves but
          after they reach adulthood they seldom – most people don’t
          remember anything before five and there is an argument about
          whether it is four or five but between four to eight we develop
          cognitively, we develop our ability to understand reason and,
          obviously, our language improves and so that up until the point
          of eight that the ability to observe things, understand them,
          then put them into our memory and hold them in the memory and not
          have them distorted by events between the time that they happen
          until we get them out, it is questionable and, obviously, varies
          due to a variety of factors…</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Dr. Bray proceeded to describe her own work with infants and
demonstrated that she possessed a particular expertise in this
area. Thus, this aspect of her testimony met all the facets of
the test in McIntosh. She was drawing on a body of knowledge from
developmental psychology about which there was a broad consensus
verified by testing using trustworthy methods. She explained the
theory underlying the observed facts. In cross-examination, Dr.
Bray conceded that some clinicians dispute the theory and she
explained the research that would be necessary to verify the
beliefs of the clinicians. The fact that a scientific theory is
open to debate, however, or that exceptional cases fall outside
the norm, does not preclude the admissibility of opinion evidence
based on that theory.
[79] A criminal case is not the ideal forum for resolving
difficult scientific questions. But, if such questions spring
from a recognized body of scientific knowledge that bear upon the
reliability of important pieces of evidence, whether Crown or
defence, it is no solution to ignore the controversy and shield
the jury from difficulties. We do not aid the search for truth by
pretending there is no dispute or depriving the defence of the
opportunity to challenge the reliability of evidence through
presentation of legitimate scientific evidence. As McLachlin J.
observed in R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d)
321 at 389:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The right of the innocent not to be convicted is dependent
          on the right to present full answer and defence. This, in turn,
          depends on being able to call the evidence necessary to establish
          a defence and to challenge the evidence called by the
          prosecution. As one writer has put it [David H. Doherty,
          &quot; 'Sparing' the Complainant 'Spoils' the Trial&quot; (1989), 40 C.R.
          (3d) 55 at 67]:
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         If the evidentiary bricks needed to
               build a defence are denied the accused, then
               for that accused the defence has been
               abrogated as surely as it would be if the
               defence itself was held to be unavailable to
               him.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In short, the denial of the right
          to call and challenge evidence is
          tantamount to the denial of the right to
          rely on a defence to which the law says
          one is entitled. The defence which the
          law gives with one hand, may be taken
          away with the other. Procedural
          limitations make possible the conviction
          of persons who the criminal law says are
          innocent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] In contrast, Dr. Bray’s evidence about the impact of trauma
on memory suffers from the frailties identified in McIntosh. In
response to defence counsel's questioning regarding what “the
field of psychology” says about trauma “assisting or not
assisting memory”, Dr. Bray responded:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            The most recent review done by Doctor Schacter and this reviews
          the articles, most of the articles that I have read in the past,
          and I feel he expresses it much better than I do but it is
          certainly, I believe this, when a person has not endured a trauma
          but believes to have, meaning that they believe they had endured
          this trauma, chances are that he or she feared it, imagined it or
          heard about it. The general principle Doctor Schacter developed
          in his earlier chapters that memories are not simply activated
          pictures in the mind but complex constructions built from
          multiple contributors. Also applies to emotionally traumatic
          memories.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] When defence counsel asked the question again in a slightly
different form, Dr. Bray gave a different answer:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            … I am saying that in terms of learning, we have found in
          learning in this that if a person is aware and is aroused to a
          certain extent, it may improve their memory while they’re
          learning certain things. If they’re aroused too much, if the
          situation is truly traumatic, such as a car accident or some
          terrible thing, what happens is their attention and their focus
          is narrowed to an extent that they don’t really observe the
          events fully and process it fully and that their memory is
          usually of a non-specific sort rather than an accurate memory of
          what is happening but some traumatic events might, indeed,
          improve memory but certainly there has been a lot of study done,
          on these things about flashbulb memories, traumatic situations,
          and I have a number of examples.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] Although Dr. Bray may be qualified as an expert, this
portion of her evidence lacks connection to a recognized body of
scientific knowledge. If Dr. Bray was drawing upon any branch of
study in psychology “concerned with a connected body of
demonstrated truths or with observed facts systematically
classified and more or less connected together by a common
hypothesis operating under general laws” it was not apparent from
her evidence. Such a branch of study may exist, but Dr. Bray’s
evidence does not make this clear. For instance, Dr. Bray failed
to indicate the methods used to test the hypothesis she refers to
and, based on her testimony, it seemed nothing more than
anecdotal. Similarly, she failed to indicate the theory or
scientific learning underlying the observation that people who
falsely come to believe they have been subject to trauma usually
first feared, imagined or heard about it. Moreover, her answer
with respect to the effect of trauma seems to express little more
than a personal opinion that trauma sometimes makes the memory
more reliable and sometimes less reliable. Further, Dr. Bray did
not indicate any science behind these observations, or any way in
which a trier of fact might distinguish the two entirely
different outcomes.
[83] In any event, even if this evidence does meet the threshold,
I question its materiality to this case. Defence counsel
certainly did not lay any apparent ground work with respect to
the complainants that would provide a context in which Dr. Bray's
answers would be of assistance to the trier of fact. Again, I am
not foreclosing evidence concerning the effect of traumas on
memory in a proper case. As Dr. Bray's evidence on this point was
not material to an issue in the case and was not adequately
connected to the scientific basis which supports it, it was
properly excluded.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               b)   Relevance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[84] As Sopinka J. notes in Mohan, relevance is a threshold
requirement for the admission of expert evidence as with all
other evidence. Sopinka J. refers to two aspects of the relevancy
criterion: probative value and &quot;legal relevancy&quot;. Probative value
is the tendency of the testimony to establish a fact in issue.
Mr. Trotter did not dispute that Dr. Bray's testimony has some
probative value on a fact in issue. I agree. Although, as
explained above, some of Dr. Bray's evidence did not relate to a
material issue and was therefore irrelevant, other parts of her
testimony would have gone to the reliability of some of the
complainants' evidence.
[85] The second aspect referred to by Sopinka J., &quot;legal
relevancy&quot;, is a cost benefit analysis. Sopinka J. described the
inquiry to be undertaken, at p. 411, in these terms:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit
          analysis, that is ''whether its value is worth what it costs'':
          see McCormick on Evidence, 3rd ed. (1984), at p. 544. Cost in
          this context is not used in its traditional economic sense but
          rather in terms of its impact on the trial process. Evidence that
          is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded on this basis, if
          its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, if it
          involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate
          with its value or if it is misleading in the sense that its
          effect on the trier of fact, particularly a jury, is out of
          proportion to its reliability. While frequently considered as an
          aspect of legal relevance, the exclusion of logically relevant
          evidence on these grounds is more properly regarded as a general
          exclusionary rule: see R. v. Morris (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 1
          D.L.R. (4th) 385, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190 (S.C.C.). Whether it is
          treated as an aspect of relevance or an exclusionary rule, the
          effect is the same. The reliability versus effect factor has
          special significance in assessing the admissibility of expert
          evidence. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] As I understand this passage, expert evidence that has some
probative value to a fact in issue will nevertheless be held to
be inadmissible if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative
value. In weighing the evidence the trial judge must pay
particular attention to whether:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            1.      the evidence would involve an inordinate amount of time
          that is not commensurate with its value;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               2.   the evidence is misleading in the
          sense that its effect on the jury is out of
          proportion to its reliability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[87] A further concern noted by Sopinka J. with respect to expert
evidence is the danger that the evidence will be misunderstood
and distort the fact-finding process. As he explained at p. 411:
“Dressed up in scientific language which the jury does not easily
understand and submitted through a witness of impressive
antecedents, this evidence is apt to be accepted by the jury as
being virtually infallible and as having more weight than it
deserves.”
[88] In my view, however, a trial judge should be particularly
cautious in excluding expert defence evidence on the basis of a
cost benefit analysis. The exclusion of logically relevant
evidence on these grounds is an aspect of the general
exclusionary rule enunciated in Morris. As McLachlin J.
subsequently explained in Seaboyer, however, the exclusionary
rule only operates to exclude defence evidence where the
prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighs its
probative value.
[89] The Northwest Territories Court of Appeal made a similar
point in R. v. Bell (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 107 at 118 in
relation to the necessity criterion:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Where, as here, expert evidence is offered by the defence in
          its efforts to make full answer and defence, a trial court should
          not impose, as noted in Mohan, too strict a standard for the
          necessity of such evidence, especially where as here the witness
          recognized the need to avoid crossing into the jury's domain. In
          R. v. Seaboyer (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at page 391,
          McLachlin J., on behalf of a majority of the Court, noted the
          general attitude to evidence offered by an accused:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         Canadian courts, ... have been
               extremely cautious in restricting the power
               of the accused to call evidence in his or her
               defence, a reluctance founded in the
               fundamental tenet of our judicial system that
               an innocent person must not be convicted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[90] Nevertheless, as Sopinka J. explained, the rule retains a
particular significance for expert evidence because of the
greater danger of misuse of that evidence and therefore the
greater likelihood that the evidence will distort the fact-
finding process. This was a legitimate concern with some of Dr.
Bray’s evidence, if only because she was unable to articulate the
practical implications of some of her opinions. I have mentioned
that Dr. Bray would have testified that it is a misconception
that memory is like a tape-recorder. The following is a portion
of that testimony:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            … [O]ur understanding, our experience, our ability to, well,
          conceptualize is the best word I can use, has a lot to do with
          what we remember, how long we remember it and in what way we are
          able to bring it back but one of the things that is really
          important to look at in adult memory as well as in children’s
          memory is this idea, as [defence counsel] said, that memory isn’t
          like a tape recorder, that memories aren’t simply activated
          pictures or sounds in the mind, they are complex constructions
          built from multiple contributors so that it is not just what went
          in on the first start, it’s how did it go in, what – was it
          correctly interpreted on the first start, then once it’s in, how
          well was it stored and what factors might have influenced it over
          the years and then when the person is recalling it, like one of
          the things I think that most of us do is when we’re children,
          we’re not aware that certain things are negative and bad but when
          we’re older we’re very aware of that and if our recollection is
          that something bad happened as a child, we had a bad feeling,
          that we start to look back on those situations and reinterpret
          them and focus them differently than they were when they went in.
          But frequently children will not react when certain things
          happen, like someone is killed in front of them, they don’t react
          as an adult would because they don’t understand death. But when
          they think about it when they’re older, they recollect seeing the
          body there and now they’re interpreting it in terms of how they
          feel about death and they will frequently say things like, “I was
          terribly upset,” and yet people that were there at the time will
          say, “The child didn’t react,” and probably the child didn’t
          react because the child wasn’t really aware and you can tell from
          the kind of questions the child asked at the time whether he is
          reacting to the horror of the people around him or the horror of
          the actual situation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[91] As I understand it, Dr. Bray is saying that adults remember
childhood events through the filter of accumulated experience and
it is wrong to think of an adult as being able to reliably play
back a childhood memory as if it were a piece of audio tape. I
have no doubt that this is a valuable insight, but, presented in
the form of expert evidence it takes on an aura that suggests
that science has found that all childhood memories are inherently
unreliable. I do not think that is what Dr. Bray intended to say.
She was, in my view, doing nothing more than explaining why a
trier of fact must be cautious about relying upon adult memories
of childhood impressions. The need for that caution can
adequately be conveyed to the jury in the trial judge’s charge.
Finlayson J.A. made this point in McIntosh when dealing with the
proposed expert evidence in that case about the frailties of
cross-racial identification, at p. 395:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            This is not to say that a reminder as to cross-racial
          identification is not appropriate in a case where it is an issue.
          However, the argument that impresses me is that such a reminder
          from the trial judge is more than adequate, especially when it is
          incorporated into the well-established warnings in the standard
          jury charge on the frailties of identification evidence.
          Writings, such as those of Dr. Yarmey, are helpful in stimulating
          an ongoing evaluation of the problem of witness identification,
          but they should be used to update the judge's charge, not
          instruct the jury. I think that there is a very real danger that
          such evidence would &quot;distort the fact-finding process&quot;. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[92] I will return to this issue in the sub-section &quot;The Charge
to the Jury&quot;. What might have been of real assistance in this
case is evidence, if it exists, that science has learned that
special frailties attend the reliability of very old memories,
frailties not associated with more recent memories with which the
law is more familiar. For example, in R. v. R.(D.) (1995), 98
C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Sask. C.A.) reversed on other grounds (1996),
107 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
held that the Crown was properly permitted to lead the evidence
of a child psychiatrist about the development and working of
memory in children. In the course of her testimony, the
psychiatrist testified that children three and four years old can
have memories of events but that it is difficult for children
under ten to place events in sequence and in time. She also
testified that if a child is required soon after the event to
repeatedly recount it, the memory of it might become consolidated
and even more reliable. If that area is a proper subject of
expert testimony, I can see no basis for excluding the defence
calling evidence on the same issues. For example, why should the
defence be precluded from calling evidence on the impact on the
reliability of the memory where the children do not repeatedly
recount the event but rather try to put the memories out of their
mind?
[93] Furthermore, the trial judge should be cautious about
excluding expert evidence simply because the field is of some
complexity and may lead to both parties calling experts. In my
view, that is not a sufficient ground to exclude the evidence and
is not the kind of undue expenditure of time about which Sopinka
J. was concerned. We do not ensure the continuing vitality of the
jury system by underestimating the intelligence of jurors.
Finlayson J.A. addressed the argument that experts testifying in
a DNA case should not be permitted to use frequency numbers,
rather they should be confined to express an opinion of the
significance of a match in qualitative terms such as “rare” or
“common” in R. v. Terceira (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.),
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada submitted to the
Court June 29, 1998 (Court File 26546). It was argued that the
probative value of this evidence was outweighed by its potential
for unfair prejudice. Finlayson J.A. rejected this argument by
reference at p. 20 to the decision of Dickson C.J.C. in R. v.
Corbett (1989), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at 400-1:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The very strength of the jury is that the ultimate issue of
          guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary citizens
          who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process
          a healthy measure of common sense. The jury is, of course, bound
          to follow the law as it is explained by the trial judge. Jury
          directions are often long and difficult, but the experience of
          trial judges is that juries do perform their duty according to
          the law. We should regard with grave suspicion arguments which
          assert that depriving the jury of all relevant information is
          preferable to giving them everything, with a careful explanation
          as to any limitations on the use to which they may put that
          information. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[94] The fact that the jury would have to decide which expert to
believe is not a reason to deprive the jury of the information
the experts might provide. A jury’s function sometimes involves
deciding between different experts. Regardless, this trial was
not going to be a trial of experts. The primary evidence was
given by the complainants, the other witnesses to the events, the
appellant and his witnesses. The role of the experts would have
been to assist the jury in assessing the reliability of that
evidence.
[95] To conclude, the portions of Dr. Bray’s evidence which
represent only a general discussion about the memory process and
are unrelated to any special problems in this case were properly
excluded on grounds of relevancy. Such evidence would not have
made the evidence of the Crown witnesses any more understandable
for the jury.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               c)   Necessity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] The most problematic aspect of Dr. Bray’s testimony was
whether any of it met the necessity requirement, notwithstanding
the relatively relaxed standard of necessity adopted in recent
cases. Sopinka J. explained the test for necessity in Mohan at p.
413:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense
          that it provide information ''which is likely to be outside the
          experience and knowledge of a judge or jury'': as quoted by
          Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra. As stated by Dickson J., the
          evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to
          appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature. In
          Kelliher v. Smith, [1931] 4 D.L.R. 102, at p. 116, [1931] S.C.R.
          672 (S.C.C.), this court, quoting from Beven on Negligence, 4th
          ed. (1928), p. 141, stated that in order for expert evidence to
          be admissible, ''[t]he subject-matter of the inquiry must be such
          that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment
          about it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge''. More
          recently, in Lavallee, supra, the above passages from Kelliher
          and Abbey were applied to admit expert evidence as to the state
          of mind of a ''battered'' woman. The judgment stressed that this
          was an area that is not understood by the average person.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[97] In R. v. Lavallee (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), the
Crown's primary submission was that in matters dealing with human
nature or human experience the jury can serve as their own
experts and thus, expert psychiatric evidence is not necessary.
Wilson J. cautioned against excluding such expert evidence at
pp. 111-12:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            The need for expert evidence in these areas can, however, be
          obfuscated by the belief that judges and juries are thoroughly
          knowledgeable about &quot;human nature&quot; and that no more is needed.
          They are, so to speak, their own experts on human behaviour.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    This, in effect, was the primary
          submission of the Crown to this court.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The bare facts of this case, which
          I think are amply supported by the evidence,
          are that the appellant was repeatedly abused
          by the deceased but did not leave him
          (although she twice pointed a gun at him),
          and ultimately shot him in the back of the
          head as he was leaving her room. The Crown
          submits that these facts disclose all the
          information a jury needs in order to decide
          whether or not the appellant acted in self-
          defence. I have no hesitation in rejecting
          the Crown's submission.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[98] As I have noted above, this court and the Supreme Court have
previously held that, in some circumstances, expert evidence from
psychiatrists and psychologists about the process of human memory
is admissible as it is relevant and necessary. For example, in R.
v. R. (D.) the Supreme Court held that a clinical psychologist
called by the defence should have been permitted to testify about
the types of childhood memories. Major J., at pp. 303-4, applied
the reasoning of McLachlin J. in R. v. Marquard:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            … [t]here is a growing consensus that while expert evidence on
          the ultimate credibility of a witness is not admissible, expert
          evidence on human conduct and the psychological and physical
          factors which may lead to certain behaviour relevant to
          credibility, is admissible, provided the testimony goes beyond
          the ordinary experience of the trier of fact.  [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] Major J. then explained the need for the defence expert’s
evidence in that case:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            Dr. Elterman's testimony was relevant to the issue of the
          reliability of the children's memories of their birth parents,
          memories which he suggested had been &quot;learned'' and which could
          not be independently recalled. The credibility of the children
          was central to the disposition of the case, and considering the
          nature of the children's evidence, any explanation of their
          otherwise incredible behaviour could only aid the trier of fact
          in accurately assessing their credibility. Dr. Elterman's
          testimony should have been admitted as an evidentiary basis upon
          which the children's credibility could have been judged.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[100]     As Major J. notes, there were “incredible” aspects of
the behaviour of the children in that case, which the expert’s
evidence might help explain. While the facts in R. (D.) are
particularly bizarre, I do not read the reasons in that case as
limiting the admissibility of expert evidence on memory to such
bizarre cases. In any event, there were also some unusual aspects
of this case that expert evidence might help explain. I have
already mentioned the unusual memory feats of J.L. In addition,
all of the daughters were testifying to some events alleged to
have taken place when they were under ten years of age, but which
were not discussed until 20 to 30 years later. Until 1992, there
was nothing to suggest the serious and multiple allegations that
were made. In my view, expert evidence about the nature of
childhood memory and the effect of this lengthy delay on the
reliability of those memories would have been helpful as such
evidence goes beyond the ordinary experience of the jury.
[101]     In McIntosh, Finlayson J.A. held that the trial judge
properly rejected the expert testimony in that case. He described
the testimony, at p. 394, as directed to “instructing the jury
that all witnesses have problems in perception and recall with
respect to what occurred during any given circumstance that is
brief and stressful.” Accordingly, the expert was not testifying
to matters “that are outside the normal experience of the trier
of fact [but] reminding the jury of the normal experience.”  Some
of Dr. Bray’s testimony was of a similar nature and properly
excluded by the trial judge such as her evidence about the effect
of trauma on memory. However, other parts of her evidence,
especially about very early childhood memory of sexual abuse, are
outside the normal experience of the trier of fact. Provided such
evidence can meet the threshold test of being a proper subject of
expert testimony, it meets the criteria of relevancy and
necessity.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               d)   The absence of an exclusionary rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[102]     The only exclusionary rule suggested in this case is
the discretion of the trial judge to reject otherwise probative
evidence where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative
value. As noted, in Mohan, Sopinka J. held that this rule could
be included in the analysis either as an aspect of legal
relevancy under the relevancy criterion, or under this heading.
As I have chosen to deal with this aspect of Dr. Bray’s evidence
under the relevancy heading, I need not repeat that discussion. I
would, however, make this comment: Mr. Trotter submitted that Dr.
Bray’s evidence should be rejected on the basis that she
presented as “gospel” opinions on matters that were highly
contentious. He also described memory as a “political” issue
which divides experts. Neither ground would provide a valid basis
for excluding proper expert evidence. On my reading, Dr. Bray did
not present her views as if there were no room for legitimate
debate. In the course of a lengthy cross-examination, Dr. Bray
readily conceded differences of opinion on some of the matters to
which she testified, although she adhered to her opinion. That is
not an unusual occurrence. In fact, it would be surprising if all
experts agreed on all matters, especially on matters as elusive
as human psychology. As to the “political” aspect of the debate,
Dr. Bray testified that clinicians tend to take different views
from experimental psychologists and explained why this may be. I
do not think it is beyond the capacity of a jury to consider
questions of professional bias in deciding what weight to attach
to expert evidence.
[103]     To conclude, in my view, the trial judge erred in
excluding all of Dr. Bray’s evidence. Parts of her evidence, such
as the reliability of memories of events which occurred when the
witness was an infant, should have been admitted. On the other
hand, some of Dr. Bray’s evidence, as it was led at this trial,
was properly excluded as it did not meet the Mohan test. On the
new trial, the defence, with the assistance of the McIntosh
decision, may be able to satisfy the trial judge that the
proffered evidence is a proper subject for expert opinion. That,
of course, will be for that trial judge to determine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE CHARGE TO THE JURY</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[104]     The appellant did not raise the adequacy of the charge
to the jury as a separate ground of appeal. However, picking up
on comments by Finlayson J.A. in McIntosh, Mr. Gold argued that
if the trial judge was not prepared to admit some of the expert
evidence, he should have at least incorporated some of its
information into the jury charge. This submission raises
practical concerns. The trial judge charged the jury as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            There was one other thing that I have to tell you about and
          that is in this case more than in most you have the evidence of
          girls, girls who are relatively young at the time offences were
          committed – remembering those offences and testifying about them
          with no supporting evidence in most cases. In some cases I have
          referred to where there was evidence to support but in most cases
          it is their word against their dad’s word or in the case of B.S.,
          his word against his step-father’s word. Not in the case of R. –
          it’s not her dad – but her evidence relates to events which
          allegedly occurred when she was ten years old.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               All of these offences allegedly occurred
          when these girls were in the range – in their
          early teens or late nine to ten, some of them
          even go back to the ages four and five. I
          mentioned that during the course of my
          address. Two of them were when the
          complainant was two years old.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Now, you have to view that evidence
          carefully because you know – and again we are
          talking common sense – you know the ability
          of a person to recall something that occurred
          many years ago when you were a toddler, when
          you were an early teen and so on. You will
          know that. Maybe you won’t know at the age of
          two but certainly by the age of nine or ten,
          12, 14, you will know whether or not
          something happened to you that you can
          remember clearly, particularly if it was of a
          traumatic nature, something out of the
          ordinary, something that you wouldn’t expect.
          You might be able to remember that better,
          you might not be able to. That is your
          experience. All I am saying is that you
          should be careful when you consider that
          evidence – view it closely. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[105]     Some of Mr. Gold’s submissions as to the state of
knowledge of memory are not beyond controversy. They are not
easily categorized as matters about which a trial judge could
take judicial notice: see D. M. Paciocco, &quot;Judicial Notice in

35. In this sense, they differ from the example provided by
Finlayson J.A. in McIntosh concerning cross-racial
identification. Nevertheless, some of the special problems with

constructed so that it was of more assistance to the jury. In
particular, the trial judge ought to have cautioned the jury that
their own experience and common sense might betray them in the
very unusual circumstances this case presented. While jurors may
have had occasion to remember back to events in their distant
past it is unlikely that they had the opportunity to
independently verify those memories. The task of assessing the
reliability or accuracy of memories on a daily basis is different
from the very rare event the jury was called upon to undertake in
this case — to assess the accuracy and reliability of memory of
events that allegedly occurred 30 to 40 years earlier.</font></pre>

will be on the charges upon which the appellant was convicted. In
view of this disposition, I need not consider the appeal from
sentence.
