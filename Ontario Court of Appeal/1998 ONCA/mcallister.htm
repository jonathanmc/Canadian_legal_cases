    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    This appeal raises two issues: first, did the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">err in failing to award damages, and second, did she err in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">holding that the appellant McAllister could not redirect the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commissions to himself?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    In our view, the trial judge erred on both issues. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant gave some evidence of his damages. Admittedly, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence was not as precise as it should have been. However, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent did not contest the appellant's estimate and offered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no evidence of its own though undoubtedly it had the accurate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">figures in its own records. The appellant testified that, if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anything, his estimate was low and the respondent's silence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggests that was likely the case. Once the trial judge found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellant was entitled to a further 2 1/2 per cent in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commissions, we think she erred in not accepting the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estimate when there was no evidence to the contrary.


[3]    The trial judge found that the direction to the numbered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company was revocable. That finding implies that the contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remained a contract between McAllister and the respondent. Thus,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was open to McAllister to redirect the commissions to himself</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the trial judge erred in holding otherwise.


[4]    Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Simmons J. is set aside and in its place the appellant McAllister</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is awarded damages in the amount of $39,952 plus pre-judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest in accordance with the Courts of Justice Act. Subject to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any offers to settle the appellant is entitled to his costs of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial and of the appeal. If there is any difficulty in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settling the amount of pre-judgment interest we may be spoken to.</font></pre></td>
