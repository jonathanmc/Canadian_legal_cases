    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  In our view, there was no admissible evidence before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury which identified the appellant as the man who shot the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deceased. At the trial, the Crown relied upon the evidence of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior identification during a photographic line-up made by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness Testebasis on October 17, 1994, six days after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">homicide. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge treated this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as independent evidence of identification on which the jury could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rely in convicting the accused.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  At the trial, Testebasis did not identify the appellant as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the man who shot the deceased. He said in his evidence in-chief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Here I see a different man.&quot; This could mean either that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused at the trial was not the man Testebasis identified as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gunman in the photographic line-up or was not the gunman he saw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the night in question or, most likely, both of these. He did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not deny that he had, on October 17, 1994, clearly identified the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">photograph as being that of the gunman. He gave an explanation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for this earlier identification and why it might have been wrong.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He said that two or three days before the homicide he had seen a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person who had passed in the store that looked something like the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person in the photograph. He said that he must have confused the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">man that he saw two or three days earlier and the gunman.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  He said that the accused at the trial did not look like the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gunman at the event or the person in the photograph. He testified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the man that had the gun had white to blondish hair and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the man in the photograph # 7 did not.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We do not think there was a proper basis for the admission</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the photographic line-up evidence. It was not consistent with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positive identification evidence given by Testebasis at trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because there was none. Second, the witness did not testify that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he had previously made an accurate identification of the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In fact, his evidence was to the contrary. The respondent submits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was open to the jury to reject his evidence why he could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identify the photograph as depicting the gunman. Assuming this to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be so, the result would not be that there was evidence from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness at the trial that he had previously made an accurate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identification.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge correctly instructed the jury:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          None of these witnesses [four eye-witnesses,
          including Testebasis, to the events
          surrounding the October 11 shooting]
          identified the accused in this court as the
          gunman.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The verdict depended entirely on the previous out of court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identification. For the reasons we have given, we do not think it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was admissible.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In the event that this evidence was admissible, we are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied that any verdict based on it would be unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Even if the jury rejected Testebasis's trial evidence, there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would still be no sworn evidence before the jury attesting to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact that the previous identification was accurate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Further, we are satisfied that the evidence given by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other three eye-witnesses, either individually or cumulatively</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with all of the other evidence, was not reasonably capable of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supporting a verdict of guilt. Before setting forth the parts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this evidence upon which the respondent particularly relies, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">note that the photographic evidence shows that the appellant was,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to use appellant's counsel's expression, &quot;a bulletin board of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tattoos.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The witness Mylonas did not identify the appellant as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gunman in the photographic line-up, nor could he identify anyone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the courtroom as the gunman. He testified in-chief that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gunman had a blue tattoo just above the index finger on his right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hand. He could not say if it was one or two because he saw it in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a &quot;split of a second&quot;. In cross-examination he acknowledged that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he did not see what the tattoo was. A photograph of the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shows tattoo letters across the whole of the back of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's right hand.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The witness Zapounidis was the owner of the cafe where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">homicide took place. He testified that he saw something on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gunman's right or left hand. He suggested that possibly it was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tattoo but in cross-examination he said that he could not say for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sure that it was a tattoo. He was unable to identify anyone in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the photographic line-up or in the courtroom as the gunman.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The witness Katsoulis was asked to examine the photographs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on October 18, 1994. At that time he said that the gunman looked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more like photograph #1 than photograph #7 (the appellant). He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not say either was, in fact, the gunman. At trial he said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the gunman looked more like #7 than #1. Further, at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial he said that the gunman did not look like the man in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">photograph #7 and with respect to the appellant at the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;there is nothing that I remember that I saw that night.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Assuming that the failure of the appellant to testify is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factor that could be taken into account on the issue of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonableness of the verdict, in view of the weakness of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown's case it should not be taken into account in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the verdict is set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aside, and a verdict of acquittal is directed to be entered.</font></pre></td>
