    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I    THE McCULLOUGH APPEAL</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[1]  The appellant McCullough (the &quot;appellant&quot;) appeals his

conviction by a court composed of Soubliere J. and a jury on the

following counts:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          1)  escape from lawful custody (s.145(1));</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2)  forcible confinement (s.279(2));</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3)  possession of a weapon for the purpose of
          committing an indictable offence (s. 87);</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4)  sexual assault with a weapon (s. 272(a));
          and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5)  uttering a death threat (s. 264.1(1)(a)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Following his conviction, a dangerous offender hearing was held

and the appellant was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced

to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period of

time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          a) Constitutionality of ss. 16(2) and (3) of
             the Criminal Code (the&quot;Code&quot;);</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          b) Instruction regarding the requisite mens
             rea of the five offences charged;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          c) Incorrect definition of insanity;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          d) Instruction to find the appellant guilty;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          e) Failure to review the evidence during the
             final instructions to the jury and
             failure to put the theory to the defence
             to the jury;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          f) Method of charging the jury;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          g) Failure of the trial judge to recuse
             himself from the dangerous offender
             hearing on the ground of reasonable
             apprehension of bias.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The appellant relies on all the grounds of appeal, although he

did not address them all during oral argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  In 1980, the appellant was found not guilty by reason of

insanity after a trial in which he was charged with attempted

murder and two counts of kidnapping (offences that bear

similarity to the present offences).  He was subsequently

detained in various mental health facilities under Lieutenant-

Governor's Warrants.  The appellant is presently fifty-six years

old.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  On June 6, 1992, the appellant allegedly kidnapped a sixteen

year old woman and, as a result, he was charged and convicted of

the offences herein.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  At trial, it was not disputed that the appellant had

committed the said offences.  The major part of the evidence

consisted of psychiatric evidence called by the Crown and the

defence on the issues of mental disorder and the declaration that

he was a dangerous offender.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  We will deal with the grounds of appeal in the same order as

listed above.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     a) Constitutionality of ss. 16(2) and (3) of the Code</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  In a pre-trial motion, the defence argued that ss. 16(2) and

(3) of the Code (presumption of sanity and onus of proof) violate

the appellant's Charter rights since he was still the subject of

a Lieutenant-Governor's Warrant at the time of the commission of

the offences.  The trial judge ruled that s. 16(2) and (3) were

constitutional.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  In our view, the trial judge was correct in dismissing the

constitutional challenge to s. 16 of the Code.  The decision of

the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Chaulk (1990), 62 C.C.C.

(3d) 193 provides a complete answer on this issue.  We see

nothing in Chaulk that would lead us to believe that it was

intended to apply in limited circumstances only.  As was the case

in Chaulk, while s. 16 infringes  s. 11(d) of the Charter, it is

justified under s. 1.  The analysis made by Chief Justice Lamer

is also applicable to the present case.  Chaulk is binding on

this court.  We see no merit to this argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     b) Instruction on the requisite mens rea of the five
        offences charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  No real issue was raised at trial as to the appellant's

&quot;general intent&quot; with respect to his actions.  Defence counsel

specifically acknowledged that the real issue was insanity and,

unless the appellant was found insane, he was guilty on counts 1,

2 and 4. The defence's alternative position was that if the

appellant was not insane, then his mental condition would raise a

doubt as to the specific intent required under counts 3 and 5.

No objection was raised with respect to the final charge lacking

an instruction on &quot;general intent&quot;.  We see no error on the part

of the trial judge on this issue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     c) Incorrect definition of insanity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] In his opening remarks to the jury, the trial judge, as part

of the insanity instructions, told the jury that &quot;wrong&quot; meant &quot;a

criminal act or legally wrong&quot;.  This was in error.


[11] On this issue, it is important to note that the trial judge

instructed the jury that his opening remarks were subject to

correction.  More importantly, the error respecting the meaning

of &quot;wrong&quot; was immediately corrected in the next paragraph of the

trial judge's opening remarks and the correct meaning of &quot;wrong&quot;

was again given to the jury immediately prior to the testimony of

the psychiatrists.  Moreover, after the error was brought to his

attention, the trial judge specifically brought to the attention

of the jury that he had made this error and again gave the jury

the correct meaning of &quot;wrong.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] When the charge to the jury is considered as a whole, we are

of the view that the trial judge provided the jury with adequate

instruction on insanity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     d) Instruction to find the appellant guilty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] The appellant submits that the trial judge's instructions

amounted to instructions that they should find the appellant

guilty.  Unless the appellant was found to be insane, there was

no question that he was guilty, subject to the issue of specific

intent referred to above.  We see no merit in this submission.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     e)   Failure to review the evidence during the final
          instruction and failure to put the theory of the
          defence to the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] Looking at the charge as a whole, the trial judge adequately

reviewed the evidence with respect to the issues that had been

raised.  He also adequately summarized the position of the

defence, simple as it was, that the appellant was not criminally

responsible on account of mental disorder or, in the alternative,

the appellant did not have the specific intent for counts 3 and 5

on account of his mental disorder.   No objection was raised with

respect to this issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     f) Method of charging the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] This was a very short trial in which the issues were

exceedingly simple.  The trial judge gave the jury a split

charge, however, he instructed the jury to consider his charge as

a whole.  He instructed the jury during the course of the trial

on the specific issues as they arose, and the final charge

essentially dealt with the real issue in the case, namely,

insanity.  His final charge was quite brief — approximately

eleven pages of transcripts.  As he had given the jury copies of

the earlier parts of his charge, he also offered to give copies

of his final charge.  The jury did not request it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] In the circumstances of this case, we do not think that the

manner in which the charge was given amounted to misdirection of

the jury on any essential requirement of a proper charge.  The

trial judge provided sufficient assistance to the jury to enable

it to perform its duties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     g)   Failure of the trial judge to recuse himself from the
          dangerous offender hearing on the ground of reasonable
          apprehension of bias</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] A trial judge is entitled to make reasonable criticism

respecting the conduct of counsel and witnesses who appear in

court.  The trial judge's inquiries of the conduct of a witness

and the appellant's counsel were neither unreasonable nor

otherwise improper.  He was concerned that certain events had

caused considerable inconvenience, expense and loss of court

time.  He expressed his concerns in a reasonable manner.  The

criticism voiced by the trial judge was not misplaced and it

cannot be said to support an apprehension of bias.  In its proper

context, it did not demonstrate &quot;a predisposition to decide an

issue or cause in a certain way that does not leave the judicial

mind perfectly open to conviction.&quot;  See R. v. Bertram, [1989]

O.J. No. 2123 as cited in R.D.S. v. The Queen (1997), 118 C.C.C.

(3d) 353 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] For these reasons, the appeal of the appellant McCullough is

dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
II   THE BENNETT APPEAL</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] The appellant Bennett, who was counsel for the appellant

McCullough at trial, appeals the order of the trial judge holding

him personally responsible for witness fees and expenses incurred

by the Crown on the sentencing hearing.  Bennett was also an

intervenor in the McCullough appeal, however, on consent of the

all parties, he did not appear or participate in the hearing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] With respect to the appeal of the appellant Bennett, the

Crown concedes that Bennett has a right of appeal against the

costs order made against him pursuant to s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts

of Justice Act.  The Crown further concedes that, in the

circumstances, there was not a proper basis to order costs

against this appellant.   Although, as stated above, the

criticism of the trial judge was not misplaced, we agree with the

Crown that, taken as a whole, this appellant's conduct did not

justify the costs order.  His conduct, while in the nature of a

mistake or an error of judgment, cannot be described as being in

the nature of contempt or abuse of process.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] Accordingly, this appellant's appeal is allowed and the

costs order made against him is hereby set aside.</font></pre></td>
