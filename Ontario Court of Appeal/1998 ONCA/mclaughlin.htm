      </div>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent’s entitlement to a pension is derived from
his agreement with the appellant as it relates to retirement
benefits.

The appellant agreed to pay retirement benefits (a pension)
to the respondent. Section 6.01 of the pension plan imposes
an obligation on the appellant to pay a monthly pension to
the respondent, in an amount that is not in issue.

The appellant has not met that obligation. We agree with the
trial judge that s.11.02 of the plan did no more than
authorize the appellant to remove funds to purchase
appropriate annuities through which in normal circumstances
full pension benefits would have been paid.  Had the
appellant sought to change its obligation in respect of the
payment of retirement benefits it could have done so by
resort to contractual language that would have provided that
its payment obligation was discharged by the purchase of an
appropriate annuity.  The contract in issue does not contain
such provisions.

In our view, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with
costs.</font></pre></td>
