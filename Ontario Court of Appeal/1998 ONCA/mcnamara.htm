    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">ABELLA J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Robert McNamara was a standardbred owner/groom of some
horses at Rideau Carleton Raceway.  On September 12, 1997 he
accompanied the woman he lives with, Sherry Korniski, to a
hearing she was required to attend at the Raceway as a result of
charges laid against her in connection with horses she owned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The hearing took place before three track judges.  Early in
the hearing, after reading the statement of one of the witnesses,
McNamara became agitated and started swearing at the judges.  The
judges asked him to leave, which caused McNamara to become even
more abusive.  The hearing was then adjourned at Korniski's
request so that her lawyer could attend.  The judges refused to
let Korniski race her horses pending the adjournment.  As a
result, she and McNamara went next door to the offices of the
Canadian Trotting Association so Korniski could transfer some of
her horses.  McNamara was also interested in transferring one of
his horses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  When the person in charge of the offices of the Canadian
Trotting Association asked the three judges whether the transfers
could be made, the judges refused.  They believed that McNamara
and Korniski had an interest in each other's horses.  This, and
the serious nature of the charges against Korniski, caused the
Track Judges to conclude that no horses should be transferred
until the ownership was clarified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  This decision enraged McNamara.  He threatened, verbally
abused, and intimidated the Judges, refusing to leave the office
even after the Judges called security personnel for assistance.
It took security almost ten minutes to arrive, during which time
McNamara's abuse and intimidation continued.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  One of the judges, Al Caughey, then told McNamara that he
was suspended for thirty days and all horses under his direction
that night were scratched.  McNamara became further enraged.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Two security officers, David Joanis and Ernie O'Dwyer,
arrived and found McNamara yelling, swearing and screaming at the
judges.  Joanis said McNamara was &quot;about to snap&quot;, a state Joanis
had seen him in before.  O'Dwyer said McNamara was ranting and
raving and said he would leave &quot;when he fucking well wanted to
leave.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Joanis and O'Dwyer placed themselves between the Judges and
McNamara, and were able gradually to manoeuvre him out of the
room.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Shortly after this incident, the Track Judges allowed
Korniski to transfer 9 horses and McNamara to transfer one.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The official ruling of the  track judges was that McNamara
had violated Rules 6:17(b)(c)(d)1of the Rules of Standardbred
Racing, 1997, because he:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Did threaten, used insulting, offensive and
          improper language and was guilty of GROSS
          improper misconduct toward the judges in
          their office on 12 Sept 97. [Emphasis in
          original.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McNamara appealed the suspension to the Ontario Racing Commission
(the &quot;Commission&quot;). The suspension was stayed pending the
Commission hearing held the following month, and continues to be
stayed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] A three-person panel of the Commission heard viva voce
evidence for three days. The witnesses were McNamara; one of the
three track judges, Al Caughey; the two security officers; and a
doctor called on McNamara's behalf, Dr. James Turnbull.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] McNamara admitted at the Commission hearing that he had lost
his temper and swore at the judges, but said this occurred only
after he and Korniski were told they could not transfer their
horses. He was also upset at being suspended for 30 days without
a hearing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] McNamara attributed his behaviour on September 12, 1997 to
his diabetic condition. His medical condition improved
dramatically, he said, on September 23, 1997, when his medication
was changed to injectable insulin and his diet was adjusted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The Commission found Dr. Turnbull, an expert in internal
medicine, to be a &quot;very credible witness.&quot; He was asked by
McNamara's counsel to explain the impact of diabetes on
behaviour. Although he was not McNamara's doctor, he based his
opinions on medical records he got from McNamara's treating
physician. His evidence was that when diabetes is out of control,
a patient can experience confusion, stress, the loss of social
skills, fear, aggression and the use of profanity. Dr. Turnbull
confirmed that McNamara's diabetes is now under control, and can
continue to be controlled with ongoing help from his doctor, a
dietician, and continuing education.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] After hearing all the evidence, the Commission rejected
McNamara's evidence where it conflicted with the evidence of
Caughey, O'Dwyer and Joanis. It made a finding that McNamara
behaved in &quot;a totally unacceptable manner&quot; and that his abusive
conduct started almost as soon as he arrived at Korniski's
hearing. The Commission found that McNamara &quot;acted in an
outrageous manner&quot; even before being told the horses could not be
transferred, and did not stop until he was finally ushered out of
the hearing room.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] McNamara's defence of provocation was rejected as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          We reject the suggestion that his misconduct
          was precipitated by the conduct of Caughey in
          either refusing to permit the transfer of
          horses or in suspending McNamara on the spot.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The Commission also took into account McNamara's outbursts
on prior occasions in concluding that his medical condition alone
did not cause his abusive behaviour:
[1]
          During the evidence in chief of Caughey and
          O'Dwyer in particular, reference was made to
          a number of prior occasions when McNamara was
          verbally aggressive, vulgar, obnoxious and
          loud with various racetrack officials and
          licensees. There was no objection taken to
          the introduction of this evidence. To the
          extent that this evidence could be described
          as character evidence, in our view it is only
          relevant to disprove the facts put in issue
          by McNamara that his extreme outburst on this
          occasion was caused or contributed to by his
          medical condition. Evidence of extreme
          outbursts on other occasions when a medical
          condition did not appear to be a direct issue
          is received to disprove McNamara's assertions
          as to the cause of his behaviour on this
          occasion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the result, we find that McNamara's
          conduct toward the Judges on the day in
          question was grossly offensive, insulting,
          threatening and improper and that he was in
          violation of Rules 6.17 (b)(c) and (d). While
          his diabetic condition may have contributed
          to the excessiveness of his behaviour, we do
          not accept that it was its sole cause and
          therefore provides an absolute excuse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The immediacy of McNamara's suspension was found to be
justified under Rule 1.09 because these were &quot;very special
circumstances&quot;:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Racing Officials are not to be subjected to
          the kind of treatment that Caughey, Raymond
          and Campbell experienced at the hands of
          McNamara in this case. In our view, Caughey
          was justified in suspending McNamara on the
          spot. If further justification is required in
          the special circumstances of this case, it
          can be found in Rule 1.09 which reads in part
          as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.09      the Commission in its absolute
               discretion may waive the breach of
               any of the rules which waiver or
               breach the Commission does not
               consider prejudicial to the best
               interests of racing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the unique circumstances of this case if
          necessary, we would be prepared to waive the
          application of Rule 6.03.2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In closing, we wish to make it clear that the
          kind of conduct exhibited by McNamara on
          September 12, 1997, will simply not be
          tolerated. Standardbred Judges are to be
          treated with courtesy and respect by
          standardbred licensees. Should a licensee
          feel aggrieved by the decisions or conduct of
          the Judges, there is recourse to the
          Commission. That recourse must never include
          the kind of abuse that was directed toward
          the Judges at Rideau Carleton by McNamara.
          [Emphasis in original.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The Administration of the Commission had cross-appealed the
30-day suspension, seeking a 6-month suspension. The Commission
increased the suspension to 60 days for the following reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In determining penalty, we have considered a
          number of factors, viz. the extreme nature of
          McNamara's conduct on the night in question,
          that his conduct may have been influenced in
          part by his medical condition, that his
          medical condition now appears to be under
          control, his prior conduct towards racing
          officials, his willingness to abide by
          conditions should he be permitted to continue
          to hold an owner's and groom's license and
          his apologies. In all of the circumstances,
          we have concluded that McNamara should be
          suspended for 60 days less the 7 days already
          served prior to continuing a stay of these
          proceedings pending the disposition of this
          appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In addition to the 60-day suspension, the following
conditions were imposed on McNamara:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In addition, during both the period of
          suspension and subsequent, McNamara shall
          satisfy the Administration of the Commission
          in a form acceptable to it that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          a)   his diabetic condition is under
               control and that he continues to
               monitor his blood/sugar levels;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          b)   that he continues to be monitored
               for his diabetic condition by a
               physician such as Dr. Dostaler who
               is responsive to his condition;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          c)   that he pursues a diet that is
               compatible to his medical
               condition; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          d)   that he participates in a regime of
               continuing education with regard to
               his medical condition.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] McNamara brought an application for judicial review of the
Commission's decision. The application was heard and dismissed by
a single judge of the Divisional Court, Campbell J. His reasons
were set out in an endorsement which states:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The applicant raises in this court for the
          first time the proposition that the
          proceedings were really for contempt and that
          track judges and the ORC therefore had no
          jurisdiction to exercise the contempt
          jurisdiction reserved exclusively to the
          Divisional Court under SPPA s. 13. These
          proceedings were not for contempt. They were
          for the enforcement of Rules 6.17 (b) (c) and
          (d). It is irrelevant that the conduct was
          also contemptuous. The violently threatening
          and assaultive conduct of the applicant went
          far beyond any contempt of the kind
          contemplated by s. 13 of the SPPA. It
          constituted an immediate physical challenge
          to the order of the track and had to be dealt
          with on the spot. The decision of the track
          judges and the ORC was squarely within their
          jurisdiction in relation to the enforcement
          of Rules 6.17 (b), (c) and (d). Resort to
          Rule 1.09 was fully justified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Any arguable defects in substance or
          procedure before the track judges were cured
          by fresh review before the ORC which heard
          evidence and made its own findings of fact.
          If there was any apprehension of bias on the
          part of the track officials, who obviously
          and out of immediate necessity had to act
          quickly on the spot in the circumstances, it
          was cured by the rehearing before the fresh
          tribunal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There was no error in relation to the
          standard of proof, the use made of the
          medical and similar fact evidence or in the
          finding that there was no prejudice by reason
          of the timing of the cross-appeal in relation
          to penalty. There was ample evidence to
          support the findings of fact and the penalty
          for the applicant's violently disruptive,
          assaultive, and threatening conduct. The
          conditions, that the applicant take
          appropriate efforts to control the medical
          condition to which he attributed his
          aggressive outbursts, is reasonably necessary
          to ensure he does not repeat his conduct.
          There is nothing in the measured and careful
          reasons of the ORC [the Commission], an
          experienced specialist tribunal, to suggest
          any error in law, principle, or jurisdiction,
          let alone anything that approaches the
          patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          For these reasons, the application is
          dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] McNamara appealed this decision and was granted leave by a
panel of this court with respect to two issues:</font></pre>

moot. The essence of McNamara's claim is that the proceeding
before the track judges was a nullity and therefore could not be
corrected on appeal. I disagree. The track judges had
jurisdiction to suspend McNamara. The more apposite analysis is
that the procedure they followed represented, arguably, an
infringement of the rules of natural justice. Such procedural
defects, however, are amenable to rectification on appeal; they
do not render the proceeding void. The jurisprudence is clear
that they can be cured by a subsequent hearing in which natural
justice is accorded. This renders &quot;nugatory any alleged earlier
failure to accord ... such natural justice in any of the earlier
hearings&quot; (Harelkin v. University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561

that he was ultimately found to have merited a suspension after a

place was a hearing de novo, a fresh consideration of the events
of September 12, 1997.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] As for the propriety of the penalty, McNamara had explained

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] The Commission made findings of credibility against McNamara
and rejected his evidence on both matters. This was completely
within its jurisdiction. Having heard the full case, it found
McNamara's conduct to be abusive and outrageous, citing some of

including suspension (s. 10(d)(i)(o) of the Racing Commission

          be ungovernable, he or she will be stripped
          of their licence. The conduct of standardbred
          racing and the overall public interest
          requires no less if it is to be conducted in

and respectfully am unable to agree with them.
Facts
[36] On September 12, 1997, the appellant, who was licensed as a
trainer and groom, attended with his spouse before a panel of
track judges at Rideau Carleton Raceway. His spouse, who was
licensed as a trainer, was facing charges for betting on horses,
other than her own, in races in which her horses competed. The
appellant attended to represent her in her discipline
proceedings.
[37] Exactly what happened thereafter is not clear on this
record, but on any version of the facts, the conduct of the
appellant was outrageous. He berated the panel of judges to the
point that the proceedings had to be adjourned and he and his
spouse were ushered out of the hearing room. They then attended
at the Canadian Trotting Association office in the same building
to arrange for the transfer of the registration of horses in the
spouse’s name to the appellant so that in the event that his
spouse was suspended, the horses could still race. The person
responsible for those transfers contacted the office where the
panel of judges was sitting and was told not to effect the
transfers.
[38] The appellant flew into a rage, returned with his spouse to
the original hearing room and apparently lost control of his
temper completely. He again berated the panel, threatened
individual members and used obscene language. It was necessary to
send for security and the appellant had to be physically
restrained. At some undetermined point in what is now referred to
as a “hearing”, the focus of attention of at least one member of
the panel of track judges shifted from a consideration of the
conduct of the appellant’s spouse to that of the appellant.
However, the appellant was never warned that his conduct was
unseemly and that he was at risk in consequence. He was never
told that he was facing discipline or what rules he was alleged
to have broken. He was not advised of any potential penalty, nor
was he advised that he was entitled himself to have
representation at the hearing. As far as I can determine, the
first indication to him that his conduct was being examined into
was when the president of the panel, with the appellant’s face
thrust within six to eight inches of his own, announced that the
appellant was suspended and all horses under his direction were
scratched. This infuriated the appellant even more. He was then
physically removed from the hearing room by security.
[39] The typescript of the ruling of the panel of track judges
states that there was penalty imposed “of 30 days full suspension
from September 12, 1997 through to October 12, 1997” for the
following reasons:

          ORC rule 6.17(b) (c) (d)
          Did threaten, used insulting, offensive and
          improper language and was guilty of GROSS
          improper misconduct toward the judges in
          their office on 12 Sept 97.
          All horses under his direction were
          scratched.

[40] The appellant appealed his suspension and counsel for the
Administration of the Ontario Racing Commission served notice
that she intended to request that the Racing Commission vary the
penalty by increasing the suspension from 30 days to six months.
[41] The Racing Commission heard evidence and argument and at its
conclusion, dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-appeal to
the extent of increasing the suspension to 60 days and imposing
certain health monitoring conditions on the appellant as a term
of re-instating him. In dealing with jurisdictional arguments,
the Racing Commission concluded:

               In normal circumstances, a licensee is
          certainly entitled to be notified of any
          charges against him or her for a violation of
          the Rules and to attend at a hearing convened
          for the purpose of dealing with the alleged
          violation (see Rule 6.03). However, we find
          that this case involves very special
          circumstances. Racing Officials are not to be
          subjected to the kind of treatment that
          Caughey, Raymond and Campbell [the panel of
          judges] experienced at the hands of McNamara
          in this case. In our view, Caughey was
          justified in suspending McNamara on the spot.
          If further justification is required in the
          special circumstances of this case, it can be
          found in Rule 1.09 which reads in part as
          follows:
               1.09 the Commission in its absolute
          discretion may waive the breach of any of the
          rules, which waiver or breach the Commission
          does not consider prejudicial to the best
          interests of racing.
               In the unique circumstances of this case
          if necessary, we would be prepared to waive
          the application of Rule 6.03.

[42] An application for judicial review was heard by A. Campbell
J. sitting as a single judge of the Divisional Court. He
dismissed the application, holding that the violently threatening
and assaultive conduct of the appellant went beyond any contempt
contemplated by s.13 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act,
R.S.O. 1990 Chap. S-22, that his conduct was squarely within the
jurisdiction of Rules 6.17(b), (c) and (d), that resort to Rule
1.09 was fully justified and any arguable defects in substance or
procedure before the track judges were cured by fresh review
before the Ontario Racing Commission.
Analysis
[43] Counsel for the respondent conceded that the proceeding
before the track judges was most unusual and entirely
unprecedented. The appellant should have received written notice
of the hearing pursuant to the Rules of Standardbred Racing
(“Rules”).

               4.1 (1) Unless otherwise ordered,
          written notice of a hearing shall be given by
          the Commission to the parties and other
          persons as required by statute and to such
          other persons as the Commission considers
          necessary.
               (2)  All notices of hearing shall
          include:
               (a)  a reference to the statutory
               authority under which the hearing is to
               be held;
               (b)  a statement of the purpose of the
          hearing; and
               (c)  a statement that the party may have
               a representative at the hearing.
               (3)  The Commission may include in a
               notice of hearing any other information
               or directions it considers necessary for
               the proper conduct of the hearing.

[44] Rule 4.5 reads:

               Unless otherwise ordered, notice of
          hearing is sufficiently given if served under
          Rule 2.1 with 4 clear days notice.

[45] Counsel further conceded that there was no urgency in this
situation except that the members of the track judge’s panel felt
threatened and were fearful for their safety. However, she agreed
that once security had been summonsed, the appellant could have
been ejected (as he ultimately was) and a proper hearing
conducted at a later date upon proper notice to the appellant.
[46] To conduct an administrative hearing relating to the
cancellation or suspension of a licence in these circumstances
bordered on the bizarre. The panel members were fearful for their
personal safety and the licence holder was incapable of
controlling his temper. There was a total lack of due process and
no semblance of natural justice. The suspension was a complete
nullity. Nothing could save it. There was no hearing in fact or
in law and consequently nothing from which to appeal.
[47] Before dealing with the main submission of the respondent as
to why the decisions below should be sustained, I would like to
deal with the reliance by both the Racing Commission and the
Divisional Court on Rule 1.09 which reads in full:

               1.09 If any case occurs which is not or
          which is alleged not to be provided for by
          the rules, it shall be determined by the
          judges or the Commission as the case may be,
          in such manner as they think in the best
          interest of racing. Provided however, the
          Commission in its absolute discretion may
          waive the breach of any of the rules, which
          waiver or breach the Commission does not
          consider prejudicial to the best interests of
          racing.

[48] The track judges at no time purported to take refuge in this
rule and it hardly lay in the mouths of the Racing Commission to
invoke it on behalf of the panel whose ruling was in review. When
pressed on this point, counsel for the respondent conceded that
it was a weak argument and relied in the end almost exclusively
on the submission that to the extent that there were any
deficiencies in the hearing before the panel of track judges,
they were cured by what counsel referred to as a trial de novo on
the full appeal to the Racing Commission.
[49] There are a lot of things wrong with this submission. First
and foremost, there is nothing in the appeal provisions that
provide for a trial de novo. Section 24.01 of the rules states:

          An appeal is a request to review any
          decision or rulings of the judges or
          delegated officials.

[50] Second, while counsel for the respondent stated before the
Racing Commission that she was proceeding as on a trial de novo,
there is nothing in the reasons of the Racing Commission which
acknowledges that it was proceeding on that basis. I find it most
strange that a respondent in an appeal can unilaterally determine
the nature and quality of the hearing to which the appellant is
entitled.
[51] Third, if counsel was intending to rely upon case law to the
effect that procedural defects could be corrected by a full
hearing on appeal, there is no statement by the Racing Commission
that it was not accepting the original decision and was
proceeding with a fresh hearing.
[52] The difference between a trial de novo and an appeal was
discussed in R. v. Dennis, [1960] S.C.R. 286, by Ritchie J of the
Supreme Court of Canada in the context of interpreting s.727 of
the Criminal Code, 1953-54, C.51. He said, at p. 290:

                   As was said by said by Hogg J.A. in
          R. v. Crawford [[1955] O.R. 866 at 872, 113
          C.C.C. 160.], the outstanding distinction
          between the trial de novo contemplated by s.
          727 and the new trial which may be ordered by
          the Court of Appeal is that in the latter
          case the conviction has been quashed before
          the new trial starts whereas in the former
          the conviction remains outstanding, subject,
          however, to being reversed by the Appeal
          Court on evidence called afresh or indeed on
          entirely new evidence. In the one case, the
          conviction has gone while in the other it is
          under review by fresh eyes in the light of
          fresh evidence.

                   On the other hand, the distinction
          between “an appeal by holding a trial de
          novo” and an appeal to the provincial Court
          of Appeal is that although the object of both
          is to determine whether the decision appealed
          from was right or wrong, in the latter case
          the question is whether it was right or wrong
          having regard to the evidence upon which it
          was based, whereas in the former the issue is
          to be determined without any reference,
          except for purposes of cross-examination, to
          the evidence called in the Court appealed
          from and upon a fresh determination based
          upon evidence called anew and perhaps
          accompanied by entirely new evidence.

[53] Based on the above definition, I do not think there was a
trial de novo in this case. First of all, the Racing Commission
panel was aware of the decision of the track judges and that it
had been implemented. The decision was not set aside with a view
to making a fresh start with fresh evidence. The real reason for
calling evidence was that there was no record of what had
transpired before the track judges. In fact, the president of the
panel had to be called to explain what had occurred and, in the
course of so doing, justify his suspension of the appellant.
While it is obvious from the reasons that the Racing Commission
considered the evidence carefully, it is apparent that it did so
to determine if it could justify the decision under review. For
example the finding that Rule 1.09 was properly invoked due to
the one-time extreme circumstances and the finding that “In our
view, Caughey [the president] was justified in suspending
McNamara on the spot.”. I do not think there was properly a
“fresh determination”.
[54] Rule 24(1) speaks of a “review” of a decision. This language
describes exactly what happened. The Racing Commission reviewed
the decision of the track judges below without any restrictions
on what evidence it might consider. It is as if this court
reviewed a decision of the General Division with the liberty to
consider fresh evidence.
[55] The leading case in Canada dealing with whether there is an
appeal from a decision which is said to be a nullity is Harelkin
v. University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561, where Beetz J. for
the majority of the Supreme Court stated at p.580:

               IV – Whether the decision of the council
          committee was a nullity from which there
          could be no appeal

                   The proposition that the failure to
          comply with natural justice renders a
          decision absolutely null rather than voidable
          is an old and much mooted one of a somewhat
          theoretical nature but with far reaching
          practical consequences. It was raised in
          Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal [(1852), 3
          H.L.C. 759], where it was held that a decree
          of Lord Chancellor Cottenham rendered while
          he was disqualified from sitting as a judge
          on the ground of interest was merely
          voidable. But that was a case involving a
          superior court. The theoretical aspect of the
          question with respect to an inferior
          tribunal, was expressed but left unanswered
          by the Judicial Committee in White v. Kuzych
          [[1951] A.C. 585], at p. 598:

                    . . . is the conclusion of a
               judicial tribunal acting within its
               jurisdiction, which is arrived at in a
               way which amounts to a denial of natural
               justice, appealable, or, on the
               contrary, is it simply void and thus not
               subject to an appeal at all?

                   If there is nothing to appeal from,
          certiorari should then issue in all except
          the rarest of cases for the aggrieved party
          would have no alternative remedy to cure the
          injustice. This was the view taken in New
          Zealand in Denton v. Auckland City [[1969]
          N.Z.L.R. 256], and followed in England in
          Leary v. National Union of Vehicle Builders
          [[1970] 3 W.L.R. 434 (Ch. D), by Megarry J.
          who criticized the conflicting opinion of
          this Court in King v. University of
          Saskatchewan [[1969] S.C.R. 678], where
          Spence J., speaking for a unanimous Court,
          said at p.689:

                    Any possible failure of natural
               justice before the special appeal
               committee, the executive committee, or
               the full faculty council, is quite
               unimportant when the senate, the appeal
               body under the provisions of The
               University Act, and also the body in
               control of the granting of degrees, has
               exercised its function with no failure
               to accord natural justice. If there were
               any absence of natural justice in the
               inferior tribunals, it was cured by the
               presence of such natural justice before
               the senate appeal committee.

                    A similar matter was considered in
               Posluns v. Toronto Stock Exchange
               ([1968] S.C.R. 330), and Ritchie J.,
               giving the reasons for the Court,
               distinguished the circumstances there
               present, where the second hearing was
               one in which the appellant was accorded
               a full measure of natural justice, from
               the situation in Ridge v. Baldwin,
               ([1964] A.C. 40), where, as Lord Reid
               pointed out at p. 79:

                         But here the appellant’s
                    solicitor was not fully informed of
                    the charges against the appellant
                    and the watch committee did not
                    annul the decision which they had
                    already published and proceed to
                    make a new decision. In my
                    judgment, what was done that day
                    was a very inadequate substitute
                    for a full rehearing.

                   I am of the opinion that the
          situation here resembles that in Posluns v.
          Toronto Stock Exchange, supra, and that the
          hearing before the senate appeal committee, a
          small and very able body, was such as
          accorded the appellant every advantage of
          natural justice and rendered nugatory any
          alleged earlier failure to accord him such
          natural justice in any of the earlier
          hearings.

[56] In support of the concept that a breach of natural justice
or procedural fairness renders a decision void rather than
voidable, LeDain J. for the court in Cardinal v. Kent Institution
(Director), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, stated at 660:

               Certainly a failure to afford a fair
          hearing, which is the very essence of the
          duty to act fairly, can never of itself be
          regarded as not of “sufficient substance”
          unless it be because of its perceived effect
          on the result or, in other words, the actual
          prejudice caused by it. If this be a correct
          view of the implications of the approach of
          the majority of the British Columbia Court of
          Appeal to the issue of procedural fairness in
          this case, I find it necessary to affirm that
          the denial of a right to a fair hearing must
          always render a decision invalid, whether or
          not it may appear to a reviewing court that
          the hearing would likely have resulted in a
          different decision. The right to a fair
          hearing must be regarded as an independent,
          unqualified right which finds its essential
          justification in the sense of procedural
          justice which any person affected by an
          administrative decision is entitled to have.
          It is not for a court to deny that right and
          sense of justice on the basis of speculation
          as to what the result might have been had
          there been a hearing.

[57] Having the above discussion in mind, I can see no evidence
in this case that the track judges ever purported to conduct a
hearing respecting the conduct of the appellant. We are not
dealing with a failure to accord with natural justice, we are
dealing with a decision made without any hearing at all. That is
why I say there is nothing to appeal from. In these circumstances
the perception of lack of procedural fairness is paramount. The
hearing before the Racing Commission could do nothing to correct
this and indeed it made no attempt to do so. The clear message it
sent was that it was prepared to protect its officials from
abuse.
[58] I have a great deal of sympathy with the Administration of
the Ontairo Racing Commission, faced as it was with a flagrant
contempt of its track officials, but the more egregious the
contempt the more careful it should have been in proceeding
against the appellant. This is not one of the “rarest of cases”
which deprive the aggrieved party of the remedy of certiorari.
The appellant was appearing on behalf of another and as such was
in a position akin to counsel. When he acted in the way that he
did, the panel of judges could have done one of two things:

          1.   Ejected him and proceeded with the hearing in his
          absence;
          2.   Ejected him and adjourned the proceedings until
          the respondent in the discipline proceedings could
          obtain new representation.

[59] In either event, the panel could have invoked the contempt
procedures available under s.13 of the Statutory Powers
Procedures Act or proceeded on its own to charge the appellant
under Rule 6.17(b) (c) and (d). In taking short cuts, the
Administration ended up attempting to justify what was no more
than a spontaneous, albeit understandable, outburst by a track
judge to an abusive groom. Unfortunately, in my view, they will
have to conduct a proper discipline hearing.
[60] For the reasons set out above, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Divisional Court and in its place make
an order quashing the decision of the track judges. I would allow
the appellant his costs in this court and in the Divisional
Court.
