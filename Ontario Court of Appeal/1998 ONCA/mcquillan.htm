    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>CHARRON J.A.:</b>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This proceeding arises from the appellant's use of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">driveway situated between her house and the respondent's house.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The parties are neighbours in a residential area of London,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario. There is a distance of approximately seven feet between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their respective houses. The appellant claims that, by her long</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">user and that of her predecessors in title, she has acquired a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescriptive easement over a two-foot strip of land on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's property.  The respondent disputes the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim to long user.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  However, the issues on this appeal are not all centred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">around the appellant's user of the two foot strip of land. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter is complicated by the fact that the appellant had brought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an earlier application, before the same judge and based on much</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same evidence, for a declaration of possessory title to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same strip of land. This earlier application was dismissed on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 27, 1995. No appeal was taken from this dismissal. Seven</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months later, the appellant brought the present application for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration of prescriptive easement. This application was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed on October 30, 1996. She appeals from this dismissal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant takes the position that the motions judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misapprehended the evidence and that, on the facts, she is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to a declaration of prescriptive easement. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternative, she argues that any controversy in the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should have been resolved by a trial of the issue and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge erred in dismissing her application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The respondent submits that the appellant has not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established a sufficient user of the strip of land and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge was correct in dismissing her application. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent also argues that, regardless of the merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present application, the appellant is estopped from bringing a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second application on the same subject-matter and that her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application should be dismissed on that basis. On this latter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue, the appellant replies that, if the court finds that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exists grounds for the application of the doctrine of estoppel,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an exception should be made in this case because of &quot;special</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Before considering the merits of the matter,  it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore necessary to determine whether the appellant should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estopped from bringing her application. In order to determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this issue, it is important to consider the nature of the earlier</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application and the findings made by the motions judge. On the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier application, the appellant sought a declaration that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's interest in and title to the two foot strip of land</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in question have been extinguished under the Limitations Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1990, c. L-15 and a declaration entitling her to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possessory title to that same land. The motions judge considered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence, made certain findings and dismissed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application. He gave the following reasons:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The applicant seeks a declaration that
          the respondent's title to a 2' strip of land
          adjacent to the east boundary of the
          applicant's property has been extinguished by
          sections 4 and 15 of the Limitations Act.
          The applicant alleges that she and her
          predecessors in title have been in open,
          notorious, continuous, peaceful and exclusive
          possession of that strip which they have used
          as part of their driveway since at least
          1973.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               There is no doubt that the area between
          the applicant's house at 47 Tecumseh Avenue
          and the respondent's property at 49 Tecumseh
          Avenue has been used as a driveway by the
          occupants of 47 Tecumseh Avenue since 1923.
          The factual question to be decided is whether
          that driveway encroached on the respondent's
          property at 49 Tecumseh Avenue for long
          enough to extinguish the respondent's title.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Clearly, the driveway encroached
          approximately 2' onto the property of 49
          Tecumseh Avenue after it was paved by the
          applicant in 1988.  Prior to that, the
          picture is less clear.  There are affidavits
          from various owners of 47 Tecumseh Avenue
          dating back to 1973 all attesting to the fact
          that the driveway encroached.  Indeed, one of
          the past owners of 49 Tecumseh Avenue says
          that the driveway encroached.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The respondent, however, had the
          property surveyed in 1985 when it purchased
          49 Tecumseh Avenue.  That survey which is
          dated January 15, 1985 clearly shows that the
          respondent's fence and hedge encroached on
          adjoining properties. However, it doesn't
          show any encroachment by the applicant's
          driveway on the respondent's property.
          Later, when the same surveyor surveyed the
          property on March 23rd, 1994, there was an
          encroachment by the applicant's driveway on
          the respondent's property and it is shown on
          the survey.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               While the anecdotal evidence in the
          affidavits filed by the applicant is of
          assistance, it is not sufficient to overcome
          the clear survey evidence in the survey of
          Donald Redmond of January 15th, 1985 that the
          encroachment did not exist at that time.
          Since the onus is on the applicant to
          establish the encroachment and possessory
          title, I find that the onus has not been met
          and the application is therefore
          dismissed....
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On the present application, the appellant seeks a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration that she is entitled to a prescriptive easement over</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two foot strip of land, a declaration that she is entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">maintain a right-of-way over the land or in the alternative a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration that she is entitled to a right-of-way by implication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">over the land in question. Although the respondent raised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue of estoppel, the motions judge did not find it necessary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decide the issue. He dismissed the application on the basis of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same findings of fact he had made on the earlier application.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In particular, he noted the 1985 survey and concluded as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the survey does not show any encroachment
          on the respondent's property and I am not
          satisfied that the area between the houses
          which the applicant and her predecessors in
          tittle used for parking encroached on the
          respondent's property before 1988 when the
          applicant covered the whole of the area with
          concrete.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On this appeal, the respondent relies on both res judicata</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and issue estoppel, two species of the doctrine of estoppel per</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rem judicatam. The two species are distinguished in Angle v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">M.N.R., [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248. Simply put, res judicata or &quot;cause</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of action estoppel&quot; precludes a person from bringing an action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against another when that same cause of action has been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determined in earlier proceedings by a court of competent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction. Issue estoppel will prevent a person from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relitigating a question where, the cause of action being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different, the same question was decided in a final judicial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision in earlier proceedings between the same parties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Res judicata

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The respondent does not contend that the cause of action is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same in both applications. Indeed, it is not. The respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relies rather on a wider principle, often treated as covered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plea of res judicata. The doctrine of res judicata, in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wider application, prevents a person from relying on a claim or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence which he or she had the opportunity of putting before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court in the earlier proceedings but failed to do so. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Maynard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Maynard, [1951] S.C.R. 346 (at 358-59 citing the often-quoted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">words of Wigram V.C. in Henderson v. Henderson, (1843) 67 E.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">313 (Eng. V.C.)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... where a given matter becomes the subject
          of litigation in and of adjudication by a
          court of competent jurisdiction, the Court
          requires the parties to that litigation to
          bring forward their whole case and will not
          (except under special circumstances) permit
          the same parties to open the same subject of
          litigation in respect of matter which might
          have been brought forward as part of the
          subject in contest, but which was not brought
          forward only because they have from
          negligence, inadvertence or even accident,
          omitted part of their case. The plea of res
          judicata applies, except in special cases,
          not only to points upon which the Court was
          actually required by the parties to form an
          opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to
          every point which properly belonged to the
          subject of litigation and which the parties,
          exercising reasonable diligence, might have
          brought forward at the time.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The court in Maynard also adopted the following excerpt in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Hoystead v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Commissioner of Taxation [[1926] A.C. 155 at 165] (at 359):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Parties are not permitted to begin fresh
          litigations because of new views they may
          entertain of the law of the case, or new
          versions which they present as to what should
          be a proper apprehension by the Court of the
          legal result either of the construction of
          the documents or the weight of certain
          circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               If this were permitted litigation would
          have no end, except when legal ingenuity is
          exhausted. It is a principle of law that this
          cannot be permitted, and there is abundant
          authority reiterating that principle.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The respondent argues that the subject-matter of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation was the same in both applications. In each application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant was seeking a remedy which would entitle her to use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two foot strip of land as part of her driveway. The evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied upon in support of each application, although different in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some respects, is essentially to the same effect. In these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, the respondent argues that it was incumbent upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant to bring forth all legal arguments arising from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same facts in the course of the first application. Having failed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to do so and having not appealed the 1995 decision, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent submits that the appellant is bound by the result. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot relitigate the matter on the basis of different legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arguments, which could have been advanced in the course of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The principles adopted in Maynard are informed on grounds of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public policy. For numerous reasons, it is in the public interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there be an end to proceedings. Duplicative proceedings give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rise to a concern for conflicting results and the use of limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resources. Issues of fairness also come into play. While no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual should be subjected to more than one proceeding for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same cause, no one should be unfairly denied access to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">courts. For this reason, the scope of the principle adopted by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the court in Maynard has been restricted in some cases.1  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of the doctrine of res judicata is also limited when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">special circumstances can be shown as to why the new proceeding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be allowed to proceed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Upon careful review of the material filed in support of each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application in this case, I am persuaded that the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position should be adopted. Although, in a strict legal sense, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different cause of action is advanced on this application, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant is in effect seeking an analogous remedy based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">virtually identical facts. In each application, the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">asserted a right to continue to use the two-strip of land on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's property as part of her driveway. It does not appear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it would make any practical difference to the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether this right was asserted by way of possessory title or by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way of prescriptive easement. On the facts as presented on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier application, it would have been open to advance not only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claim for possessory title but also, in the alternative, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim to a prescriptive easement. In my view, the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second application falls clearly within the scope of the doctrine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of res judicata in its wider application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] As stated earlier, the doctrine is nonetheless subject to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;special circumstances&quot; being shown which militate against its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application. The circumstances relied upon by the appellant are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   she relied on counsel on the earlier application to protect
     her rights;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   the application of the doctrine of res judicata would result
     in the merits of the second application not being heard; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   she would lose the use of her driveway.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In my view, these circumstances do not bring the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outside the scope of the doctrine on the facts of this case. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entire factual foundation for the claim to a prescriptive right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was equally present on the first application. In these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, it is incumbent upon the appellant to show that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her failure to raise that argument did not arise through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligence, inadvertence or accident. She has not done so. To</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allow her to proceed with the second application would, in my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, run counter to the public policy principles underlying the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doctrine.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Issue estoppel

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Further, it is my view that, even if the present application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, issue estoppel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would apply. In order to succeed on either application, it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">essential that the appellant establish that the land used as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">driveway included the disputed two foot strip of land. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge made a clear finding on this issue on the first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application. He held that the driveway included the two foot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strip of land since the time it was paved in 1988 but that &quot;prior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to that, the picture is less clear.&quot; In the end result, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion judge was not satisfied on the evidence that the use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the driveway included the strip of land before the area was paved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in 1988. This finding is equally adverse to the appellant's claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the present application. Having chosen not to appeal the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier decision, the appellant is bound by the findings of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions judge on this critical issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In light of my conclusion on the issues of res judicata and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue estoppel, I do not find it necessary to consider the merits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

at 646 (Alta C.A.) where a majority of the court interpreted the
principle in Henderson, as quoted above in Maynard, to be
Alimited to such matters as arise within one cause of action.&quot;
The court held that an inquiry into some facts did not prevent an
examination of the same facts in a second action so long as the
latter was separate and distinct from the first.</font></pre></td>
