    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This was an action brought by a commercial landlord against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the tenant for damages for &quot;overholding&quot; on a lease -- The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge framed the issue before the court as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The issue before me was
          whether the defendant was overholding on the
          lease, or whether the parties had come to a
          new arrangement between themselves, or
          whether the defendant was now a year to year
          tenant; and, depending on what terms were in
          place between the parties, how the damages
          were to be calculated.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The parties agree that the trial judge correctly framed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue. In our view the trial judge erred in concluding that, &quot;any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further written agreement&quot; necessarily required the parties to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enter into, as she put it, &quot;a new lease&quot; and that in the absence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a new lease or an agreement to lease the overholding provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge did find that :</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Y the only agreement reached by the
          parties was the rental rate of $12 which was
          not to be the rent under the written Lease
          but an interim rent until a written agreement
          was entered into about the renovations.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  This agreement was reduced to writing in the letter of June</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">14th, 1991 and was a &quot;a further written agreement&quot; within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of s. 9.04.  Accordingly, the trial judge's finding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the overholding provision applied cannot stand.



[5]  The trial judge stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    If I had not held that the
          overholding provision applied, I would have
          found that a yearly tenancy existed at a
          monthly rate of $16,400.75, as was eventually
          being paid by the parties. Given that the
          rent cheque for October 1993 was never cashed
          by Harvester, under this scenario, notice
          would be required to be given 6 months before
          the year end, namely the month of June. For
          the 8 month period in question, GE Capital
          would have owed $131,206. Plus the overhold
          of one month of $7,969.78, for a total of
          $139,175.78 with appropriate pre-judgment and
          post-judgment interest rates to apply as
          noted above.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  We agree that a yearly tenancy was created. For these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set aside and in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its place the appellants are ordered to pay to the respondent the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sum $139,175.78 plus pre-judgment interest.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  With respect to costs, we are of the view that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent should have its costs at trial. In view of the divided</font></pre>
