</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These appeals raise issues concerning costs awards in motor
vehicle accident cases where a plaintiff sues not only the
tortfeasor, but the plaintiff's own insurance company under  what
is known as the S.E.F. 44 endorsement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Background</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The plaintiff Vincent Mete was injured in a motor vehicle
accident in February, 1989.  He and claimants under the Family
Law Act brought two actions for damages:  one against the driver
of the other car (Dwyer), and one against the plaintiffs' own
insurer (Guardian) under an S.E.F. 44 endorsement for any damages
exceeding the limits of Dwyer's insurance.  The actions were
tried together.  Judgment was given by Kovacs J. on December 6,
1995 in favour of the plaintiffs for damages against Dwyer and
excess damages against Guardian.  No appeal is brought with
respect to liability for or the quantum of the damages awarded.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The issues arise in the context of the various settlement
offers made by the parties and the clause in the S.E.F. 44
endorsement which provides that coverage does not include any
amount with respect to costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The plaintiffs were awarded costs against Dwyer in the Dwyer
action and against Guardian in the Guardian action to May 25,
1995, the day after a mid-trial settlement conference.  The
plaintiffs' costs of both actions from May 25, 1995 to the end of
the trial were ordered paid by Guardian alone.  Notwithstanding
that the plaintiff obtained judgment for more than its offers to
settle, all costs were awarded only on the party-and-party scale,
not on the solicitor-client scale under Rule 49.10, because the
trial judge found that the injured plaintiff's dishonesty had
severely affected the length of the trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  All parties -- the plaintiffs, the tortfeasor and the
underinsurer -- were granted leave to appeal from the award of
costs.  The plaintiffs appeal on the issue of the scale of costs.
Both Dwyer and Guardian appeal on the issue of which defendant
should be liable for costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The standard S.E.F. 44 endorsement contained in the
plaintiffs' policy with Guardian provides coverage to the insured
up to the insured's own policy limit in the event the
tortfeasor's insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy the
damages award.  As above noted, the S.E.F. 44 provides that this
coverage does not include any amount with respect to costs.
Dwyer had only the statutory minimum insurance coverage of
$200,000, which amount is inclusive of interest, but exclusive of
costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The plaintiffs recovered judgment against Dwyer in the
amount of $737,207.73 and against Guardian in the amount of
$214,243.73, both sums including pre-judgment interest.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The following settlement offers were made prior to trial:
‚    On October 31, 1994, plaintiffs offered to settle with
     Guardian for $200,000, including interest plus costs.
‚    On November 1, 1994, plaintiffs offered to settle with Dwyer
for Dwyer's policy limits ($200,000) plus costs.
‚    On December 19, 1994, Dwyer offered his policy limits on
condition that the plaintiffs release Dwyer from all claims.  The
plaintiffs did not accept, taking the position that without
Guardian's consent, they could not accept this offer because of
the subrogation rights of Guardian, set out in the S.E.F. 44.
Guardian refused to waive its subrogation rights against Dwyer.
‚    On April 18, 1995, Guardian offered the plaintiffs $40,000
plus interest, but no costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  As no settlement was reached between any of the parties, the
trial commenced May 8, 1995.  Dwyer contested liability for the
accident and Guardian claimed that the plaintiff had missed the
limitation period for suing it under S.E.F. 44; both defendants
contested damages.  On consent, a mid-trial settlement conference
took place on May 24, 1995.  The plaintiffs were prepared to
settle both actions for the total sum of $320,000 plus costs.
Dwyer offered to pay, in addition to his policy limits (up to an
additional $25,000), any sum Guardian offered in addition to
Guardian's previous offer of $40,000 plus interest.  Guardian
made no further offer, and did not respond to the plaintiffs' or
Dwyer's offers.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] As indicated above, the result at trial exceeded the offer
made by the plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Legislation and Rules Governing the Awarding of Costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] All of these appeals involve some aspect of the exercise of
the trial judge's discretion in awarding costs.  It is therefore
useful to set out the relevant provisions governing this
discretion.   A trial judge has great discretion in awarding
costs.  The court's jurisdiction is found in s. 131(1) of the
Courts of Justice Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43), which provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          131(1)  Subject to the provisions of an Act
          or rules of court, the costs of and
          incidental to a proceeding or a step in a
          proceeding are in the discretion of the
          court, and the court may determine by whom
          and to what extent the costs shall be paid.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rule 57 is the primary costs provision in the Rules of Civil
Procedure.  Rule 57.01 sets out a non-exhaustive list of the
factors that may be considered by the trial judge in exercising
that discretion, as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          57.01(1)    In exercising its discretion
          under section 131 of the Courts of Justice
          Act to award costs, the court may consider,
          in addition to the result in the proceeding
          and any offer to settle made in writing,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  the amount claimed and the amount
          recovered in the proceeding;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  the apportionment of liability;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  the complexity of the proceeding;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  the importance of the issues;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (e)  the conduct of any party that tended to
               shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the
               duration of the proceeding;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (f)  whether any step in the proceeding was,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (i)  improper, vexatious or unnecessary,
                    or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (ii)      taken through negligence,
                    mistake or excessive caution;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (g)  a party's denial of or refusal to admit
               anything that should have been admitted;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (h)  whether it is appropriate to award any
               costs or more than one set of costs
               where a party,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (i)  commenced separate proceedings for
                    claims that  should have been made
                    in one proceeding, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (ii)      in defending a proceeding
                    separated unnecessarily from
                    another party in the same interest
                    or defended by a different
                    solicitor; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)       any other matter relevant to the
               question of costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  The fact that a party is successful in a
          proceeding or a step in a proceeding does not
          prevent the court from awarding costs against
          the party in a proper case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)  In awarding costs, the court may fix all
          or part of the costs with or without
          reference to the Tariffs, instead of
          referring them for assessment, and where the
          costs are not fixed, they may be assessed
          under Rule 58.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (4)  Nothing in this rule or rules 57.02 to
          57.07 affects the authority of the court
          under section 131 of the Courts of Justice
          Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (a)  to award or refuse costs in respect
                    of a particular issue or part of a
                    proceeding;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               b)   to award a percentage of assessed
                    costs or award assessed costs up to
                    or from a particular stage of a
                    proceeding; or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (c)  to award all or part of the costs
                    on a solicitor and client basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finally, Rule 49.10 sets out the costs consequences of failure to
accept a reasonable offer:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Plaintiff's Offer</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The three appeals raise six issues, which I will address in
the following order:
     (1)   Plaintiffs' Appeal
     Whether the plaintiffs were entitled to solicitor-and-client
costs for the period following their offers to settle.
     (2)  Defendant Guardian's Appeal
          (a)  Whether the court is bound by the provisions of
               the S.E.F. 44 endorsement, such that the trial
               judge does not have discretion to order costs to
               the insured against the defendant underinsurer.
          (b)  Whether the underinsurer's right of subrogation
               includes the right to subrogate for costs, in the
               event that such an award can be made against it.
          (c)  The proper commencement date for the calculation
               of interest on the costs award.
     (3)  Defendant Dwyer's Appeal
          (a)  Whether the defendant Dwyer should be liable for
               costs between his December 19, 1994 and May 25,
               1995 offers to settle.
          (b)  Whether Guardian should be liable for Dwyer's
               costs after his offer to settle in December, 1994.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1)  Scale of Costs to the Plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] As above indicated, on October 31 and November 1, 1994, the
plaintiff delivered offers to settle to the defendants Guardian
and Dwyer respectively.  These offers complied with all the
requirements of Rule 49.10, and were for less than the plaintiff
recovered at trial from each defendant.  The plaintiff thus
became entitled, pursuant to that rule, to be awarded costs from
the date of the offers on the solicitor-and-client scale, &quot;unless
the court orders otherwise&quot;.  Kovacs J. did order otherwise, and
awarded the plaintiffs' costs on the party-and-party scale, on
the basis that the plaintiff's dishonesty had severely affected
the length of the trial.  This is one of the factors to be
considered by a judge in making a costs award, as set out in Rule
57.01(1)(e).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The trial judge stated his reasons in this regard, at pp. 8-
9, as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The plaintiffs may, subject to the court's
          discretion, have solicitor and client costs
          under R. 49.10 as against the defendant Dwyer
          after their offer of November 1, 1994, and as
          against the defendant &quot;Guardian&quot; after
          October 31, 1994.  The issue is whether the
          plaintiff, Vincent Mete, by his conduct,
          tended &quot;to lengthen unnecessarily the
          duration of the proceeding&quot; under R. 57.01(1)
          and thus be deprived of  some of his costs.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I made lengthy findings of credibility
          against the plaintiff Vincent Mete and I
          found he exaggerated his symptoms.  That is
          conduct which lengthens not merely the trial
          but the &quot;proceedings&quot; [which is the word used
          in R. 57.01(1)].  In those circumstances I
          find the plaintiff Vincent Mete is not
          entitled to the solicitor and client costs he
          would have been otherwise entitled to against
          both defendants under Rule 49.  The other
          plaintiffs' claims took but a short time to

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] An appeal court will not lightly interfere with a trial
judge's exercise of discretion, in awarding costs or otherwise,
and will only do so in very limited circumstances.  As stated by
Lamer C.J., in relation to the exercise of a trial judge's
discretion generally, in Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian
Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 32:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This discretionary determination should not
          be taken lightly by reviewing courts. It was
          [the trial judge's] discretion to exercise,
          and unless he considered irrelevant factors,
          failed to consider relevant factors, or
          reached an unreasonable conclusion, then his
          decision should be respected.  To quote Lord
          Diplock in Hadmor Productions Ltd. v.
          Hamilton, [1982] 1 All E.R. 1042, at p. 1046,
          an appellate court &quot;must defer to the judge's
          exercise of his discretion and must not
          interfere with it merely on the ground that
          the members of the appellate court would have
          exercised the discretion differently&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In order for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the costs
awarded by Kovacs J., the appellant must demonstrate that he
erred in principle in the exercise of his discretion.  The
plaintiff argues that the awarding of costs on the party-and-
party scale in this case was an inappropriate exercise of the
judge's discretion, amounting to an error in principle, and that
costs should be awarded, from the date of its offers to settle,
on the solicitor-client scale.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The plaintiff's main argument involves the purpose of Rule
49 - encouraging the making and acceptance of realistic offers to
settle - and the proposition that while Rule 49 does provide that
a court may order otherwise, resort should only be had to the
exception in rare and exceptional circumstances, analogous to
those required to award solicitor-client scale costs in cases
that do not fall within Rule 49.  Morden J.A., writing for the
Court of Appeal on the use of the exception in Niagara Structural
Steel (St. Catharines) Ltd. v. W.D. Laflamme Ltd. (1987), 58 O.R.
(2d) 773 at 777, stated that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The general, or basic, rule contained in rule
          49.10(1) is intended to be an incentive to
          the settlement of litigation. While rule
          49.10(1) does not set forth the basis for
          resorting to the exception to it, it is
          reasonable to assume that the occasions for
          the application of the exception should not
          be so widespread or common that the result
          would be that the general rule is no longer,
          in fact, the general rule. If this were to
          happen, the presumption in favour of the
          general rule and the resulting reasonable
          degree of predictability respecting the
          incidence of costs would disappear and the
          incentive policy of the rule would be
          substantially frustrated. Another consequence
          would be a more uneven application of the
          rule in litigation generally.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               As far as the occasions for resort to
          the exception are concerned, if the framers
          of the rules could have expressed the
          relevant bases or factors with any degree of
          comprehensive detail it may be assumed that
          this would have been done.  Accordingly, it
          would be wrong, for several reasons, to
          attempt to do so by judicial declaration.
          Keeping the matter on a general plane, it can
          be said that resort should only be had to the
          exception where, after giving proper weight
          to the policy of the general rule, and the
          importance of reasonable predictability and
          the even application of the rule, the
          interests of justice require a departure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The reason given by Kovacs J. for refusing to award costs on
the higher scale was solely the dishonesty of the plaintiff,
which significantly lengthened the trial and thereby increased
costs for all parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] I note that it was not merely negative findings of
credibility against the plaintiff which caused the learned trial
judge to make the award he did.  Rather, the plaintiff was shown
to have acted dishonestly in many respects, which made his every
assertion and claim suspect and worthy of challenge.  The trial
judge found that the plaintiff Vincent Mete was &quot;blatantly
dishonest.&quot;  To cite one example from the evidence, the plaintiff
Vincent Mete failed to advise his disability insurer of a $23,000
disability payment he received from the Canada Pension Plan.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] As was conceded during argument, another approach would have
been for the trial judge to make the award on the solicitor-
client scale, while at the same time reducing the number of days
to be allowed for counsel fees, from a 26 day trial to, say, a 10
or 16 day trial, to reflect that the actions of the plaintiff
significantly lengthened the duration of the trial.  Such an
award would have had the same rationale and the same effect, and
would have been within the range of options available within the
trial judge's discretion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In my view, the award made was a legitimate exercise of the
trial judge's discretion, and no error in principle occurred.  I
would dismiss the plaintiffs' appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2a) Award of Costs Against the Underinsurer - The S.E.F. 44
Endorsement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] This was the most important legal issue in this appeal.  The
defendant Guardian raised the argument that clause 5(e) of the
S.E.F. 44 Endorsement precludes the awarding of costs against the
underinsurer.  The clause provides that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In determining any amounts an eligible
          claimant is legally entitled to recover from
          an inadequately insured motorist as defined
          in paragraph 1(e)(i), no amount shall be
          included with respect to costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] It was conceded by all counsel that the court cannot be
bound in this regard by anything other than &quot;an Act or rules of
court&quot; as stated in s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act.
Nevertheless, the issue involves a point of law on which there
are apparently conflicting decisions by judges of the Ontario
Court, and clarification is therefore required.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The S.E.F. 44 Endorsement is not a legislative provision,
nor is it a policy of insurance prescribed by legislation; it is
a standard form which is included in an insurance policy to
provide additional coverage.  While it is approved by Ontario's
Superintendent of Insurance for use by the insurance industry, it
does not have the effect of legislation or of a regulation made
pursuant to an Act of the Legislature.  The legal status of the
S.E.F. 44 is the same as any other private contract, and as such
cannot be binding on the court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Clause 4(a) of the S.E.F. 44 endorsement provides that the
coverage provided is for &quot;damages.&quot;  Thus, it is clear that the
endorsement itself only covers damages, and does not as a matter
of course cover the insured for costs of an action to recover
damages against the underinsured motorist.  The purpose of
underinsured motorist coverage is to indemnify the insured
plaintiff for damages, not to indirectly indemnify the
underinsured tortfeasor against costs.  However, in a case such
as this one where the underinsurer was an active party in
defending the action, and where the matter could have been
settled at the mid-trial settlement conference or earlier had the
underinsurer agreed to waive its subrogation rights against the
tortfeasor or to contribute an amount ultimately less than the
amount awarded at trial, the clause cannot be used to fetter the
court's discretion to award costs against the underinsurer as a
party to the action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In the S.E.F. 44, the insured is agreeing that the policy
only covers damages, and does not cover its costs as against the
tortfeasor.  The insured should not be said to be agreeing, when
having to bring an action against its own insurer to recover
under the policy, that the insurer is immune from an order for
costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] As stated by Haines J. in Churchill v. Wilson (1 June 1993),
London No. 4511/89 (Gen. Div.):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The clear intention of paragraph 5(e) of the
          S.E.F. 44 Endorsement is to ensure that the
          S.E.F. 44 carrier is not burdened with the
          costs properly payable by the insurer of the
          &quot;inadequately insured motorist.&quot;  It is not
          intended to relieve the S.E.F. 44 carrier of
          its obligations concerning costs in the
          normal course.  As a party to the action the
          S.E.F. 44 carrier assumes the same risks and
          benefits attendant to the rules and
          principles relating to costs as any other
          party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] As indicated above, Kovacs J. awarded costs in each action
against the defendants, Dwyer and Guardian, until May 25, 1995,
the day after the settlement conference, and the costs of both
actions against Guardian from that day onward.  He found that
&quot;[a]fter the mid-trial settlement conference of May 24, 1995, in
my view, the position of 'Guardian' was unreasonable and
prevented a settlement which was well below the judgment
granted.&quot;  Kovacs J. was very much aware of paragraph 5(e), which
Guardian argued before him, and of the conflicting decisions
regarding its effect.  He analysed the decisions and concluded
that it was within his discretion to award costs against Guardian
as a party to the action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Kovacs J. made reference to three cases that bear directly
on this issue:  Re Haasz (1959), 21 D.L.R. (2d) 764 (Ont. C.A.),
Guertin v. Dionne (1993), 19 C.C.L.I. (2d) 303 (Ont.Gen.Div.),
and Darling v. Kay (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 299 (Gen.Div.).  In Re
Haasz, Laidlaw J.A., writing for the majority, considered the
effect of the costs provision found in s. 78(1) of the Judicature
Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 190), which was in substance identical to
the current s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act.  He said at
p. 767:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          That section means precisely what it says.
          It means that a Court or a Judge should have
          absolute discretion over all costs within
          their jurisdiction, subject only to the
          express provision of any statute ... .  The
          exercise of the discretion vested in the
          Court or a Judge by s. 78 of the Judicature
          Act is not subject to the consent of parties
          in proceedings, and no such consent can
          fetter the Court or a Judge.  To so hold
          would mean that in proceedings authorized to
          be taken in Court or before a Judge, the
          parties can by their consent usurp the
          function and power of a Court or Judge.  I
          express the firm opinion, free from all
          doubt, that a Judge cannot be bound by such a
          consent nor by any other means except the
          express provisions of a statute, and if he
          holds himself so bound he is not exercising
          the discretion vested in him by law.  It is
          both the right and the duty of a Judge to
          exercise that discretion, and he cannot
          abdicate the right or abandon the duty.  If a
          Judge omits or refuses to exercise the
          discretion intended by law to be exercised by
          him or permits a consent of parties or their
          counsel to be substituted in place thereof,
          he does not perform his duty and the question
          left to his discretion is not determined in
          accordance with the law.  It is right and
          proper that a Judge should give great weight
          and consideration to any consent of parties
          or counsel acting on their behalf, but such
          consent does not discharge him from the duty
          to exercise his discretion according to the
          particular circumstances in each case.
          [Citations omitted.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] The defendant Guardian relied on Guertin, which also
concerned an underinsured tortfeasor and the plaintiff's own
insurer.  In that case, Maloney J. was asked by way of a special
case to decide which insurer should pay the plaintiff's costs
after the action had been settled.  He found that in the case
before him paragraph 5(e) of the S.E.F. 44 did relieve the
underinsurer from liability for costs, and ordered the costs of
the action to be paid by the defendant tortfeasor's insurer.
Kovacs J. distinguished Guertin,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...as there was a settlement in that case and
          there was no suggestion of conduct of a party
          precluding an award of costs.  I distinguish
          it also as the court did not consider whether
          there was an overriding principle that the
          underinsurer was not liable for costs when
          unnecessary costs were incurred by the
          underinsurer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In my view, Guertin does not go as far as was submitted by
Guardian.  I note that the Guertin case was settled after eight
days of trial.  There is no finding by Maloney J. that the
underinsurer drove the litigation or refused to settle when it
should have or could have on a reasonable basis.  Before the
trial in Guertin, all parties agreed on a limit to the
plaintiffs' recovery at $1,000,000 plus party and party costs and
significantly, the underinsurer agreed to waive its subrogation
rights against the tortfeasor.  Further, it does not appear that
any party suggested that Maloney J. did not have the power to
award costs against the underinsurer in the face of clause 5(e).
On the contrary, it appears that the parties conceded that
Maloney J. did have the discretionary power to award costs
against the underinsurer, although such was not so stated in the
reasons.  There is no reference in the decision to s. 131(1) of
the Courts of Justice Act indicating that Maloney J. was not
asked to determine the underlying question of the impact, if any,
of section 5(e) on the court's discretion to award costs against
the underinsurer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] Finally, nowhere in his reasons does Maloney J. suggest that
section 5(e) of S.E.F. 44 as a matter of law removes the court's
discretion, preventing the court from making an order against the
underinsurer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The Darling case was decided a month after Guertin, without
reference to it, and Hockin J. framed the issue as whether the
judge's discretion to award costs can be fettered by anything
other than &quot;an Act or rules of court.&quot;  After quoting the above
passage from Re Haasz, he concluded that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Since the endorsement and, specifically, the
          attempt by the insurer to avoid costs as set
          out in para. 5(e) does not carry with it the
          weight of legislative authority, the
          jurisdiction of this court to award costs
          with respect to any action commenced under
          this endorsement remains intact.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He then considered whether on the facts costs should be awarded
against the underinsurer and concluded that they should be, based
on the fact that it was unsuccessful in the action and taking
into account the factors set out in Rule 57.01.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] In my view, this is the correct approach, and it was
followed at trial by Kovacs J.  He made no error in principle and
the award is not assailable on this ground.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2b) Subrogation for Costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Guardian argued that, if it is ordered to pay costs, it
should be able to include those costs in its subrogated claim
against the tortfeasor, the defendant Dwyer.  I disagree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The underinsurer's right of subrogation against the
tortfeasor, Dwyer, is found in clause 9 of the S.E.F. 44:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Where a claim is made under this
          endorsement, the Insurer is subrogated to the
          rights of the eligible claimant by whom a
          claim is made, and may maintain an action in
          the name of that person against the
          inadequately insured motorist...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] In effect, therefore, the underinsurer is entitled to be
subrogated only for the damages payable to the insured under the
S.E.F. 44.  The insured is not entitled to costs under the S.E.F.
44 endorsement, even though, as held above, in litigation the
court may, in exercising its discretion, award costs to the
insured against the underinsurer, notwithstanding the S.E.F. 44.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] More significantly, allowing a subrogated claim for costs
would indirectly fetter the discretion of the court to award
costs against the proper party, and thwart the main purpose of a
costs award, which is to indemnify a successful party and place
the liability for costs on the party responsible for the
incurring of those costs.  Kovacs J. determined that Guardian's
conduct during the proceedings warranted a costs award against
it, and specifically ordered,  &quot;that there be no right of
&gt;Guardian' to claim against Dwyer personally for its costs.&quot;  He
did not state this as a matter of principle, but his order is a
sound one.  Having determined on the one hand that a court has
the power to award costs appropriate to the circumstances of the
case, allowing costs to be subrogated would render this power
meaningless.  It was the conduct of Guardian as a party that
attracted the award of costs against it; Guardian ought not to be
able to then claim those costs against the tortfeasor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] There is also no reason why a certain class of litigant -
here an underinsurer - should be immune from a costs order.  Had
Guardian been successful in keeping the plaintiff's claim for
damages within the policy limits of the tortfeasor, it would not
likely have been liable for costs at all.  Had Guardian agreed to
settle and waived its subrogation rights against Dwyer, all
parties would have incurred lower costs. The underinsurer was a
prime party to the litigation and it ought to be exposed, like
any other litigant, to the costs consequences. To hold otherwise
would be to allow a litigant to prolong the proceedings with
impunity and, even if unsuccessful, not face a costs award.  I
would dismiss this aspect of Guardian's appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2c) Commencement Date of Interest on Costs Award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] Guardian submitted that interest on the costs award should
not begin to run until the date of the assessment, since it was
the plaintiff's appeal of the costs order that delayed the
assessment.  The trial judge specifically considered the issue of
the commencement date of interest on the costs award, and ordered
that interest on costs would run from one month following the
release of his reasons as to costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Section 129(1) of the Courts of Justice Act provides the
answer.  It reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Money owing under an order, including costs
          to be assessed or costs fixed by the court,
          bears interest at the post judgment interest
          rate, calculated from the date of the order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This wording is clear and unambiguous, and the defendants in this
case were actually given a 30 day grace period.  There was no
error in principle.  I would dismiss this aspect of Guardian's
appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3a) Dwyer's Liability for Costs After December 1994 Offer to
Settle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] The defendant Dwyer argued that he should not be liable for
costs after his offer to settle for his policy limits plus costs,
made in December 1994, as it was substantially the same as his
offer made at the mid-trial settlement conference in May, 1995.
The learned trial judge ordered him to pay costs of the action
against him until the day after the settlement conference.   In
his reasons, Kovacs J. addressed this issue:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The defendant Dwyer is not entitled to costs
          after December 14, 1994, when his insurer
          offered the policy limits, provided the
          plaintiffs gave a full release to Dwyer.
          While the plaintiffs made an offer to settle
          to Dwyer for his policy limits, it became
          clear the plaintiffs had not considered
          &quot;Guardian's&quot; subrogation rights against
          Dwyer. Counsel for Dwyer pointed out to the
          plaintiffs the action against Dwyer could not
          be settled as proposed without settlement of
          the &quot;Guardian&quot; action and Guardian's release
          of its subrogation claim.  At that point,
          considering the evidence the defendant
          &quot;Guardian&quot; had (i.e. surveillance evidence,
          the medical evidence of its own experts, and
          the outstanding issue of its limitation
          defence), &quot;Guardian&quot; was not unreasonable in
          insisting on its right of subrogation in
          respect to its offer to contribute $40,000.00
          plus interest and no costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Clearly, Kovacs J. concluded that the scene changed between
December, 1994 and May, 1995.  There is no error in principle in
the trial judge's exercise of his discretion.  The defendant's
offer of December, 1994 included the condition that the plaintiff
release him from all further claims, which the trial judge
rightly concluded was a condition that the plaintiff could not
then agree to.  I would dismiss this aspect of Dwyer's appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3b) Dwyer's Claim for Costs Against Guardian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] The defendant Dwyer also argued that the defendant Guardian
should pay his costs after his offer to settle of December, 1994.
The trial judge found, as noted above, that Guardian was not
unreasonable in its refusal to waive its subrogation rights
against Dwyer at that time.  He gave extensive consideration to
the issue of which party should pay costs, at which stage and in
what proportion.  He relieved Dwyer of responsibility for the
plaintiff's costs after the settlement conference, at which point
he found that Guardian's position had become unreasonable.  He
denied Guardian the right to subrogate for its costs against
Dwyer.  It is clear from the reasons of the trial judge that he
took all the relevant factors into account in making his award of
