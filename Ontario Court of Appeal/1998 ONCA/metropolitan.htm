[1]  The Condominium Corporation appeals from the dismissal of
its application for an order requiring the unit owner to sell
his unit. That aspect of the appeal must be dismissed.
Assuming, without deciding, that the court has jurisdiction to
make such an order, as is argued by the Corporation, relying
on s. 49(2) of the Condominium Act, there is insufficient
evidence in the record before us to justify such an extreme
remedy.

[2]  Counsel for the Corporation asserts, and the unit owner
agrees, that the Corporation and its agents are entitled to
reasonable access to the unit for the purposes of assessing
the need for, and the carrying out of, repairs for which the
Corporation is responsible. The need for such assessment and,
if necessary, repairs, to unit 608, with respect to plumbing
and sound, has been made out.

[3]  The access to which the Corporation and its agents are
entitled is only for such period as is reasonably necessary to
carry out the repairs. Counsel for the Corporation conceded
that, during this period, reasonable alternative accommodation
should be provided to the unit owner and his immediate family
at the expense of the Corporation. We agree. Such
accommodation should commence the day before, and end the day
after, access is required.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appeal is allowed in part. The order below is varied
so as to give effect to these reasons. There will be no order
as to costs.</font></pre></td>
