</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant appeals from his conviction on a charge of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">robbery. He was convicted following a trial by judge and jury and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was sentenced to thirty-four months' imprisonment in addition to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seven months of pre-trial custody. Identification of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was the main issue at trial. The Crown's case against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant essentially rested upon the testimony of one Ms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lackie.  Ms. Lackie, an eyewitness who was with the complainant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the time of the robbery, claimed to recognize the appellant as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one of the assailants. The appellant did not testify. However, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advanced a defence of alibi through his parents who testified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he was at home in his room with the door shut throughout the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant period.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal. First, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argues that the trial judge violated s.4(6) of the Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 by commenting on the failure of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant to testify. Second, he submits that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in not permitting the defence to cross-examine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eyewitness on the underlying facts of her criminal record.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finally, he submits that the trial judge erred in failing to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direct the jury on the dangers inherent in eyewitness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identification.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In my view, the appeal must succeed on each ground.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   Comment on the failure of the appellant to testify
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Section 4(6) of the Canada Evidence Act provides as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The failure of the person charged, or of the
          wife or husband of that person, to testify
          shall not be made the subject of comment by
          the judge or by counsel for the prosecution.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Notwithstanding this provision, the trial judge instructed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury that they were entitled to draw an adverse inference from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the failure of the appellant to testify in support of his alibi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence in these terms:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               An alibi is testimony which supports the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          accused's evidence that he did not commit the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          offence on trial because he or she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          somewhere else at the time.  Where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          supporting evidence is led but the accused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          does not testify or submit himself to cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          examine on that evidence, the jury is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          entitled to draw the inference that the alibi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          is untrue.  This is an exception to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          general rule that every accused person is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          entitled to sit silent and require the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          prosecution to prove its case against him, if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          it can.  A plea of not guilty is not the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          as sworn testimony from the accused as to his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          whereabouts at the time of the crime.  On</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          this issue there is no testimony from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          accused as to where he was at the time of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          robbery in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It is open to the jury, if you so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          decide, to draw an inference that because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          accused did not testify, the testimony of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          supporting witnesses, [the parents of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          appellant], is not credible or,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          alternatively, not reliable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Nevertheless, you need not necessarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          draw that inference.  You are equally able to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          accept the evidence and thus accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          alibi....

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Despite s.4(6),  the trial judge was of the view that, based</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on case law, he was entitled to charge the jury on the inference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that could be drawn from the appellant's failure to testify.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R .v. Noble (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 385, the Supreme Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered the evidentiary significance of the failure of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused to testify. Sopinka J., writing for the majority, held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that a trier of fact, whether judge or jury, cannot draw an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adverse inference from the silence of the accused. The accused's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">silence can not be used as a piece of inculpatory evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contributing to a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impermissibility of using silence as inculpatory evidence was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">held to be a principle flowing from the right to silence and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presumption of innocence. Sopinka J. did, however, recognize a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited exception to this principle in the case of alibi. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">noted that it has been recognized in other cases that alibi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defences create exceptions to the right to silence. At p.433,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sopinka J. concluded that:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... in the case where the defence of alibi is
          advanced, the trier of fact may draw an
          adverse inference from the failure of the
          accused to testify and subject him - or
          herself to cross-examination.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge in this case, appears to have interpreted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the carved out exception to the general rule, the alibi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exception, as creating an exception to the rule of prohibited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comment under s.4(6). This is not so.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Section 4(6) of the Canada Evidence Act prohibits a judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from commenting to the jury on the failure of an accused to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testify. From a reading of Noble in its entirety, it is clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that this is entirely separate and distinct from the question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when a trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure of an accused to testify. One is a blanket prohibition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against comments and the other is a general rule, with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exceptions, as to what inferences can be drawn.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In Noble, Sopinka J. made express reference to s.4(6). He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">noted that s.4(6) prohibits the trial judge from giving the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions on inferences that can not be drawn from the silence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the accused. He stated as follows (at 424-25):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ....Section 4(6) whose validity is not at
          issue in the present case, prevents a trial
          judge from commenting on the silence of the
          accused. The trial judge is therefore
          prevented from instructing the jury on the
          impermissibility of using silence to take the
          case against the accused to one that proves
          guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...Because of s.4(6) and the absence of
          reasons, there is no practical way of
          preventing the jury from drawing an improper
          inference from silence. The fact that the
          jury is permitted to do so does not elevate
          the use of silence to a principle of law
          which should be extended to all triers of
          fact. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  While Sopinka J. makes no further reference to s.4(6), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">same reasoning clearly applies to the alibi exception to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general rule. One has to conclude that, by reason of s.4(6), &quot;the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge is therefore prevented from instructing the jury on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the [permissibility] of using silence to take the case against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the accused to one that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in cases of alibi. The constitutional validity of s.4(6) was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at issue in Noble. The principles set out by the court cannot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serve to repeal s.4(6).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Crown counsel concedes that s.4(6) is still applicable but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argues that there was no contravention of the section in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, or that, alternatively, the court should not give effect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this ground of appeal in the circumstances of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The Crown first argues that the trial judge's charge did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitute a &quot;comment&quot; on the failure to testify within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of s.4(6).  The Crown submits that the instruction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">related solely to the alibi evidence and did not suggest that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant used his silence &quot;as a cloak for his guilt.&quot;1 I cannot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accept this argument. Simply put, it is my view that, if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge's charge does not constitute a &quot;comment&quot; on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure to testify within the meaning of s.4(6),  I don't know</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what would.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Second, the Crown submits that, even if the charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contravened s.4(6),  the court  should apply the curative proviso</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. It is argued that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It is submitted that, in effect, the trial judge simply told the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury that which the Supreme Court in Noble has confirmed they can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">do in determining whether they are satisfied beyond a reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt of the accused's guilt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In response, counsel for the appellant referred to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of the Supreme Court of California in Griffin v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">California, 380 U.S. 609 (1964). In Griffin, a federal prosecutor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had commented on the defendant's failure to testify as to matters</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which he could reasonably be expected to deny or explain because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of facts within his knowledge. An argument was made that such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comment did not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution because, it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argued, the inference of guilt for failure to testify as to those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts is, in any event, natural and irresistible. The court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected that argument and stated as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          What the jury may infer, given no help from
          the court, is one thing. What it may infer
          when the court solemnizes the silence of the
          accused into evidence against him is quite
          another. (at 614)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] I find those comments apposite to this case. The appellant,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in choosing not to testify, can expect that a jury may draw an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adverse inference against him. However, by reason of the express</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision under s.4(6), he is assured that no greater weight will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be placed upon his failure to testify by reason of a comment by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the prosecutor or the judge.  Here, the judge's instructions were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">potentially devastating to the defence.  I would therefore give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect to this ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   Cross-examination on underlying facts of the criminal
          record
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] As indicated earlier, Ms. Lackie's testimony was the only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that connected the appellant to the offence. It was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence's position at trial that the witness was lying about her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">identification of the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">robbery. The defence argued further that, in light of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness's criminal record and her use of illegal narcotics, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was an unsavoury witness who should not be believed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] During her examination-in- chief, Ms. Lackie admitted the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criminal record put to her by Crown counsel.  Her record</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">includes: narcotic offences; failing to appear in court;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">communicating for the purpose of prostitution; fraud;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intimidation; and obstructing a peace officer. In an attempt to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impugn Ms. Lackie's credibility, the defence sought to cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examine her on the underlying facts of some of the convictions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The trial judge quickly intervened and ruled that defence counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could go into &quot;the fact of a conviction&quot; but not into &quot;the facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of all the convictions&quot;. Defence counsel sought to rely on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of this court in R. v. Gonzague (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">505. The trial judge indicated that he was aware of this decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but maintained his ruling.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In Gonzague, one of the grounds of appeal was the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge's refusal to permit defence to cross-examine a crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness with respect to fifteen pending charges of fraud. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court held that this was an error (at pp. 510-11):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Clearly, the fact that a person is charged
          with an offence cannot degrade his character
          or impair his credibility, but an ordinary
          witness, unlike an accused, may be cross-
          examined with respect to misconduct on
          unrelated matters which has not resulted in a
          conviction: see R. v. Davison, DeRosie and
          MacArthur (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 424 at
          pp. 443-4, 6 O.R. (2d) 103. Consequently,
          counsel was entitled to cross-examine the
          witness, Charbonneau, on the facts underlying
          the 15 charges of fraud in order to impeach
          his credibility.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Crown counsel takes the position that generally, a party is</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discreditable conduct and associations, where that misconduct has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resulted in a criminal conviction.  However, the particulars of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the conviction (i.e. the name of the offence, the date and place</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of conviction, and the sentence imposed) will usually suffice to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convey the relevant misconduct to the trier of fact.  The Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore submits that there is no general right to cross-examine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a witness on the facts underlying a criminal conviction. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argued, rather, that the defence is limited under s. 12 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada Evidence Act to question the witness on the particulars of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the conviction only.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In my view, Crown counsel's position is not supported by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either the wording of s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act or by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant case law. It is my view that the trial judge erred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limiting the scope of the cross-examination as he did.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] It should be noted firstly that s. 12 of the Canada Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act is permissive in its terms and not restrictive. It reads as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          12.  (1)  A witness may be questioned as to
          whether the witness has been convicted of any
          offence, excluding any offence designated as
          a contravention under the Contraventions Act,
          but including such an offence where the
          conviction was entered after a trial on an
          indictment.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1.1)  If the witness either denies the fact
          or refuses to answer, the opposite party may
          prove the conviction.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  A conviction may be proved by producing
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             (a) a certificate containing the
                 substance and effect only, omitting
                 the formal part, of the indictment
                 and conviction, if it is for an
                 indictable offence, or a copy of the
                 summary conviction, if it is for an
                 offence punishable upon summary
                 conviction, purporting to be signed
                 by the clerk of the court or other
                 officer having the custody of the
                 records of the court in which the
                 conviction, if on indictment, was
                 had, or to which the conviction, if
                 summary, was returned; and
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             (b) proof of identity.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hence, s. 12 allows for the proof of previous convictions even</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where such fact would be collateral and inadmissible under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general rules of evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In R. v. Davison, DeRosie and MacArthur, this court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered s.12 in the case of an accused witness and concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(at p.442) that there were limitations imposed &quot;with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the cross-examination of an accused which do not apply in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case of an ordinary witness.&quot; [Emphasis added.]  The court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expressed the limitation in the case of an accused person as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows (at 443):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             The use that may be made of prior
          convictions allowed to be proved by the
          provisions of s.12 of the Canada Evidence Act
          is confined to the issue of credibility
          unless the acts constituting the basis of
          such convictions are also admissible under
          the doctrine of similar acts or otherwise to
          show that the accused is guilty of the
          offence with which he is charged.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The court then expressly stated (at 443) that this principle was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not intended to &quot;cast doubt on the well-established principle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that an ordinary witness may be cross-examined with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discreditable conduct and associations, unrelated to the subject-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter of his testimony, as a ground for disbelieving his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence (Phipson on Evidence, 11th ed. (1970), at p. 654), but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was rather ... a principle peculiarly applicable to an accused.&quot;2

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] In R. v. Gassyt and Markowitz (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 546</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court recently drew the distinction between cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination of a witness on the existence of an outstanding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge and cross-examination on the underlying facts of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge. Cross-examination on the fact that a charge is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outstanding will not be permitted without a proper foundation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being laid to establish its relevance. However, the court noted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(at p. 560) that &quot;Cross-examination on any facts underlying an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outstanding charge is a different matter.&quot; The court reiterated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the principle set out in earlier cases in these words (also at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">560):

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In any case, an ordinary witness, unlike an
          accused, may be cross-examined on the
          underlying facts to the extent that these
          facts may be relevant to the witness's
          credibility or to another issue in the trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In my view, there is no reason to limit the scope of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cross-examination of a non-accused witness where the conduct has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resulted in a criminal conviction.  On the contrary, the fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the conduct has resulted in a criminal conviction will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">usually enhance the probative  value of the cross-examination.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] It is clear, of course, that the right to cross-examine a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness on the underlying facts of a conviction is subject to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge's general discretion.  It must be limited within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bounds of relevance and propriety.3  In this case, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence counsel was not allowed to cross-examine on any of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">underlying facts of the convictions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Crown counsel argues that the cross-examination in this case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was nonetheless sufficient to convey to the jury Ms. Lackie's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior discreditable conduct as it related to her credibility.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">am unable to agree. Given the importance of Ms. Lackie's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testimony against the appellant and the nature of some of her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior convictions, the result quite possibly may have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different had the cross-examination been permitted. I would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore give effect to this ground of appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3. Failure to instruct the jury on the frailties of
        identification evidence
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In this case, the jury had to consider the reliability of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Lackie's eyewitness identification of the appellant as one of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assailants. She testified that she recognized the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as someone whom she knew reasonably well. Despite the fact that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the witness knew the appellant, she had limited time to observe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assailant in question. Her evidence also conflicted with that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the complainant in several significant respects. Finally,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was evidence supporting the appellant's theory that Ms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lackie misidentified the appellant as one of the assailants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Despite these factors, the trial judge did not instruct the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the general frailties of eyewitness identification nor did he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">point out the particular weaknesses of Ms. Lackie's testimony.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The Crown submits that, in this case, no particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction was necessary because the witness knew the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I cannot agree. The circumstances of this case were such that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">usual danger of relying on eyewitness identification existed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">despite the fact that this was a case of alleged recognition. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was therefore incumbent upon the trial judge to warn the jury of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the potential frailties in eyewitness identification and to list</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the actual potential frailties in Ms. Lackie's evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction and order a new trial.



RELEASED: December 23, 1998</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">_______________________________
     1 See R. v. McConnell and Beer, [1968] 4 C.C.C. 257 (S.C.C.)
where the Supreme Court of Canada held at p. 263 that the purpose
of the provision is to protect Aaccused persons against the
danger of having their right not to testify presented to the jury
in such a fashion as to suggest that their silence is being used
as a cloak for their guilt.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2 See also R. v. Cullen(1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 459 (Ont.
C.A.) where this court held that the trial judge had improperly
curtailed the defence's cross-examination of a crown witness. The
trial judge had not permitted questioning on the facts underlying
a finding of guilt on a charge that had resulted in a conditional
discharge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3  The respondent cited an endorsement by this court in R.
v. Morgan and Simms (1996), 88 O.A.C. 53 at 55 where the court
comments on its disagreement with the appellant's contention that
he was entitled to cross-examine a Crown witness Aon all the
details of the events that led to his convictions.&quot; The court
nonetheless gave effect to the ground of appeal and no further
analysis is provided. I do not read this decision as detracting
from the general principles stated above. Rather, it exemplifies
the fact that the right to cross-examine is not without
reasonable limits. The respondent also referred to another
endorsement of this court in R. v. Robertson,[1996] O.J. No. 924
where the court did not accept the appellant's argument that his
right to cross-examine a Crown witness on the details of a
conviction for public mischief had been improperly curtailed by
the trial judge. The court rejected the argument on the basis
that the trial judge had done no more than limit a line of
questioning that amounted to a fishing expedition. See also R. v.
Clarke, [1998] O.J. No. 3521 where the court, albeit in another
context, provides general guidance on the discretion to exclude
relevant defence evidence.</font></pre></td>
