    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                
[1]  The appellant was convicted of three counts of indecent
assault and one count of rape. He was sentenced to two years on
each indecent assault count to be served consecutively and two
years on the rape count to be served concurrently. The total
sentence was six years. He appeals sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We are not prepared to interfere with the sentences. The
offences were committed in relation to his three daughters. The
appellant?s conduct consisted of recurrent touching, fondling,
digital stimulation and other sexual acts that escalated in the
case of one victim to sexual intercourse. They occurred over a
lengthy period of time spanning almost 18 years, with only a
short break of four years between the second and third victims.
The appellant was in a position of trust to his victims and his
conduct had a profound effect on all three of them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  As to the concern that one of the victims was mistaken about
whether the appellant was circumcised, we are of the opinion that
although this may have impacted on the credibility of one of the
complainants on the issue of guilt, it was irrelevant on
sentencing. The reasons of the trial judge reveal no error in
principle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the
appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
