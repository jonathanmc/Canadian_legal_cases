    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The court is divided.  The majority are of the view that due
to a confusion as to the effect of particularizing the charge as
one of operation, confusion admittedly caused by the erroneous
submissions of defence counsel, the Crown committed itself to
proving the appellant had operated the vehicle on Bridge Street.
The trial judge had a reasonable doubt on that issue and
acquitted the appellant.  It was not open to the Crown to appeal
and seek to retry the appellant on a new theory of liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Weiler J.A. is of the opinion that the Crown clearly
indicated that it wished to proceed on the included offence of
care and control and merely acquiesced in an erroneous ruling by
the trial judge and she would dismiss the appeal.

[3]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is
allowed, the judgment of McKinnon J. is set aside, and the
judgment of Wright Prov. Ct. J. dismissing the charge is
restored.</font></pre></td>
