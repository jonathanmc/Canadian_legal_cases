    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    Brockenshire J. dismissed these two actions on motions for
summary judgment under Rule 20.  We agree with his disposition
even though we cannot adopt some portions of his reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    In our view the motions judge was wrong in relying on s.1
of the Charter, which refers to laws, not conduct, that can be
demonstrably justified.  Further, there was no need to find that
misfeasance or nonfeasance, without more, is not a sufficient
ground for the recovery of damages against a prosecutor under
s.24(1) of the Charter.  That section provides for &quot;such remedy
as the court considers appropriate and just in the
circumstances.&quot;  We should not go out of our way to confine such
a broadly worded constitutional remedy by general restrictions
except as may arise from the application of the section to
particular factual circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Here, the facts as developed from the pleadings, the
plaintiffs' affidavits, and the cross-examinations thereon,
disclose no basis for a claim on any standard of the application
of s.24(1).  There was no malice demonstrated, no pecuniary loss,
procedural relief was granted by the trial judge, and an
acquittal  resulted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The claim for emotional stress is set forth  in each of
the plaintiffs affidavits in identical lawyer's language and
nothing was added in cross-examinations to provide any substance
or sense that these were meaningful complaints.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Paragraph 15 of each of the three affidavits reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            15. Because of the impugned conduct of
            Thomas, I experienced additional
            emotional and consequent psychological
            stress and anguish at being placed at
            unwarranted risk of conviction both by
            reference to the protraction of the
            proceedings, hearing the concocted
            evidence of Kingston presented to the
            jury, hearing of the misconduct that I
            attribute to Thomas, hearing trial
            judge's pronouncements denying the
            motions made on my and my co-plaintiff's
            behalf to stay the proceedings for
            Thomas' Charter infringements and in
            turn, letting the case go the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    In our view these claims for damages are completely hollow
and bear no chance of success on any principled application of
s.24(1).  The rights and freedoms guaranteed to the appellants
were given full accordance by the rulings of the trial judge.  A
damage award would be undeserved and unrelated to the purposes of
the constitutional protections in the Charter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    We therefore dismiss the appeals with costs.</font></pre></td>
