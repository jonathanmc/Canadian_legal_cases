FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The premises in question are a one storey building shaped</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">like a cake box.  The total floor area is approximately 15,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">square feet.  It is occupied by billiard tables, a dance floor or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floors, a dining area or areas, bars, washroom facilities and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">kitchen.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The washroom and kitchen facilities comprise approximately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2,050 feet.  The square footage taken up by other uses varies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from time to time.  At one point, the restaurant aspect occupied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about 3,980 square feet and the recreational facilities about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8,542 square feet.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The findings of the court below with respect to proportions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were 2,700 square feet for dining and 10,250 square feet for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sports and recreation.  The maximum occupancy load for purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the liquor licence is 500 persons. Part of the premises is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">described as &quot;Club Hollywood&quot; and another part &quot;Shooters 9 Ball&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">All parts are accessible from all entrances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  According to the affidavit of Margaret Wheat, one of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicants, Club Hollywood has been marketed primarily as a night</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">club with accessory billiard facilities.  It is open from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Wednesday through Saturday and features a large dance floor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">music provided by a disc jockey and on occasion by live bands,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stand-up bar facilities and alcohol-related promotional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">activities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The premises are in an area zoned C3 where general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial uses are permitted.  These uses expressly include a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial sports or recreation establishment, a restaurant, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tavern or public house and a public hall, all terms defined by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the zoning by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The premises are on the edge of a residential area.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicants live in that area and are persuaded that there is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insufficient parking to accommodate the operation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises, with a resultant overflow of traffic into that area.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Discussions with local authorities did not produce the desired</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results so these proceedings were brought.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The applicants advance two arguments:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  The premises are wrongly classified as a
          commercial sports or recreation establishment.
          They should be classified as either a tavern or
          public house, a restaurant or a public hall, all
          of which have more stringent parking requirements;
          or, in the alternative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  assuming a commercial sports or residential
          establishment is the correct classification, only
          part of the premises should be so classified for
          parking purposes.  The balance should be
          classified as a restaurant for the calculation of
          parking requirements.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] My conclusion is that the second of these arguments must
succeed, but, because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inadequacy of the zoning by-law, the first  must fail.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] It is obvious from these numbers that the parking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirements of an enterprise will vary widely depending upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">classification of its use.  The ratio of 1 space for 6 square</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">metres for restaurants was in effect at the time the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">companies began dealing with the City.  Shortly after that, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requirement was increased to 1 space for each 4.5 square metres.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Also relevant are the bylaw definition of &quot;Accessory Use&quot;</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The position of the respondents, including the City, is that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although the use being carried on is manifestly that of a night</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">club, it cannot be so classified because there is no such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">classification in the by-law.  This despite the fact that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">zoning by-law law dates back at least as far as 1984.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] A similar enterprise had been established in Sarnia in 1990,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although on a much smaller scale, and, for lack of any better-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fitting classification, it was treated as a commercial sports or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreation establishment.  In order to be consistent, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">development now in issue must also treated as commercial sports</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or recreation establishment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Classification as a tavern or a public house is out of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question, according to the City, because the zoning bylaw</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition of this use simply refers to the Liquor Licence Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1980.  The definitions were not actually in that Act but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the regulations made under it and those regulations were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repealed sometime in the 1990s.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In any event, that classification would not be appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because by the definition in the bylaw, a tavern or public house</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not include a restaurant and this facility does have a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restaurant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The ratepayers' second choice, so to speak, is to have the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises, or a portion of them, classified as a restaurant.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' position is that it is not a restaurant.  At this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">point, the first question, classification of the use, merges with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the second question, namely how does one deal with multiple uses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Here the City, with the support of the other respondents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relies on consistency.  In the case of the 1990 enterprise, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">classified it as a community sports or recreation establishment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and treated the dining aspect of it as an accessory use.  Dealing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the instant situation in this manner, 100% of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' business is to be regarded as a commercial sports or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreation establishment for the purposes of calculating the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parking requirements.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The judge of first instance accepted this argument.  He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that it made more sense than what he called the &quot;layered or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional use approach&quot; of the applicants.  His view was that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the restaurant use was &quot;simply an accessory use for patrons who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are already there using the commercial sports or recreation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishment&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In reaching this conclusion he relied on the decision in Re</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">See: (1998) 176 D.L.R. (4th) 83 (C.A.).  Robins J.A. speaking for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the court said at pp.88 and 89:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [15]  I am respectfully unable to accept that
          the determination of whether an establishment
          is a &quot;restaurant&quot; or an &quot;entertainment
          facility&quot; depends simply on which use
          constitutes the primary function of the
          business.  Where a by-law creates a separate
          category of use specifically covering a
          proposed use, the proposed use must be
          subject to the restrictions imposed on that
          category.  Put another way, if the by-law
          contains a provision governing establishments
          providing a particular kind or class of
          entertainment in conjunction with the sale of
          food, the use of the premises for the
          specified entertainment puts what may
          otherwise be a restaurant in the defined
          entertainment category.  In the absence of
          any provision in the definition of the
          entertainment category permitting a use
          accessory to the entertainment use, this is
          so regardless of whether the entertainment
          use is primary to the dining use or visa
          versa.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [16]  In the present case, we have a by-law
          that defines &quot;entertainment facility&quot;.  This
          relatively new category was not in existence
          when any of the cases referred to in the
          court below were decided.  It was enacted to
          deal with the problems created by large
          combined dining and entertainment facilities.
          As this category is defined, an establishment
          that provides entertainment including any of
          the types of entertainment specified therein,
          as for instance, a dance floor, a discotheque
          or a supper club, in conjunction with the
          sale of food, is an &quot;entertainment facility&quot;.
          It is the combination of these uses that
          brings an establishment into this category.
          Unlike the definition of restaurant, no
          provision is made in the definition of
          &quot;entertainment facility&quot; for accessory or
          secondary uses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [17]  The entertainment area here has a
          standing capacity of 195 people and includes
          a stage and dance floor.  The presentation of
          entertainment featuring international
          singers, dancers and bands with a dance floor
          for patrons, can hardly be treated as
          something &quot;naturally and normally&quot; incidental
          or subordinate to the preparation and sale of
          food.  The main attraction may well be the
          entertainment rather than the food.  However,
          even if the entertainment can be said to be
          an accessory use, the establishment would
          nonetheless be an &quot;entertainment facility&quot;.
          The provision of a &quot;dance floor&quot; and the
          proposed entertainment in combination with
          the sale of food, by definition, renders the
          premises such a facility, as would a
          discotheque, a night club, a supper club or
          any other of  the forms of entertainment
          enumerated in the definition.  The
          respondent's proposed use of the premises is
          the kind of use intended to be covered by the
          definition and to which the zoning
          restrictions are directed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [18]  In reaching this conclusion, I would
          not wish to be taken as agreeing with the
          view apparently expressed by certain
          municipal officials to the effect that any
          live entertainment of any kind in any
          restaurant of whatever size necessarily
          converts the restaurant into an entertainment
          facility.  The by-law must be applied in a
          common sense way on a case by case basis and
          regard must be had to the reasons underlying
          the introduction of the &quot;entertainment
          facility&quot; category and the zoning
          restrictions pertinent thereto.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In my view, that decision is of limited assistance in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resolving the instant case because the decision was concerned not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the calculation of parking requirements but whether a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular use could be carried on in a particular area.  In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instant case, both uses in issue are permitted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The decision does, however, disapprove of the primary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose test, although in a different context.  The statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from paragraph 15 that &quot;where a bylaw creates a separate category</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of use specifically covering a proposed use, the proposed use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be subject to the restrictions imposed on that category&quot; is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly applicable in the instant circumstances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] I take it to mean that the parking requirements for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restaurant part of the business must be calculated on the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of what the bylaw specifies for the use of premises as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restaurant.  This I also take to be the intention of s. 8(15) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bylaw in issue here.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] I take paragraph 18 of the reasons of Robins J.A. to mean</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that any interpretation must begin with common sense and that if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a restaurant, for instance, were to add a piano player, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not necessarily convert it to an &quot;entertainment facility&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That relatively insignificant type of change was not what was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated in Re 1121472 Ontario Inc.; nor is it what is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">happening in the case now before the court, where a substantial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">percentage of the gross floor area is devoted to dining.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] I do not agree that the approach set out by Robins J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would lead to an absurd result.  With respect, this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation attempts to give effect to what is the obvious</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention of the Sarnia zoning bylaw and specifically, of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8(15).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] According to the material filed, the operators of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business were themselves concerned with the impact of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operation on the area and in particular with the traffic it would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">generate, if it became popular, as it apparently has.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] With this mind, a calculation was done by the City on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">split-use basis, that is calculating the requirements on two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bases, restaurant and commercial sports and recreation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishment.  This produced a combined parking requirement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">101 spaces, a number in excess of what is now provided that can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be counted under the by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In my respectful view, this is the correct approach.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">area should be divided into restaurant and commercial sports and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recreation establishment, the two calculations made and then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">added together.  Today's total may be different than 101,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">depending upon the current split between that part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises devoted to eating and that part given over to commercial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sports or recreation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] One of the disadvantages of this approach is that if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">split changes, the parking requirements may change as well.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">my view, this does not strike me as an insurmountable difficulty,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nor one inconsistent with the object of the by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Although no argument was directed to the details of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">split, I would expect that the kitchen facilities would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">included in the eating area and the washrooms would be divided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proportionately.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] An additional reason for not resorting to the &quot;accessory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">use&quot; clause is that, as I understand the facts, the eating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities are not &quot;exclusively devoted&quot; to the use of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises as a commercial sports or recreation establishment as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required by the definition of &quot;accessory use&quot;.  In other words,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one could go in and dine without using or having any intention to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">use the other facilities.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Returning to the first question, namely how should the use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of these premises be classified, the answer to me seems to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Hobson's choice&quot; - none of the alternatives is satisfactory.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This is not the fault of either the applicants or the two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">numbered company respondents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] From the description of what happens on the premises, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tavern or public house seems the closest fit - but that choice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be discarded because by the definition in s. 6(91) it cannot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">include a restaurant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Nor is it a public hall for the simple reason that it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">private, not public.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The applicants' third choice is &quot;restaurant&quot; and it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common ground that it is in part, at least, something else.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the result therefore I would not disagree with the judge below or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the Director of Planning who both said that it is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;commercial sports or recreation establishment&quot;, however</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsatisfactory that may be.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Counsel for the City urged that classification on the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for reasons of consistency.  While there is much to be said for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that virtue, particularly in the context of zoning, I agree with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice John Marshall Harlan of the United States Supreme Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          &quot;Let it be said that I am right, rather than
          consistent.&quot;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below and in its place substitute the following:
</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   This Court Orders And Adjudges that the parking
          requirements of the operations of 959634 Ontario Inc.
          and 1109650 Ontario Inc. be calculated pursuant to the
          City of Sarnia Zoning Bylaw 8506, by dividing the area
          of the property into its two uses, namely restaurant
          and commercial sports and recreation establishment and
          applying to the gross floor area devoted to each the
          parking requirement factor specified by section 10 of
          the said bylaw.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3.   This Court Orders And Adjudges that 959634 Ontario Inc.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] I would also order the numbered company respondents to pay</font></pre>
