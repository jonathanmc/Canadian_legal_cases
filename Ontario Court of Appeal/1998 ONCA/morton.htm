Morton v. Rabito
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  In January, 1993, Kevin Morton was driving his pick-up truck</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on a public highway when he came into collision with a backhoe.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He was very seriously injured. The backhoe with which he collided</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was owned by Vito Perino, but was not being operated with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Perino's consent. Salvatore Rabito, who was operating the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">backhoe, had stolen it earlier that evening from a construction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">site close to the scene of the accident. The backhoe was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Morton's own insurer,  The Dominion of Canada General</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Company, provided uninsured and underinsured automobile</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the owner and the operator of the backhoe and against Dominion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for very substantial damages. Dominion moved for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissing the claims asserted against it, alleging that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">backhoe was not an &quot;automobile&quot; within the meaning of the policy</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue before him to be &quot;whether the definition of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various sections of the policy becomes operative&quot; (p. 276). He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">noted that the definition of &quot;automobile&quot; in s.1, the definition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">section of the Insurance Act, included &quot;a self-propelled vehicle&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which, he held, clearly included a backhoe.  He noted further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the term &quot;automobile&quot; was defined in s. 224(1), the first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">section in Part VI of the Insurance Act, which deals specifically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with automobile insurance.  That section provides that, in Part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">VI,  &quot; 'automobile' includes a motor vehicle required under any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act to be insured under a motor vehicle liability policy&quot;.  He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then referred to the judgment of this court in Regele v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Slusarczyk (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 556, which held that a farm</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dominion's submission that since a backhoe, like a farm tractor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was expressly excluded from the definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot; in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;automobile&quot; within s. 224(1) of the Insurance Act. Hermiston J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected this submission and held, following Heath v. Co-</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jevco Insurance Company v. Commercial Union Assurance Company
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In October, 1992, Stephen Hutson was driving his motorcycle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on a public highway and attempted to pass a backhoe that was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">turning left across the roadway onto a private driveway.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motorcycle and the backhoe collided, and Hutson was seriously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injured. The backhoe, owned by Pachecos Contractors Ltd., was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured under a motor vehicle liability policy, but Pachecos was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured under a commercial general liability insurance policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issued by Commercial Union Assurance Company.  The motorcycle was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insured under a standard motor vehicle insurance policy issued by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jevco Insurance Company.  Jevco paid Hutson, the injured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motorcyclist, over $100,000 in accident benefit payments.  It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then brought an application against Commercial Union for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration that Commercial Union was a second party insurer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the contemplation of s. 275 of the Insurance Act and s. 9</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Automobile Insurance Regulation and was therefore obliged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to indemnify Jevco for the payments it had made<sup>2</sup>.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Hoillett J. held that s. 275 did not apply by reason of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">226(2) of the Insurance Act, which makes Part VI inapplicable to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contracts providing insurance in respect of an automobile not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to be registered under the Highway Traffic Act unless it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is insured under a contract evidenced by a form of policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approved under that Part. He therefore concluded that Commercial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Union was not a second party insurer obliged to indemnify Jevco</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the benefits it had paid. His reasons are reported at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1996), 37 C.C.L.I. (2d) 144.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In his reasons, Hoilett J. set out the relevant subsections</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of s. 275 of the Insurance Act  and s. 9 of the regulation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definitions of &quot;automobile&quot; in the Insurance Act and of &quot;motor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle&quot; and &quot;road-building machine&quot; in the Highway Traffic Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the provision for inapplication of Part VI in s. 226(2) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Insurance Act. He concluded that because a backhoe was &quot;an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile not required to be registered under the Highway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Traffic Act&quot; and because the backhoe was not &quot;insured under a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract evidenced by a form of policy approved under [Part VI]&quot;,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 226(2) operated to exempt Commercial Union from the obligation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to indemnify Jevco under s. 275. His formal order declared that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Commercial Union was not a &quot;second party insurer&quot; within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of s. 275.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Jevco appeals.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Relevant Statutory and Policy Provisions

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The argument of these appeals canvassed  a number of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Regele v. Slusarczyk
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Much of the argument of these appeals was directed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recent judgment of this court in Regele v. Slusarczyk (1997), 33</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">O.R. (3d) 556. Regele was an appeal from an order  made on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion for the determination, before trial, of the question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law whether a farm tractor  was an &quot;automobile&quot; within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of Part VI of the Insurance Act<sup>3</sup>. The motions judge held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it was. His order was reversed on appeal to this court.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The judgment of the court was delivered by Finlayson J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">After setting out ss. 266(1) and (2) of the Insurance Act, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">observed that &quot;[i]n ordinary parlance, an automobile does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">include a farm tractor&quot; (p. 558). He then referred to s. 224(1)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Insurance Act, which defines an automobile to include a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motor vehicle required under any Act to be insured under a motor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle liability policy.  He noted that the Act which requires a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motor vehicle to be insured under a motor vehicle liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy is the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act<sup>4</sup>, which gives</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to &quot;motor vehicle&quot; the same meaning as that found in the Highway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Traffic Act.  He observed that the definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the Highway Traffic Act  included an automobile but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically did not include a farm tractor, a self-propelled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">implement of husbandry or a road-building machine within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of that Act<sup>5</sup>. He then continued, at p. 559:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Clearly, a farm tractor is not a motor
          vehicle under the Highway Traffic Act. This
          means that it is not a motor vehicle under
          the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act. This
          is turn means that it is not an automobile
          under s. 224(1) since it is not &quot;required
          under any Act to be insured under a motor
          vehicle liability policy&quot;. Accordingly, it is
          not an &quot;automobile&quot; within the meaning of
          s.266 of the Insurance Act.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] He then turned to, and rejected, the motions judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contrary view, which rested on the definition of &quot;automobile&quot; in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 1 of the Insurance Act. Finlayson J.A. said, at p.559-560:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          With respect, the motions judge erred in
          finding that a farm tractor is an automobile
          for the purposes of s. 266. The operative
          definition is in s. 224(1) and not s.1. It is
          specifically applicable to Part VI and the
          special provisions that affect no-fault
          insurance. Even without the caveat ...  [in
          the introductory words of] ... s.1, this is a
          case where the specific should override the
          general. It is clear that s. 224(1) was
          intended by the legislature to provide a
          definition of automobile for the purposes of
          Part VI. It incorporates by reference the
          definition of &quot;automobile&quot; in the Highway
          Traffic Act. That definition expressly
          excluded a farm tractor. It is illogical to
          make use of the word &quot;includes&quot; in s. 224(1)
          of the Insurance Act to bring in a vehicle
          which has already been expressly excluded.
          Section 1 is inconsistent with s. 224(1), the
          definition section that governs s. 266 of
          Part VI, and accordingly s. 224(1) must
          prevail.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Finally, Finlayson J.A. directed his attention to Heath v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Co-operators General Insurance Co., the case which Hermiston J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopted in his reasons in Morton v. Rabito. Heath, said Finlayson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.A., at p. 560:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          dealt with the issue of whether an uninsured
          farm tractor was an uninsured automobile
          within the provisions of a policy of
          insurance. The policy did not define
          &quot;automobile&quot;. Relying on s. 1 of the
          Insurance Act, Binks J. held that a farm
          tractor was an automobile for the purposes of
          the policy. Heath may well be distinguishable
          on this basis, but if it was not, it was
          wrongly decided.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasoning of Binks J. in Heath v. Co-operators General Insurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Co. (1994), 24 C.C.L.I. (2d) 183. In Heath, Binks J. found that a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... if the insurance policy used restrictive
          words which limited the definition of
          automobile then a farm tractor would not be

          words, and in the case of the definition of
          the word automobile in s. 1 of the Insurance
          Act, a farm tractor being a self-propelled
          vehicle should be considered to be an

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Applying this reasoning, Hermiston J. found that a backhoe</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] It is important to recollect the object of this definitional</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a backhoe. The impetus behind the consideration of the meaning of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;automobile&quot; under the Insurance Act was an effort to ascertain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether there was some statutory definition that might</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Counsel for Commercial Union, who was counsel before Hoilett J.,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggested such a concession, none appears in the agreed statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of facts, in the factum filed by Commercial Union before Hoilett</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J., or in the factum filed by Commercial Union in this court. I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">am satisfied that no such concession was made, and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question whether the backhoe that collided with Stephen Hutson's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motorcycle was an &quot;automobile&quot; is still open for argument on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jevco appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] I now turn to that question.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] In support of its position, Jevco relied on the decisions of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Binks J. in Heath and of Hermiston J. in Morton, which I have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">already canvassed. Jevco also relied on an unreported decision of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court, affirming an unreported judgment of Hogg J., in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bergsma v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] O.J. No. 2572,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aff'd. [1996] O.J. No. 3082.  In Bergsma, the plaintiff was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involved in a motor vehicle accident which, she alleged, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">caused by the negligence of drivers of vehicles owned by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Department of National Defence.  It appears to have been common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ground that the DND vehicles were owned by the federal government</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and as such were not required, by provincial law, to be insured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under a motor vehicle liability policy. The plaintiff  brought an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application to determine whether s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied to her injuries and whether the DND vehicles were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;automobiles&quot; as defined in s. 224(1).  She submitted that such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles were excluded from the definition of &quot;automobile&quot; in s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">224(1) because they did not have to carry insurance and that,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of such exclusion,  the threshold provisions of s. 266(1)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not apply to her action. Hogg J. disagreed, and concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the DND vehicles were automobiles within the definition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 224(1) and that s. 266(1) applied to the plaintiff's injuries.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In a brief endorsement, this court dismissed the plaintiff's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal, saying:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... we agree with the motions judge that s.
          266(1) of the Insurance Act applies to the
          injuries sustained by the appellant and that
          the vehicles involved in the accident are
          automobiles as defined by s. 224(1) of the
          Insurance Act.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] By analogy, Jevco argued, the backhoe in the present case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was an &quot;automobile&quot; even though it was not required to be insured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under a motor vehicle liability policy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Bergsma is very different from the present case.  Although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">neither the reasons of Hogg J. nor the endorsement of this court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicates what types of  DND vehicle were involved in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident, the factums filed on the appeal indicates that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicles were trucks. A truck, in ordinary parlance, is an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile<sup>6</sup>.  One need not resort to the statutory definition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;automobile&quot; in s. 224(1) to deem a truck to be an automobile,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the fact that the truck was not &quot;a motor vehicle required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under any Act to be insured under a motor vehicle liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy&quot; did not exclude it from being an automobile.  In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present case, however, we are dealing with a backhoe, not a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">truck.   In ordinary parlance, an automobile does not include a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">backhoe, so that if a backhoe is to fall within the definition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;automobile&quot; as that term is used in s. 275 of the Insurance Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and in s. 9 of the automobile insurance regulation, it must fall</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within some enlarged statutory definition of that term.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In my view, it does not.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Unlike the Morton appeal, the Jevco appeal requires no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">canvass of the language of a policy of insurance. The narrow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question in Jevco is whether Commercial Union is a second party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">insurer liable to indemnify Jevco under s. 275. Section 275</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appears in Part VI of the Insurance Act.  It provides that, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certain cases,  the insurers of certain classes of automobiles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must indemnify a first party insurer for no-fault benefits it has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid to its insured.  If the backhoe is not an automobile, s. 275</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not apply.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] I consider Regele to be dispositive of the question whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a backhoe is an automobile for the purposes of Part VI of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Act.  If, as in Regele, a farm tractor is not an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile for the purposes of s. 266 of the Insurance Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">neither, in my view, can a backhoe be an automobile for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes of s. 275.  Since s. 275 applies only to &quot;insurers of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">...  classes of automobiles&quot;, and since a backhoe is not an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile within that section, Commercial Union cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligated by s. 275 to indemnify Jevco.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] There is a second reason why the Jevco appeal cannot</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succeed. Assuming, for the purpose of argument, that a backhoe is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a class of automobile contemplated by s. 275, I agree with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hoilett J. that the operation of that section is excluded by s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">226(2) of the Insurance Act.  That subsection makes Part VI</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inapplicable to &quot;a contract providing insurance in respect of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile not required to be registered under the Highway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Traffic Act unless it is insured under a contract evidenced by a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form of policy approved under this Part&quot;.  A backhoe is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to be registered under the Highway Traffic Act. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definitions section of that Act specifically excludes from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot;  any  &quot;road building machine&quot;, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the definition of &quot;road building machine&quot; in the same section</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically includes backhoes. The backhoe is not insured under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a contract evidenced by a form of policy approved under Part VI.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] I therefore conclude that, both because a backhoe is not an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">automobile for the purposes of Part VI of the Insurance Act and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because, even if it is, the application of Part VI is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically excluded by s. 226(2), Hoilett J. was correct in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaring that Commercial Union was not a &quot;second party insurer&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the meaning of s. 275.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Disposition
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] For these reasons,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(a)  I would allow the Morton appeal, set aside the order
     appealed from and substitute an order dismissing the action
     against Dominion. I would make no order respecting the costs
     of the action, the motion before Hermiston J. or the appeal
     to this court; and
(b)  I would dismiss the Jevco appeal, with costs.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] In my analysis, including my consideration of the decisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under appeal and of Bergsma, I have followed the approach of this</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] I confess to some misgivings about this process. Part VI of</font></pre>
