    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  After a trial before Crossland J. and a jury, the appellants
K.M. and R.M. were convicted of sexually assaulting their two 
daughters.   K.M. was also convicted of assaulting one of her 
daughters.  Each appellant was sentenced to eight years 
imprisonment.  They appeal their convictions and their sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Conviction Appeals</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On their conviction appeals the appellants make five
submissions:
       (i)  the trial judge misdirected the jury on how they
            should use the evidence of the Crown's child sexual
            abuse expert;
       (ii) the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the
            limited use of the evidence  of the appellants' bad
            character;
       (iii)    the Crown improperly cross-examined the
            appellants and thus prejudiced their defence;
       (iv) the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the
            limited use of previous consistent statements made
            by the complainants;
       (v)  the trial judge did not fairly outline the position
            of the defence to the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.     Expert Evidence
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Crown called Dr. Harvey Armstrong, an expert in child
sexual abuse.  Dr. Armstrong had not interviewed the
complainants, but he testified about delayed or incremental
disclosure, recantation and other behaviour said to be consistent
with child sexual abuse.  The appellants submit that the trial
judge made two errors in his charge on the use the jury could
make of Dr. Armstrong's evidence.  First, the appellants argued
that the trial judge erred by inviting the jury to treat Dr.
Armstrong's evidence as bolstering the complainants' credibility
and thus confirming the alleged abuse.  Second, they argued that
the trial judge erred by telling the jury to be cautious before
rejecting Dr. Armstrong's expert opinion.  We decline to give
effect to either argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  To take the second submission first, this was not a case of
competing experts because the defence chose not to call their own
expert.  Indeed the defence did not challenge most of Dr.
Armstrong's evidence.  Instead, in their cross-examinations they
sought only to qualify some of Dr. Armstrong's answers or
elaborate on some of his answers in chief.  This defence strategy
made sense because our courts have accepted the need for and the
admissibility of the kind of expert evidence given by Dr.
Armstrong.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Although the trial judge did caution the jury about
rejecting Dr. Armstrong's evidence, he twice instructed them that
they were free to do so by saying:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            Now, the same rules applies to his [Dr.
            Armstrong's] evidence.  You can accept
            it all, you can reject it all or you can
            accept part and reject part, but I would
            suggest to you you should be cautious
            before rejecting his professional
            opinion, but keep in mind it is open for
            you to do so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On the appellant's main point, we recognize that the
distinction between testifying about the credibility of the
complainants and helping the jury assess the complainants'
credibility by testifying about the behaviour of children who
have been sexually abused is not always an easy distinction to
make.  Nonetheless, our court has affirmed the propriety of this
distinction.  In R. v. J. (F.E.) (1989), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 64 (Ont.
C.A.) at 70, Galligan J.A. wrote:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            At first blush it may appear that there
            is not much of a difference between
            admitting expert opinion evidence to
            bolster credibility and admitting it to
            show that certain psychological and
            physical conditions are consistent with
            sexual abuse and thus capable of
            supporting the testimony of the child
            witness.  The difference is that in the
            first case the witness gives his or her
            expert opinion about truthfulness.  In
            the second, the evidence is only
            admitted as tending to show a condition
            consistent with sexual abuse and,
            therefore as being capable of supporting
            the witness's testimony.  It remains for
            the court to decide as a question of
            fact whether the psychological or
            physical conditions, as interpreted by
            the expert, do in fact support the
            testimony of the child witness.  The
            distinction is crucial and must always
            be borne in mind.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The trial judge charged the jury in the terms approved of by
Galligan J.A.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal must fail.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.     Bad Character Evidence
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Evidence of the appellants' bad character, including
evidence of their physical violence, glue sniffing and alcohol
abuse, was put before the jury.  The trial judge did not instruct
the jury on the limited use of such evidence.  The appellants
submit that the absence of a limiting instruction prejudiced the
defence because without such an instruction the jury might well
have inferred guilt from the appellants' general bad character.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The Crown concedes that the trial judge should have given a
limiting instruction, but submits that his failure to do so did
not prejudice the appellants.  We agree with the Crown.  The glue
sniffing and alcohol abuse, which was admitted by the appellants,
though evidence of bad character, was not so significant that it
would have invited the jury to infer the appellants' guilt.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The other bad character evidence was disputed at trial.
This evidence either amounted to the very offences alleged by the
Crown or was closely linked to these offences.  In this context
the trial judge can hardly be blamed for not giving a limiting
instruction.  It would have been difficult, if not impossible, to
give a sensible limiting instruction.  Moreover, a limiting
instruction might well have bolstered the complainants'
credibility.  We note that defence counsel did not object to the
lack of a limiting instruction.  For all these reasons we do not
give effect to this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellants also argued that the trial judge did not
caution the jury that they could not use evidence admissible on
one count to convict on other counts.  At the end of his charge,
the trial judge did instruct the jury that they &quot;must consider
each accused separately and ... each count separately.&quot;  This
instruction, although not as thorough as one might have wished,
has survived appellate scrutiny.  See R. v. Lyons (a judgment of
the Ontario Court of Appeal, released December 9, 1997).  Reading
the charge as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury would have
appreciated they were to consider the evidence on each count as
applying only to that count.  Our conclusion is supported by
defence counsel's failure to object to this part of the trial
judge's charge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.     Improper Cross-Examination
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellants complain about two improper questions in
cross-examination: first, K.M. was asked whether
she had ever been sexually abused by her father; and, second, K.M.
was asked to explain why her daughters would
complain to the police if their allegations were untrue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The first question was irrelevant and any prejudice that it
may have caused was neutralized by the trial judge's charge.  The
trial judge told the jury:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            I should mention at this time that Mrs.
            K.M. was asked on one occasion
            whether or not she'd ever told anyone
            that she'd ever been sexually abused by
            her father and she denied that and that
            is where it stands.  There is no
            evidence before this court that she was
            sexually abused by her father and
            indeed, there is no evidence before this
            court that I know of, that a person who
            has been sexually abused by their
            parents is more likely to abuse their
            own children.  So you disabuse your mind
            of that matter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] On the second question, ordinarily it is improper to ask an
accused whether a Crown witness is lying or to elicit from an
accused an explanation why a witness is not telling the truth.
However, this line of questioning in this case, though improper,
did not prejudice the defence.  The evidence of the complainants
and the appellants were diametrically opposed.  The jury would
have known that both sides could not have been telling the truth.
Indeed in her examination-in-chief, the appellant K.M. 
accused both her daughters of lying and by the end
of the trial the defence claimed collusion on the part of the
complainants.  Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury that
neither appellant had to give any reason why the complainants
would make these allegations &quot;because there is no onus on either
accused to prove anything.&quot;  This ground of appeal fails.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4.     Previous Consistent Statements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] During the trial, in an attempt to show inconsistencies, the
defence adduced evidence of previous consistent statements made
by the complainants to social workers and police officers.  The
appellants submit that the trial judge erred by failing to
instruct the jury on the limited use of such statements and
specifically by not telling the jury that these statements were
not admissible for the truth of their contents.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Even assuming that a limiting instruction is required when
the defence adduces evidence of the complainants' previous
consistent statements, we do not think that the absence of a
limiting instruction prejudiced the appellants.  As Mr. Finley
for the Crown pointed out, a limiting instruction would have
highlighted those parts of the complainants' previous statements
that were consistent and diluted the impact of those parts
alleged by the defence to be inconsistent.  The defence likely
appreciated this and for that reason did not object to the lack
of a limiting instruction.  This ground of appeal also fails</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5.     Outlining the Position of the Defence
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In their factum the appellants submitted that the trial
judge did not properly outline for the jury the position of the
defence and the evidence supporting their position.  However, the
appellants did not pursue this submission in oral argument and we
did not call on the Crown to respond to it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] We find no merit in this ground of appeal.  The trial judge
adequately instructed the jury on the position of the defence.
He told the jury that the appellants' position was that the acts
complained of never took place and that the complainants had
plotted to make false allegations against their parents. The
trial judge referred to the inconsistent statements made by the
complainants, which were relied on by the defence and to the
evidence given by the appellants refuting the allegations.  This
ground of appeal fails.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Accordingly, the appeals against conviction are dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Sentence Appeals
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The appellants submit that a sentence of eight years was
outside an acceptable range.  These were horrible crimes.  When
under the influence of glue or alcohol, the appellants
physically, sexually and psychologically abused their young
daughters. The abuse extended over many months.  Although the
complainants were not subjected to sexual intercourse, they
endured aggravating acts of sexual domination.  These offences
demanded lengthy penitentiary sentences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Still, in all the circumstances, we think that eight years
was unacceptably long.  The Crown conceded that there was no
authority to support an eight-year sentence for these offences.
We note that the appellant K.M. had a minor unrelated
criminal record and that the appellant R.M. had
an unrelated record, which was largely more than 20 years old.
We also note that because of difficulties in obtaining the
transcript this appeal took four years to come to this court.  We
think that a fit sentence is five years for each appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conclusion
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The conviction appeals are dismissed.  Leave to appeal
sentence is granted and the sentences of the appellants on counts
three and five are reduced from eight years to five years.</font></pre></td>
