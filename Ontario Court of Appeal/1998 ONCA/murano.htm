    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">INTRODUCTION
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The defendants Bank of Montreal and Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal from a judgment of Adams J. for $5,038,926.03 which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comprises $3,907,389 for damages and $1,131,537.03 for pre-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment interest. They also seek leave to appeal and, if leave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be granted, appeal from an order of solicitor and client costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against them and from the fixing of these costs by the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge in the amount of $474,760.39. The plaintiffs cross-appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the trial judge's refusal to award punitive damages and from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the award of pre-judgment interest at the rate of 7% per annum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather than at 10%, the rate prescribed by s. 128 of the Courts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. C43.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The facts relating to liability and damages are fully stated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the reasons of the trial judge, Adams J., which are reported</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at (1995), 20 B.L.R. (2d) 61 and 31 C.B.R. (3d) 1 and I will not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repeat them. I shall confine my reference to the facts and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence to what is necessary to address the issues raised on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The bank was a creditor of the plaintiffs with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four video stores which they owned and operated in the Kitchener-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Waterloo and Cambridge areas. The stores comprised the &quot;Hilton</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division&quot;. More specifically, the plaintiff Joe Murano, through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate holdings, owned and operated the four video stores. For</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the purpose of addressing the issues nothing turns on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular positions and roles of each of the six plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">They have been treated as one composite entity. The judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to above is simply in favour of &quot;the plaintiffs&quot;,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without any apportionment of it among the plaintiffs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On March 26, 1991 the bank appointed Peat Marwick Thorne</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Inc. as receiver and manager of the four video stores. It went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into possession of three of them on March 27, 1991. (The contents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the fourth store had been moved to Richmond Hill over the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">previous weekend.) Around the same time the bank disclosed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information, including what the trial judge found to be false</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information, concerning the plaintiffs, particularly Joe Murano,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to other creditors and lenders, business associates and suppliers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the plaintiffs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  At the time of the receivership the plaintiffs had opened</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">five other video stores under the name &quot;Top 30&quot; involving a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different video rental concept. The plaintiffs planned to expand</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the number of stores in the Top 30 division.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge found that Mr. Murano had also entered into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an agreement to purchase companies which owned and operated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another video store chain, Bandito Video and its eight corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and 44 franchised stores (&quot;Bandito Video Division&quot;). The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction was to close in April of 1991. The appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenge the finding of the existence of this agreement. Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Murano also owned several commercial properties in Kingston and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various mortgages and notes receivable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The trial judge held that the bank had not given the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs reasonable notice before taking possession of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properties through the receiver and had violated its obligation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as a banker to the plaintiffs in disclosing information to other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditors. He held the defendants liable to pay damages for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss of business respecting the Hilton Division, the Top 30</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division and the Bandito Video Division and also damages relating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the properties, mortgages, etc. in Kingston in the total</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of $3,907,389. (The defendant Peat Marwick may well not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liable for the same amount of damages as the bank but no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinction in this regard has been raised in the presentation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case or in the judgment, which is against &quot;the defendants&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In these reasons I shall mention only the bank when referring to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendants' side of the case.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUES

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The main issues on the appeal are (1) the liability of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank to the plaintiffs; (2) if there be liability, the amount of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the damages; and (3) the basis and amount of the plaintiffs'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">LIABILITY
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Was Reasonable Notice Given by the Bank to the Plaintiffs
     before the Receiver Took Possession of the Three Video
     Stores on March 27, 1991?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   Two hours before the receiver took possession of the stores</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bank delivered to the three video stores demand letters that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their loans be immediately repaid. It is, of course, not in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question that reasonable notice is required as a matter of law to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">give the debtor some time to repay the indebtedness before a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditor may properly enforce its security. The bank's basic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position is that it did give reasonable notice in a letter of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 17, 1990 to Mr. Murano, which is quoted in full in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge's reasons. The letter said that the bank was prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;to extend continued assistance on the basis of the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms&quot;. Certain terms were set out.  The letter concluded with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following two paragraphs:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Please provide a response by December 31st as
          to your agreement with the above arrangements
          and we will proceed with the increased loan.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Should the above not be satisfactory to you,
          we will have no other alternative but to
          request that you seek alternative
          arrangements to liquidate all loans by
          January 31st, 1991.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] Several events took place in the course of the relationship</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the plaintiffs and the bank between December 17, 1990 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">March 27, 1991. The bank has argued that what it submits to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been six weeks notice given in this letter was &quot;suspended&quot; by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason of representations made by the plaintiffs which culminated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in an agreement under which the bank agreed to continue the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">banking relationship upon certain terms and conditions. One of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the terms was that the plaintiffs would make a payment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$100,000 as a permanent partial payment of the indebtedness. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge found that the payment was not made. The bank submits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the plaintiffs did not honour their obligations under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extension agreement and that, therefore, the bank was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceed without any further notice because adequate notice had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">already been given in the December 17, 1990 letter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The trial judge held that the bank could not rely on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter because it did not contain an unequivocal demand. The bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenges the trial judge's conclusion in this respect. I am</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inclined to agree with the trial judge's interpretation. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appears to me, however, that a more fundamental basis for denying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bank the right to rely on the letter is that, no matter how</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is interpreted, following January 31, 1991 several events had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overtaken it which indicated to the plaintiffs that the letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not being relied upon by the bank. The bank itself did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have its terms in mind when it took possession through the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiver on March 27, 1991.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] An important meeting took place between the parties on March</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">20, 1991 during which several matters, not including the December</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">17, 1990 letter, were discussed. The plaintiffs had asked for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more financing for a reorganization scheme. The bank said that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would get back to them in a few days with respect to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request. As indicated, nothing was said to convey to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs the fact that the bank was even thinking about the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier letter. Assuming that the bank could have taken steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">revive the terms of the letter, nothing was done by it to do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The bank advanced an alternative submission that, in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances, the failure to give more time to the plaintiffs to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pay would have made no difference because of their financial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inability to make the required payment. This is entirely a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question of fact with respect to which the trial judge examined</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence and concluded that &quot;regardless of the onus, I am</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied that Murano could have repaid the funds.&quot; There was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence reasonably supporting this conclusion. Accordingly, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is not open to us to make a different finding.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Improper Disclosures by the Bank

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In Crawford and Falconbridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8th ed. (1986) at p. 802 it is said that the law respecting a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank's duty of confidentiality to its customer is stated in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">headnote to Tournier v. National Provincial Bank, [1924] 1 K.B.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">461 (C.A.) which &quot;is the leading case in England and throughout</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Commonwealth ...&quot; The headnote reads:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is an implied term of the contract between
          a banker and his customer that the banker
          will not divulge to third persons, without
          the consent of the customer, expressed or
          implied, either the state of the customer's
          account, or any of his transactions with the
          bank, or any information relating to the
          customer acquired through the keeping of his
          account, unless the banker is compelled to do
          so by order of a Court, or the circumstances
          give rise to a public duty of disclosure, or
          the protection of the banker's own interests
          require it.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The trial judge concluded that this obligation of the bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been breached by Mr. Rowlands, an account manager with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank in Kitchener, in conversations with several other creditors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Mr. Murano and by Mr. Skebo, a Bank of Montreal employee in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kingston and account manager of Mr. Murano's Papa and Pete's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pizza business. The most significant breaches were, likely, those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relating to statements made to the Toronto-Dominion Bank (which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was in the course of extending credit facilities to Mr. Murano</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relating to his Top 30 venture) and to Canada Trust (which had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extended credit to Mr. Murano on at least one of his Kingston</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properties).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The bank submits that there was no breach of its duty of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confidentiality in speaking to the other creditors because Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Murano had invited it to do so. There is evidence that,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediately after the imposition of the receiver, Mr. Murano told</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his creditors to call the bank for information. Accordingly, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think that much of the information which the bank furnished to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these creditors would be covered by the exception to the rule of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confidentiality based on the customer's consent. In this regard,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I think, with respect, that the trial judge's statement that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;there was no justification for the bank to do anything other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than confirm it had called its loans and imposed a receivership&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is too restrictive. The callers already knew that there was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receivership in place and Mr. Murano's suggestion to them to call</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bank reasonably extended to obtaining information on why the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank had taken the steps that it had.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Notwithstanding the trial judge's restrictive view of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exception from the duty of confidentiality, I think that his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimate conclusion that the bank breached the duty is clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supported on the evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Craig Eano, an employee of Canada Trust, which held a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage on a Murano property in Trenton, testified that on April</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">24, 1991 he received a call from Mr. Rowlands. Mr. Rowlands was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calling to check on the status of Mr. Murano's equity with Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trust because the Bank of Montreal was taking legal action on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security. Mr. Eano made notes of the call. Among other statements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made by Mr. Rowlands in the conversation was a statement that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Murano had been &quot;taking inventory in desperation&quot;. More</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically, Mr. Rowlands said that Mr. Murano was moving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cassettes from video stores and that he was moving restaurant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equipment from a restaurant in Kingston. I mention now that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no substance at all to the allegation respecting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restaurant equipment. This allegation was one that must have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained by Mr. Rowlands from Mr. Skebo, the Bank of Montreal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account manager in Kingston.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Kingston received an unsolicited call from Mr. Skebo who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advised him that the Bank of Montreal had lent money to a Murano</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company and &quot;that the loan related to some pizza equipment that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been at the 611 Princess Street ... [and that] the equipment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was gone and the loan was in arrears.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] On April 5, 1991 Mr. Day had telephoned Mr. Rowlands to find</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out what the bank was doing. He made a note of the conversation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There was considerable argument before us on the correctness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge's findings relating to this conversation and to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its effect on the Toronto-Dominion Bank's decision to cancel its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credit facilities for Mr. Murano's Top 30 venture. I shall deal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with it briefly. It may be fair to say that Mr. Day's oral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence went beyond what he recorded in his notes of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conversation. The note contained the following:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Rolland (sic) also advised that Murano had
          closed out one of the stores and removed all
          of the inventory and equipment which was
          assigned to the Bank and to the best of his
          knowledge no new store was opened in the
          area.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] The bank submits that this is an accurate and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unexceptionable statement. On behalf of Mr. Murano it is argued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it leaves out important context - that there had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing done to hide the moving of the inventory from the bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that Mr. Rowlands knew that Mr. Murano had not &quot;back doored&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the inventory. More importantly, Mr. Day testified that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rowlands had said that Mr. Murano had &quot;back doored&quot; the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inventory. Mr. Day said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Our reaction to Mr. Rowlands was quite
          serious. We felt that there must be a very
          serious problem with that particular
          business, both to go ahead and take the
          action that they took, especially when he was
          advising us that they put the receiver in
          without demanding loans first. Normally, a
          bank takes that kind of quick action, they
          suspect inventory is disappearing out the
          back door, and basically he indicated that in
          the telephone conversation, and we took his
          comments very seriously.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Later in his evidence he said that &quot;In the conversation with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Rowlands he made some direct accusations ... and based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there was a question in my mind as to whether our dealings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with Mr. Murano were going to remain satisfactory from that point</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Mr. Day testified in-chief that the Toronto-Dominion Bank's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision to cancel the credit facilities for Mr. Murano was based</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the fact of the receivership and the conversation he had with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Rowlands. In cross-examination he said that the decision was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made before the conversation with Mr. Rowlands. He was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to what he had said in-chief on this point. In re-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination the discrepancy was put to him. He then testified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that if he had said that the decision to cancel the credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities was made before his conversation with Mr. Rowlands he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was wrong and that the decision was made after the conversation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In my view, contrary to the bank's submission, this was proper re-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination. It is not our function to retry the factual issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the case. Clearly, it was open to the trial judge to conclude</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it was the actions of the Bank of Montreal which caused the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Toronto-Dominion Bank to cancel its line of credit for Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Murano's Top 30 venture.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In conclusion, it is apparent that the bank's conduct is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">covered by the exception to the rule of confidentiality based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the consent of the customer. The bank's disclosures respecting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its customer, which indicated that he was dishonest, were not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified by the facts. Further, having regard to Mr. Rowlands'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge that the removal of the inventory did not amount to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;back-dooring&quot;, it must be taken that the bank had no basis for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">saying that he was dishonest. Mr. Murano did not consent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosures of this kind.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] It might be thought that the gravamen of Mr. Murano's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complaint was not so much that confidential information was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosed but, rather, that the &quot;information&quot; that was disclosed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was both wrong and harmful to him. It was defamatory. This part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the case was not pleaded, nor argued, as one of defamation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so I will say nothing further on this. (It may be noted that in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the leading case of Tournier two causes of action were pleaded,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">slander and breach of confidentiality.) At the very least, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement of what Mr. Murano had done, which was not true, takes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case out of the exception to Tournier upon which the bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relies.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">DAMAGES

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] On the assumption that the bank is liable to the plaintiffs,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bank submits that the damages assessed are excessive. Before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considering the bank's submissions I shall outline the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge's reasons on damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   An Outline of the Trial Judge's Reasons

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Having found liability on the basis of trespass and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conversion following the failure to give reasonable notice and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the bank's communications to third parties in breach of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank's duty of confidentiality, the trial judge assessed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business losses relating to each of the Hilton Division, the Top</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">30 Division, the Bandito Video Division and the &quot;other losses&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] This part of his reasons commenced as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is the position of the plaintiffs that the
          actions of the defendants triggered a chain
          of events which included:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On April 22, 1991 the Canadian Imperial
          Bank of Commerce demanded repayment of its
          loans to two related companies, 855505
          Ontario Ltd. (operating as a Bandito Video
          store) and 548996 Ontario Ltd. (operating as
          Paulo's Pizzeria) totalling approximately
          $170,000. In addition, the CIBC demanded
          repayment of a personal line of credit to
          Murano of approximately $42,000;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On or about April 25, 1991 Canada Trust
          demanded repayment of a $300,000 mortgage on
          a property located in Trenton, Ontario;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On the same date, the Toronto Dominion
          Bank (&quot;TD Bank&quot;) demanded repayment of its
          loan of $94,000 to a related company, 548290
          Ontario Ltd. (operating as Miami Subs) and
          refused to honour cheques over $500 relating
          to the Top 30 Division operating in Eastern
          Ontario;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    In that same month Robert Hilton
          demanded repayment of his $1,000,000 loan and
          commenced an action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On May 17, 1991 National Trust demanded
          repayment of $875,000 pursuant to mortgages
          on properties at 161 Princess Street and 180
          King Street East, Kingston, Ontario;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On May 22, 1991, the TD Bank demanded
          repayment of a $97,000 loan to a related
          company, 855519 Ontario Ltd. (operating as a
          Top 30 Division location); and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          *    On May 27, 1991 the TD Bank demanded
          repayment of a $855,000 loan in respect of
          611 Princess Street and 512 Albert Street.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[29] The trial judge set forth the general economic background</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and its bearing on the video retail industry and, following this,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the competing expert opinion evidence given on behalf of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs and the bank.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] He then dealt with the law relating to damages for business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">loss. In this part of his reasons he began by stating that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages are to be compensatory for losses sustained in both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract and tort. He quoted from BC Checo International v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">37.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Following this, he dealt with &quot;the intertwined remedial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues of causation, foreseeability and certainty&quot;. Under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heading of certainty he noted at the outset &quot;the requirement that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a plaintiff prove its damages on a reasonable preponderance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credible evidence&quot; and then noted that &quot;the inherent difficulty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in piecing together what might have happened had there been no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach or tort committed will not relieve a court of its duty to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assess damages&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] He concluded this part of his reasons as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In assessing the reliability of projected
          future profits, a record of past earnings
          will obviously increase the certainty of such
          a prediction. However, a lack of evidence of
          past earnings does not automatically preclude
          a new business from recovering for lost
          profits. Rather, a new business must be
          allowed to prove lost profits to a reasonable
          level of certainty by expert testimony, by
          evidence of actual profits of similar
          businesses, by evidence of proven managerial
          experience and expertise, and by evidence of
          subsequent earnings if such evidence is
          available. Nevertheless, damages should not
          be awarded for lost profits which are
          entirely speculative and uncertain. See Al
          Edwards v. Container Craft Carton and Paper
          Supply Company, 327 P. 2d 622 (Calif. Dist.
          Ct. App. 1958) and Cooke Associates Inc. v.
          Warnick et al., 664 p. 2d 1161 (Utah Sup. Ct.
          1983). But once a defendant has been shown to
          have caused a loss, liability should not be
          escaped because the amount of the loss cannot
          be proven with precision. Consequently, the
          reasonable level of certainty required to
          establish &quot;the amount&quot; of the loss is
          generally lower than that required to
          establish &quot;the fact or cause of&quot; a loss. See
          Cooke Associates Inc. v. Warnick [664 p. 2d
          1161 (Utah Sup. Ct. 1983) at 1116] and
          Bradshaw Construction Ltd. v. Bank of Nova
          Scotia, [[1993] 1 W.W.R. 596 (B.C.C.A.) at
          612-13].</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[33] After setting forth the law relating to an award of punitive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages, he turned to the application of the legal principles he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had set forth to the facts as he found them. In this part of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons he dealt first with the valuation of the business losses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I shall deal later with his reasons respecting the expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. He arrived at the following conclusions respecting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs' losses:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Hilton Division                              $1,550,000
     Top 30 Division                              $1,000,000
     Bandito Video Division                       $1,000,000
     Other losses respecting Murano's real
         estate and real estate related assets       220,000
     TOTAL:                                        $3,770,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In amending reasons this amount was increased by $137,389 to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct an error relating to the deduction of shareholder loans</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting the Hilton Division.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] He then turned to the issues of causation and foreseeability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;with respect to those losses&quot;. In short, he found that causation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been established:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The imposition of a receivership is
          understood to entail immediate and
          devastating consequences for a business.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The established damages flow as a direct
          result of the misconduct alleged, misconduct
          which constitutes both a breach of contract
          and a commission of the torts of trespass and
          conversion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[35] On foreseeability he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          ... I am satisfied that those business losses
          were reasonably foreseeable at the time of
          contracting. The Bank sought and obtained
          comprehensive information from Murano and
          Glenn about their business activities before
          deciding to contract with them. The Bank was
          aware that Murano was an active entrepreneur
          with several other ventures. At all times,
          the Bank would be alive to the devastating
          impact a receivership has on a debtor's
          ongoing financial credibility. At all times,
          the Bank would also know that the adverse
          impact of a receivership would be magnified
          if it became known that the debtor could not
          be trusted and was generally in a desperate
          financial situation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[36] He then referred to a portion of Lord Wright's reasons in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Monarch Steamship Company v. A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker, [1949]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1 All E.R. 1 (H.L.) at 14 and then said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... [I]t was reasonably foreseeable at the
          time the parties contracted that these kind
          of breaches could destroy Murano's business
          and produce losses of the order established.
          From what the Bank knew about Murano at the
          time they entered into dealings with him, I
          am satisfied that neither the existence of
          loss nor the extent of loss was
          unforeseeable. As well, since the plaintiffs
          have made joint claims in tort and contract,
          the difference in the timing at which
          foreseeability is to be assessed in tort and
          contract claim is not material.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[37] He concluded that he found &quot;the losses established to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably foreseeable in both contract and tort and caused by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendants' wrongful actions&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   The Bank's Submissions

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The bank submits that the trial judge erred in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calculation of the business losses. He failed to take proper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account of the evidence given by the bank's expert witness and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in applying the discounted cash flow method of business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">valuation. He also erred in taking into account that every</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable presumption should be made in favour of the plaintiffs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting the proof of damages because the defendant had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">produced the circumstances of which the plaintiffs complained.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] With respect to causation, the bank submits that there is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">causal connection between the bank's actions and the alleged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses respecting the Top 30 Division and the Bandito Video</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division. With particular respect to the Bandito Video Division,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bank submits that there was an insufficient factual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foundation for the judge to conclude that there was an agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the purchase and sale of that business.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] With respect to foreseeability, the bank submits that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge erred in concluding that the date for determining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what damages were reasonably foreseeable was the date of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach, as opposed to the date upon which the contractual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship was entered into. Further, with respect to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages relating to the Top 30 Division and the Bandito Video</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division, they were not reasonably foreseeable.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal issue of foreseeability, the award of $220,000 was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unjustified by the very findings made by the trial judge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   Remoteness of Damages

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] According to the bank, much in this case turns on the matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of foreseeability. Before considering this matter and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles and rules relating to damages, it is first necessary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to determine the character of the wrong or wrongs that give rise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the claim. The two actions of the bank of which the plaintiffs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complain are: (1) the receiver's entering into possession of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hilton Division stores and (2) the breaches of the bank's duty of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] The bank characterizes the first, the entering into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession of the plaintiffs' stores by the receiver, as a breach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of contract. Its reasoning in this regard is that the damages in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case do not arise from torts committed by the bank but from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of contract relating to failure to give reasonable notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Not enough time was given to the plaintiffs to protect their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other interests. If reasonable notice had been given and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiver had gone in after the notice period there could be no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim. Accordingly, the cause of action here is breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract and the damages recoverable are those which were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably foreseeable at the time that Mr. Murano became a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">customer of the bank in December of 1989.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] With respect, I disagree with this analysis. The proposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may be tested as follows. Assume that a bank calls a demand loan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without giving any notice but, instead of appointing a receiver</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to take possession of the debtor's assets, issues a statement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim and then proceeds to attempt to collect the debt by seeking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a judgment for its payment. This would have involved a breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract (the failure to give reasonable notice) but, without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more, nothing that happened in the present case would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">happened. Accordingly, the torts of trespass and conversion by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the receiver were the causes of the plaintiffs' losses, not the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of contract. The role played by the breach of contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was, simply, that it disentitled the bank from relying upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract to shield it from a claim of trespass by its customer. I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">note that this analysis is in accord with the reasons in Ronald</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Elwyn Lister Limited et al. v. Dunlop Canada Limited, [1982] 1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.C.R. 726 and Ronald Elwyn Lister Limited v. Dayton Tire Canada</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] Because the taking of possession is a tort, it follows that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in so far as foreseeability is relevant, the material time would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be when the tort was committed, not when the banking relationship</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was entered into. I think, however, that foreseeability has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">little to do with the measure of damages in this case. Generally,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a trespasser can be liable for unforeseeable consequences. In</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Dunlop submits that the damages in this
          respect were not foreseeable and too remote.
          Since we are concerned with damages flowing
          from an intentional tort I regard the
          remoteness principle as requiring that the
          damages flow as a direct result of the tort:

          clearly a supportable finding on the evidence
          that, but for the tort, the only reasonable

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The rule stated in this Section affects only
          the measure of damages for a tort, but is
          based upon the principle ... that
          responsibility for harmful consequences
          should be carried further in the case of one
          who does an intentionally wrongful act than
          in the case of one who is merely negligent or
          is not at fault. The rule applies not merely
          to physical harm to the person but also harm
          to the feelings, to reputation, and to
          business. Its principle applies not only to
          permit a jury to award punitive damages but
          also to cause an intentionally wrongful tort
          feasor to respond for compensatory damages in
          cases where, were he merely negligent, he
          would not be required to pay damages.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[47] I do not suggest that there can be no limit on the damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recoverable as a result of an intentional tort. It is unnecessary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to explore the possible limits because, in the present case, the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The bank challenges the trial judge's finding that Mr.</font></pre>

          view, adopted assumptions that were either
          too conservative or too liberal. For example,
          Wise's adoption of the plaintiffs' profit
          projections unduly minimized Murano's own
          quite daunting projections made to Rowlands
          at the meeting of March 20; the closure of 22
          Weber Street; and the fact that Murano was
          actually contemplating the move of a second
          store out of the Kitchener/Waterloo area to
          Pickering. In the circumstances, the
          projected 12% annual increases for the years
          1991 to 1993 strike me as overly optimistic,
          particularly in light of the revenue
          experience in 1989 in comparison to previous
          years. Similarly, Wise's failure to attribute
          any head office costs to administer the
          Hilton Division stores when those stores were
          really the most concrete manifestation of
          Murano's foothold in the video rental
          industry was unfair. Unaccounted for, as
          well, were the concerns expressed by Robert
          Hilton in his letter to Murano of March 5,
          1991. In my opinion, Murano faced challenges
          that were not adequately reflected in either
          management's projections or Wise's
          application of risk factors of 5-20% over the
          projected period.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my opinion, the plaintiffs' loss on the
          Hilton Division should therefore be assessed
          at 75% of the mid-point of the value range
          estimated by Wise or .75 times $2,702,500 or
          $2,026,875 less the amount owed the Bank
          (i.e. $207,000) and the indebtedness of
          Murano by way of shareholder loans from HVL
          and 828556 in the amounts of $127,990 and
          $146,787 respectively. See Ronald Elwyn
          Lister Ltd. v. Dayton Tire (1985), 52 O.R.

          resulting value of the Hilton business and
          therefore Murano's losses in this regard to
          $1,550,000. [As noted earlier, he increased
          this amount by $137,389 to correct an error
          relating to the deduction of shareholder
          loans.]</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tax rate was also inappropriate. The resulting amount was</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] With respect to the Bandito Video Division, the trial judge</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] In very general terms, what the trial judge did with respect</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">5.   The Other Losses

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] The basis of the claim for &quot;other losses&quot; was a loss of:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  market value, that is, the excess of the market value
          of the properties over the proceeds of their
          liquidation suffered by Mr. Murano; and
     (b)  the loss of mortgages and notes receivable, as well as
          additional financing costs on securing a mortgage on
          his home, as a result of the bank's actions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[70] The trial judge dealt with this claim as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          ... [T]he losses associated with Murano's
          real estate and real estate related assets
          need consideration. I am not satisfied with
          the reliability of the fair market value
          estimates as of the loss date for the real
          estate in question. The market was a
          difficult one for commercial properties and
          particularly properties experiencing
          vacancies. Not all of the back-up
          documentation constituted formal appraisals
          and even where opinions were expressed as
          appraisals, extensive local market
          comparisons and revenue projections were not
          given. Murano had heavily mortgaged these
          properties and, thus, his asset base was
          highly leverage[d] at the very time his
          operations in the video industry were being
          challenged. Murano's claim is for losses
          arising from the forced sale of these
          properties. I think it more likely than not
          he would have been required to sell several
          of these properties to meet those challenges.
          Having regard to all of the circumstances,
          however, I am prepared to assess his loss on
          real estate as the difference between the
          total mortgage balance outstanding of
          $1,872,541 and the gross disposal price of
          $1,753,000 or $119,541 rounded to $120,000.
          To this I would add a further $100,000 to
          assess the total extent of loss due to
          untimely disposition of real estate assets at
          $220,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[71] With respect, the trial judge's conclusions are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supportable on the findings of fact which he made. He said that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was not satisfied with the fair market value estimates, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the back-up documentation for the assessments was not given, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the properties would likely have had to have been sold by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Murano in any event to meet the challenges facing his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">business at the time unrelated to the actions of the bank. By</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason of these findings, no award should have been made in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour of the plaintiffs with respect to these losses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] The principle that every reasonable assumption should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made in favour of the plaintiffs is of no assistance to shore up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this award. It was open to the plaintiffs to obtain evidence to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establish these losses and their failure to do so does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably give rise to the presumption. I would set aside the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Introduction

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] The bank appeals from the awarding of costs on solicitor and</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] The bank sought leave to appeal but submitted that it did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not need leave because its costs appeal is part of a larger</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal and, accordingly, was not an &quot;appeal .. only as to costs&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the meaning of this expression of s. 133(b) of the Courts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C43. The bank referred to the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which is contrary to its submission but sought to distinguish it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] In Cameron the appeal to the Court of Appeal on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantive issues failed and leave had not been obtained to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal costs. The court held that it had no power to deal with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appeal from the costs part of the judgment. At p. 435</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schroeder J.A. said for the court:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It was held in Murphy v. Lamphier (1914), 32
          O.L.R. 19, 20 D.L.R. 906 that where an appeal
          fails on the merits the Court has no power to
          interfere with the exercise of the trial
          Judge's discretion as to costs where no leave
          has been given by him to appeal with respect
          to costs. The point also fell to be
          considered in Buckley v. Vair (1917), 40
          O.L.R. 465, 39 D.L.R. 796 and in Le Lage v.
          Laidlaw Lumber Company (1918), 43 O.L.R. 400.
          It was decided in those cases that an
          appellant could not, by joining with an
          appeal as to costs, an appeal as to other
          parts of the judgment on which he failed,
          escape from the provisions of s. 23 (now s.
          24).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[76] Because the bank has been successful with respect to part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its appeal the interpretation applied in Cameron is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applicable. Nevertheless, it may be of value to deal with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank's submission.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] The bank submitted that at the time of Cameron the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision (s. 24 of the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190) was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different from the present provision. It then read:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... [N]o order of the High Court or of a
          judge thereof as to costs only ... shall be

          which the appeal is to be taken,</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[79] The bank submitted that the change in the wording dictates a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different conclusion from that reached in Cameron. I do not think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, in substance, the two provisions have a different meaning.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">If the Legislature had intended a change in this regard I think</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   The Award of Costs on a Solicitor and Client Basis

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] The bank submits that this is not one of those rare and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exceptional cases in which solicitor and client costs should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">awarded. In my view, having regard to the findings that the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge made respecting the bank's conduct before the proceeding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was commenced and the manner of its defence of this conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during the proceeding, it cannot be said that he exercised his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discretion wrongly. He said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Bank, at trial, pursued the allegation of
          absconding in a manner that went to Murano's
          honesty and personal integrity. It was
          pleaded he had acted surreptitiously and in a
          manner inconsistent with honesty. To buttress
          these positions, the Bank argued it was
          necessary for the court to analyse in detail
          the entirety of its relationships with the
          plaintiffs prior to the time at which its
          actions giving rise to this action occurred.
          The result was a minute examination of many
          events over the course of the preceding year
          with a general emphasis on Murano's alleged
          lack of honesty and, in my view, with the
          subtext being that Murano was &quot;the kind of
          debtor&quot; who would have attempted to abscond
          with assets otherwise subject to the Bank's
          security.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It was found, however, that no matter how all
          these earlier events were construed, the Bank
          could not have reasonably concluded or been
          certain that Murano was absconding with the
          Weber Street assets in March, 1991 and, in
          fact, that the Bank had used the
          circumstances surrounding the closure of the
          Weber Street store as a convenient pretext
          for implementing a plan it had been
          considering well before learning that the
          store was empty. It was also found that
          officers of the Bank, in an attempt to
          justify the Bank's wrongful conduct,
          inaccurately relayed to other lenders as well
          as to existing and prospective business
          associates that Murano was financially
          desperate and that he had acted dishonestly
          not only in respect of the movement of the
          Weber Street store but also in relation to
          inventory associated with a restaurant
          located in Kingston.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This wilful misconduct of the Bank
          essentially destroyed Murano's businesses and
          likely impaired his reputation in the
          business community on an ongoing basis. These
          unfounded allegations were then repeated in
          the Bank's pleadings and pursued with vigour
          at trial. As previously mentioned, while the
          Bank was entitled to proceed in this manner,
          it had to be prepared for the cost
          consequences if this court concluded its
          serious allegations in this respect were
          totally unfounded.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following might usefully be said.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">how the power to fix costs should be exercised.  The following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considerations, however, should be helpful:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1)  A judge should not fix costs on his or her own motion. If a
     judge is minded to fix costs, or if one party asks the court
     to do so, the parties should be given the opportunity to
     make submissions on whether costs should be fixed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2)  With due respect to the contrary view expressed by Henry J.
     in Apotex Inc. v. Egis Pharmaceuticals (1991), 4 O.R. (3d)
     321 (Gen. Div.) at 322, I do not think that a judge has an
     unfettered discretion to fix costs. The power should only be
     resorted to when the judge, having received the parties'
     submissions, is satisfied that he or she is in a position to
     do procedural and substantive justice in fixing the costs
     instead of directing that they be assessed by an assessment
     officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3)  Having decided to fix costs, the judge should, of course,
     conduct an appropriate hearing on the question of the amount
     to be fixed. Depending on the circumstances, this could
     properly take the form of the receipt of written submissions
     from the parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[89] Each case turns on its own circumstances. In Couglin v.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter&quot;. By way of contrast, in Skinner v. Royal Victoria</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I do not feel that in this case I have the
          same familiarity [as E. Macdonald J. in
          Coughlin] with the background. It should be
          remembered that the trial of the action was
          bifurcated with the first part being heard in
          the spring of 1993 and the second in the
          summer of 1994. There were numerous expert
          witnesses called at both trials. I have no
          doubt that before the first trial there were
          extensive pretrial examinations and
          production and inspection of documents
          including hospital records. I have no
          knowledge of any pretrial interlocutory
          proceedings but there may well have been
          many. In order for a proper evaluation of the
          costs to be made I am of the view that a
          complete review and breakdown of all of the
          time spent will have to be prepared and
          submitted. I would expect this to be a
          lengthy document and I would also expect it
          to be subject to considerable investigation
          and comment by counsel for the defendants.
          Accordingly the costs that I have ordered to
          be paid should be made payable forthwith by
          the defendants after their assessment by a
          designated assessment officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[90] It is reasonable to think that a judge or court after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hearing a motion, an application, or an appeal would generally,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of familiarity with all of the relevant facts, documents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and issues, be in a reasonable position to fix the costs of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion, application, or appeal. With trials, the matter becomes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more difficult because the trial judge is not likely to know,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">simply by virtue of having been the trial judge, much about all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the pre-trial stages. In these circumstances, his or her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge of the case would necessarily require substantial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supplementation. The whole question is helpfully canvassed by</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vong, [1991] O.J. No. 2292 (Gen. Div.) as a proper description of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judge's function in fixing costs:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A judge's function in fixing costs (as
          contrasted with the role of an assessment
          officer on a full assessment) is to perform a
          summary analysis of the cost of the services
          of counsel for the successful party, then to
          apply the party/party scale of
          indemnification to that figure. The purpose
          of the summary analysis is for the trial or
          motions judge, familiar with the nature of
          the proceeding as well as with its
          substantive and procedural complexity, to
          ensure that the magnitude of the claimed
          costs is in keeping with what is warranted in
          the circumstances. I do not view it to be the
          court's function when fixing costs to second-
          guess successful counsel on the amount of
          time that should or could have been spent to
          achieve the same result, unless the time
          spent is so grossly excessive as to be
          obvious overkill. (Emphasis added by Adams J.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[92] Adams J. then referred to a passage in Apotex Inc. v. Egis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pharmaceuticals and Novopharm Ltd., supra, at p. 325 on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of solicitor and clients costs. His reasons conclude as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This was a fifteen day trial. The matter was
          quite complex and hard fought. I intended the
          award of costs to completely indemnify the
          plaintiffs because of the circumstances I
          have reviewed in earlier reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The fees and disbursements are not, in all
          the circumstances, grossly excessive. The
          services billed and the costs incurred fall
          within the ambit of being &quot;reasonably
          necessary&quot; to fully and fairly prepare and
          present the plaintiffs' case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The bill of costs presented by the plaintiffs
          is therefore allowed without adjustment.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[93] I agree with the judge's acceptance of Henry J.'s statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the purpose of solicitor and client costs set forth in Apotex</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at p. 325:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The general principle that guides the court
          in fixing costs as between parties on the
          solicitor and client scale, as is provided in
          my order, is that the solicitor and client
          scale is intended to be complete
          indemnification for all costs (fees and
          disbursements) reasonably incurred in the
          course of prosecuting or defending the action
          or proceeding, but is not, in the absence of
          a special order, to include the costs of
          extra services judged not to be reasonably
          necessary.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[94] The difficulty with this statement, in many cases, lies in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its application to the facts before the court - more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically, in the approaches and tests to be applied in fixing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs on a solicitor and client basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[95] Henry J., in Apotex at 326, set forth the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approach:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This brings me to a second guiding principle
          - the judge in fixing costs of a proceeding
          is not assessing costs as if he were
          performing the functions of a master or
          officer to whom the court has referred costs
          to be assessed. Rule 57.01(3) expressly
          provides that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In awarding costs, the court may
               fix all or part of the costs with
               or without reference to the
               Tariffs, instead of referring them
               for assessment ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          This I understand is what the judges are
          doing frequently in interlocutory proceedings
          currently, including myself; it is not an
          assessment item by item according to the
          Tariffs as would be done by an assessment
          officer; it is rather the judge's
          determination of what the services devoted to
          the motion or other proceeding are worth
          according to the submissions of counsel, his
          own experience and with some regard to what
          could be taxed on the party and party scale.
          This is done in Weekly Court, Motions Court
          and Divisional Court and normally involves
          the party and party scale. It is essentially
          pragmatic, made on an overall appreciation of
          the factors in rule 57.01 without reviewing a
          catalogue of itemized charges.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] I accept this approach subject to some qualification. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one thing to say that the fixing of costs is not an assessment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">item by item according to the tariffs as would be done by an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment officer, which I accept. It is quite another to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">countenance not reviewing a &quot;catalogue of itemized charges&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Claims for solicitor and client costs in any matter of complexity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are invariably broken down into items describing the services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performed and the amounts charged for them. These must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reviewed by the judge, as must their total. In this regard, I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think that the approach of Haines J. in Worsley v. Lichong,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1994] O.J. No. 614 (Gen. Div.) is the correct one. In paragraph</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... I believe the fixing of costs still
          requires a critical examination of the work
          undertaken in order to determine that the
          costs claimed have been reasonably incurred
          and reflect what the court considers to be
          proper and appropriate in the circumstances
          given the complexity and significance of the
          proceedings held up against the backdrop of
          full indemnification.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I do not believe the decision in Apotex,
          however, should be interpreted as authority

          without careful consideration by the judge as
          whether or not the costs were reasonably

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the reasons of Somers J. in Skinner, quoted above:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Should the costs be fixed or assessed?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [para 19] The defendants urged me to fix the
          costs. My experience with the case would save
          much time; the process would be less time-
          consuming than the assessment process; trench
          warfare over every motion over 17 years of
          litigation would be avoided. The plaintiff
          sought an assessment submitting that although
          I knew about the trial, I would have no
          advantage as to the pre-trial period; the
          process would inevitably resemble an
          assessment given the nature of the
          proceedings; the effective allocation of
          court resources called for the assignment of
          the task to the Assessment Officers; I should
          not force them to a summary fixing over their
          objections.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [para 20] This was a 30 day trial after over
          a decade of active litigation. The costs will
          be very large amounts, backed by extensive
          records. Fixing the costs is meant to be a
          summary sort of procedure and I do not think
          such a procedure is likely to reach a just
          result unless it evolves into something akin
          to an assessment, with the Judge reviewing
          the factors an Assessment Officer would
          review. The costs will be assessed, but I am
          prepared to consider submissions as to any
          special directions that ought to be given.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] In my view, this contains the correct observation that, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances of that case, to reach a just result the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parts. An overall sense of what is reasonable may be factored in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to determine the ultimate award. This overall sense, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be a properly informed one before the parts are critically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examined.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[101]     Another, possibly related, qualification I have to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement in Apotex relates to the statement that the judge is to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have &quot;some regard to what could be taxed [assessed] on the party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and party scale&quot;. He was speaking principally of an award of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs on a party and party basis at that place in his reasons. If</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this was intended to mean that the law recognizes that the fixing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure properly yields a different substantive result, i.e., a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different amount, from the assessment procedure, then I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respectfully disagree. The procedure for determining costs is, of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">course, different but this does not mean that the substantive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results of the two processes are intended to be different.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[102]     The general principle is that like cases should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclude with like substantive results. Because no two cases are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exactly alike and, also, because matters of discretion and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment are involved, it is not to be expected that results will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be identical even in cases that are exactly alike. This does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mean, however, that the substantive goal should not be equal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results. I think that my view is reflected in the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passage from the reasons of Jessel M.R. in Willmott v. Barber</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1881), 17 Ch. D. 772 (C.A.) at 774:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The judge has a large discretion as to
          costs... [H]e may follow the course which I
          sometimes adopt, and I generally find that
          the parties are grateful to me for doing so,
          namely, fix a definite sum for one party to
          pay to the other, so as to avoid the expense
          of taxation, taking care in doing so to fix a
          smaller sum than the party would have to pay
          if the costs were taxed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[103]     I read this as indicating that Jessel M.R. intended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that his fixing of costs would be in line with the results of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taxation, after giving some effect to the saving of the expense</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a taxation. To the same effect is the following statement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Austin J. in Ligate v. Abick (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 332 (Gen. Div.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at 335:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It was also argued [in support of a
          submission that he, as trial judge, fix the
          costs] that, since I tried the case, I would
          have an advantage in that I would already
          know how long it took, how difficult it was,
          etc. I acknowledge that I would have had a
          headstart in that regard. On the other hand,
          I have a serious disadvantage. Specifically,
          I do not know the rates presently being
          awarded by assessment officers. Few judges do
          and, in my view, in the interests of
          consistency, the job of assessing costs
          should be left to those skilled in the task,
          except in circumstances which compel another
          approach.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This indicates the relevance to the fixing process of decisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made in the course of the assessment process and the importance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of general consistency.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[104]     The main advantage of the fixing procedure is its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expedition - the avoidance of delay in the determination of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs part of the proceeding. This should not be bought at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">price of a less than reasonable procedure. Robert D. Malen, at p.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">94 of the article to which I have referred, has rightly observed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the amounts of costs involved in some cases are of a very</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial amount and that &quot;something more than a 'summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analysis' is required.&quot; He elaborates on this as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The dollars at stake in most trials are less
          than that amount [he was referring to
          $600,000] and, if that quantum was in issue
          at a trial, most judges would not question
          spending a week or two trying the case. Why
          then, when the issue is costs, should the
          approach be any different? From the client's
          point of view, a dollar is a dollar whether
          it forms part of the judgment or part of the
          costs.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[105]     If it be objected that a careful review by a judge is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">too time consuming then the proper course is to refer the costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to assessment. I refer to the statement of D. Lane J. in McKinlay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Transport which I have quoted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[106]     Related to this subject are the observations of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Callaghan C.J.O.C. in In-Med Laboratories Ltd. et al. v. Director</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          We are embarking on a new direction in this
          case in that most appeals before us to date,
          upon which we have fixed costs, have been
          matters of a lesser nature where there has
          not been such a large number of hours claimed
          by counsel as being expended in preparation
          for the hearing before this court. We feel
          that when a claim for costs reaches numbers
          similar to that before us today then it
          should be supported by an affidavit of
          counsel. Either counsel, who have appeared on
          this matter can provide us with an affidavit
          substantiating the hours spent and the
          disbursements.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          We note for the record that the hours
          claimed, in the circumstances of this case,
          having regard to the nature of the appeal and
          the transcripts involved, of approximately
          1,700 pages, do not appear out of line and we
          certainly are not taking issue with them. We
          rule, however, that when a bill of costs
          reaches this size it should be supported by
          an affidavit that confirms the hours and
          disbursements.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
No affidavit appears to have been filed in this proceeding.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[107]     I now consider Adams J.'s decision in light of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foregoing. First, did he apply the correct substantive principle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respecting the determination of costs on a solicitor and client</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis? I think that he did. He referred to the statement of Henry</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. at p. 325 of Apotex. It is true that he said that &quot;[t]he fees</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and disbursements [were] not, in all the circumstances, grossly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">excessive&quot;. With respect, I think that &quot;grossly excessive&quot; is an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expression that should be avoided. It is clearly susceptible of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being read as allowing an amount that is more than reasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Adams J. did not give it this meaning because in the next</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence he said that the costs were &quot;reasonably necessary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fully and fairly prepare and present the plaintiffs' case&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[108]     Second, with regard to the procedure followed, I have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some concern stemming from the lack of detail in his reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the judge subjected the proposed costs to the degree of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scrutiny required. In the circumstances, however, this concern</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does not incline me to setting aside the award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[109]     In the bank's supplementary notice of appeal it sought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to have this court reduce the amount fixed. On the argument</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before us this remedy was not pursued - that is, the bank did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make submissions on what a more correct amount would be and why.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Instead, the bank requested that the costs be referred for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment. I have noted that the trial judge in his reasons did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set forth the submissions of both parties. I assume that he gave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them proper consideration. Of importance to me, in reviewing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award and taking into account the factors listed in rules</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">57.01(1) and 58.06 (the amount involved in the proceeding, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complexity of the proceeding, the importance of the issues, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">length of the trial, etc.) is that I am not persuaded that any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part of the costs, or the total allowed, are out of line measured</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the principle of full indemnification for costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably incurred. In this regard, I accept what Henry J. said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at p. 331 of Apotex:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Whether a service is performed or engaged
          in contemplation of adversarial proceedings
          in court is essentially a matter of judgment.
          I have looked for the exercise of judgment,
          together with prudence, foresight and
          imagination, in assigning services to the
          motion in this case as the test of fairness,
          reasonableness and necessity in applying the
          guiding principles. It is not appropriate to
          apply the test of hindsight (20/20 vision) to
          determine whether a service charged for was
          an extra service or frill not reasonably
          necessary to defend the client's position.
          The time to view the decision to commit
          services to the project is before the hearing
          or trial - not on the basis of hindsight
          which might indicate that as it turned out,
          the service was unnecessary.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">For the sake of completeness, I should note that I do not regard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the reduction of the damages by $220,000 respecting &quot;other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">losses&quot; to have any significant bearing on the reasonableness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the costs award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[110]     For these reasons, whatever misgivings I may have with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to the process followed by Adams J., I do not think that</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct&quot; which would normally call for punitive damages but,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following this, he deprived them of an award of punitive damages</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deprived the plaintiffs of an award of punitive damages in their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favour.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[113]     Earlier in his reasons the trial judge referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Waddams, The Law of Damages, 2nd ed., at paragraph 11.450 for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposition that &quot;the conduct of the plaintiff in provoking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">otherwise harsh or oppressive actions by a defendant is relevant</font></pre>

          and contributory negligence applied in
          relation to compensatory damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[114]     While it may be that the facts of Moase v. Royal Bank</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive damages, I cannot say that it was not open to conclude</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to communicate information to the bank and other conduct</font></pre>
