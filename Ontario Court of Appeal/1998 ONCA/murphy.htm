    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Little Memphis Cabaret Inc. (&quot;Little Memphis&quot;) appeals from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Zuber dated December</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">9, 1996.  The action arises out of damages for injuries sustained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by James Eldon Murphy (&quot;Murphy&quot;), in an assault which took place</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after 1:00 a.m. on July 19, 1992, outside of a tavern located in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the City of Windsor, and owned by Little Memphis. The appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as to liability only.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The assault on the respondent Murphy, which occasioned his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant injuries, took place after he and his friend,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Terrance Cairns, were ejected from the tavern. The injuries were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inflicted by one or more of four other patrons with whom they had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been fighting in the tavern.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge found, on conflicting evidence, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Murphy and Cairns were put out the front door of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tavern at the same time that the group of four patrons, three of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whom were clearly troublemakers, were put out the back door. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made the finding, with which we cannot interfere, that &quot;it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eminently foreseeable that when Murphy and Cairns were ejected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the tavern that they would be attacked by one or more of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">group of four&quot;. On the basis of these findings, and after citing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jordan House v. Menow, [1974] S.C.R. 239 and Dunn v. Dominion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Atlantic Railway (1920), 52 D.L.R. 149, he found:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In both those cases the duty to use
          reasonable care in expelling a patron related
          to an intoxicated patron. However, I do not
          regard the principle that emerges from those
          cases as being confined to the intoxicated
          patron.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is not necessary or even prudent to
          attempt to define the outer limit of that
          duty. The strength of the common law rests in
          its experimental and inductive quality -
          moving from case to case in the development
          of principle. In this case it is sufficient
          to say that the tavern owner had an
          obligation to exercise reasonable care in
          expelling Murphy from the tavern in view of
          the fact that imminent danger which
          originated within the tavern awaited him
          outside the door.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We agree with this application of the law to the facts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  It was argued on appeal that there was evidence before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge of contributory negligence on the part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Murphy. However, there is no evidence in this record</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Murphy precipitated the conflict in the tavern or in what</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took place outside. He was a regular patron of the tavern and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence was that he had never caused any problems. In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submission of the respondent, he was the least culpable of all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the participants in the fracas in the tavern.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  While the trial judge did not deal specifically with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue, we are told that it was not argued before him. In any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">event, it is quite clear that there is no basis for a finding on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this record of contributory negligence on the part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Murphy.
