</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted of robbery and aggravated
assault. He was sentenced to 12 months secure custody and 6
months open custody, followed by probation for 18 months.  He
appeals against his convictions and seeks leave to appeal his
disposition.

The conviction appeal
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On behalf of the appellant, Ms. Paine advanced three grounds
in support of the conviction appeal:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  the trial judge effectively required the
          appellant to prove motive to fabricate on the
          part of Crown witnesses and thereby shifted
          the burden of proof to the appellant;
          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  the trial judge effectively required the
          appellant to offer further evidence of the
          malfunctioning truck muffler that figured
          prominently in the defence; and
          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  the trial judge erred in his approach to
          the assessment of the evidence and failed to
          assess that evidence in the manner
          contemplated by R. v. W. (D.) (1991), 63
          C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  On the first ground, it must be acknowledged that the trial
judge's reasons for conviction are, in places, discursive and
difficult to follow.  Reasons for conviction, however, must be
read as a whole and ought not to be analyzed by dissecting them
into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation as if it
described, or was intended to describe, a legal principle applied
by the trial judge: R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at
204.  In weighing credibility, it is appropriate for a trier of
fact to consider a witness' motive or lack of motive to fabricate
and, although the trial judge dealt with the subject at
considerable length, we are not persuaded that he shifted the
onus to the appellant to prove such motive nor that he equated
credibility with the absence of such motive.  We would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.


[4]  The second ground related to the treatment of the defence
evidence regarding the allegedly broken muffler on the truck used
by the appellant and his mother.  The condition of the muffler at
the time the offences were committed was a significant factor,
and it was not unusual for the trial judge to give the subject a
great deal of attention in his reasons. In the end, his
assessment formed only part of his reason for finding that the
appellant's mother and the appellant were in error in their
evidence on the question when the truck was and was not in use;
there was also evidence, which the trial judge noted, from the
witnesses Rose </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kling and J.R. that figured in this conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.


[5]  The third ground was that the trial judge failed to analyze
the evidence in accordance with the methodology indicated in
W.(D.) and thus never considered the &quot;middle road&quot; to acquittal.
There are two answers to this submission.  The first is that
reasons for conviction in a trial by judge alone are not intended
to be, and should not be, read as a verbalization of the entire
process engaged in by the trial judge in reaching a verdict:
Morrissey, at p. 204.  The second is that a reading of the trial
judge's reasons as a whole in the present case confirms that he
was sensitive to the correct burden and standard of proof and did
not make the error of which the appellant complains.  We would
not give effect to this ground of appeal.

The disposition appeal
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Two other persons were involved in the incident that led to
the appellant's convictions. One was J.R., who was also a young
person and who actually beat and robbed the victim; the other was
Roger Vienneau, who was an adult and who waited with the
appellant in the pickup truck while the incident was taking
place.  J.R. was originally sentenced to 2 years secure custody
followed by 4 months of open custody followed by 12 months of
probation. On appeal, this court reduced that disposition to 12
months secure custody followed by 6 months open custody followed
by 18 months probation.  Vienneau, who pleaded guilty and who had
a lengthy criminal record, was sentenced to 20 months
incarceration. The appellant received the same disposition as
this court had imposed upon J.R. on the hearing of his appeal.


[7]  In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge canvassed the
facts relating to the offence and the sentences imposed on J.R.
and Vienneau.  He noted the mitigating and aggravating factors
relative to the appellant's situation, and addressed the issue of
disparity. He found that the involvement of the appellant was
either the same as, or perhaps greater than, that of Vienneau,
and he found as well that the appellant was no less culpable than
J.R., who actually committed the robbery and administered the
beating of the victim.  We see no error in principle in the trial
judge's determination of the appropriate disposition to be
imposed upon the appellant, nor any basis to suggest that the
disposition was unreasonable or unfit.  We would not interfere
with that disposition.

Disposition

[8]  For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed, leave to appeal against disposition is granted but the
appeal against disposition is likewise dismissed.</font></pre></td>
