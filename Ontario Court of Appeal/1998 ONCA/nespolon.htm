    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[1]  An evening which started with a teenager drinking too much

in a friend's home, ended four hours later with his being run

over and killed on a roadway.  As a result of the boy's death,

the driver who ran him over suffered nervous shock, or post

traumatic stress.  The issue in this appeal is whether the driver

should recover damages for this psychological injury from the

estate of the dead youth, or from the two teenagers who had been

with the youth shortly before he was killed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
The Trial Judge's Findings</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[2]  On Friday night, April 8, 1988, in Harrow, Ontario, Kevin

Snider and his best friend, Brian Carson, went to the home of

Arthur Pavao at around 8:00 p.m.  They were joined there by some

of their other friends, including Chris Wurfel.  Kevin Snider was

14 years old;  his friends were no older than 16.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[3]  Pavao, whose parents were not home, gave Snider a 2 litre

pop bottle 3/4 full of homemade wine.  Pavao had seen Snider

drink at parties before.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[4]  Kevin Snider, Brian Carson and Chris Wurfel then went to

Wurfel's home to watch a video.  Snider had brought the wine with

him and was the only one to drink it.  By about 10:30 p.m., when

the three boys left Wurfel's home to go to a dance at their high

school, Snider had drunk most of it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[5]  When Wurfel, Carson and Snider arrived at the school, Snider

was wobbling and his speech was slurred.  Carson persuaded him to

wait in the parking lot rather than going into the school in his

condition.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[6]  After only a short time at the school, Carson and Wurfel,

along with a few other friends who had been at the dance, decided

to go to the Burger King in neighbouring Amherstburg, about

twenty minutes from Harrow.  On the drive from Harrow to

Amherstburg, Kevin Snider threw up twice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[7]  When they reached the Amherstburg Burger King, Kevin Snider

stayed in Wurfel's car.  Wurfel and Carson joined their friends,

Justin Alford and Kyle Berard, in the restaurant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[8]  At around 11:45 p.m., when Wurfel and Carson decided to

return to Harrow because they had curfews, Snider told them he

did not want to go home yet.  As a result, he was helped into the

back seat of Justin Alford's car by Wurfel and Carson, who then

returned to Harrow.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[9]  Alford and Berard, who were 16, said they found Snider in

Alford's car.  They helped him out and were in the process of

taking him into the Burger King when they were confronted by a

police officer who told them they could not take Snider into the

restaurant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[10] The police officer gave evidence that on arriving at the

Burger King parking lot after 11:30 p.m. that night, he saw three

males standing and talking beside a car, a two-door Chevrolet

Nova.  When one of them fell, the officer got out of his car to

approach the other two males, who turned out to be Justin Alford

and Kyle Berard.  The police officer said the male who fell,

Kevin Snider, was &quot;falling down drunk.&quot;  Thinking the three males

were between 19 and 21 years old, he told Alford and Berard that

if they did not agree to take him to Harrow, Snider would spend

the night in jail.  Snider was placed back into the Alford

vehicle, and the boys left the Burger King parking lot for

Harrow.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[11] A third party action against the police officer was

dismissed on consent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[12] On the way back to Harrow, Alford drove, Berard occupied the

passenger seat, and Kevin Snider was in the back seat.  There was

&quot;playful banter,&quot; with Alford and Berard teasing Snider about his

drunken condition.  Snider had abrasions on his chin from a fall

earlier in the evening.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[13] Around midnight, the boys stopped at a Mac's Milk/Shell

station for gas when they reached Harrow.  According to Kyle

Berard, a brief discussion took place there between him and

Alford about what to do with Snider.  They were not sure where

Snider lived, and wondered whether they should call his parents

to have him picked up.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[14] While in the Mac's Milk store, Alford and Berard ran into

their friend David Slobodnick, whom they agreed to drive home.

Slobodnick sat in the front seat between Alford and Berard.

Slobodnick was a friend of Kevin Snider.  Until he entered the

vehicle and saw him in the back seat, he did not know that Snider

was also being driven home.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[15] When the boys approached a home belonging to the Henesy

family, Kevin Snider said he knew them and asked to be let out.

As the middle passenger in the front seat of a two-door car,

Slobodnick hunched forward to permit that seat to be moved

forward for Snider's exit.  Slobodnick thought he heard sounds

indicating that Snider fell at the side of the road when he got

out of the back seat.  The evidence of Alford and Berard was that

they did not know that Snider had fallen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[16] After leaving Snider in front of the Henesy home,  Alford,

Berard and Slobodnick drove for a short distance, but soon turned

back to look for Snider.  They found him 60 or 70 feet from where

they had dropped him off, walking across lawns.  He was, the

trial judge found, &quot;either staggering or in some manner moving

forward quickly ... in an effort to maintain himself on his

feet.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[17] The three boys continued driving, but again returned to

check on Snider.  When they returned this time, they found that

there had been an accident involving Snider.


[18] They drove to Berard's home where they decided that they

would contact the police the next day and provide information.

They also called Chris Wurfel, who had been with Snider earlier

in the evening, to tell him that Snider had been in an accident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[19] Floyd Stroud and his wife were driving in the car behind the

Alford vehicle.  When his car was about 300 feet away, Stroud saw

the brake lights of the car ahead of him come on when it pulled

over to the side of the road.  He said he saw a &quot;body tumble out,

head over heels.&quot;  As the car again proceeded ahead of him,

Stroud saw that the two passengers in the car were looking

backward through the rear window.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[20] As he actually passed Snider, Stroud saw that he was on the

side of the road at the edge of the Henesy lawn, struggling to

get up.  He was wearing a dark red jacket, blue jeans, and white

sneakers.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[21] Stroud continued to drive for about a mile before deciding

with his wife to return to see if the person needed help.  He

found Snider about 70 feet from where he had last seen him,

staggering and leaning forward.  Snider, who was on a lawn on the

other side of the street from Stroud, turned his face towards

Stroud.  Stroud thought he saw abrasions around Snider's mouth.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[22] Stroud slowed his speed down to about 10 m.p.h., rolled down

his window, called to Snider and asked him if he needed help.

Snider's answer was unintelligible, but he started to walk

towards Stroud, who had stopped his car at the side of the road,

leaving his headlights on low beam.  Stroud's car was facing

north with the two right wheels off the roadway.  Snider was

crossing the southbound lane towards Stroud when he fell near the

centre line of the road.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[23] Stroud noticed an oncoming vehicle proceeding at about 25

m.p.h. in the southbound lane where Snider had fallen.  By the

time Stroud got out of his car, the oncoming vehicle, a pick-up

truck, was directly opposite him.  The driver was looking

straight ahead.  Stroud saw no brake lights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[24] The truck struck Snider two or three seconds after Stroud

first noticed the vehicle, and dragged his body for more than 50

feet before it stopped on the southbound shoulder.   Snider was

killed.  The driver's words to Stroud, right after the accident,

were &quot;My God, where did he come from?  I didn't see him.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[25] The driver was Gary Nespolon.  He was returning from having

picked up some Chinese food after his work shift ended at 11:00

p.m.  As he was proceeding south, his eyes were drawn to a set of

headlights on a car stopped on the opposite side of the road,

facing north.  This was the Stroud car.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[26] At almost the same time that he was distracted by those

headlights, he heard a &quot;thump, thump.&quot;  Thinking he had struck an

animal, he brought his vehicle to a stop.  To his shock, he

discovered that he had hit a young boy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[27] There was nothing unusual about the weather or road

conditions that night, and no evidence of either speeding or

drinking on the part of Gary Nespolon.  The trial judge found

that the lighting on the street was &quot;not very bright.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[28] Nespolon was distraught as a result of the accident.

Instead of going into his house when he got home, he was found

crying behind the garage by his wife.  He did not sleep that

first night and took the next week off work.  He started having

nightmares, and became withdrawn and short-tempered with his

family.  There was so serious a personality change, that his

continuing anger and insensitivity resulted in the estrangement

of two of his three sons and in two separations from his wife.

He was hospitalized  twice for psychiatric care.  A pre-existing

serious back injury became more painful.  He continued to feel

guilt.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[29] Dr. William McDermot, a clinical psychologist, first saw

Nespolon 7 years after the accident in February, 1995.  He

identified Nespolon's condition as resulting from &quot;post traumatic

stress disorder&quot; requiring at least five years of treatment.  In

his view, Nespolon's guilt was &quot;irrational.&quot;  Dr. McDermot's

prognosis was guarded.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[30] The trial judge made a finding that Nespolon was not guilty

of negligence.  In his words:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
          ... I think the circumstances of those [sic]
          dark clothing, the dark area, the relatively
          unlit area, the blackness of the road, the
          existence of the Stroud lights where they
          were, all were complicit in precluding the
          possibility of Mr. Nespolon seeing Snider,
          and as a consequence I make no finding,
          indeed, I cannot find Nespolon guilty of any
          negligence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[31] He also absolved Arthur Pavao and his parents of any

liability.  The trial judge found that while Pavao could

theoretically be found negligent in giving a 14-year old so much

wine, there were so many intervening acts between Snider drinking

the wine and the accident itself, that the foreseeability of the

accident and its consequences were too remote to make findings of

negligence against either Arthur Pavao or his parents.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[32] The action was also dismissed against David Slobodnick.  He

was a passenger joining the group at the end of the evening's

events, and had so little  -  or no  -  control over the

circumstances or decisions that led to the accident, that the

trial judge found he owed no duty of care to Snider.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[33] A duty of care was, however, attributed to Justin Alford and

Kyle Berard.  The trial judge found that they took responsibility

for Snider at the Burger King in Amherstburg.  He explicitly

rejected the evidence of Justin Alford that responsibility was

taken only because of the pressure of the police officer, yet it

is worth noting that his findings about the conversation between

the officer and Alford and Berard seem to confirm this pressure:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          I accept ... these findings ... that the
          officer asked whether they were acquaintances
          or friends.  When he found that they were  he
          asked where they were from and found they
          were all from Harrow, and he offered the
          observations at that point that unless he was
          taken home he was going to be run in, and I
          accept that Alford and Berard agreed at that
          point and accepted the responsibility of
          taking him back to Harrow and taking him
          home.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[34] This exchange, the trial judge concluded, created a duty of

care from Alford and Berard to Snider that they would take him

home safely or to a place of safety.  By leaving him at the side

of the road in his condition, they knew or ought to have known

that not only would Snider likely injure himself, but that he

would also create an emergency situation and danger to others who

were using the highway.  The trial judge speculated that the

possibility of such danger was what motivated the boys to return

twice after they had dropped Snider off.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[35] The deceased, Kevin Snider, was also found to be negligent.

The trial judge found that Snider owed a duty of care to those

&quot;who might likely become involved as a result of his ... drinking

... wine to the extent that he became inebriated.&quot;  By choosing

to drink to the point of drunkenness, he knew or ought to have

known that he might become a danger to himself and others.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[36] Having concluded that Justin Alford, Kyle Berard, and Kevin

Snider were negligent, the trial judge found that Gary Nespolon's

post traumatic stress, or nervous shock, was foreseeable and

therefore compensable in damages.  Relying on Bechard v.

Haliburton Estate (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 512 (C.A.), where an

innocent bystander in the role of a rescuer recovered damages for

nervous shock, the trial judge found Nespolon's nervous shock to

be even more foreseeable than that suffered by the successful

plaintiff in Bechard.  The following statement summarizes his

conclusion:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          ... I am of the view that the public
          generally and the ordinary reasonable man,
          even to the extent of the ordinary reasonable
          16 year old, ought to be aware, and indeed in
          law should and is aware, ... that a person
          who is made to be the instrument of another's
          death, and then exits his vehicle and sees
          the mangled remains is likely to suffer the
          exact horrendous damages that have been
          sustained by Mr. Nespolon.  [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[37] As a result of nervous shock, the trial judge held that Gary

Nespolon was entitled to recover $39,000 by way of general

damages;  $49,048.07 for lost wages;  $28,875.00 for future

medical treatments based on Dr. McDermot's 5-year psychological

treatment proposal;  and 60% of whatever future wage losses were

determined to have taken place for the rest of Nespolon's working

life, as determined by a master on a reference (forty percent was

found to be attributable to the pre-existing back injury).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[38] Justin Alford (and his father Jim Alford, who was the car's

registered owner), Kyle Berard, and the Estate of Kevin Snider

were each found liable to contribute 1/3 of the damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[39] The Alfords, Kyle Berard, and Kevin Snider's Estate each

appealed from the findings of negligence and liability.  Gary

Nespolon cross-appealed from the assessment of damages, seeking

an increase in the amounts awarded to him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[40] Although courts have been divided as to the precise

categorization of all the elements of negligence, three broad

concepts have been firmly established within which the requisite

elements fall, namely, a duty of care, a breach of the duty and

damage resulting from that breach.  Although they may be treated

within the foregoing broader categories or as separate elements,

the concepts of the standard of care, foreseeability and

proximity or remoteness are also part of any ultimate

determination of negligence (Allen M. Linden, Canadian Tort Law,

6th ed. (Toronto:  Butterworths, 1997) at p. 99).  While the

precise division of the elements may differ, and some may be

viewed interchangeably, all of the foregoing elements must be

brought together to determine negligence liability (Crocker v.

Sundance, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1186).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[41] The Supreme Court of Canada addressed the problem of the

overlapping nature of the concepts in negligence in Kamloops v.

Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2.  After reviewing the prevailing

English jurisprudence, Wilson J. provided that the following two

questions must be answered in order to establish whether a duty

of care exists (at pp. 10-11):</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          (1)  is there a sufficiently close
          relationship between the parties so that, in
          the reasonable contemplation of the [alleged
          tortfeasor], carelessness on its part might
          cause damage to that person?  If so,</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          (2)  are there any considerations which ought
          to negative or limit (a) the scope of the
          duty and (b) the class of persons to whom it
          is owed or (c) the damages to which a breach
          of it may give rise?</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[42] A duty of care will only be found where the resultant harm

is reasonably foreseeable. In order to determine whether the harm

was or ought to have been foreseeable, one examines the proximity

of the relationship between the parties and the probability of

the harm actually occurring (Yeun Kun-Yeu v. A-G Hong Kong,

[1987] 2 All E.R. 705 at 712 (P.C.);  Nova Mink Ltd. v. Trans-

Canada Airlines, [1951] 2 D.L.R. 241 at 265 (N.S.S.C.), see also

B.D.C. Ltd. v. Hofstrand Farms Ltd., [1986] 1 S.C.R. 228;  School

Division of Assiniboine South No. 3 v. Hoffer et al. (1971), 21

D.L.R. (3d) 608 (Man. C.A.), aff'd. (1973), 40 D.L.R. (3d) 480

(S.C.C.)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[43] In his text The Law of Torts in Canada, Professor G.H.L.

Fridman confirms this nexus as follows:  &quot;[f]oreseeability of

harm is a necessary ingredient of a relationship that is apt to

give rise to a duty of care.&quot;  (Vol. 1 (Toronto:  Carswell, 1989)

at p. 235).  Foreseeability, in other words, arises where the

harm resulting from the conduct of the defendant was, or ought to

have been contemplated by the alleged wrongdoer as a probable

consequence of his or her actions (at p. 238).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[44] As characterized by Fridman, &quot;[o]nly if what happened is

considered to be a natural and probable result of what the

defendant did or omitted to do will the defendant be regarded as

having behaved so unreasonably as to be guilty of negligence,

i.e. of conduct falling short of the standards of the ordinary

reasonable man&quot; (Fridman, supra, at p. 291, see also Town of

Prescott v. Connell (1893), 22 S.C.R. 147, per Sedgewick J.).  As

Major J. states in Stewart v. Pettie, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 131 (at p.

150):</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          One of the primary purposes of negligence law
          is to enforce reasonable standards of conduct
          so as to prevent the creation of reasonably
          foreseeable risks.  In this way, tort law
          serves as a disincentive to risk-creating
          behaviour.  To impose liability even where
          the risk which materialized was not
          reasonably foreseeable is to lay a portion of
          the loss at the feet a party who has, in the
          circumstances, acted reasonably.  Tort law
          does not require the wisdom of Solomon.  All
          it requires is that people act reasonably in
          the circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[45] Turning then to the circumstances in this case, it is

necessary first to address the appellants' submission that the

trial judge's finding that Gary Nespolon was not negligent,

should be overturned.  Stroud's evidence, which the trial judge

accepted, supports this submission. The lighting was good enough

that Stroud could see the faces of the two passengers in a car

100 feet ahead of him when they turned around to look at snider

after dropping him off.  There is no evidence of any explanation

for Nespolon failing to see Snider either walking on the road or

after he had fallen, even though Snider fell only two or three

seconds before being struck by Nespolon's truck.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[46] While I might not have made the same findings of fact with

respect to Nespolon's driving that evening, they were findings

which the trial judge was entitled to make.  Absent palpable and

overriding error, there is no basis for interfering with those

findings of fact.  While there may have been some errors, they

are not enough, in my view, to disturb his overall finding.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[47] Even accepting the trial judge's findings of fact, however,

for the reasons that follow I cannot agree with his legal

conclusion that Nespolon was entitled to recover damages for

nervous shock in this case.  In particular, I am unable to agree

that Nespolon's nervous shock was reasonably foreseeable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[48] The trial judge defined the duty of care owed by Alford and

Berard to Kevin Snider and Nespolon as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          They owed a duty of care to Snider to assure
          to him personally that he be taken safely
          home or to a place of safety, and that he not
          be merely abandoned at the side of the road
          where they knew or ought to have known, 16
          years old or otherwise, that in his condition
          he was likely not only to do damage to
          himself but to create an emergency situation
          and a danger to others using that highway.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[49] Alford and Berard were two  16 year-old boys who were

required by a police officer to take their inebriated 14 year-old

acquaintance back to Harrow.  Although Snider's care was imposed

on them, I am nonetheless of the view that this required that

they behave responsibly towards Snider.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[50] The inquiry, then, is whether there was, in fact,

appropriate behaviour in the circumstances, or, &quot;... whether the

steps taken by the defendants were sufficient to discharge the

burden placed on them.&quot;  (Stewart v. Pettie, supra at p. 147, per

Major J.).  This depends on whether in dropping Snider off in

front of the Henesy home they ought to have reasonably foreseen

the probability that Gary Nespolon could suffer post traumatic

stress.  If this risk was not reasonably foreseeable, there is no

basis for imposing liability since &quot;the sine qua non of tortious

liability remains the foreseeability of risk.&quot; (Stewart v.

Pettie, supra, at p. 150).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[51] In my view, there was no causal connection between dropping

Snider off and the injury suffered by Nespolon.  Feeling they had

no choice, Alford and Berard agreed to take Snider back to Harrow

but did not know exactly where he lived.  They dropped him off at

the place where he asked to be dropped off -- in front of a house

whose occupants he said he knew. They had no reason to question

his request. As Major J. said in Stewart v. Pettie, supra, at p.

150:  &quot;Tort law does not require the wisdom of Solomon.  All it

requires is that people act reasonably in the circumstances.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[52] The reasonableness of the behaviour must also be considered

in light of the boys' ages and experience in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[53] In determining the appropriate standard of care for

children, the test is whether a child exercised the care expected

from children of like age, intelligence and experience (McErlean

v. Sarel et al. (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 396 at pp. 411-12 (C.A.) and

McEllister v. Etches, [1956] S.C.R. 787;  Heisler v. Moke, [1972]

2 O.R. 446 at p. 448 (H.C.J.) (per Addy J.), see also Downing v.

Grand Trunk Rly Co. (1921), 49 O.L.R. 36 at p. 40 (H.C.)).  This

is both an objective and subjective standard, which acknowledges

the need for individualized treatment along with the need for

consistency in the law (see also Linden, supra, at p. 139).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[54] This court has refined that test by holding that when

children engage in adult activity, they will be held to the same

standard as adults (McErlean v. Sarel, supra, at p. 412).  But it

is the specific activity giving rise to the allegation of

negligence one examines, not whether the overall activity is

normally an adult one.  That means that in this case, although

Alford and Berard were engaged in driving, an adult activity, the

alleged negligent activity under examination was in dropping

Kevin Snider off at the side of the highway in front of the

Henesy home.  This, in my view, cannot be said to be a

particularly adult activity, and there is, therefore, no basis

for holding the boys to an adult standard for their behaviour in

this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[55] Alford and Berard themselves had never been drunk and had no

knowledge of how that would affect someone's ability to make

decisions.  Snider was an acquaintance, and they felt responsible

enough to drop him off at the side of the road, at his request,

in front of a home he was familiar with. It is difficult to say

what more they could have done in the circumstances, short of

demanding that Snider tell them where he lived, and insist on

taking him home even if he himself did not want to go home.

There was no evidence that Berard or Alford had any realistic

alternative to what they did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[56] Any duty arising from the obligation to comply with the

officer's demands that Snider be taken back to Harrow did not

necessarily require that he be dropped off at his home;  it

required that he be dropped off in Harrow at a reasonable

location.  The Henesy property was a such reasonable location.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[57] Based on their experience, and based too on seeing Snider

walking in apparent safety across lawns the first time they drove

back to check on him, there was no reason for Berard and Alford

to suspect that Snider was at risk, let alone that he would fall

on the road, causing the risk of nervous shock to a stranger.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[58] In Bechard v. Haliburton Estate, supra, at 512, Griffiths

J.A. stated the test for determining whether nervous shock was

compensable:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
          ... reasonable foresight of nervous shock to
          the plaintiff is the touchstone of liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
(See also Duwyn et al. v. Kaprielian (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 736 at

p. 747 (C.A.), per Morden J.A.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[59] The trial judge correctly stated this as the applicable test

when he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          &quot;... foreseeability of risk to the person who
          has suffered the nervous shock or the post
          traumatic stress system.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">But in my view he erred in concluding that the risk of harm to

Nespolon was reasonably foreseeable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[60] There was, in my view, no reasonable foreseeability that any

risk created by the behaviour of Snider, Alford or Berard could

include &quot;nervous shock&quot; to someone in Gary  Nespolon's position.

The possibility that on a clear, dry night a driver would be

sufficiently distracted not to notice Snider walking - or falling

- on the road, was too remote to be within anyone's reasonable

contemplation, let alone these two 16 year-old boys.  The further

prospect that this distracted driver would be so traumatized by

having caused Snider's death that nervous shock would ensue, is

even further from reasonable foreseeability in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[61] I conclude, therefore, that there was no fault in dropping

Snider off in front of the Henessy home, and no causal connection

between this behaviour and Nespolon's nervous shock.  It was

simply too remote and unreasonable to expect that Alford and

Berard would foresee that dropping Snider off where they did

could lead to Nespolon's nervous shock.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[62] As for Snider, the trial judge found the following breach of

the duty of care:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          ... Snider ... owed a duty to those persons
          who might likely become involved as a result
          of his imbibing and his drinking of wine to
          the extent that he became inebriated,
          &quot;falling down drunk&quot; in the words of the
          officer ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          I am of the view, quite frankly, that he
          chose to drink, and that in that choosing he
          knew or ought to have known that he might
          ultimately become a danger to himself or
          others, and I find him negligent in the
          consuming of alcohol to the extent that he
          became inebriated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[63] The remoteness of the foreseeability of risk of nervous

shock applies to Snider as well.  In this case too, one must

consider age and experience. It is simply not reasonable to

conclude that this 14 year-old boy could foresee that by getting

drunk at his friend's house earlier in the evening, he could end

up falling on a road in the middle of Harrow and cause a driver

running him over to develop post traumatic stress.  He neither

owed nor breached any duty of care to a passing motorist like

Nespolon.  The relationship was too remote, as was the

foreseeability of nervous shock occurring as it did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[64] There is no doubt that the accident was traumatic for

Nespolon, as it must have been for Alford and Berard, for Stroud,

and undoubtedly for the Snider family.  Every accident causes

someone distress.  But this does not mean that his shock at

having discovered that he had killed a young boy entitles

Nespolon to recover damages from that boy's estate or his two

young friends, unless he can show that his injury was within the

ambit of the risk arising out of their conduct.  As Justice

Linden points out in Canadian Tort Law, at p. 97:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          ... negligence law does not aim to compensate
          everyone  -  only those whose injuries result
          from someone else's faulty conduct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[65] A number of circumstances have been held by the courts to

fall within the ambit of risk leading to liability for nervous

shock.  These include whether there was a relationship between

the tortfeasor and the injured person, whether the injured person

was acting as a rescuer, and whether the injured person

anticipated or saw the accident.  None of these circumstances are

present here.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[66] The issue then becomes whether there are any policy reasons

to add someone in Nespolon's circumstances to this class of

persons entitled to recover damage for nervous shock.  In Hall v.

Hebert, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 159, Cory J. said, at p. 203:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          ... even if a duty of care is found to exist,
          the court will have to determine whether, for
          public policy reasons, that duty should be
          limited in part or in whole.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">The cautionary words of Griffiths J.A. in Bechard, supra, at p.

120, are particularly apposite in deciding whether policy grounds

justify Nespolon recovering damages from the three boys:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The &quot;policy grounds&quot; that have concerned the
          courts in these cases is that there should
          not be unlimited liability to persons who
          suffer nervous shock.  The perceived danger
          is that every accident may generate an ever-
          widening circle of plaintiffs including,
          possibly, the casual passerby who witnesses
          the accident and those who come to gaze at
          the scene later, as well as the relatives of
          all of those to whom the details will be
          recounted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[67] In my view, there are no policy reasons to justify expanding

the category of those whose nervous shock is compensable, to

include a stranger in Nespolon's circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[68] Nespolon's nervous shock is too remote from any relationship

with or behaviour of Alford, Berard and Snider to be compensated

in damages from any of them.  Nespolon's injuries, in other

words, were not caused by or related to any fault on the part of

any of the three boys, and were not reasonably foreseeable by

them.  There has therefore been no breach of any duty of care.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[69] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial

judge with costs throughout.  The cross-appeal of Gary Nespolon

is dismissed with costs.

    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">BROOKE J.A. (in dissent)</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[70] This is a tragic case. The deceased, Snider, a 14-year-old

youth, drank to the point where he became very drunk and was run

over and killed after he collapsed on a highway. The sixteen year

old appellants became involved when their friends, Wurfel and

Carson, who had care of Snider, as a joke, placed him in the

appellants’ car and left them to look after him. The respondent,

who killed Snider by running him over, suffered nervous shock

from the accident, for which he was held blameless.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[71] With respect, I cannot agree with the judgment of Madam

Justice Abella.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[72] The trial judge delivered thorough reasons. He made clear

findings of credibility and fact, with which I do not think we

should interfere, and, in my opinion, has correctly resolved the

issues as to liability of the appellants, Alford, Berard and the

Estate of Kevin Snider.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[73] Put shortly, I think the trial judge’s view of the facts as

against Alford and Berard was that they accepted the

responsibility of caring for Snider who was so drunk that he had

difficulty standing and needed assistance to move meaningfully

for any distance. They knew this, and that he could not make it

on his own, so they had agreed to take him home. But they failed

to take him home or to assist him to safe place; rather, they

left him struggling at the roadside and drove off. When they

returned, they found him staggering aimlessly across the lawns by

the road and did nothing to help him.  By the time they returned

a second time and passed him, Snider had staggered onto the

highway, collapsed and been killed.  I agree with only some of my

colleagues’ statements as to the findings of the trial judge.  In

the circumstances, I think it is best to quote directly from the

reasons as to many of them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[74] At about eight o’clock in the evening, Kevin Snider obtained

a two-litre bottle of homemade wine from Arthur Pavao. It was

three quarters full. He did not share it and by the time he and

his two companions, Wurfel and Carson, left in Wurfel’s car to go

to their high school dance he had consumed most of it. As to

Snider’s condition at that time, the trial judge said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               The best evidence, I think, of the
          condition of Mr. Snider at the time, was that
          observed by Mr. Carson, and that was, I
          believe in his words, that he was getting
          drunker and getting to a point where he
          couldn’t handle it. He was in fact wobbling,
          he was slurred of speech to the point that
          when they arrived at the Harrow High School,
          his friend, Brian Carson, thought that Snider
          might best not present himself at the school
          doors, and indeed prevailed on him to stay in
          the parking lot.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[75] While they were at the high school, Berard saw Snider in

Wurfel’s car. He was lying on the back seat. After a short time,

a group of people, including Wurfel, Carson, Snider, Alford and

Berard, left the school for the Burger King. Snider was very

drunk. The trial judge said:

          I find that a decision was taken, clearly by
          a number of those at the high school, but
          certainly by Wurfel and Carson and Alford and
          Berard, and another party by the name of
          Squires, that they would go to the Burger
          King in Amherstburg, and they did, and I find
          that the trip is of some 20 minutes duration,
          and that during that trip Snider occupied the
          passenger side front seat of the Wurfel
          vehicle, Carson was in the rear, and that
          while engaged in that trip it was necessary
          to pull the vehicle over by reason that
          Snider had become ill, had vomited upon
          himself in the car, and on exiting the car
          was sick again, was assisted out of the
          vehicle by Carson who felt it necessary to
          render that assistance by reason of the
          worsening condition of Snider, and that while
          out of the vehicle Snider found it
          impossible, or at least at the time, not
          possible to stand, and fell, inflicting on
          himself a small abrasion to his chin or ear.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[76] At the Burger King, Wurfel and Carson put Snider in Alford’s

car without Alford’s consent and left. The trial judge said:

          I find that Wurfel and Carson had an early
          curfew and that it was necessary that they
          return to Harrow, and on their going back to
          the vehicle, engaged in some conversation
          with Snider who made it clear that he did not
          wish to return to Harrow at that point, and
          that while Carson remained with him, Wurfel
          returned to the restaurant and may have had
          some conversation. That conversation, if it
          had to do with Snider, is denied by Alford
          and Berard, but suffice it to say that I find
          that on a return to the vehicle, Wurfel and
          Carson removed Snider from the Wurfel vehicle
          and placed him in the back seat of the Alford
          vehicle and left, returning to Harrow.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">                              . . . .
                                </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          It is clear that when this transfer was
          taking place, and I find, that Snider was
          incapable of making this move on his own and
          required assistance to stand.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[77] When Alford and Berard returned to their car, they found

Snider lying on the back seat. Berard’s evidence was that they

got him out and were walking him around; that they had to do

something about Kevin; that he was having trouble standing up;

and, that he fell down in front of the police officer who

arrived. The trial judge said:

          Constable McWhinny of the Amherstburg Police
          Department gave evidence that on the night in
          question he attended at the Burger King at or
          about the hour of 11:30 to 11:40, and that on
          arrival at the parking lot he saw three
          persons, three male persons, standing near a
          vehicle. He gave evidence which I accept and
          find, that he did not leave his vehicle but
          from his cruiser that he observed that there
          was some talking going on between the three
          male persons and that the one appeared to be
          let go and fell, or dropped to the pavement,
          and that he formed the opinion, from his
          position, which I take and find to have been
          less than a car length away, that the person
          who I find to have Snider, was, in the words
          of the officer, “falling down drunk.”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[78] Alford and Berard, like Wurfel and Carson, were sixteen

years old. The police officer thought they were older. There was

a conflict in the evidence of the police officer and Alford and

Berard as to what transpired between them.  The trial judge made

the following findings of fact and credibility in that regard:

          I accept the evidence of the police officer
          and find that a short conversation took place
          between the remaining two individuals, and
          that the officer asked whether they were
          friends of the person who had fallen, and
          that a response in the affirmative was made.
          I find that he further, he, the police
          officer, inquired as to whether or not they
          could or would take Snider home, failing
          which he would spend the night in jail, and
          although contested by Berard and Alford, I
          reject their evidence and find and accept the
          evidence of the police officer, that there
          was no objection taken and that indeed they
          accepted to take Snider back to Harrow, they
          having advised the officer that they were all
          from Harrow.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The officer gave evidence that he thought
          that the ages of these three ranged between
          19 and 21. He was clearly in error, but there
          is no doubt that all three were large boys
          for their age, 5’6”, 5’9”, ranging from 165
          to 170 pounds. Berard may perhaps have been
          the smallest of group at 140 and 5’6”. In any
          event, Snider, I find, was placed back in the
          Alford vehicle, or from the police officer’
          perspective, placed into the Alford vehicle,
          the vehicle left the parking lot, made the
          appropriate turn and exited the town.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[79]  Alford’s evidence was that it was their intention to take

Snider home because it was the appropriate thing to do because

Snider was drunk and was disoriented.  Berard’s evidence was that

they put Snider back in the car. He was lying on the back seat.

They drove to Mac’s Milk Shell station and teased Snider about

his drunken condition. The trial judge said:

          I was able to glean from the evidence of
          Justin Alford and Kyle Berard, that on
          leaving the Burger King premise, and I find
          that they returned to Harrow, and that while
          returning they engaged in some playful banter
          in the car at the expense of Snider, joking
          with him as to his condition and his odour,
          and that there was some return conversation
          in a sense that there was some swearing from
          Snider as to the jokes being made at his
          expense.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[80] It is clear that while in the gas station, Alford and Berard

discussed what they should do. They recognized their obligation

to get Snider to a place of safety and discussed whether they

should abandon Snider, call his parents to come and pick him up

or take him home. There was no suggestion that there was any

problem determining either the Snider family’s phone number or

address. They determined they must take him home. While there,

Slobodnik, another youth joined them.  He knew Snider.  The trial

judge said:

          Berard gave evidence that in fact discussion
          took place at the Mac’s Store as to whether
          Snider ought to be abandoned at the store,
          whether in fact his parents ought to be
          called and asked to come and pick him up, or
          whether he should be taken home. Alford
          denies any recollection of that discussion,
          and I find as a fact that David Slobodnik was
          not involved in that discussion. Rather, I
          find that Slobodnik became an unwitting
          passenger in the vehicle that was going to
          take Kevin Snider home, and I accept the
          evidence of Slobodnik when he says that
          essentially he became aware of Snider when he
          went to the vehicle, Alford and Berard having
          agreed to give him a ride home, and he found
          Snider lying on the back seat of the car.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[81] They set out to drive him home. They did not reach the

Snider residence. Instead, Snider asked to be let out when he

recognized the house of a family he knew. The trial judge

accepted the evidence of Stroud, who was following the Alford

vehicle in his own vehicle, as to what happened:

          Alford was driving a Nova, Chevrolet Nova; it
          was a two door vehicle, and it appears, and I
          find, that as they were proceeding south on
          Erie Street they came to a point where in
          fact the vehicle pulled off the road. What is
          clear, and I take from and find from the
          evidence of the witness, Stroud, Floyd
          Stroud, who was, at or about the hour of
          11:30 going from his son’s home to his own
          home on Gore, and he says, and I accept and
          find, that as they were proceeding in the 50
          kilometre per hour limit stretch of Erie
          Street before it exists Harrow, that he
          became aware of another vehicle proceeding
          ahead of him, and that he became aware of
          that vehicle, something in the order of 400
          feet ahead. He says that when the vehicle was
          about 300 feet ahead, he saw it pull to the
          side, brake lights come on, and to use his
          words, I believe, he saw a “body tumble out,
          head over heels.”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          He saw no other persons exit the vehicle. The
          door closed, and when he got to within about
          100 feet of that vehicle I find that that
          vehicle then left its stopped position and
          proceeded further south on the roadway. I
          find and accept that that vehicle was indeed
          the Alford vehicle.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">                        . . . .
                           </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          He says that as he proceeded, he, Mr. Stroud,
          says that as he proceeded past the point
          where in fact the body had tumbled out of the
          car, that he saw a person on the side of the
          road struggling to get up. His evidence was
          that the person’s head seemed to be further
          down than their feet, they were struggling to
          rise, feet towards the road, head towards the
          Henesy property. The vehicle that had
          discharged this person continued down the
          road as did Mr. Stroud, and I find that after
          discussion with his wife and proceeding about
          a mile to the south, he decided to go back to
          see whether or not that person that had been
          discharged needed assistance.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[82] On these findings, it was clear that Snider fell to the

ground from the door of the car and was not able to get up. He

was still struggling to get up when Stroud passed by him. The

others had driven off, leaving him in that condition. Given that

Alford’s car was a two-door car, it seems highly improbable that

the others, who were in the front seat, would not have seen

Snider fall out of the car. Slobodnik said in his evidence that

he heard the sound of Snider falling. Berard said, after looking

at his statement to the police, that he recalled Snider falling,

that they did not stop long enough to see if he got up, and that

he did not look back to see what had happened. The trial judge 

said:

               Also, Mr. Slobodnik – and I choose my
          words here – was the only one who seemed to
          be prepared to remember that Snider had
          fallen. He gave evidence that in fact he did
          not see Snider fall but that he heard he
          believed sounds that led him to believe
          Snider fell.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[83] After driving a short distance, the appellants turned around

and drove back, looking for Snider. They observed him on the same

side of the road, staggering across the lawns, making an effort

to stay on his feet. They did not stop, but drove past him.


[84] Mr. Stroud also turned around. He was so alarmed by the

state of the person he had seen at the roadside that, after

discussing it with his wife, he decided to return to see if the

person needed any assistance. He found Snider staggering close to

the paved surface of the road some 70 feet north of where he had

seen the body exit the vehicle. The trial judge said:

          He asked, on rolling down his window, and I
          find, “Do you need help?&quot; and the mumbled
          response was completely unintelligible. He
          says that the individual started then to
          proceed to walk generally toward him, and
          that he in turn, Mr. Stroud, pulled his
          vehicle to the right, proceeding at about ten
          miles an hour, and that he succeeding in
          getting the right two wheels of his vehicle,
          he believes, off the roadway and came to a
          stop. He continued to observe the deceased,
          Snider, and I find that Snider proceeded
          across the roadway, and at a point some 30 to
          40 feet behind and to the left of the Stroud
          vehicle, and while in the southbound lane he
          made an additional two or three steps and
          then fell to the roadway, not moving again.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[85]  The appellants drove back a second time looking for Snider.

By the time they passed, he had been run over by the respondent,

whom the trial judge found to be blameless.


[86] The trial judge reviewed the evidence, including the

evidence of the appellants and Slobodnik as to their actions and

what was said and he concluded:

          Taken to its highest I have a concern at the
          similarity of the evidence ultimately
          recorded by the police and given by these
          witnesses as to how Snider exited the
          vehicle, how in fact it was determined where
          he should exit and why this abiding curiosity
          that seemed to motivate, travel back and
          forth by the scene. But what is clear is that
          in fact they chose to either allow Snider to
          exit or to assist him in exiting at the
          Henesy property, and they chose once again
          not to render assistance when it became clear
          that he was not going to the Henesy home and
          was proceeding back towards Harrow, and that
          when they came back for the third time to the
          scene, that it was too late.
        </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[87] From the above facts, I think it is clear that Snider was

visibly very intoxicated. He could not stand unassisted for any

length of time, nor could he walk with any real success. At best,

he could simply stagger about. These facts must have been

apparent to and understood by the appellants when they first

discovered him in the Alford vehicle and found that he was unable

to stand up. He fell from their hands in the parking lot. The

police officer described Snider as “falling down drunk”. He had

vomited on himself and lay on the back seat of either Wurfel’s or

Alford’s car during almost all of the evening. Predictably, he

fell at the roadside when leaving their car and struggled to get

up.  Equally predictably, he collapsed on the road and was run

over by the respondent.


[88] The evidence establishes that the appellants knew the

deceased was too drunk to get home on his own and that he needed

physical assistance. They knew this when they told the police

officer that they would take him home. The conversation at the

gas station reflects this: they knew that they should either call

his parents to come and get him or that they should take him home

themselves.


[89] As to the liability of Alford and Berard, the trial judge,

having found that the defendant Slobodnik was merely a passenger

in the Alford car and under no duty to the deceased, said:

               The same is not true, in my view, in
          terms of Justin Alford and Kyle Berard,
          although I think it will be clear from my
          findings of fact that they certainly were not
          responsible for Snider’s arrival in
          Amherstburg. I have found, and I repeat, they
          took responsibility for and accepted
          responsibility for Snider at the Burger King,
          and I do not accept, indeed I reject the
          evidence of Justin Alford that in effect he
          only took it on because he felt somehow the
          pressure of the police officer imposing
          Snider upon him. I accept that the more
          likely events that evening, and I think I’ve
          already made these findings, was that the
          officer asked whether they were acquaintances
          or friends. When he found that they were he
          asked where they were from and found they
          were all from Harrow, and he offered the
          observation at that point that unless he was
          taken home he was going to be run in, and I
          accept that Alford and Berard agreed at that
          point and accepted the responsibility of
          taking him back to Harrow and taking him
          home.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               That being the case, in my view, they
          owed a duty of care to Snider to assure to
          him personally that he be taken safely home
          or to a place of safety, and that he not be
          merely abandoned at the side of the road
          where they knew or ought to have known, 16
          years old or otherwise, that in his condition
          he was likely not only to do damage to
          himself but to create an emergency situation
          and a danger to others using that highway,
          and that clearly is what happened, and I
          believe in fact what was the motivator behind
          their coming back to, with curiosity, see
          what was happening to him, the first and the
          second time.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[90] I think the trial judge was right in reaching the conclusion

that both of the appellants Alford and Berard were negligent

although, with respect, he ought to have specifically addressed

the question of the standard of care for young persons and its

application to each of them.


[91] As appears from his reasons, the trial judge had been

referred to and considered the judgment of the Supreme Court of

Canada in McEllistrum v. Etches, [1956] S.C.R. 787 (S.C.C.), but

perhaps not the judgment of this court in McErlean v. Sarel

(1987), 42 C.C.L.T. 78 (Ont. C.A.). Generally, the standard of

care is that standard which society expects of a reasonable and

prudent person in the position of the person in question. On the

other hand, in the case of a young person, society takes a more

lenient and subjective approach, by taking into account that

person’s age intelligence and experience.  Young people are not

judged by the same standards as adults. The test is essentially a

subjective test, which recognises that the capabilities of young

persons are various and treats them on an individual basis.   Of

course, care must be taken not to judge this case on the basis

that both or either of the appellants were engaged in an entirely

adult activity of the nature that would disentitle him the

benefit of the subjective test.


[92] The question to be answered is this: did each of these two

youths exercise the care expected of a youth of like age,

intelligence and experience? Applying proper principles, I think

the trial judge reached the right conclusions on the facts as he

found them. There was evidence as to their age, intelligence and

experience. For example, both were sixteen years old and in grade

eleven at high school.  Berard went on to an honour degree at

university. Their circumstances indicate that each was apparently

considered by his peers and parents as responsible. Alford was

entrusted to drive his parent’s car about the area and was

licensed to operate it. These are facts from which knowledge and

judgment relevant to this case can be inferred. Alford said he

had observed drinking and drug use amongst his peers. Accepting

as fact that neither had experience with a very drunk person, the

serious effect of what Snider had consumed was obvious. Alford

said he understood the obligation to take Snider home because he

was drunk. The police officer thought each was older than his

years. There is no reason to say this was based simply on fact

they were big people and looked older, but more likely that each

appeared to understand the importance of caring for Snider

because he was not capable of caring for himself and so was a

danger to himself and others about the highway.   The finding of

the trial judge, accepting the evidence of the police officer

that the appellants agreed to take Snider home and rejecting

their evidence they did this solely because the police officer

told them to, is important. Their understanding of their

responsibility is reflected by the fact that when they stopped at

the gas station, they considered their options and queried

whether they should abandon Snider, call his parents to come and

get him or take him home. They agreed they must take him home.  I

think the evidence fully sufficient to enable the trial court to

determine whether each of the appellants exercised the standard

of care that should reasonably be expected of each of them.


[93] My colleague concludes that in the circumstances the

appellants had no alternative but to leave Snider as they did.

With respect, I think the appellants had two alternatives, either

of which would have discharged their duty of care to Snider: they

could have ignored his request that he be let out of the car and

taken him home as they knew they should do; or, they could have

stopped and simply assisted him to where he wanted to go, in the

same way they would have done had they taken him home. They could

have assisted him to safe a place rather than leaving him

collapsed on the edge of the road, a danger to himself and others

using the highway.


[94] In light of Snider’s state of intoxication, where he could

not stand or effectively move about, Alford and Berard knew or

ought to have known that to let him out of the car, unassisted,

would create a situation of danger to him and to persons using

the highway. In my view, in leaving Snider by the side of the

road, as they did, Alford and Berard ought to have foreseen that

Snider could stagger or wander onto the highway and cause an

accident in which he would be injured and the driver or occupants

of the vehicle would be injured or suffer harm. Their decision to

let him out of the car, unassisted, in the face of these

foreseeable harms, was negligent.


[95] In my opinion, applying the same consideration with respect

to each of the appellants, the trial judge correctly held the

appellants Alford and Berard liable for the nervous shock

suffered by the respondent. In Duwyn v. Kaprielian (1978), 22

O.R. (2d) 736 (Ont. C.A.), Morden J.A. considered the question of

foreseeability of the risk of this type of harm. At p. 749, he

said:
               In bringing the generally-stated
          principle down to its application in actual
          cases, it is fair to observe that as a matter
          of experience and common sense it is easier
          to recognize a situation of foreseeability of
          shock with respect to a plaintiff directly
          involved in an accident than it is with
          respect to one who was an observer of an
          accident or came upon its aftermath. Indeed,
          while it has to be kept in mind that it is
          foreseeability of nervous shock, and not
          something else, that is the test in nervous
          shock cases, it is difficult to disagree with
          A.L. Goodhart’s factual observation that “ in
          most cases the foresight concerning emotional
          injury and that concerning physical injury
          are identical”—“The Shock Cases and Area of
          Risk, 16 Mod. L. Rev. 14 (1953), at p. 22 –
          at the same time recognizing his point that a
          requirement of foreseeability of physical
          harm to the plaintiff may, and should in some
          cases (such as plaintiff-observer ones), be
          completely inapplicable.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[96] In the same case, Morden  J.A., at p. 749, with respect to

foreseeability of nervous shock, referred to a statement by

Professor Williams  in  Linden’s Studies in Canadian Tort Law

(1968) as follows:

               The question then is what can the
          reasonable or average man foresee? It is
          submitted that, with the increasing general
          knowledge of the average Canadian, and
          especially with his current awareness of
          mental reactions to various stimuli, a
          reasonable man would foresee the risk of
          psychic damage in many situations in which he
          would not have foreseen it even five years
          ago. Since our state of knowledge is
          constantly broadening the scope of the duty
          of care must expand accordingly.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               See “Tort Liability for Nervous Shock in
          Canada” in Linden, Studies in Canadian Tort
          Law (1968), 139 at p. 150.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[97] I think young persons like the appellants are aware of the

risk of psychiatric damage and what Linden says applies to the

appellants in this case.


[98] The respondent was directly involved in the accident. There

seems little reason for any distinction between foreseeability of

physical injury and of nervous shock. In any event, I think the

trial judge correctly held that nervous shock was foreseeable and

that the appellants must take the respondent as they find him.


[99] I agree with Abella J.A. that we cannot interfere with the

finding of the trial judge that no negligence of the respondent

Nespolon caused or contributed to the accident.


[100]     I would dismiss the appeal by the appellants Alford and

Berard.


[101]     In his reasons for finding liability on the part of the

Estate of Kevin Snider, the trial judge said:
               So also do I find that Snider, and as a
          consequence his litigation administrator,
          owed a duty to those persons who might likely
          become involved as a result of his imbibing
          and his drinking of wine to the extent that
          he became inebriated, “falling down dunk” in
          the words of the officer, and having chosen
          as he did so to do, I think and indeed the
          argument falls rather hollowly, that he was
          so drunk that he ought not to be visited with
          the responsibility of his actions, that he
          did not know, in effect, what was happening
          and ought not therefore to be capable of
          negligence.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               I am of the view, quite frankly, that he
          chose to drink, and that in that choosing he
          knew or ought to have known that he might
          ultimately become a danger to himself and to
          others, and I find him negligent in the
          consuming of alcohol to the extent that he
          became inebriated.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[102]     I agree with him that drunkenness is not an excuse.

Further, I think the trial judge has correctly dealt with this

issue of negligence. The real and foreseeable danger with

intoxication is that one will not be able to respond adequately

to the circumstances that may arise, particularly the unexpected,

and so cause harm to another.


[103]     When deciding whether Snider was liable to the

respondent, the principles in McEllistrum v. Etches, supra must

be followed. There is not a great deal of evidence about Snider.

He was a youth, fourteen years of age. He was big and well

developed for his years. It seems many of his friends were older

than he was and ahead of him at school. His friends, Wurfel and

Carson, were each sixteen years old and grade eleven students, as

were his acquaintances, Alford and Berard. No doubt, like them,

he had experience with some of their contemporaries using drugs

and alcohol and had observed their possible effects. The evidence

of his friend Pavao, who supplied Snider with the bottle of wine

that evening, was that Snider drank on occasion and that he had

seen him consume beer, wine, vodka and other alcohol. Snider’s

generation has been subjected to very extensive information about

the effects and dangers of drugs and alcohol. Although Snider was

just fourteen, I think he appreciated that alcohol could

seriously effect him and that he could become so drunk as to be

in need of physical assistance. His appreciation was not that of

an experienced adult. But, no doubt when sober, if asked, he

would have acknowledged that “a fall down drunk” might well be a

danger to himself and cause a serious accident if he found his

way onto a highway. I think he understood the risk to himself and

to others that such conduct on his part would pose.


[104]     Taking into account Snider’s age, intelligence and

experience at the time he drank, was the risk of harm to others

foreseeable? Is foreseeability measured on the basis that he

should have foreseen the circumstances in which the accident took

place and that, while in those circumstances, he would be a

danger to him self and others? Or is it measured on the basis

that he reasonably should have foreseen that, in a state of

intoxication, he would be a danger to himself and others because

he would be unable to respond adequately to the circumstances

that might arise, particularly the unexpected. Is this general

understanding of the effects of intoxication enough or is “the

unexpected” too remote?


[105]     If the test is whether Snider, at the time he was

consuming the alcohol, should reasonably have foreseen the

circumstances of the accident, or even that he would pose a

threat to people on the highway, then Snider’s his estate should

not be held liable. When the evening began and Snider started

drinking, he was with his friends. They knew he was drinking and

they knew about his drinking on other occasions. According to the

evidence, Snider expected to spend the evening with them and to

be driven to the party and to his home. They were his friends. I

do not think he could be expected to foresee that they would

abandon him, or that others, his acquaintances, would leave him

in circumstances where he was in danger or where he posed a

danger to persons using the highway.


[106]     However, I think the second test is the correct one and

that the trial judge was right. When Kevin Snider drank, he knew

that he would become intoxicated – drunk. He knew that, while

intoxicated, his ability to function, mentally and physically,

would be seriously impaired; in other words, he knew that he

might not be able to respond adequately to the circumstances that

might arise, particularly the unexpected things. He was a danger

to himself and to others. His liability should not depend on

whether he could reasonably foresee the specific circumstances in

which the accident occurred. One cannot be expected to always

foresee the unexpected, but that is where there is danger in the

state of intoxication. In this case, whether Snider found himself

on the highway with the same consequences because his friend’s

car broke down, or because he wandered off and left the others,

or because his friends let him down, really should not make any

difference to his liability. The foreseeable mental impairment

and inability to respond to the circumstances as they arose was a

breach of the duty of care that he owed to others and is what

made his conduct, in becoming intoxicated, negligence.


[107]     For the reasons stated above with respect to Alford and

Berard, I think the foreseeable danger to others included nervous

shock to one directly involved in the accident.


[108]     I would dismiss the appeal of the Estate of Kevin

Snider.</font></pre></td>
