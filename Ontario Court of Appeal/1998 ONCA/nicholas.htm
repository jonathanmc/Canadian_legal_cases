[1]  Trudy Nicholas appeals from the dismissal of her motion in

which she sought leave nunc pro tunc to commence an action

against John Anderson in his capacity as Trustee of the bankrupt

Montego Products Ltd pursuant to s. 215 of the Bankrutpcy and

Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. In considering whether leave

should be granted under s. 215, the evidence must be sufficient

to establish that there is a factual basis for the proposed

claim. The evidence on a motion under s. 215 does not have to be

sufficient to enable the motions court judge to make a final

assessment of the merits of the claim sought to be made, but it

must be sufficient to address the issues:  Mancini (Bankrupt) et

al. v. Falconi et al (1993), 61 O.A.C. 332 (Ont. C.A.) at 337.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Nicholas contends that in connection with the purported

disappearance of inventory from Montego Products Ltd., she was

charged maliciously by Anderson with fraud in relation to the

Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The charge against her was later

withdrawn.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  One of the main items of evidence in support of Nicholas'

contention that Anderson initiated a criminal prosecution against

her maliciously concerns a note called the Epinger note which was

in Anderson's possession. Mr. Anderson did not provide these

notes to the police when he provided them with information

relating to the suspected fraud.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Epinger note, indicated in part &quot;Y all inventory items

2000 and up is stock kept off premises ... in addition, stock

added on to inventory listing manually by Trudy is off premises.&quot;

Anderson's explanation for not providing the notes is that he

thought the stock was off premises for purposes of it being kiln

dried or to have melamine put on it. There is no reference in the

notes to the stock being off premises temporarily for these

purposes. Early in the receivership, there was a meeting between

Anderson and Nicholas respecting the status of inventory and Mr.

Anderson stated in his affidavit that the source of his

information and belief was Ms. Nicholas herself. His evidence was

not contradicted by Nicholas in this regard. In addition,

Anderson deposed that he did not knowingly withhold any

exculpatory information.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  After reviewing this evidence and all of the other evidence,

Blair J. was not satisfied that Anderson's acts constituted

anything other than the normal conduct of a receiver or Trustee

in bankruptcy faced with a situation where it appeared that there

had been losses by the debtor company in relation to which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">senior personnel of the company may have been implicated. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant therefore failed to establish sufficient facts to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support her allegation of malice. Blair J. properly applied </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the test under s. 215 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
