    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge applied the proper test in determining
whether, in the light of the factual errors in the information
sworn to obtain the warrant, the warrant remained valid.

[2]  The trial judge misapprehended the position of appellant's
counsel on the question of the officer's good faith, but in our
view that misapprehension was not significant in his analysis of
the s. 8 claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We find no basis upon which to interfere with the trial
judge's conclusion that the errors in the information were not
such as to render the grounds relied upon in the information
incapable of supporting the granting of the warrant. We reject
counsel's submission that the trial judge was not entitled to
consider the correct information with respect to hydro usage in
determining whether on the Garofoli test the search was
unreasonable. We think the trial judge was entitled to look at
those correct figures as part of the &quot;amplified record&quot; placed
before him on the s. 8 application. The conviction appeal is
dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We can find no error in the trial judge's determination that
a conditional sentence was inappropriate. We would grant leave to
appeal sentence, but affirm the sentence imposed by the trial
judge.</font></pre></td>
