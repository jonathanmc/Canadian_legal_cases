<b>GOUDGE J.A.:</b>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by the defendants from the judgment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Cosgrove J. rendered on August 16, 1996. He determined that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff Noseworthy had been dismissed without cause from his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment and that he should receive damages in lieu of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate notice together with aggravated damages, punitive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages, and damages for mental distress.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The defendants do not contest the finding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Noseworthy was terminated without cause. However, they attack</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all aspects of the award of damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judgment was rendered prior to the decision of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme Court of Canada in Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1997] 3 S.C.R. 701. For the reasons that follow I have concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, in light of Wallace, the awards of aggravated damages,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive damages, and damages for mental distress cannot stand</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that the calculation of appropriate notice must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reassessed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Mr. Noseworthy was terminated on March 15, 1994. He was then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sixty years old. He had worked for four years as office manager</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the defendant Riverside Pontiac-Buick Ltd., an auto</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealership in Prescott, Ontario. Only one employee reported</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly to him. His annual salary was $38,480.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The defendant Birnie owned the dealership and the defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MacMillan was its sales manager.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Mr. Noseworthy's duties included responsibility for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bookkeeping practices at the dealership. It was dealership policy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that only the plaintiff and the service manager Laurie Craig were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorized to sign cheques up to $1,000. The trial judge found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mr. Noseworthy had permitted another employee to sign</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Craig's name to a number of cheques because he reasonably</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believed that the defendant MacMillan knew of this practice and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had given it his tacit approval.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The trial judge further found that on May 15, 1994, without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prior warning, the defendants confronted Mr. Noseworthy and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused him of forging Laurie Craig's signature on the disputed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cheques. The defendant Birnie told him that they would have to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">part company and that if he did not sign a letter of resignation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he would be charged with forgery. Mr. Noseworthy complied with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this demand although the defendants did not subsequently rely on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this letter as having any legal significance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The uncontradicted psychiatric evidence was that the abrupt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">termination of employment and the circumstances surrounding the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">termination caused Mr. Noseworthy to suffer from traumatic stress</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disorder with only a fair prognosis for recovery. Indeed, at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time of trial Mr. Noseworthy still remained unemployed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The trial judge found that the acceptance by Mr. Noseworthy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the practice of substituting a signature by an unauthorized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee was at most an error in judgment. It appears that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Birnie was unaware of this practice before the meeting of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">March 15, 1994. The trial judge nevertheless characterized the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">false allegations of forgery against the plaintiff and the threat</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of criminal charges unless he resigned as &quot;highhanded, repulsive,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and unacceptable by any standard of decency&quot;. He found that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was intended to avoid giving the plaintiff adequate notice of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">termination of employment. He concluded that the dismissal of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Noseworthy was without cause.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] His judgment as to damages was made up of the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  damages against the corporate defendant equivalent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          to ten months' salary representing the period of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          reasonable notice required in all the circumstances;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  aggravated damages against the corporate defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          equivalent to five months' salary. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          expressed his finding as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               &quot;I have concluded that the damages for
          lack of adequate notice, because of the
          aggravating circumstances in this case,
          should increase the notice period from ten
          months to fifteen months. These factors
          include the age of the plaintiff and his
          limited prospects in a stagnant economy, the
          unfounded allegations of forgery and the
          attempt, in effect, to pressure a letter of
          resignation from the plaintiff.&quot;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
     (c)  punitive damages against all defendants jointly and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          severally in the amount of $15,000;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (d)  damages for mental distress against the defendants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Birnie and MacMillan in an amount equivalent to one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          year's salary.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] As I have said, the defendants attack each of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings. I will deal with each of them in turn.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Aggravated Damages

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In Vorvis v. Insurance Company of British Columbia (1989),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">58 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.) McIntyre J., speaking for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority, made clear that aggravated damages are compensatory,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not punitive. He cited with approval the description of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravated damages given by Professor Waddams in The Law of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Damages 2nd ed. (1983) at p. 562 which includes this passage:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          The expression &quot;aggravated damages&quot;, though
          it has sometimes been used interchangeably
          with punitive or exemplary damages, has more
          frequently in recent times been contrasted
          with exemplary damages. In this contrasting
          sense, aggravated damages describes an award
          that aims at compensation, but takes full
          account of the intangible injuries, such as
          distress and humiliation, that may have been
          caused by the defendant's insulting
          behaviour.
          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In the context of wrongful dismissal, the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravated damages turns not on the factors considered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge as aggravating circumstances in the passage quoted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">above but, rather, on whether the manner of dismissal caused the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff mental distress. Where that occurs damages for mental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distress are available provided that the manner of the dismissal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutes an independently actionable wrong on the part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer. This was made clear by Iacobucci J., speaking for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">majority, in Wallace, supra at p. 734. He went on to say that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the manner of dismissal caused mental distress falling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">short of a separately actionable cause of conduct, while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravated damages could not be awarded there could be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extension of the period of reasonable notice. I will return to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this concept in dealing with the period of reasonable notice that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is appropriate in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Here, the trial judge erred in basing his award of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravated damages on certain factors which he viewed to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravating circumstances. Rather, he was required to assess</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the manner of Mr. Noseworthy's dismissal caused him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mental distress and whether that constituted a separately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actionable wrong by the employer. Only if both criteria were met</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could he make the award he did. There is nothing in the record</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before us to suggest that the manner of dismissal was an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">independent actionable wrong by the corporate defendant nor was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this argued by the plaintiff. That is enough to preclude the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award of aggravated damages, and this component of the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below must be set aside.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Punitive Damages

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Similarly, Wallace, supra at p. 736 makes clear that in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongful dismissal action punitive damages can be awarded only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the conduct sought to be punished by such an award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitutes a separately actionable wrong.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Here, as I have said, there was no suggestion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">manner of dismissal of Mr. Noseworthy constituted more than a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of contract on the part of the employer. It could not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said to be independently actionable conduct as against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant Riverside Pontiac-Buick Ltd.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Equally for the reasons set out below, the manner of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissal could not be said to be independently actionable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct by the defendants Birnie and MacMillan. It does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constitute the tort of intentional infliction of mental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffering.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Hence, in my view there was no basis for an award of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">punitive damages and that element of the judgment also must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set aside.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Damages for Mental Distress

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The trial judge assessed damages for mental distress against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendants Birnie and MacMillan but not against the corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant. The reasons for judgment do not reveal the basis upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which this was done. On appeal, the only basis offered was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Even if this cause of action is available in the employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">context, in this case the purpose of the defendants' actions in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effecting the dismissal was to avoid providing reasonable notice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the plaintiff. This falls short of the requisite intention for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability to be sustained on this basis. Therefore, the provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the judgment of damages for mental distress must also be set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aside.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Reasonable Notice

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The trial judge concluded that the period of reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice required in this case was ten months. While his reasons do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not clearly set out the basis on which he reached this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion, it may have been founded on the well-known principles</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first laid out in Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail Ltd. (1960) 24 D.L.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(2nd) 140 (Ont. H.C.) at 145:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               There can be no catalogue laid down as
          to what is reasonable notice in particular
          classes of cases. The reasonableness of the
          notice must be decided with reference to each
          particular case, having regard to the
          character of the employment, the length of
          service of the servant, the age of the
          servant and the availability of similar
          employment, having regard to the experience,
          training and qualifications of the servant.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Using these factors alone, I would have been inclined to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">think that in the circumstances of this case ten months is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significantly too generous. However, that is not now the end of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the matter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In reaching his conclusion the trial judge appears to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">excluded consideration of the employer's bad faith in dismissing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff and the impact of that on him. Rather, he used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these considerations (erroneously, as I have found) to underpin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his awards of aggravated damages and punitive damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Since Wallace, supra the plaintiff is entitled to have these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors considered as part of the assessment of reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice. Indeed the appellants' counsel conceded as much. Hence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is necessary that this issue be revisited in light of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles in Wallace.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Wallace represents a significant new step in the evolution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the way in which reasonable notice is determined. Speaking for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, Iacobucci J. began his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discussion of reasonable notice by making clear that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles set out in Bardal, supra remain centrally relevant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this task. He reviewed the subsequent common law to demonstrate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Canadian courts have not treated this list as closed but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have built several additional factors onto this foundation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Principal among them is a consideration of whether the dismissed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee had been induced to leave previously secure employment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] He then turned to an analysis of the relevance of bad faith</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct by the employee in effecting the dismissal. He concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, given the special characteristics of the employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship and the type of contract governing it, the law must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognize such conduct as a consideration in determining the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">length of notice required. Particularly in light of the power</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imbalance that typically exists in the employment relationship,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fundamental importance of work in a person's life, and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">special vulnerability of an employee when termination occurs, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer must act fairly and in good faith in carrying out the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissal. He put his conclusion this way at p. 742:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               The point at which the employment
          relationship ruptures is the time when the
          employee is most vulnerable and hence, most
          in need of protection. In recognition of this
          need, the law ought to encourage conduct that
          minimizes the damage and dislocation (both
          economic and personal) that result from
          dismissal. … In my opinion, to ensure that
          employees receive adequate protection,
          employers ought to be held to an obligation
          of good faith and fair dealing in the manner
          of dismissal, the breach of which will be
          compensated for by adding to the length of
          the notice period.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] He made clear that this factor is relevant even where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee suffers mental distress as a result but cannot show that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the manner of dismissal affected his future job prospects</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although if the latter occurs as well, the resulting extension of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the notice period would likely be considerably greater.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] In Wallace the employer's bad faith conduct had both these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequences. Together with the other relevant factors this led</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Iacobucci J. to uphold an award equivalent to twenty-four months'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice which he acknowledged may be at the high end of the range.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This ultimate conclusion makes clear that the compensation for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bad faith employer conduct comes by way of a lengthened notice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period fixed within a generally accepted range.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Put another way, it seems to me that Iacobucci J. does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplate that the dismissed employee should recover damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for all the harm caused by the bad faith conduct. To do so would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be to treat &quot;bad faith discharge&quot; as a stand-alone cause of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action either in contract or in tort, something he clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejects.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Fixing the notice period within a range depends on all the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant circumstances of the particular case. The upper end of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the range is not an absolute ceiling but is elastic enough to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increase for particularly deserving cases. Within this range, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequence of Wallace is that where bad faith employer conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exists, there will be a longer notice period than there would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the same case if there were no such conduct.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] As Iacobucci J. said in Wallace at p. 745 the trial judge in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weighing the importance of this factor must examine both the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature of the bad faith conduct and its impact in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances. This is best done as part of a consideration of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all the relevant factors in the case rather than as a separate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exercise of determining the discrete addition to be made to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice period because of the employer's conduct. Given the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">various factors to be considered and the endless variety of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factual contexts, reasonable notice cannot be determined as if it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were simply the product of an arithmetical formula.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In part, this is a consequence of the fact that the various</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors to be considered do not appear to yield a single</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">organizing principle. Rather, they reflect various important</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aspects of the employment relationship that deserve recognition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the law in determining the notice required to terminate an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee. The factors set out in Bardal, supra reflect the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee's interest in some degree of job security and his or her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">need to be cushioned against its loss. The consideration of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the dismissed employee has been induced away from secure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment reflects his or her reliance and expectation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests. The factor first laid out in Wallace, supra reflects</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the employee's interest in being dealt with fairly and in good</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">faith at the point of dismissal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Where an employee is terminated without cause and without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice the task of the trial judge is to examine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of the particular case in light of these factors to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine the quantum of damages in lieu of notice that reflects</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relative wrongfulness of the termination. The degree to which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the termination was done without respecting these important</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aspects of the employment relationship will dictate where, within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the range, the required notice falls.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] It remains to apply the approach mandated by Wallace to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts of this case. Turning first to the Bardal factors,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Noseworthy's position was that of office manager for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant car dealership. He had responsibility for only one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subordinate. There appears to be nothing extraordinary about his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duties. While he was sixty years of age at termination he had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only four years of service. Although the stagnant economy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">undoubtedly limited his job prospects, there was no suggestion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that similar employment could not be found.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Since there is no indication that Mr. Noseworthy had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">induced away from his prior employment his dismissal does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disregard any employee reliance or expectation interest.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] While the employer was found to have acted in bad faith in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effecting the dismissal, neither the allegation of forgery nor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the threat of criminal charges which grounded this finding appear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to have been sustained beyond the initial meeting. It is, in my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, far from the most egregious example of bad faith conduct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Regrettably, however, the consequences of this conduct to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Noseworthy's mental health were significant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] In all the circumstances, in my view the appropriate period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of reasonable notice is ten months. I would vary the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below to provide for damages in an amount equivalent to ten</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months' salary.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] The award of costs at trial was dependent upon a comparison</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the result with the plaintiff's offer to settle. Since it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possible that the result of this appeal will affect that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comparison, it is appropriate that judgment as to costs, both of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial and of this appeal, be reserved in order to give the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties an opportunity to provide written submissions on both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aspects of the costs issue. This is to be done within the next</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thirty days.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] In the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment below</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is varied in accordance with these reasons. Costs of the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and of the appeal will be reserved to await written submissions.
