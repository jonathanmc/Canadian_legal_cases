</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   The defendant Aden M. Shantz appeals the judgment of Molloy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.  seeking  either  a new trial before a judge  and  jury  or  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reduction in the damages award.  We called on the respondent, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff Edward O'Brien, on only two issues:  first, whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge erred in discharging the jury; and second whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial  judge  erred  by  failing to take  into  account  negative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contingencies in her award of past and future loss of income.



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   The Discharge of the Jury

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  This is the main ground of appeal.  After nine days of trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  after  both  counsel had made their closing  addresses,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial  judge on the plaintiff's motion, discharged the  jury  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave  judgment  herself.  The appellant submits  that  the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  erred  on  two  grounds  in  discharging  the  jury.   The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant argues that the trial judge erred first, by failing  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclude  that  the Workers' Compensation Board  (&quot;WCB&quot;)  records</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">filed in evidence were admissible for the truth of their contents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  business  records under s.35(2) of the Evidence  Act,  R.S.O.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1990, c.E-23; and second, by concluding that defence counsel (not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr.  Thomas)  had breached the requirements of fairness  when  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to the WCB records in his closing address to the jury in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an  attempt  to  show  inconsistencies  between  the  plaintiff's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testimony at trial and statements attributed to the plaintiff  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  records.   Alternatively,  the  appellant  argues  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fairness  concerns  prompting the plaintiff's motion  could  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been remedied by further instructions to the jury.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We do not accept these arguments.  The trial judge was faced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with  an unusual and difficult situation.  She gave thorough  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered reasons for exercising her discretion to discharge the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury.  Not only do we find no reviewable error in the exercise of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that discretion, we agree with her decision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   Plaintiff  counsel's motion to discharge the  jury  stemmed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  defence counsel's use of the WCB records during his closing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument  to  impeach the plaintiff's credibility.  Before  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both   counsel  had  given  notice  under  the  business  records</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision of the Evidence Act, s.35(2), that they intended to put</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  plaintiff's WCB records before the court.  On the first  day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  trial,  plaintiff's counsel filed, on consent, one volume  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately  400  pages  of WCB  records.   This  was  not  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's  entire WCB file.  Defence counsel took the  position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  entire  file should be before the court,  and  on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fourth day of trial, additional WCB reports were filed, again  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent.  The total WCB file was approximately 500 pages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   At  no  time did either counsel say that the  records  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being  filed  for the truth of their contents.  No  evidence  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">called  about  the nature of the records or the circumstances  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which they were made.  Although s.35(2) of the Evidence Act  does</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provide for an exception to the hearsay rule, the entire contents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the records do not constitute evidence of the truth of  their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contents by the mere fact that they are introduced  following the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">service  of a notice under s.35.  Any record sought to be  relied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon for the truth of its contents must fall within the scope  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  statutory exception.  See: Adderly v. Bremner, [1968] 1 O.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">721  (H.C.).  Given the large volume of material and the  diverse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature  of  these records, defence counsel could  not  reasonably</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have   thought  that  plaintiff's  counsel  was  accepting  every</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statement  in  the  records for its truth.  Moreover,  the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  did  not understand that either counsel was conceding  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">truth of any of the WCB documents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   Defence  counsel never once referred  to  the  WCB  records</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during his lengthy cross-examination of the plaintiff.  When  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second  volume of WCB records was filed, defence counsel did  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ask to have the plaintiff recalled for further cross-examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Instead, defence counsel made a tactical decision not to  examine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  plaintiff on the WCB records because he did not want to give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's counsel an opportunity to address any inconsistencies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in re-examination.  In closing argument, however, defence counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">used  the records to attack the plaintiff's credibility.  He gave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  jury copies of the records and referred to several pages  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">show  that the plaintiff had advanced two contradictory  versions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  his medical condition, one to obtain WCB benefits, the  other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to obtain a large damages award.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   In  granting the plaintiff's motion to discharge the  jury,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  trial  judge recognized the general principle that  a  party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wishing  to  impeach the credibility of a witness must ordinarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">put  the  contradictory material to the witness in order to  give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  witness  an opportunity to explain it.  This  principle,  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bottom  a  principle of fairness, is reflected in  the  House  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lords decision Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R.67 (H.L.) and in ss. 20</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  21 of our Evidence Act.  The trial judge recognized that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle was not absolute but she concluded:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my opinion, both Section 21 of the Ontario
          Evidence Act and the rule in Browne  v.  Dunn
          are  applicable to the situation  before  me,
          and  both  have been violated in  spirit,  as
          well as in substance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   She  found,  as contended by plaintiff's counsel,  that  if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence  counsel  wanted  to use the  records  to  challenge  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's  credibility,  he  was  obliged  to  have  given  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  an opportunity to explain the alleged inconsistencies.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">She observed:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          On  the facts of this case, I agree with  Mr.
          O'Hagan's  position.   I  might  have   ruled
          differently  if  the alleged  inconsistencies
          were  clearly and blatantly before the  Court
          in  earlier evidence, in such a manner as  to
          cry out for some explanation by the plaintiff
          when he subsequently testified.  However, the
          inconsistencies  were  buried   within   five
          hundred  pages  of material  which  had  been
          filed in a routine manner on consent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In those circumstances, I think it completely
          unfair  to  Mr. O'Brien to extract  bits  and
          pieces  of  those documents, including  notes
          regarding snippets of telephone conversations
          two-and-a-half years ago, and  to  use  those
          excerpts  to  attack  his  credibility   now,
          without   giving   him  any  opportunity   to
          confirm, deny or explain.  This smacks to  me
          of  trial  by ambush, and I don't believe  it
          should   be  permitted.   It  simply  doesn't
          appear  to me to be fair or to be in  keeping
          with the principles underlying Section 21  of
          the  Evidence  Act or the Rule in  Browne  v.
          Dunn.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   The  trial  judge held that after both parties  had  closed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their  case   it  was too late to redress the unfairness  to  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  by  recalling  him  to testify  in  reply.   Moreover,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence counsel did not ask that the plaintiff be recalled.   She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also   held  that  the  unfairness  could  not  be  remedied   by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions to the jury.  On this point, she concluded:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  am inclined to agree with counsel for  the
          plaintiff.   It would be extremely  difficult
          for  a lay jury to sort out what evidence  is
          permitted   to  be  taken  into  account   in
          assessing credibility and what should not.  I
          am  particularly troubled by the March  23rd,
          1993  memo,  which  purportedly  evidences  a
          directly contradictory statement made by  the
          plaintiff on an issue central to the case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  Therefore, although recognizing the importance of the right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  a  jury  trial,  the trial judge concluded  that  she  should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharge the jury:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  recognize that the right to trial by  jury
          is  an  important one, and ought  not  to  be
          interfered with lightly.  I gave this  matter
          a  good  deal  of  thought, indeed  anguished
          thought.    On  balance,  I  feel  that   any
          unfairness  to  the defendant in  discharging
          the jury in these circumstances is outweighed
          by the unfairness to the plaintiff in leaving
          the  jury in.  The statements referred to  by
          Mr. Zarek are so potentially prejudicial that
          I  do not believe justice would be served for
          Mr. O'Brien if the jury remained.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  We  agree  with  the trial judge's decision  and  with  her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons.   We  make  these four additional comments.   First,  we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reject  the  appellant's  main contention  that  the  entire  WCB</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records could be used for the truth of their contents because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records  were filed under s.35(2) of the Evidence Act.   Although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">each  party served notice of his intention to file these  records</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under  s.35(2),  certain prerequisites must  be  shown  to  exist</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before a record can properly be admitted as proof of its contents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under that provision. The section reads as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          s.35(2)   Any writing or record made  of  any
          act,  transaction,  occurrence  or  event  is
          admissible   as   evidence   of   such   act,
          transaction, occurrence or event if  made  in
          the usual and ordinary course of any business
          and  if  it  was  in the usual  and  ordinary
          course  of such business to make such writing
          or   record   at  the  time  of   such   act,
          transaction, occurrence or event or within  a
          reasonable time thereafter. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">As  we said earlier, no evidence was led about the nature of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records or the circumstances in which they were created.  In  our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view,  the  appellant  has  not shown that  the  WCB  records  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended  to use to contradict the plaintiff's testimony properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fell within the scope of s.35(2).  Therefore, the trial judge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct  in concluding that the records were simply filed without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">formal  proof  of their authenticity and were not admissible  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the truth of their contents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  Second,  the  appellant's  submission  on  s.35(2)  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Evidence Act ignores the fundamental unfairness that took  place.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">What   was   fundamentally  unfair  was  that   defence   counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deliberately  refrained  from  asking  the  plaintiff  about  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inconsistencies  while  he was in the  witness  box  and  instead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">waited  to  attack his credibility when he had no opportunity  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respond.  The appellant submits that because the WCB records were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  independent or extrinsic evidence, having been filed by  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff, the rule in Browne v. Dunn had no application.  In the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">context  of this case, the distinction drawn by the appellant  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant.   It is unrealistic and unfair to have  expected  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff  to  have reviewed voluminous material  to  search  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inconsistencies  not  brought  to  his  attention   while   being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examined.   Fairness  required that the  plaintiff  be  given  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opportunity to explain the inconsistencies before his credibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could be impeached by them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Third, the appellant submits that defence counsel had little</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">choice but to refer to the WCB records during his closing address</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because he had to close first and plaintiff's counsel had already</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">signalled that he was going to review the records with  the  jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by pointing out to them those records that assisted his case.  It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  true  that  early in the trial plaintiff's counsel  told  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court that he would be reviewing some of the WCB records with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury  and yet during the course of the evidence he never did  so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Still, in our view, plaintiff's counsel's conduct does not assist</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  appellant.   It would have been no more open to  plaintiff's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel  to  refer to the WCB records during his closing  address</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than  it was to defence counsel.  In the light of the way counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conducted the trial, plaintiff's counsel could not have used  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">records  to support his client's credibility and defence  counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not use them to impugn the plaintiff's credibility.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  Fourth, the trial judge's order discharging the jury was  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discretionary order.  On appeal it is accorded the same deference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  other discretionary orders.  See:  Hamstra (Guardian ad Litem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of)  v. British Columbia Rugby Union (1997), 145 D.L.R. (4th) 193</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Contingencies

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The trial judge awarded $90,000 for past loss of income  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$678,200  for  future  loss of income.  She expressly  took  into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account negative contingencies in her award of past income  loss.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  claim  for  past loss of income covers the five-year  period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from  1991  to 1995.  Because of contingencies, the  trial  judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">awarded  loss of income for only three years and at  the  reduced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">annual figure of $30,000.  She said:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  find  as  a  fact that but for  the  motor
          vehicle  accident he would have graduated  in
          1991.   Further,  I  believe  he  would  have
          obtained employment within a reasonable  time
          thereafter.   I therefore am of  the  opinion
          that  there is some lost income between  1991
          and   1995   for   which  the  defendant   is
          responsible.   However, due to the  recession
          and  job cutbacks, it is quite possible  that
          Mr.  O'Brien would not have been employed for
          that   whole  period.   Allowing   for   this
          contingency, as well as time to  find  a  job
          and  an  entry level wage, I assess his  lost
          income claim at $30,000.00 per year for three
          years, for a total of $90,000.00.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  negative  contingencies lowered the past income  loss  award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from $200,000 to $90,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  In  awarding future loss of income, the trial  judge  found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  the  plaintiff would be working today, and indeed would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">working  until  the usual retirement age, were  it  not  for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident.   She also found that neither the plaintiff's Addison's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disease nor his head injury interfered with his ability to obtain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">full-time employment.  These findings limited the extent to which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negative contingencies could affect the award for future loss  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">income.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  Still  the trial judge expressly factored two contingencies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into her award.  She deducted $2,000 per year for the possibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the plaintiff would earn some income from working part-time;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  she  refused  to give the plaintiff any  credit  for  salary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increases  beyond the rate of inflation.  Instead she  concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;Given  the  fact  that his pre-injury earnings  were  below  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">average, I have not allowed any increase for that contingency&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  We  are therefore satisfied that the trial judge adequately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took  account of negative contingencies in her assessment of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's loss of past and future income.  The appellant's real</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument  is not that the trial judge failed to consider negative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contingencies  but that she should have made a greater  deduction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  them.   That argument is met by the deference  an  appellate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court  must  accord  to  a trial judge's assessment  of  damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Therefore, this ground of appeal also fails.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
