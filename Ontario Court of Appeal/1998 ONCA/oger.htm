    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by Continental Insurance of Canada
(&quot;AContinental&quot;) from a judgment awarding the sum of $50,000 to
the respondent Yves Oger pursuant to a policy of insurance issued
to Chiefscope Incorporated (&quot;Chiefscope&quot;). The decision is
reported at (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 215 (Ont. Gen. Div.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The respondent Yves Oger lost his motor vehicle or any
compensation for it as a result of a fraud committed by Nikolas
Vithoulkas and David Barry, the principals of Chiefscope. It is
conceded by Continental that the respondent's loss is covered by
the policy if it was incurred as a result of a criminal act
committed by an employee of Chiefscope. It is further conceded
that Vithoulkas and Barry fall within the definition of
&quot;employee&quot; contained in the policy. However, coverage under the
policy is excluded if the loss is due to any fraudulent,
dishonest or criminal act of the corporate insured. The trial
judge held that the actions of Vithoulkas and Barry were not the
actions of the corporate insured and granted judgment
accordingly. Continental appeals and seeks a dismissal of the
action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appeal, therefore, turns on the question whether the
fraudulent actions of the principals of Chiefscope were those of
the corporation. If the answer to this question is yes, the
respondent=s claim falls within the terms of the exclusion clause
and his action must be dismissed. On the other hand, if the trial
judge was correct in finding that the fraudulent actions of the
principals were not the actions of the corporation, but frauds
committed for their own benefit to the detriment not only of the
respondent but of the corporate insured itself, the appeal must
be dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge found that, although Vithoulkas and Barry
were undeniably the directing minds of the corporation, their
fraudulent actions were intended for their own financial gain.
Chiefscope did not benefit from the frauds but, rather, was
stripped &quot;of all of its assets... leaving [it] an empty shell
with nothing but liabilities.&quot; In the circumstances, the trial
judge concluded that Vithoulkas and Barry could not be said to
have acted as the alter ego of the company itself and for its
benefit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Continental does not dispute the trial judge=s findings of
fact, but argues that it cannot be said that the actions of Barry
and Vithoulkas constituted a fraud upon the corporation when the
evidence also showed that the corporation was set up by them for
the very purpose of effecting their fraudulent scheme.
Continental contends that the trial judge in effect made this
finding when she said that the &quot;corporation was merely a tool or
vehicle which [Barry and Vithoulkas] implemented as an instrument
of their fraud and to give the scheme a veneer of
respectability.&quot; There was no admissible evidence before the
trial judge which would allow her to conclude that the
corporation was set up with a view of perpetrating the frauds.
Further, we do not read these comments of the trial judge as
meaning anything other than Vithoulkas and Barry perpetrated a
fraud on the corporation as a means of achieving personal gain.
It does not detract from the main thrust of the trial judge's
finding that Barry and Vithoulkas were acting for their own
benefit only.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Consequently, we see no reason to interfere with the trial
judge's conclusion. The appeal is dismissed. As the respondent is
unrepresented by counsel, there will be no order as to costs.</font></pre></td>
