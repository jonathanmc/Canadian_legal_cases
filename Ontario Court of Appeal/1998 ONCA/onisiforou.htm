          is  entitled  to party and party  costs  from
          that date, unless the court orders otherwise.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)   The burden of proving that the judgment
          is as favourable as the terms of the offer to
          settle,  or more or less favourable,  as  the
          case  may be, is on the party who claims  the
          benefit of subrule (1) or (2).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The facts, in so far as they are material to the issue to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided  are  as follows. The plaintiff, Georgia Onisiforou,  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">injured  on  October  7, 1987, in a motor vehicle  accident.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other  plaintiff is her husband, Mario Onisiforou. They commenced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an  action against the defendant Clinton Rose, the driver of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other  vehicle  in  the  accident,  and  the  Scarborough  Public</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Utilities Commission, the owner of this vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   Georgia's  claim  was for damages  for  personal  injuries.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mario's  claim  was for damages under the Family Law  Act,  1986,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.O. 1986, c.4.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   About  18 months before the trial commenced, the  defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">served  an  offer to settle in these terms: &quot;$50,000.00 inclusive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of   claims   and  pre-judgment  interest  for  all   plaintiffs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Assessable  costs  are  in  addition.&quot;  The  defendants  admitted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability  and  the  action proceeded before  a  jury.  The  jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessed  Georgia's damages at $30,750. After  the  deduction  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accident  benefits  she had received and  the  addition  of  pre-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment  interest as determined by the trial judge, the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in her favour as set forth in the formal judgment was $50,868.60.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  jury assessed Mario's damages at nil and the formal judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided   that   he  &quot;shall  recover  no  monies   against   the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendants&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   In  comparing the judgment to the terms  of  the  offer  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settle, the trial judge added to the net damages of $28,073  pre-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment interest to the date of the offer (December 7, 1993)  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  average rate of 10.5% on the general damages and 10% on  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">special  damages. The total came to $46,487.91 -  less  than  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount   of  the  defendants'  offer.  Accordingly,  under   rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">49.10(2), he awarded costs to the plaintiffs to the date  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer and costs to the defendants thereafter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   The appellants' principal argument is that the trial  judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred  in  concluding that the offer to settle &quot;was of sufficient</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clarity  to invoke rule 49(2)&quot;. They also submit that  the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge  erred,  with  respect to the offer,  in  calculating  pre-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment interest at the average rate of 10.5% on general damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rather than the statutory rate of 13% and, further, that he erred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  calculating  pre-judgment interest only to the  date  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer and not to the date of judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   In my view, the appellants are entitled to succeed on their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principal argument. I would not characterize the issue  as  being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether  the  offer  had &quot;sufficient clarity&quot; but,  rather,  more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">broadly, whether the respondents have shown, on the facts of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case,  that  &quot;the  plaintiff Georgia  obtain[ed]  a  judgment  as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favourable as or less favourable than the terms of the  offer  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settle.&quot;  From a purely contractual point of view the  offer  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clear. The two appellants could have accepted this offer and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would  have  been  the  end of the action. How  they  divided  it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between them was of no concern to the defendants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The appellants, however, did not accept the offer but  went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  to  trial.  Georgia obtained a judgment for  $50,868.60.  Her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment  was  treated by the trial judge as being somewhat  less</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than  $50,000. Mario did not obtain a judgment. In fact,  because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he  did  not  prove  any  damages, his  action,  in  effect,  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   It  is  not  possible, in these circumstances,  to  compare</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Georgia's  judgment with the terms of the offer for the  purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of rule 49.10(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  I  do not think that it answers the question to be resolved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  lump  the two plaintiffs together and then say the offer  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clear.  What  happened  here happens in many  actions.  Georgia's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim,  on  a  separate cause of action, succeeded,  and  Mario's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim,  albeit  asserted in a derivative action, failed.  In  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">normal  course, she would be entitled to costs and  he  would  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liable  for  costs or, possibly, no costs would be  ordered  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect  to  his  claim. See Orkin, The Law  of  Costs,  2nd  ed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1997),  p.  2-48. No doubt, most of the time and effort  in  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action was devoted to her claim, not his.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  this  case was as favourable as or less favourable  than  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms  of the offer - because there was no offer with respect  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claim on which Georgia obtained her judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  By reason of rule 49.10(3), the burden of proving that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment  is as favourable or less favourable than the  terms  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the offer is on the respondents. This burden they have not met.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  The respondents have argued that the appellants did not  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any time request a breakdown of what was being offered as between</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  two plaintiffs. With respect, I do not see how this relieves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  respondents of having to show, after the judgment, a set  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts that enables them to have the advantage of rule 49.10(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  Reference  may  usefully be made  to  rule  49.02(1)  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enables  a party to serve an offer to settle &quot;any one or more  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claims in the proceeding&quot;. This clearly shows that within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">framework  of Rule 49 it was open to the defendants to  serve  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offer  that could have attracted the costs consequences  of  rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">49.10(2).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  The  respondents refer to a similar case under  the  former</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rules,  Ross  v.  Martin, [1966] 2 O.R. 306 (H.  Ct.),  in  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Moorehouse  J. held, with respect to a payment into  court,  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  failure to specify the amount of it allocated to each of two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims was only an irregularity, and that he could still exercise</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his  discretion under rule 317 to award costs after payment  into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court to the defendants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] I do not think that this decision is of any more help to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents   than  to  the  appellants.  The  former   governing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision  on  costs, Rule 317, was in considerably more  general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms than those in rule 49.10(2) and, accordingly, the reasoning</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  Ross is of little assistance in the present case. There is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discretion  under  rule  49.10(2) respecting  costs  consequences</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unless resort is had to &quot;the court order[ing] otherwise&quot;. This is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  narrow  residual  discretion (Niagara  Structural  Steel  (St.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(C.A.)) and neither side in the present case submits that  it  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant to the resolution of the issue before us.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In light of my conclusion on the principal submission of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant,  it  is  not necessary to consider  the  other  issues</font></pre>
