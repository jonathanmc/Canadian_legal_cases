    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lincoln County Board of Education from 1959 until he retired in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995. For all but three years of his teaching career Mr. Stadler</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taught full time. However, in the school years 1989-90, 1990-91</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and 1991-92, with the School Board's approval, he taught only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">half-days. The School Board characterized his reduced workload</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for each of these three school years as a half time leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  On December 19, 1991, Mr. Stadler applied to the Pension</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;the Plan provisions do not provide for the purchase of credit</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appealed on Mr. Stadler's behalf to the Benefits Adjudication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Committee of the Pension Board. The question before the Committee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was &quot;whether members who have an arrangement with their employers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a reduced workload from full-time to part-time employment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have a leave of absence within the meaning of subsection 94(1) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Schedule 1 of the Teachers' Pension Act.&quot; The Committee answered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this question affirmatively and therefore allowed OSSTF's appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Contrary to the staff's position, the Committee concluded that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;the part-time work arrangement of the member can be considered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to result in a leave of absence for the period when the member is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not at work.&quot; On February 11, 1993, the Pension Board ratified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Committee's decision.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Minister applied for judicial review of the Pension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board's decision. On September 24, 1996, the Minister's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application for judicial review was dismissed by the Divisional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court (Southey, Watt and Perras JJ.) who, applying a standard of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correctness, found no reason to interfere with the decision of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Pension Board. The Minister appeals with leave to this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I would allow the Minister's appeal. In my opinion, Mr. Stadler</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">became a part-time teacher during the three school years in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question. He was not on a leave of absence and therefore he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not entitled to purchase credited service for the time he was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teaching.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Discussion
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The Pension Plan is Schedule 1 to the Teachers' Pension Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.O. 1989, c.92. Although local school boards employ teachers,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these school boards are not required to contribute to the Pension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Plan. Instead, under the Pension Plan, the Minister of Education</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is required to match the contributions made by teachers. A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher's required pension contribution is a percentage of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher's pensionable salary. Normally, a teacher's pensionable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">salary is the amount paid to the teacher during the school year.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, under s.14(1) of the Pension Plan, a teacher's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pensionable salary may be increased by a deemed amount if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher is entitled to purchase credited service for an absence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or break in service. Section 14(1) provides:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               14.C(1) The pensionable salary of a
          member who purchases credited service under
          section 94, 95 or 96 for an absence or break
          in service is the amount of remuneration
          that, in the opinion of the member's
          employer, the member would have earned had he
          or she not taken the absence or break.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  By the application of this provision, credited service</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affects the amount of required pension contributions by both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teachers and the Minister of Education. Credited service also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factors into the calculation of the amount of a teacher's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pension. Under s.41(3) of the Pension Plan, the amount of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher's retirement pension, before adjusting for inflation, is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calculated using the formula (A x B) - C, in which A is 2 percent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the teacher's average salary, B is the number of years of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher's credited service and C is the reduction for any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contribution to the Canada Pension Plan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The normal rule is that teachers obtain credited service</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only for the number of hours or days they actually work. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rule is found in s.10(1) of the Pension Plan, which states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               10.C(1) An active member receives one
          year of credited service for working the
          number of hours or days normally worked
          during a school year by a full-time employee
          in the occupational group in which the member
          is employed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Thus, under s.10(2) of the Pension Plan, part-time teachers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only receive credited service for the part of the school year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that they work. The section of the Pension Plan in issue in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, s.94(4), is an exception to the normal rule that teachers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are credited only for days or hours worked. Section 94(4) states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (4) An active member may purchase
          credited service for all or part of an
          absence or a break in service.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The word &quot;absence&quot; is broadly defined in s.94 to mean &quot;a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leave of absence, with or without pay, to which a member's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer consents&quot;. The School Board consented to Mr. Stadler</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">going on a leave of absence for each of the three school years</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between September 1, 1989 and June 30, 1992. The crux of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal then is whether for those three school years Mr. Stadler</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a full-time teacher on a leave of absence for half of each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">day or whether he was a part-time teacher. On this question, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties agree that the decision of the Pension Board is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to deference. The Pension Board is not protected by a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">privative clause and its members have no special expertise in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pension law. The standard of review, therefore, is correctness.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Although the School Board granted Mr. Stadler a &quot;leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence&quot; for the three school years in question neither its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterization of nor its consent to his reduced teaching load</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is determinative. The School Board has no financial stake in this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dispute because it is not required to contribute to the Pension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Plan. Although the School Board must consent to a &quot;leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence&quot; to permit the teacher to purchase credited service, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">School Board cannot by simply calling a teacher's reduced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teaching load a &quot;leave of absence&quot; turn it into a leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence under the Pension Plan. Otherwise, the Minister would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to match contributions made by all teachers classified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by their school boards as being on a leave of absence regardless</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the validity of that classification.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Similarly, the type of contract under which a teacher is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hired is not determinative. Both the OSSTF and the Divisional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court appeared to rely on the fact that Mr. Stadler was hired to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teach full-time to support their position that he was on a leave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of absence. In my view, it is irrelevant that Mr. Stadler was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">originally hired to teach full-time. Whether a teacher is a full-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time or a part-time employee and whether a teacher is on a leave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of absence must be determined by interpreting the relevant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation, not by the teacher's contract. See: Hugh v. Ontario</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Teachers' Pension Plan Board, [1993] O.J. No.1083(C.A.), leave to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal to the S.C.C. refused February 3, 1994.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The Pension Plan distinguishes between part-time employees</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and employees on a leave of absence. Mr. Stadler must have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one or the other during the three years in question; he could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been both. Both the definition of part-time teacher under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.2, and the definition of part-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time and full-time employees under the Pension Plan support the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Minister's position that Mr. Stadler became a part-time employee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during the three school years in question. Section 1(1) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Education Act, defines a &quot;part-time teacher&quot; as a &quot;teacher</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employed by a board on a regular basis for other than full-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty&quot;. This definition fits a teacher like Mr. Stadler who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teaches half-days everyday of the school year.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The Pension Plan similarly defines full-time and part-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees. Section 1(3) of the Plan states:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (3) A person is considered to be
          employed,
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  full-time, if the person is required to
               work throughout each work day of a year
               or of a session; and
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  part-time, if the person is required to
               work on a regular but not full-time
               basis.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] For the three school years in question Mr. Stadler was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to teach regularly C every day C but not on a full-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis. Under the Pension Plan he was therefore a part-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teacher. And under the Pension Plan part-time teachers are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permitted to purchase credited service for time not worked. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Plan contains express provisions for the calculation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contributions by part-time teachers. These express provisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">show that part-time teachers are not permitted to purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credited service under s.94 of the Plan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Admittedly, &quot;absence&quot; under s.94 is broadly defined to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">include &quot;leave of absence&quot; and is not further defined. There are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at least three reasons however, why a part-time teacher cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered to be on a leave of absence under s.94.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] First, the ordinary meaning of being on a leave of absence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is being temporarily absent from work with the intention of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">returning to work. See: Black's Law Dictionary, 6th ed. (1990) at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">891. Ordinarily being on a leave of absence does not mean working</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regularly but only for part of a work day. A person on a leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence is away from the workplace with the employer's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permission, for any one of a variety of reasons C for example,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">study, pregnancy or illness. A person who works mornings and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">takes afternoons off is not absent from the workplace. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of the British Columbia Labour Arbitration Board in Re</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crane Canada Inc. and U.A., Loc. 170 (1993), 33 L.A.C. (4th) 236</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at 239, captures the ordinary meaning of a leave of absence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Although it is unnecessary to give a
          comprehensive definition of a &quot;leave of
          absence&quot; it typically represents a period
          during which the employee is not at work
          where the employee has sought and obtained
          the permission of the employer. Generally,
          the absence is because of needs and wishes of
          the employee and has the approval or
          permission of the employer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] I see no reason to reject the ordinary meaning of leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence for some other interpretation. Neither the context in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which s.94 is found nor the purpose of the Pension Plan suggests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a different interpretation. The OSSTF's position blurs the clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">distinction made in the Pension Plan between part-time employees</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and employees on a leave of absence and would treat adversely and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfairly teachers on part-time contracts working the identical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hours and days as Mr. Stadler.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Second, the way contributions are calculated for an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;absence&quot; under s.94 shows that teaching half-days cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">classified as a leave of absence. Under s.94(6) and (7) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pension Plan, the amount of and due date for contributions by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teachers who elect to purchase credited service are calculated by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reference to the teacher's &quot;return date&quot;. Section 94(8) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pension Plan provides that &quot;a member's return date following an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence or break in service is the member's twenty-first day of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment in education in the first school year during which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">member works more than twenty days following the absence or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">break.&quot; This subsection cannot apply to Mr. Stadler because,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although he did not teach in the afternoons, he never ceased to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be employed in education. For the OSSTF's position to be correct,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Stadler's &quot;return date&quot; would have to be his twenty-first day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of employment after he returned to full-time teaching. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be the case. A &quot;return date&quot; ordinarily implies that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person is returning to something the person has left. Yet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">throughout the time frame Mr. Stadler claims he was on a leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absence, he remained employed in education. He cannot be said to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have returned to employment in education when he never left that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employment. In other words, although he may returned to full-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">teaching, he did not return to employment in education.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The third reason favouring the Minister's position flows</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from comparing the provisions of the current Pension Plan with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its predecessor in O.Reg. 423/84 promulgated under the previous</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation, the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1983, S.O. 1983,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">c.84. The previous pension plan also allowed teachers credit in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Teachers' Superannuation Fund for a leave of absence or break</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in service. Section 7 of the 1984 regulation listed specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">kinds of leaves of absence C for example, travel, study, ill</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">health or pregnancy. Admittedly, s.94 of the current Pension Plan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has adopted a broad definition of absence instead of listing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specific kinds of leaves. To that extent s.94 is more flexible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than its predecessor, s. 7 of the 1984 regulation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] But the significance of the 1984 regulation lies in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treatment of credited service for position sharing. When Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Stadler first began teaching half time he was position sharing,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is, sharing a full teaching load with another teacher. Under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.14 of the 1984 regulation C not s.7 C a teacher was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credit in the Fund for &quot;a period of leave of absence because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">participation in a position-sharing scheme&quot;. Under s.14.1(iii) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the regulation if the person's employer confirmed that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;person would have been employed in education on a full-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis but for participating in the position-sharing scheme&quot;, that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person was entitled to credit for being on a leave of absence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Thus, under the 1984 regulation Mr. Stadler would have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to full credited service when he taught part-time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because he was position sharing. However, this special provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for credited service because of position sharing had a limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">life span. Under s.14.6 of the regulation, no person was entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to credit in the Fund for a leave of absence because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">participation in a position sharing arrangement before September</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1, 1982 and after August 31, 1989. Provision for credited service</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for position sharing was not expressly retained in the 1989</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statute or in the current Pension Plan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The OSSTF argues that the current Pension Plan uses a broad</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition of absence instead of itemizing specific kinds of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">absences and therefore that credited service for position sharing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is incorporated in this broad definition in s.94. I do not agree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The itemized leaves of absence in s.7 of the 1984 regulation are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">undoubtedly included in the definition of absence under s.94 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the current Pension Plan. But credited service for position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sharing was treated separately and was limited in duration under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the 1984 regulation. Therefore, I do not think that s.94 can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably be interpreted to embrace leaves of absence for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">position sharing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Although courts should use legislative history cautiously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when interpreting a statute or a regulation, comparing two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">successive versions of a provision can demonstrate that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantive change was intended. In my view, comparing s.94 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Pension Plan with sections 7 and 14 of the 1984 regulation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demonstrates a legislative intent to change the law by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eliminating leaves of absence for position sharing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The Minister's position does, seemingly, produce some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anomalous results. For example, a teacher in a semestered program</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who teaches full time for the first half of the school year and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then takes the second half of the year off may teach the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of hours as Mr. Stadler and yet may properly be considered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be on a leave of absence for the second half of the school</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">year. This result, however, flows from the provisions of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Pension Plan. Moreover, teachers who leave the workplace for an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entire semester ordinarily do so for one of the usual reasons for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a leave of absence. And the number of teachers permitted to take</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these leaves will likely be limited. Thus, I do not think that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this example detracts from the Minister's position.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conclusion
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Divisional Court, grant the application for judicial review and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set aside the decision of the Pension Board. Because this issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has not been litigated before, I would make no order for costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either in this court or in the Divisional Court.
