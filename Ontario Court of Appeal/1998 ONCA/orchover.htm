    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    The appeals in these two actions are scheduled to be heard
on September 11, 1998 and this motion seeks to introduce a new
ground of appeal to permit the plaintiff in the Grogan action to
take advantage of this court's judgment in Bannon v. McNeely.
Subject to complications that arise if the motion is allowed, no
further material would be necessary to argue the new ground and
the appeals could proceed on September 11.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The plaintiffs pursued two defendants for damages arising
out of separate accidents. In the Grogan action the adjudged
damages were reduced by the amount of statutory accident benefits
to zero. This led to a cost award which the defendants appealed.
The defendant Wright also appeals saying that some of the
accident benefits should have been applied to reduce his award.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    At the time of trial the plaintiffs took no issue with the
full deduction of the accident benefits, including from the award
of general damages. It is said that if the Bannon decision is
applied the plaintiffs will have a recovery of 100,000 including
interest (approximately).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The defendant Grogan contested the threshold issue at
trial but did not appeal because the recovery was nil against
him. If he is now to be exposed to a large judgment he wants an
opportunity to decide whether to appeal the threshold issue. If
this occurs a full transcript of over 20 days evidence will be
needed and the appeals cannot proceed on September 11 on the
basis of the agreed statement of facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The issue is whether the plaintiffs who acceded to the
former interpretation of the statute at trial and did not appeal
any ground of liability or damages should now be allowed to
assert a claim based upon the new interpretation of the statute.
The issue is further complicated by the fact that if in the
Wright appeal the court should hold that some of the credits
should be transferred from Grogan to Wright, as things now stand
they would be taken from a gross sum and then applied to specific
items in accordance with Bannon. This would result in a trial
leading to different formula applications of the credits to the
two judgments.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    This issue may have significant implications to other
appeals in the stream and I therefore wish, as a single judge, to
avoid a general prouncement as to whether cases in the stream
should all be treated under the new understanding of the law or
where a cut-off should be drawn.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    With that in mind I will permit the notice of appeal and
factum to be amended to claim this new ground of appeal, and, in
doing so, make it clear that I am not prejudging the entitlement
to successfully assert this entitlement, given the position taken
at trial and thenceforward. That will be for disposition at the
hearing having regard to the general policy and the authorities
cited to me dealing with finality of issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    That leaves for disposition the potential appeal by Grogan
as to the threshold, being the only prejudice I am inflicting by
this order. I grant leave to Grogan to cross-appeal on this
ground if it is filed on or before September 1, 1998. In the
event it is filed the appeals will be removed from the list until
that appeal is perfected.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    The appellant Orchover will file an amended notice of
appeal and amended factum by August 27, 1998. The other parties
may file an amended factum in response by September 6, 1998. This
new issue may alter the considerations as to the costs appeal but
these can be readily dealt with without changes to the facta.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   An order shall issue in accordance with these reasons. The
costs are reserved to the panel hearing the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]   These reasons should be provided by the Registrar to the
panel in advance so that its members will understand why these
changes are being made at this late date.
