says, &quot;To stop work now.  Due date Oct. 29/92&quot;.  (The child was

actually born on October 23, 1992.)  The second says, &quot;Return to

work December 4/92&quot;.


[8]  A staff member of OSSTF, who represented OSSTF in the

grievance procedure, wrote to Dr. Bourke before the hearing of

the grievance stating that the above notes had &quot;not been accepted

as evidence of her actual physical disability during the period

in question&quot;, and asking a number of questions for clarification.

His response is quoted below:

          In response to your letter of June 14,1994.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I am providing the following answers to
          your questions raised in your letter:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   I graduated from Medical School in
          1967 from the Royal College of Surgeons,
          Dublin Ireland. I was granted my Canadian
          Fellowship F.R.C.S. in Obstetrics and
          Gynaecology in 1973.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   I did provide all 3 notes that are listed.          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   I was attending Physician at the
          birth of Carlinda D'Alimonte's child.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.   I think it is fairly obvious that
          she could not be working and delivering her
          baby at the same time. Therefore, it is
          impossible for her to be working and
          delivering on the same day.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is a standard teaching in Obstetrics
          that a normal post partum birth is 6 weeks.
          This allows the pelvis to heal adequately,
          the vaginal canal to heal naturally and
          properly. The uterus returns to its normal
          non pregnant state. The vaginal bleeding has
          usually subsided by 6 weeks.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          For all of the above it is normal that a
          woman remain off work for 6 weeks following
          delivery.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  When he attended before the Board of Arbitration (the

&quot;Board&quot;), Dr. Bourke declined to elaborate on the comments in his

letter.  It is interesting to note that nowhere in that letter

does Dr. Bourke state that Mrs. D'Alimonte was suffering from a

&quot;sickness, or physical or emotional disability&quot;.  These are the

criteria for granting sick leave within the terms of Art.

12.01(a)(iii) of the Collective Agreement.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The OSSTF takes the position that Mrs. D'Alimonte was

discriminated against on the basis of sex, contrary to ss. 5(1)

and 10(2) of the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19

by being denied sick leave subsequent to the birth of her child

and prior to the commencement of pregnancy and parental leave.

Those sections read:

          5. - (l)  Every person has a right to
          equal treatment with respect to employment
          without discrimination because of race,
          ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic
          origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual
          orientation, age, record of offences, marital
          status, family status or handicap.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          10. - (2)  The right to equal treatment
          without discrimination because of sex
          includes the right to equal treatment without
          discrimination because a woman is or may
          become pregnant.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The majority of the Board held that there had been no

discrimination.  The Divisional Court reversed that decision.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Reasons of the Board of Arbitration
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The essence of the majority and of the minority reasons  of

the Board are reproduced below:

               Majority opinion
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The long and short of it is that this
          collective agreement and federal and Ontario
          legislation have established a climate of
          labour relations in which sick leave and
          maternity leave are considered as separate
          types of leave. No one doubts that an
          employee is unable to work for part of the
          time that they are on maternity leave and in
          fact the U.I.C. income supplement paid for
          fifteen of those weeks helps make up for some
          of the lost pay. I find it of some
          significance that the Employment Standards
          Act does not include a sick leave plan and
          that the payment of benefits towards a sick
          leave plan is not within the contemplation of
          that Act. Thus, on balance I prefer the
          employer's position.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The words &quot;physical disability&quot; in the
          sick leave plan in this collective agreement
          in their ordinary usage might well cover some
          of the time when a mother would be unable to
          work because of having given birth. This
          would be from the day of birth to perhaps
          four to six weeks thereafter. I do not think
          that the phrase &quot;physical disability&quot; can be
          given its wide ordinary usage but must be
          read in the context of the sick leave plan
          itself and the collective agreement. Physical
          disabilities due to maternity are, in my
          view, recognized in the Employment Standards
          Act maternity leave provisions and the sick
          leave plan must be interpreted to exclude
          them, therefore. In the result the grievance
          is dismissed.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Minority opinion
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The fact that the collective agreement
          provides two different benefits for which
          eligibility may overlap in some instances, is
          not an argument for reading into the sick
          leave provisions an exclusion which is not
          present in the text of the agreement. Sick
          leave is an earned benefit whose fundamental
          purpose is to protect income when employees
          are unable to work on account of sickness and
          disability. There is no reason why a pregnant
          employee ought not be able to take advantage
          of this income protection plan. Had the
          parties intended to so narrow the sick leave
          provisions they would surely have said so. In
          the absence of clear language to this effect,
          an employee ought not to be deprived of such
          a benefit simply because she may be entitled
          to some lesser benefit under the agreement. Y
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In my view there is nothing absurd,
          unreasonable or anomalous in permitting women
          who are disabled on account of pregnancy to
          draw upon their sick leave credits in the
          same manner as an employee who has undergone
          surgery, who has broken his leg, or who
          suffers from a common cold. It is entirely
          consistent with the purpose of the sick leave
          plan that an employee have her income
          protected when she is unable to work on
          account of disability regardless of the
          nature of that disability. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Standard of Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The Divisional Court held that the appropriate standard of

review in this case is that of correctness, since the true issue

in the case involves the application of a general public statute,

namely the Ontario Human Rights Code, and not simply the

interpretation of the Collective Agreement.  With respect, I am

of the view that there are two major issues in the case, each of

which involves a different standard of review -- first, the

interpretation of the leave provisions of the Collective

Agreement and, second, whether the interpretation of those

provisions results in discrimination contrary to the provisions

of the Ontario Human Rights Code.  With respect to the first, the

privative provision in s. 72 of the School Boards and Teachers

Collective Negotiations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.2 applies.  With

respect to the second, if the interpretation of the relevant

provisions of the Collective Agreement given by the Board of

Arbitration is in conflict with the provisions of the Ontario

Human Rights Code, then the provisions of the Code prevail. The

standard of review on that issue is clearly one of correctness.

          would be without wage benefit for the first
          two weeks of pregnancy or adoption leave.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The majority of the Board held that the leaves provided for

in the Collective Agreement were distinct, and intended for

separate and distinct purposes.  They were of the view that

although there might be a &quot;physical disability&quot; component to

recovery from pregnancy and giving birth, that was intended to be

provided for in the maternity leave provisions of the Collective

Agreement.  In the argument before us, the appellant took the

position that a pregnancy and delivery without complications was

contemplated by the provisions of the Employment Standards Act

(the provisions of which are incorporated into the Collective

Agreement), and that such a pregnancy and delivery did not result

in a sickness or physical disability within the meaning of the

Collective Agreement.  To apply the ordinary meaning of the words

&quot;physical disability&quot; would be to ignore the intention of the

parties when they entered into the Agreement. In my view, that is

not an unreasonable reading of the Collective Agreement.

[16] However, that does not end the matter.  Such an

interpretation of the provisions of the Collective Agreement may

mean that the Agreement discriminates on the basis of sex

(including pregnancy), proscribed by ss. 5(l) and 10(2) of the

Ontario Human Rights Code.

Ontario Human Rights Code
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The basic position of the appellant is that the Agreement

does not discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, and that any

pregnant woman who also becomes sick or physically or mentally

disabled may claim and receive sick leave in addition to her

pregnancy leave.  All sick or disabled persons are treated in

exactly the same manner B male or female B pregnant or not

pregnant.


[18] That argument has substantial appeal in that it allows for

uncomplicated administration of the Agreement. The problem is

that all &quot;disabled&quot; persons are not treated the same by the

agreement.  Women giving birth normally, and who, it is

acknowledged, would nonetheless be &quot;physically disabled&quot;, in the

ordinary sense of those words, for some undetermined length of

time, would not receive leave with pay for that period.  In my

view, that is all that is being argued about in this case.  In

that sense, I agree with Adams J. that the Board's reading of the

Agreement results in discrimination against pregnant women.  See

Brooks v. The Canada Safeway Ltd (1989), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 321

(S.C.C.).


[19] The parties to the Agreement will, no doubt, consider ways

to amend its provisions to preclude the practical complications

of having to determine a specific period of disability in each

case of an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.


Result
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In this case, Mrs. D'Alimonte had ample opportunity to prove

the period of her disability.  Her physician, although called as

a witness, declined to give the relevant evidence and neither the

Board nor the Divisional Court was able to determine the relevant

period in which Mrs. D'Alimonte would have been entitled to sick

leave. In the circumstances, I see no reason to send this matter

back to the Board of Arbitration.


[21] I would allow the appeal on that basis alone, set aside that

part of the order of the Divisional Court which remitted the

matter to the Board and provided for the payment of interest, and

confirm the Board's dismissal. However, in the circumstances, I

would make no order as to costs here or below.
