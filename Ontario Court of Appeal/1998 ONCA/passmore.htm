    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant does not dispute that the respondent Passmore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffered damages in the amount of $1,377,885.95. However, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant argues that clause 20 of Schedule A of the Agreement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Purchase and Sale operates to limit Passmore’s damages to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of the appellant’s deposits, totalling $422,598.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Clause 20 provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          20.  In the event the Purchaser defaults on
          any of his obligations herein contained, or
          contained in the Occupancy Agreement, prior
          to closing and fails to remedy such default
          within five (5) days of his being so notified
          in writing, the Vendor, in addition to any
          other remedies this Agreement provides, may
          at its option declare this Agreement and the
          Occupancy Agreement to be at an end and any
          deposit monies together with all monies paid
          for any extras or changes shall be retained
          by the Vendor as its liquidated damages and
          not as a penalty. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          Please be advised that our client accepts
          your repudiation of the Agreements of
          Purchase and Sale which are terminated and of
          no further force and effect. By reason of
          your breach of contract and repudiation of
          the Agreements of Purchase and Sale, all
          deposit money previously paid has been fofeit
          to our client as liquidated damages and not
          as a penalty. We wish to further advise that
          you will be held responsible for all
          additional costs, losses and damage which our
          client will incur as a result of or arising
          out of your breach of contract and
          repudiation of the Agreement of Purchase and
          Sale. Interest on any amount found to be
          owing by you will be claimed pursuant to the
          Courts of Justice Act, S.O. 1980), c. 11, ss.
          138-139, as amended.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The letter enclosed a draft statement of claim asserting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Passmore’s claim for the actual damages it would suffer as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result of the appellant’s default.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  At common law, one of the options open to a vendor in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Passmore’s position is to elect to accept the purchaser’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repudiation of the agreement and sue for its damages in respect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the breach committed. Maysen v. Clouet, [1924] A.C. 980 (H.L.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at 985.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant submits that the vendor’s only option is to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceed under clause 20 and that as a result the vendor is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited in its claim for damages to the amount of the deposits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and has in effect forfeited the common law right to sue for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">full amount of its loss.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We are satisfied that a proper interpretation of clause 20</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not remove the options open to Passmore at common and law and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not therefore preclude Passmore from electing to accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s repudiation and sue for the full amount of its loss.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  It is clear that Passmore did not opt to proceed in a manner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that would limit its claim for damages. To the contrary, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter of October 3, 1990 clearly set out its intention to pursue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a claim in an amount in excess of the amount of the deposits.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, the appeal against the judgment in favour of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Passmore is dismissed with costs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellant also appealed the dismissal of its third party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim against the respondent’s Kevin Lo and Sincere Realty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">O’Brien J. found that the facts of this case did not give rise to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a duty on the part of these respondents to qualify the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as a purchaser or to advise her to seek legal advice. We did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">call on the respondent in respect to this part of the appeal as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">we saw no merit in it. Accordingly, this branch of the appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also dismissed with costs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] We are not certain if all counsel agreed that costs should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be fixed in the amount of $25,000 each and for this reason we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would order that costs be assessed.</font></pre></td>
