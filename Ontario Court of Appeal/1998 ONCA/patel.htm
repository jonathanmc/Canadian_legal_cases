    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                
[1]  We are all of the opinion that this appeal must succeed and
there must be a new trial. Counsel has attacked the judgment on
two grounds. The first was that the charge to the jury was unfair
and that there was misdirection. The second was that the verdict
of the jury was unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  As we are all of the view that the appeal succeeds on the
second ground, it is unnecessary to deal with the criticisms of
the charge in detail. However, we are not to be taken as
approving of it as there are aspects of the charge which we think
are not satisfactory.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Counsel has carefully reviewed the evidence with us. In
light of the respondent Giuseppe Rizzo=s admission that by his
carelessness he created a situation of danger on the roof into
which he invited the appellant Bhavanbhai Patel to move, we think
the verdict that the respondent had taken all reasonable care in
the circumstances was not reasonable. The verdict cannot stand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Therefore, the appeal from liability must succeed. The issue
of credibility runs through both the issue of liability and the
issue of damages. Accordingly, the new trial will be with respect
to both of the issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the cross-appeal is
dismissed. The judgment at trial is set aside and there will be a
new trial on both liability and damages. The appellants will have
the costs of the appeal. The costs of the first trial will be at
the discretion of the judge presiding at the second trial.</font></pre></td>
