    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dockets for the original motion and no dockets at all for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The assessment officer gave reasons in which she stated as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            On the assessment, the solicitor for the
            plaintiffs had filed a bill of costs
            claiming approximately 230 hours with
            respect to drafting of materials,
            research, preparation and attendance on
            the motions in the General Division.
            Time dockets submitted in support
            totaled [sic] 78.4 hours (after it was
            determined that 6.5 of docketed hours
            related to another motion and were not
            properly assessable at this assessment).
            A second bill of costs relating to the
            attendance at the Court of Appeal was
            filed as well, claiming approximately
            232 hours with respect to drafting of
            materials, research, preparation and
            attendance.  There were no time dockets
            submitted in support of this bill of
            costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            I am fully aware that the absence of
            dockets does not mean that the solicitor
            should not be compensated (The Law of
            Costs, 2nd Edition, Ch. 311.1(7)),
            however, I would remind counsel that at
            the assessment hearing full submissions
            were heard from both solicitors and
            evidence of the work done, as well as
            the time dockets submitted, were
            carefully considered.  All time honoured
            factors and principles of assessment
            were applied including the complexity of
            the proceeding, the degree of
            responsibility assumed, the skill and
            competence demonstrated by the
            solicitor, the importance of the issues
            to the client and the result achieved.
            Factors that can attribute to the
            expenditure of reasonably excessive
            preparation time such as experience of
            counsel, unnecessary preparation and
            preparation due to an overabundance of
            caution were combed through the dockets
            and I did determine that, under the
            given circumstances, the following was
            fair and reasonable and will remain as
            assessed:</font></pre>

Appeal

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    It appears from these reasons that the assessment officer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took into account the proper factors to be applied on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment but, based on a review of the dockets that were there,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">came to the conclusion that Mr. Azevedo had spent an inordinate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount of time in unnecessary preparation applying an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overabundance of caution.  Consequently, she significantly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reduced the hours he claimed to have spent from 230 hours in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect of the motion and 232 in respect of the appeal down to 55</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hours for the motion and 52.5 hours for the appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    The appellant solicitor's position is that the assessment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer made an error in principle by failing to appreciate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complexity and importance of the issue and therefore the degree</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of skill required to successfully prepare for and argue the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal. The respondent takes the position that the assessment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officer made no error in principle and that the only issue on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this appeal is as to amount.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    In my view, based on the record, it cannot be said that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assessment officer made an error in principle.  The award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">included a significant amount of time to prepare for and argue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this matter. If the preparation involved something extraordinary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which the solicitor desires to demonstrate to this court on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record, he would require dockets to do so.  The assessment of 50</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hours is not one which this court can say is too low as a matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of principle to prepare for an appeal on a question of law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
