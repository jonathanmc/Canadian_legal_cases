    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by Sharon Paul, wife of the respondent,
Walter Picavet, from a judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice
Cunningham, dated February 6, 1997. Cunningham J., on an amended
application to vary a separation agreement, ordered a reduction
of support payments provided for in the separation agreement from
$2,500 to $1,500 per month. His order was made retroactive to
July 1996, resulting in a required refund from the wife to the
husband of $9,375. He also ordered the deletion of paragraphs 12
and 13 of the agreement, thus relieving the husband of the
obligation to provide health coverage and group life insurance in
favour of the wife. Costs were also awarded against the wife in
the amount of $10,681.42.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Cunningham J. concluded that the appellant wife did not, at
any time, fully and properly disclose to her previous solicitor
that in May, 1995 she was hired by BASF as a bilingual product
safety assistant, commencing June 5, 1995, at a starting salary
of $27,500 per annum reviewable after three months. In fact, he
was satisfied that throughout the negotiations leading to the
preparation and signing of the separation agreement, the
appellant wife led her previous solicitor to believe her
situation remained unchanged and that the parties relied upon
each other for full disclosure in negotiating an adequate level
of support in the separation agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Counsel for the appellant wife takes the position that there
were material facts in dispute and, therefore, the judge hearing
the application erred in not ordering a trial. In any event, he
argues, the judge misapprehended the affidavits and examinations
thereon, and made findings of fact which were not open to him. In
the alternative, he argues that even if it were open to
Cunningham J. to vary the support provided for in the agreement,
he did so outside the appropriate range in failing to follow well
settled principles of support law, including the concept of
compensatory support.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Cunningham J. stated at the commencement of his reasons that
the issue in the proceedings was the husband's knowledge of his
wife's income at the time he executed the agreement. He expressed
the view that the wife did not make her husband aware of her
changed circumstances and also that this was not a case where the
husband knew that the facts were different than originally stated
by the wife, but decided not to inquire further about details. We
agree that the uncontroverted evidence can only lead to such
conclusions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  While the statement that the non-disclosure of the wife
amounted to an inducement to the husband to sign the agreement
may be somewhat strong, the result is the same. The evidence on
the application does not satisfy us that there was any intent on
the part of the wife to falsify her income, but again, the result
is the same. The husband signed an agreement based on a set of
facts as to his wife's employment income which was not accurate,
and the inaccuracy did not result from any default on the part of
the husband; it resulted, rather, from statements presented by
the wife which were inaccurate well before the signing of the
agreement, and which she had a legal obligation to correct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  As noted, the appellant argues that, in any event, the
support order was inadequate and failed to comply with the
guidelines set out in Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 345
(S.C.C.). When the agreement was signed, each party had
independent legal advice. There is no indication that all
appropriate support law principles, including compensatory
support, were not considered at that time. It is also somewhat
unrealistic to isolate the agreement respecting support from the
other parts of the agreement, including the substantial lump sum
payment and equalization payment made by the respondent to the
appellant. In our view, the only question before us is what the
agreed to support payments would have been, as part of that
entire package, had all the facts been known. The wife's income
was approximately $29,000 per annum more than stated. That being
the case, the reduction in supported ordered by the trial judge
of $1,000 per month does not seem to us out of line. Her after
tax income on the $29,000 would be in excess of $12,000
regardless of the tax rate applied.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Cunningham J. ordered that the appellant reimburse the
respondent for the total overpayment of support payments from a
date one year from the date of execution of the agreement. The
appellant argues that he erred in making the order retroactive.
We do not agree. The respondent had taken the view from the
commencement of the application that the variation should date
from that time rather than from the date of execution of the
agreement. This position is consistent with the terms of the
agreement themselves whereby the respondent agreed not to seek a
variation of the spousal support for the first twelve months
after execution, even though it was contemplated that within that
one year period the appellant might well obtain employment. We
see no error in that portion of his order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant also appeals that part of the judgment which
varies the separation agreement by deleting that portion of
paragraph 13 of the agreement requiring the respondent to
maintain group life insurance through his place of employment.
Paragraph 13 reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          13.  GROUP INSURANCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  The husband currently participates in a
          group insurance plan through his employer,
          Canadian Bank Note, being policy #9085. The
          husband shall maintain the wife as the
          irrevocable beneficiary of this plan for so
          long as the benefit is available to the
          husband through employment for an amount of
          $100,000.00. In the event that this policy is
          no longer available to the husband, through
          this employment, he shall only be obligated
          to maintain a similar life insurance plan if
          it becomes available to him, through
          subsequent employment, at no cost or nominal
          cost to him. If this similar plan is
          available, at no cost or nominal cost to the
          husband, through subsequent employment, he
          shall designate the wife as irrevocable
          beneficiary for an amount of $100,000.00</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  The parties recognize that the amount of
          insurance coverage, as specified in this
          agreement, may decrease if the quantum of
          support is materially reduced and agree that
          the amount of coverage may, from time to
          time, be subject to variation as the parties
          may agree, or, as a court of competent
          jurisdiction may determine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  The husband shall authorize the insurer
          and plan administrator to provide the wife
          with any information she may request relating
          to her entitlement pursuant to this plan, or
          to any replacement plan, and shall provide
          her with copies of all communications between
          himself and the insurer or plan administrator
          within 10 days of the communication.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  The husband shall not make any
          elections, designations or nominations under
          these plans that would in any way affect the
          coverage relating to the wife without the
          wife=s prior written consent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (e)  If the husband dies without this
          insurance in effect, his obligation to pay
          support, if any, pursuant to the Separation
          Agreement will survive his death and this
          obligation will be a first charge on his
          estate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  We were informed that although the respondent has changed
his place of employment, he has available through his new
employer group life insurance in the amount of $35,000. He has
named the lady with whom he was living at the time of the hearing
as beneficiary of that insurance. Our reading of the above
provision would require that the named beneficiary under that
policy be changed to name the appellant, and we would so order.
The result is that the appellant, under the circumstances
existing at the hearing, is entitled to be beneficiary of the
respondent's group life policy in the amount of $35,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Result</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appeal is allowed to the extent of deleting paragraph l
or the judgment to read, &quot;This court orders that the Separation
Agreement be varied such that paragraph 12 is deleted.&quot; Paragraph
13 is to be left intact, to be applied as circumstances dictate.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] We are of the view that the order as to costs of the hearing
was punitive, reflecting the applications judge's view (which we
do not consider was made out on the evidence) that the wife
actively mislead her husband as to her income. The appellant
should have informed her lawyer and thus her husband of the
change in her financial condition. However, the respondent must
bear some of the blame for what occurred. Although the
negotiations had been proceeding for some time, shortly before
the date the agreement was executed, the respondent began to
exert considerable pressure upon the appellant to quickly reach
an agreement. In particular, he left a message with the appellant
that if she did not sign his version of the agreement by July 5,
1995, he would call off negotiations and stop payment on all
other cheques. Thereafter, all of the parties were working to
this artificial deadline imposed by the respondent. Accordingly,
we would allow the respondent one-half of his party and party
costs at trial. Since success was divided on the appeal, there
will be no costs of the appeal.</font></pre></td>
