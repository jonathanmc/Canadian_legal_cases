    <pre><b><font face="Courier New" size="3">MORDEN A.C.J.O.:</font></b></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted of having the care or
control of a  motor vehicle while his ability to operate a
motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 253(a)
of the Criminal  Code. His  appeal  to  the summary
conviction appeal  court  from  this conviction  was
dismissed. He now seeks leave to appeal,  and  if leave be
granted, appeals to this court from that dismissal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The issue before this court, broadly phrased, is
whether the summary conviction appeal court judge correctly
concluded that the trial judge applied the correct legal
test of &quot;care or control&quot; to the facts of this case.

[3]  The basic facts are as follows. At about 1:08 a.m. on
October 28, 1994 two constables of the Wallaceburg Police
Service observed the appellant seated in the driver's seat
of a Ford Ranger pick-up truck which was parked on the east
side of Bridge Street in Wallaceburg across from a licensed
establishment. The appellant appeared to be unconscious or
sleeping. He was sitting with his head tilted back towards
the head-rest with his eyes closed. One of the constables
requested several times that he open the door and he
eventually complied.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   The police observed that the appellant had glassy
eyes, his speech  was  slurred,  and his movements were
very  awkward.  In addition,  there  was  a strong  odour of  
alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. The keys to the
vehicle were on  the floor directly below the driver's seat, 
between the  appellant's feet.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]   The two samples of the appellant's breath which were 
taken showed that his blood alcohol concentration was 202 
milligrams of alcohol  in 100  millilitres  of blood  at 
3:00  a.m.  and 206 milligrams at 3:22 a.m.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant testified that on October 28, 1994 he had been
working  in  Windsor and had returned to Wallaceburg around 
7:30 p.m. on his way home. He stopped at a bar and &quot;had quite 
a bit to drink&quot;. He said that he was drinking beer and shots of
liquor. He left  the  bar and went back to his truck. He said 
that he threw the keys underneath the passenger's side seat and 
put his feet on the  passenger's side and fell asleep. He testified 
that when  he entered   the vehicle he was not going to drive but 
was going  to &quot;sleep it off&quot; and that &quot;[if] I woke up at 5:00 then
I was going to  go  home&quot; and then to work in Windsor. He said 
that he leaves Wallaceburg at 5:30 a.m. to get to work in
Windsor by  7:00  a.m. or 8:00 a.m.

[7]   The  trial judge first considered whether the  Crown could
rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code - 
of care  or  control - because the appellant did occupy the seat  
or position ordinarily occupied by a person who operates  a
motor vehicle.  Because he accepted the appellant's evidence  
that  &quot;he got  into that vehicle with an intention other than to drive
it&quot; he  did not apply the presumption. (The respondent did not  
argue that  the  trial judge erred in concluding that the  appellant's
evidence that he intended to set the vehicle in motion  at  some 
later time satisfied the presumption and so I shall not deal with it. 
Cf. R. v. George (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 502 (Nfld. C.A.)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The  trial  judge  then referred to the decisions  of the
Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ford (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 392 
and R. v. Toews (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 24 and then a passage from the
judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Diotte (1991),  
64 C.C.C. (3d) 209 which held that it was not  necessary to  establish
some overt action on the part of  the  accused to indicate that he 
was involved with the vehicle in such a  way  as to  cause danger to
the public but that care or control could  be established:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        where   [the   accused]  had  the immediate capacity  
	and means of operating  a vehicle, there  existed the
        risk that he would put  it in motion and become a danger to
        the public, even  though at the time he was found by  the
        police he was asleep in the front seat of the vehicle.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   The  trial judge found that it &quot;is a simple matter to  pick
keys  up  off  the floor and put the key in the ignition  and  do 
something which could set the vehicle in motion&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  There  was no real issue respecting impairment. The  trial 
judge  found the appellant guilty with respect to the
charge  of having  care  or  control of a motor vehicle while  
impaired  and stayed the charge in the second count in the
information of care or  control having consumed alcohol
in such a quantity  that  the concentration in his blood exceeded 80
milligrams of  alcohol  in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s.
253(b) of the Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  The summary conviction appeal court judge said with respect to 
the applicable law:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In  my opinion, the care and control that is
          necessary to be shown by the prosecution does not
	      have to go to the extent of a  clear finding  of
          an  intention  to operate the vehicle.  I think the
          law as stated in Penno [R. v. Penno
          (1990), 59 C.C.C.(3d) 344]  is still the law and that
          there does not have to be  an intention
          clearly demonstrated to set the vehicle in
          motion. It is the capacity  to do so that is the
          ingredient that needs to be proven  here and  I 
	  think that the  learned trial judge found that to
          be so.

[12] The issue comes down to whether the trial judge applied  
the correct test of care and control. Section 253(a) provides:
          253   Everyone commits an offence who ... has
          the  care  or control of a motor vehicle  ... whether 
	  it is in motion or not,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  (a)  while  the  person's ability to  operate
       the  vehicle ... is impaired by alcohol or a drug; ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  The appellant submits that some action on the part  of  
the accused respecting the use of the motor vehicle
is required  for him or her to have the care and control of the 
motor vehicle. In this regard, he referred to the
following passage in Ford, supra, at p. 399:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...  Care or control may be exercised without
          such  intent [to set the vehicle  in motion] where  
	      an accused performs some act or series of acts 
	      involving the use of the  car,  its fittings or
	      equipment, such as occurred in this case, whereby
	      the vehicle    may unintentionally be set in motion
          creating the danger the section is designed to
	      prevent.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  The  appellant submits that there are no acts or series  of 
acts of this kind in this case. This is true, but this
passage in Ford  is  not an exhaustive statement of what may 
amount to  care and control. In Toews, supra, McIntyre J.
said for the court  at p. 29:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          What  will constitute having care or control,
          short  of  driving  the vehicle?  It  is, I suggest,
          impossible to set down an exhaustive list  of acts which
          could qualify as acts  of care or  control, but courts have
          provided illustrations which are of assistance.

[15]  McIntyre J. then quoted from four judgments, including  
the passage in Ford set forth above, and then said at p. 30:

          ...  The cases cited, however, illustrate the
          point and lead to the conclusion that acts of care
          or control, short of driving, are acts which  involve some
          use of the  car or  its  fittings  and  equipment, or
          some course  of conduct  associated with  the vehicle
          which would  involve a risk of putting the  vehicle in  
     	  motion so that it could become dangerous. Each  case  will
          depend on its own facts  and the circumstances in which
	      acts of care or control may be found will vary widely.
          [Emphasis added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]  Following this, he set forth the basic facts in Ford, which 
resulted in a conviction for care or control, and then
at  p.  30 the  facts in Toews, which the court held did not 
amount to  care or control:
        ...  In  the case at bar the vehicle  was  on
        private  property and the respondent was
        not in occupation of the driver's seat.	
	He  was unconscious  and clearly not  in  de  facto
	control.  The fact of his use of  a  sleeping bag  would
	support his statement that he was merely using the vehicle as
	a place to sleep. There remains the fact that the key
	was  in the ignition and that the stereo was playing.
	Strangely enough, however, there is no direct evidence
	that the respondent put the key  in the ignition or turned
	on the stereo, and the evidence is  that  the last  driver  of
	the vehicle was his friend, who drove him to  the party  and
	who  was  to drive him  home. I consider   that 
        in  view  of all the circumstances  described  above no        
        adverse inference should be drawn in this case on the basis 
        of the ignition key evidence alone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]  The  appellant relies upon Toews and submits that,  because 
the  facts of the  present case are essentially the same as those 
in  Toews,  its holding should govern this case. In my  view,
there  are  material differences in the facts of this  case  
and Toews to which I shall   advert but, in any event, I do
not think that  the analysis should begin with attempts to match 
the  facts of one case against those of another for
the purpose of arriving at  a dispositive conclusion. The analysis
should begin  with  a consideration of whether the facts as   found
are  subsumed under the governing principle stated by the Supreme 
Court  of Canada. In this process, the decisions in earlier cases 
can be helpful.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]  In  the  present  case,  the statement  of the  governing 
principle  most directly on point is set forth in  Toews  and  is
emphasized in the second last passage quoted above:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [A]cts  of care or control, short of driving,
          [may be]   ...  some  course of  conduct
          associated  with  the  vehicle which   would involve  
	  a  risk of putting the  vehicle  in  motion so that 
	  it could become dangerous.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The findings of the trial judge, which are supported by the 
evidence, bring this case within the principle. The appellant was 
found seated in the driver's seat, albeit asleep. The truck
was parked on the street and the keys were on the floor. The trial
judge observed that it was &quot;a simple matter to pick the keys off 
the floor and put the key in the ignition and do something
which could set the vehicle in motion&quot;. The trial judge accepted 
the appellant's evidence that he entered the car without
the intention of driving. On the appellant's evidence this meant the
immediate intention of driving. The appellant testified that, 
while he was going to &quot;sleep it off&quot;; &quot;[i]f I woke up
at 5:00 then I was going to go home&quot; and then to work in 
Windsor. At its best, as far as the appellant was concerned,  
this showed that he did intend to drive the  car  if, in his
subjective and potentially impaired opinion, he had “slept it off”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]  The facts which McIntyre J. for the Supreme Court of Canada 
considered relevant to the acquittal in Toews and which are
absent in this case are: in Toews the vehicle was on private 
property; the accused was not in the driver's seat; the
accused was in a sleeping bag; and a friend of his had driven 
him to the location and was to drive him home.

[21]  It is true that the trial judge relied on R. v.  Diotte, supra,
and said that it extended the law stated in Ford and Toews.  The 
appellant has submitted that Diotte wrongly  extended the test of 
care and control stated in these cases  and  that, accordingly, the
trial judge applied the wrong test. In my view, it  is not necessary 
to decide whether Diotte extended the law in Ford and Toews, 
rightly or wrongly, because the facts as found by the  trial judge
and admitted by the appellant, show &quot;some course of conduct 
associated with the vehicle which would involve a risk of  putting  
the vehicle  in motion  so  that  it could  become dangerous&quot;. 

[22] I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.</font></pre></td>
