    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants appeal from that portion of the judgment of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Clarke J. in which he decided that an impugned portion of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">codicil dated August 8, 1990 was written prior to the signing of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the codicil and was a valid part of that codicil.  The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge carefully considered the evidence that the impugned portion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeared to have been written in a different ink than other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">portions of the codicil, the squeezed style of writing, the fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the writing in the impugned portion went into the margin of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the document, the overwriting of the date at the end of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">document and the evidence of the witnesses including that of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant=s expert.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">portion had been inserted  prior to the time the testator signed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the document and gave reasons for so doing. We cannot say that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge=s conclusion was unreasonable and accordingly we</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In making his award as to costs, the trial judge took into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration certain factors that were irrelevant to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question of costs such as the fact that the respondent had given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gifts to the testator during her lifetime and her financial</font></pre>
