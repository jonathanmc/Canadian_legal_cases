MORDEN A.C.J.O.:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal, with leave, by some of the defendants  in

this  proceeding,  from an order of a motions  judge  fixing  the

plaintiff's  costs in this action on a party and party  basis  in

the amount of $50,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]   The dispute between the parties concerned the ownership  of

property. It arose, to quote from the reasons of the judge,  &quot;out

of  the  assertion of control over property of Branch 1A  of  the

Polish  National  Union of Canada Mutual  Benefit  Society  by  a

dissident  group&quot;. Since this appeal does not turn on  the  facts

relating to the dispute, I shall say no more on this subject.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]   Pleadings  in the action were exchanged. The  statement  of

defence included a counterclaim. There were several interlocutory

motions. The plaintiff then brought a motion for summary judgment

which  was successful. The judge declared that the plaintiff  was

the  owner  of the property in question, granted related  relief,

and  ordered that the defendants named in the final paragraph  of

the  formal  judgment  pay  to the plaintiff  and  defendants  by

counterclaim costs in the amount of $50,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  I shall set forth the steps which preceded the making of the

costs  order. At the conclusion of her reasons for judgment dated

March 14, 1997 the judge said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Counsel    may   make   written   submissions
          regarding costs, if desired, within 30  days,
          addressed to me at ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]   On  April  8,  1997  the defendants' counsel  made  written

submissions to the judge. He submitted that, for several reasons,

no  costs  be  awarded against the defendants and  plaintiffs  by

counterclaim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]   On  April  14,  1997, the last day for  making  submissions

according  to  the  judge's requirement, the plaintiff's  counsel

made  his written cost submissions in which he claimed: (1) costs

on  a  solicitor and client basis fixed at $96,000;  (2)  in  the

alternative, costs on a party and party basis fixed  at  $68,000;

and  (3) in the further alternative, costs in accordance  with  a

Rule  49  offer to settle dated October 4, 1996. Bills  of  costs

relating  to the first two alternatives were delivered  with  the

submission. Substantially all of the submissions were devoted  to

why costs should be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. None

were  addressed  to the appropriateness of the judge  fixing  the

costs  as  opposed  to  referring  them  for  assessment  or   to

justifying   the   amounts  claimed.  No  back-up   documentation

respecting the costs was provided.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  On April 16, 1997, two days after the deadline for the costs

submissions  to  be  filed, counsel for the defendants  delivered

reply  written submissions which argued that solicitor and client

costs were not appropriate and that the costs, if any, should not

be  fixed. Specifically, counsel submitted that &quot;it is impossible

to  properly respond, in this fashion, to the Plaintiff's  claims

for  costs,  and that the fixing of costs in this  fashion  would

effectively  be  a denial of natural justice to those  Defendants

ordered to pay the costs&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]   On  April  22, 1997 the judge released her reasons  on  the

costs  issue. She awarded costs, on a party and party  basis,  in

the amount of $50,000. She arrived at this amount by reducing the

hourly rates claimed for students and law clerks from $80 to  $50

and  making  an adjustment for &quot;the late documentary production&quot;.

In her reasons she said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Fixing of costs in these circumstances is not
          equivalent   to   an  assessment,   and   the
          criterion to be applied are not the  same  as
          those which would be applied by an Assessment
          Officer. Rather, it involved determination of
          a  fair, global amount to be paid by  way  of
          compensation   for  legal  expenses,   having
          regard to all of the circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]   In Murano v. Bank of Montreal, which is being released this

day, I said with respect to the power to fix costs:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Having  regard to the unqualified wording  of
          s.  131(1) [of the Courts of Justice Act] and
          rule   57.01(3)  [in  the  Rules   of   Civil
          Procedure]  it  would  not  be  sensible   to
          impose,   in   advance  of  considering   any
          particular case, hard and fast limits on when
          or  how  the  power to fix  costs  should  be
          exercised.    The  following  considerations,
          however, should be helpful:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1)  A  judge should not fix costs on his  or
               her own motion. If a judge is minded  to
               fix  costs,  or  if one party  asks  the
               court  to  do so, the parties should  be
               given    the   opportunity    to    make
               submissions on whether costs  should  be
               fixed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  With  due  respect to the contrary  view
               expressed by Henry J. in Apotex Inc.  v.
               Egis Pharmaceuticals (1991), 4 O.R. (3d)
               321  (Gen. Div.) at 322, I do not  think
               that   a   judge   has   an   unfettered
               discretion  to  fix  costs.  The   power
               should  only  be resorted  to  when  the
               judge,   having  received  the  parties'
               submissions, is satisfied that he or she
               is  in  a position to do procedural  and
               substantive justice in fixing the  costs
               instead   of  directing  that  they   be
               assessed by an assessment officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3)  Having  decided to fix costs, the  judge
               should,    of    course,   conduct    an
               appropriate  hearing on the question  of
               the amount to be fixed. Depending on the
               circumstances, this could properly  take
               the  form  of  the  receipt  of  written
               submissions from the parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] In my view, the order fixing costs cannot stand because,  at

the  very  least,  the  defendants  did  not  have  a  reasonable

opportunity  to address the question of the proper amount.  As  a

result  of  this  and, in any event, the judge did  not  have  an

adequate or accurate factual base for making the award.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11]  I  do  not understand the judge's statement in her  reasons

that &quot;[c]ounsel may make written submissions regarding costs&quot;  as

reflecting  her  intention to fix costs. It  is  clear  from  the

submissions  made  by  defendants'  counsel  that  he   had   not

anticipated  that  this  was  what the  judge  had  in  mind.  As

indicated in the passage from Murano, the judge should have heard

from each side on whether she should fix costs and, in any event,

before  she  proceeded  to  do so,  she  should  have  given  the

defendants'  counsel  an adequate opportunity  to  present  their

case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12]  As it was, by reason of the plaintiff's last day filing  of

its  submissions, the defendants were obliged to file their reply

submissions out of time. The defendants submit that they  do  not

know whether they were taken into account by the judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13]  The plaintiff submits that although a court should  receive

submissions from the parties before deciding whether to fix costs

or refer them for assessment (citing Arthur J. Fish Ltd. v. Moore

et  al.  (1985), 53 O.R. (2d) 65 (Div. Ct.) at 69) costs  may  be

fixed  even in the absence of such submissions (citing Chittenden

Trust  Co.  v. Western, [1993] O.J. No. 7 (Gen. Div.)  para.  2).

Chittenden  is  of  no  assistance to the plaintiff  because  the

reasons  in that case make it clear that the party which did  not

file  submissions had been afforded a generous opportunity to  do

so.  It  appeared  that the decision not to file submissions  was

deliberate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] I turn now to the factual basis on which the costs award was

made.  In  a  word,  the  factual record  before  the  judge  was

inadequate  and,  in  a sense, inaccurate.  The  bills  of  costs

submitted  by  the  plaintiff  included  the  costs  of   certain

interlocutory motions. The orders which had been made on at least

two  of these motions, which were not before the judge, contained

provisions that the plaintiff was not entitled to the costs.  For

example, on April 1, 1996, a judge had ordered that there  be  no

costs  respecting a motion by the plaintiff for an order relating

to  the  obtaining  of  certificates of  pending  litigation.  In

another order made on the same day, the same judge granted  leave

to the plaintiff to amend its statement of claim and ordered that

the  costs of the motion (wrongly referred to in the order as  an

&quot;action&quot;)  &quot;be  to  the added defendants in the  cause  fixed  at

$350.&quot; There were other steps, referred to in the bills of costs,

with  respect  to which the defendants submit that the  plaintiff

was not entitled to costs. These submissions are debatable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] It was not open to the judge to award costs of a segment  of

the  proceeding with respect to which there was an existing order

providing,  in  effect, that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to

those  costs.  This principle would not deprive a party  who  had

been  awarded costs of a motion on a party and party  basis  from

having the costs provision &quot;topped up&quot; in an order at the end  of

the  proceeding fixing costs of the proceeding on a solicitor and

client  basis. I refer to Van Bork v. Van Bork (1994), 30  C.P.C.

(3d)  116  (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 124, 131843 Canada  Inc.  v.

Double  &quot;R&quot;  (Toronto) Ltd. (1992) 11 C.P.C. (3d) 190  (Ont.  Ct.

(Gen.  Div.))  at  197, Benner &amp; Associates Limited  v.  Northern

Lights  Distributing Inc. (1996), 6 C.P.C. (4th)  201  (Ont.  Ct.

(Gen.  Div.)) at paras. 8 - 10, and Orkin, The Law of Costs,  2nd

ed. (1997) at pp. 1-13 to 1-14.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16]  One other basic matter that appears to have been overlooked

is   that  the  sum  of  $1,402  in  the  bill  of  costs   under

Disbursements - Item 33 (apparently in reference to  item  33  in

Part II of Tariff A in the Rules) is for agency fees. If this was

a  sum paid for solicitor services then the services should  have

been  described in the solicitors fees part of the bill and  been

open to examination from this point of view.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] As I indicated, there was no back-up documentation furnished

with  the plaintiff's submissions nor an affidavit verifying  the

services performed and the disbursements, as was required in  In-

Med  Laboratories Ltd. v. Director of Laboratory Services  (Ont.)

(1991),  45  O.A.C.  241 (Div'l. Ct.) at 248. This  assumes  some

importance  in this case by reason of the lack of submissions  on

quantum by counsel for the defendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18]  I have set forth a passage in the judge's reasons in  which

she said that her task was to determine &quot;a fair global amount  to

be  paid&quot;.  As  I  have said in Murano v. Bank of Montreal,  this

determination   cannot   fairly  be   made   without   a   proper

understanding, after a critical examination, of the  basic  facts

relating to the services performed and disbursements made.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19]  In  the result, I would allow the appeal, with  costs,  set

aside  the  costs order, and in its place make an order directing

that the costs be assessed on a party and party basis.
