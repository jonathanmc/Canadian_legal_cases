    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal from a judgment of Loukidelis, J, of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario Court (General Division), dated March 11, 1997. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant appeals from both the finding that he was negligent and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assessment of damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant, who is a solicitor, was retained by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents to act for them in the purchase of a house and lands</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they had agreed to purchase under the terms of an agreement of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchase and sale. In the agreement of purchase and sale the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lands were referred to as Lots 77 and 78, plan H-811, Fenwick</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Township, District of Algoma.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The problem is most easily described by simply stating that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an unopened road allowance, shown on the survey as Alberta</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Street, lies between lots 77 and lots 78. Approximately sixty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">percent of the house and all of the garage stand on this road</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowance. In addition, the survey shows that the respondents'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">predecessors had also occupied to the water's edge, part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another unopened road allowance, Water Street, where lot 78</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fronts on it. Access to all of the land and premises is only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possible from a public road on which lot 77 fronts. Alberta</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Street runs a very short distance between the road in front of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lot 77 and Water Street. However, the allowance for Water Street</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">runs for some distance as it follows the bank of a river that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">runs through part of the lands in the plan. Much of this is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">readily apparent from the survey attached to the deed (see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Appendix &quot;A&quot;) and a portion of Plan H-811 (see Appendix &quot;B&quot;).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  When the transaction was completed, the deed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents contained a four part metes and bounds description</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purporting to convey not only lots 77 and 78 but also parts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alberta Street and Water Street. The appellant was found to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligent because he certified to his clients that they had a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">good and marketable title to all of the lands.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  It is conceded that the respondents got a good title to lots</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">77 and 78. The appellant contends that his clients got a good</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">title to all of the lands described in the deed, relying on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">search of the abstract of title for each of the four parts in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deed. He said the abstract for each of the two road allowances</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">showed a good and sufficient chain of title during a period</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">greater than forty years immediately preceding his search. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">short, the appellant argues that although neither abstract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recorded a conveyance of the interest of the Crown in the right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Canada or Ontario in the unopened road allowances, grants to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his clients' predecessors in title purported to convey the same</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lands and that was enough to convey clear and marketable title to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The lands are in unorganized territory, an area without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">municipal organization. Pursuant to the Robinson-Huron Treaty of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1850, they were set aside as a reserve for the Batchewana First</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nation. They were subsequently surrendered in 1859 by a treaty</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the aboriginal owners to the Crown in right of Canada,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the condition that any sale proceeds be held for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aboriginal owner. An undated plan of the area, consisting of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whole township and showing no roads, was then registered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Subsequently, in 1861, the Crown registered a plan for that part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the township in which these lands lie. It was the plan of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">town plot of Apoquosh. This plan laid out Alberta Street and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Water Street and the lots adjacent to them. In 1908, the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied to the court and obtained an order amending the plan;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, the road allowances remained unaltered. Plan H-811 is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not a plan of subdivision. It is a Registrar's Composite Plan of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the town plot of Apoquosh and was approved for registration on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 11, 1981. It includes the lots in question here and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowances for Water Street and Alberta Street. It is conceded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there were valid patents from the Crown for the lands</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subdivided into lots. The abstracts of title do not show that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">either of the two streets was ever the subject of a patent, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that any steps have been taken to close either of them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We agree with the trial judge that there was sufficient on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the title to bring the matter within the exception provided by s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">112(1) of the Registry Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.20. Clearly, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presence of the unclosed road allowances constitutes a claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">referred to in s. 113(5)(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Registry Act. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances, the appeal from the finding that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was negligent fails and must be must dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The damages were assessed at $78,636. The trial judge heard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence that the respondents paid $105,000.00 for the property</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that it was valued at $125,000 if the owner had a good and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marketable title. However, the assessor testified that he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unaware of a situation with the same or similar title issues that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could be used as a comparison. For his part, however, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant pointed to the evidence of the recent purchase of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">house next door, on lot 76, in which case a small part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">house and garage was perhaps built on deeded portion of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alberta Street allowance. Even though the purchasers were warned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this and the fact they would get no title to the Alberta</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Street land, they chose to close anyway and to pay full price.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">According to the appellant, that land was marketable. But as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appendices show, the facts there were different. Lot 76 itself is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">much larger than 77 or 78, neither of which alone has a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficient area upon which to locate the house and, of course,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two lots are separated by Alberta Street.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Acting on a suggested basis for assessing the damages given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in evidence by an evaluator and accepting his evidence that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cost of purchasing a similar water front lot and moving the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' house and buildings there would be $78,636, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge assessed the damages in that sum. He regarded this as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an alternative method of measuring the damages, made necessary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of the inability to assess damages on the difference in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">money between the amount paid to the vendor, and the value had he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received good title.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] However, in our opinion, an assessment on the basis adapted,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and in that amount, is not responsive to the evidence and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligence. It was overcompensation. If the respondents were to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceed as contemplated they would end up with their house on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new lot to which they had good title as well as the original lots</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">encumbered as a result of the unopened road allowances. On the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other hand, if the respondents did not proceed to buy and move</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the house, they could retain or sell the present property and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moneys. There is no suggestion the sum relates to the cost of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtaining title to the road allowances or the diminution in value</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if title cannot be obtained.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The respondents led no evidence that they had ever intended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to move or that they had ever attempted to sell the property. Nor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did they lead evidence of a present intention of doing so. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no evidence that could support even a suggestion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown in the right of Canada or Ontario had any interest in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opening either of the road allowances or that it would serve any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">public interest or reason to do so. Currently, Ontario appears to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recognize the respondents as &quot;owners&quot; of the lands, at least for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the purpose of taxation. A certificate of the Treasurer of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant Board of Education, which was filed in evidence, states</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the total taxes levied on the lands being lots 77 and 78 and part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Alberta Street and indicates the respondents as owners. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is no evidence that the lands are situated near or contiguous to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a reserve. Moreover, the surveys show the area beyond the road</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowances to be completely subdivided into residential lots on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">patented lands, with all the lots fronting on a separate right of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way. Thus, it is quite unlikely that the respondents' occupancy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will ever be disturbed. At best, any claim in damages appears to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be minimal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] While the issue was not raised by the parties, we were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned that the respondents had made no efforts to procure a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">closing of the road allowances by the township or Crown in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">right of Ontario and or Canada, and to obtain such releases as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">might be necessary. Normally, when lands are subdivided for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">residential lots, it would be quite inconsistent with the sale of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lots in the development that road allowances could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupied for any other purpose, except perhaps those of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjacent land owners. The sale of the development surely proceeds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this basis. There is no registered plan subdivision here as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that term is understood in modern terms. But what seems clear is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that consistent with its ownership, the Crown, in 1861, for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose of development through sale, put on a plan showing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">land divided into lots serviced by roads. It then proceeded to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sell the lands on that basis, granting patents for the lands on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which building was to take place. In the circumstances, it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubtful that there is room for a claim of a property interest in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the unopened road allowances in the original aboriginal owners,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although a claim for all or part of the compensation received</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from an adjacent landowner might survive depending on the Crown's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The evidence of a witness touched on the question of whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the closing and conveyance of the road allowances was possible at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this time, given the possibility of a claim made against them by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the original aboriginal owners. This witness, a solicitor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">produced letters that he suggested could be taken as indicating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that neither the federal government, the province, nor the Local</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Roads Board were either able or prepared to move to clear the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff's title. However, that evidence was, in the main,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hearsay and, in our respectful opinion, should have little if any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">weight. In our view, a bona fide attempt to resolve the title</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deficiencies was a condition precedent to such an award of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages as was made in this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The respondents had the burden of proving their damages. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages suffered by the respondents was the cost of getting clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">title to the lands purportedly conveyed to them, and failing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, the diminished value of the lands and premises because of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the title. There was very little evidence touching on these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues and, in our respectful opinion, that evidence established</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only minimal damages. On the evidence, we think the damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be assessed in the sum of $3,000.00.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Accordingly, the appeal from the assessment of damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succeeds and the award is reduced to $3,000.00. There will be no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order as to costs in this court. The order as to cost at trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stand.</font></pre></td>
