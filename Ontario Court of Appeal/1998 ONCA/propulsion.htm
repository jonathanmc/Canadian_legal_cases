    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge's reliance on the doctrine of
unconscionability to defeat the appellant's claim was misplaced.
Unconscionability was not pleaded and had no application to the
facts of this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appeal is, however, from the judgment and not from the
reasons. Further, despite the errors in the trial judgment, the
factual findings should be accepted unless they are unreasonable.
The trial judge found that the guarantee was given for the
purpose of equalizing the risk among the participants in the
project and, further, that the respondent's guarantee was to
remain effective only as long as the appellant had advanced more
money towards the project than the respondent. It was common
ground that the advances were equalized in September, 1989. On
the trial judge's findings of fact, once those advances and
hence, the risks were equalized, the guarantee's purpose was
fulfilled and it ceased to be enforceable against the respondent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We cannot say that any of the trial judge's factual findings
were unreasonable. Taken together they make out the defence
advanced in paragraph 6 of the statement of defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Despite the errors in the trial judgment, the action was
properly dismissed. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
