    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                
[1]  A contractor sued a homeowner for the balance owing on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">project to refinish a basement. The statement of claim alleged a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of contract and did not allege a claim based on quantum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meruit. During the closing argument counsel for the plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moved to amend the statement of claim to claim quantum meruit and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made submissions based on quantum meruit. The amendment was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">strenuously opposed as being inappropriate at that stage of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings but no request was made to adjourn the proceedings to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">call further evidence. The trial judge reserved his decision on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue of whether the amendment should be granted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In his reasons the trial judge stated in relation to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quantum meruit claim:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The defendant suggests that the
          plaintiff is disentitled from relying on this
          principle of liability because it has not
          been specifically pleaded. There is no
          suggestion that he has been prejudiced by
          this failure. Throughout this litigation,
          including the three days of trial, the
          defendant has been contrasting the
          reasonableness and proof of the amount
          claimed by the plaintiff. In those
          circumstances, I see no need for an amendment
          of the pleadings to include a claim based on
          quantum meruit: see Burns v. Pocklington
          (1995), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 18 ( O.C.A.).
          Alternatively the circumstances of this case
          cry out for such relief.
          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Before us, the defendant submitted that he was prejudiced,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he did not have an opportunity to adduce evidence as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value of the work done and that the trial judge did not assess</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claim for quantum meruit on the appropriate basis.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The time to raise the issue of prejudice was when the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request to amend was made.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The defendant prepared and filed a written copy of his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument with the trial judge that had been prepared the day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before. The argument included a section entitled quantum meruit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and made submissions with respect to this claim. The defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was therefore aware that the plaintiff was advancing a claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">based on quantum meruit at trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In the circumstances we are not persuaded that there was any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unfairness to the defendant. We are also of the opinion that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">method used by the trial judge to assess the claim for quantum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meruit was one that was open to him. The appeal is dismissed with</font></pre>
