    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Susan Ramcharitar, was 31 years old when Adrian was born. About</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">four month's before the child's birth, Susan moved to Guelph to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">live with her 50 year-old sister, Molly Ramcharitar and her</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The parties agreed that the child would be raised by Molly</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  After the child was born, they all lived together until</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 1992 at which time they went to Trinidad when Susan and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Molly's mother died. After the funeral, Susan remained in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trinidad for six weeks to deal with outstanding estate matters;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Molly and her husband returned to Canada with Adrian.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  When Susan returned to Canada in February 1993, she asked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her sister to return the child to her. Molly and her husband</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  After attempted negotiations failed, Susan applied for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">custody of Adrian in June, 1993. Her sister and brother-in-law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cross-applied in July. In September 1993, an interim order was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made giving custody to Molly and her husband, with access to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Susan for three hours every other weekend.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Almost a year later, in July 1994, Molly and her husband</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied to adopt Adrian and to dispense with Susan's consent to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the adoption. The custody and adoption proceedings were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consolidated in November 1994.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The trial did not take place until March 1995. The words of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge, Associate Chief Judge Robert Walmsley are worth</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The consolidated applications before me
          provide a cruel illustration of the
          devastating effects of delay on the rights of
          parties and parents in matters involving
          young children.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In this case, the passage of twenty-one
          months since the start of the custody
          application has crystallized temporary
          arrangements into permanent rights, and has
          effectively barred the court from making a
          true decision on the competing interests.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... absent ill-treatment or abuse by the
          principal care-givers, Molly Ramcharitar and
          Pillalamari Jagam, the inevitable result
          would have been the firm psychological
          attachment of Adrian to Molly and
          Pillalamari, and that is in fact what
          happened.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Adrian regards them as his parents, their
          home as his home, and while he relates well
          to Susan Ramcharitar, he does not think of
          her as his mother and indeed is not aware of
          his relationship to her. The attachment is
          confirmed by witnesses and by both of the
          professional assessors.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Based on the evidence before him, including a court-ordered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assessment by Samuel R. Luker, and a report by Dr. Nitza Perlman</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who was retained by the adoptive parents, Judge Walmsley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that it was in the best interests of the child to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remain with his aunt and uncle. But he was also firmly of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view that notwithstanding the pending adoption of Adrian by Molly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and her husband, there should be access by Susan Ramcharitar. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recited four reasons for giving her access:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  The mother has a healthy and
               comfortable relationship with the
               child and this relationship poses
               no threat to Adrian's development
               and well-being;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  Mr. Luker was in favour of
               continuing and broadening access to
               the mother as set out in his
               recommendation #4. He found that
               the custody parents were not
               opposed to access provided it was
               supervised, as they had a concern
               that the mother might abscond with
               the child;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  Dr. Perlman found that the custody
               parents were strongly in favour of
               Adrian knowing his birth mother but
               worried that if she had free access
               it might interfere with Adrian's
               sense of a secure environment;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  Finally, it must be borne in mind
               that this is a &quot;relative&quot; adoption.
               The adoption order may make Molly
               Ramcharitar and Pillalamari Jagam
               the legal parents of Adrian. But it
               will also make Susan Ramcharitar
               his aunt and they will all still be
               part of the same extended family.
               Further, the evidence showed that
               were it not for the extended family
               concept and a cultural tradition of
               informal adoption within the
               family, Susan Ramcharitar would not
               have felt able to turn to Molly and
               her husband for the support and
               commitment involved in raising a
               child. Clearly, access in the
               context of a &quot;relative&quot; adoption is
               a very different matter from access
               in the context of a stranger
               adoption. My conclusion is that
               Adrian should continue to enjoy an
               access relationship with his soon-
               to-be aunt. [Emphasis in the
               original]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In making an order for access, Associate Chief Judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Walmsley was making an order he knew would survive the adoption</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order. It was an order he considered not only jurisprudentially</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">available, but in fact desirable in the context of these three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adults being related to one another. In his words: &quot;I conclude</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that access orders made before a relative adoption survive the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adoption order, and that there exists in Ontario no jurisprudence</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Judge Walmsley's decision was appealed both by Susan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ramcharitar and by the adoptive parents. Efforts at access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrangements were unsuccessful and a long period of time elapsed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between visits for Susan Ramcharitar. Eventually, however, in an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effort to settle the appeal, Susan agreed to abandon her appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the following bases: (1) Susan Ramcharitar would have access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Adrian; (2) Molly Ramcharitar and Pillalamari Jagam would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopt him. In addition, the parties agreed to mediation in order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to assist access arrangements. Minutes of Settlement giving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect to these terms were signed on December 3, 1996.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The adoption order was made on January 21, 1997.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Although the access arrangements initially appeared to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adequate, problems emerged by the spring of 1997. Efforts at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mediation were unsuccessful and an application was brought by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Susan seeking unsupervised access, police intervention to enforce</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">access, and mediation. Molly and her husband sought to have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">access terminated. The matter was heard by O'Connor J.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The expert evidence before Justice O'Connor persuaded him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that access to Adrian by Susan Ramcharitar was in the child's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">best interests. The expert evidence available to this panel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirms this conclusion. There is no doubt that the child has a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">good relationship with Susan Ramcharitar and that it would be in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his interest to continue a relationship with her. He ordered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overnight access every three weekends, plus an additional day</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">every second weekend, in accordance with the terms of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outstanding interim access order. He also ordered mediation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police intervention to assist in the enforcement of access.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] As recently as October 27, 1998, a report from Dr. James</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Deutsch, who reviewed all the documents but did not have access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to any of the parties directly, stated:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The descriptions in Dr. Paulker's report
          suggest that birth mother demonstrated a
          sensitivity and talent for mothering and a
          good-enough relationship based on respect for
          the autonomy and separateness of Adrian. In
          contrast, there are psychological limitations
          described in the adoptive parents, along with
          observations consistent with Adrian
          representing to some extent adoptive parents'
          own aspirations or anxieties regarding
          themselves. There is a clear indication that
          the birth mother is a significant
          relationship figure in the life of Adrian,
          whether or not he fully understands that she
          is his birth mother. The descriptions of
          their interactions would indicate that the
          relationship demonstrated an ease that was
          absent from the custodial relationship and
          was likely quite positive and helpful to this
          boy. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] With respect to access, Dr. Deutsch concluded:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It remains important for Adrian to have
          continuing, predictable access to his birth
          mother. It would be detrimental if this
          access were to be cut off. This would be true
          in both the short term and the long term.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] His report also stresses what he views as the obligation on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the part of the adoptive mother to:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... address her ambivalence and to provide,
          to the best of her ability, support for this
          clearly valued child to understand and cope
          with his complex and distressing situation.
          His relationship with his biological mother
          will not go away; it cannot be wished away.
          Should its significance be denied or should
          he be deprived of it, there is significant
          risk of later issues of trust due to a sense
          of betrayal and withholding of respect for
          his autonomy.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] We agree, therefore, with Justice O'Connor's decision that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positive relationship exists between Adrian and his biological</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother and that he should continue to enjoy access to her.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Justice O'Connor found Molly Ramcharitar and Pillalamari</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jagam largely responsible for the frustration of access rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In his words:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [The] dispute has been significantly
          contributed to by the respondents. It does
          not lie with them to seek a remedy for an
          alleged harm caused or contributing to by
          them.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] There was ample evidence to support this conclusion. As Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Jerome Paulker indicated in his assessment, which was undertaken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pending the appeal from the decision of Associate Chief Judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Walmsley, the adoptive parents were anxious to terminate access</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and were determined to prevent Adrian from having any contact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with his biological mother. They offered no evidentiary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">foundation for their desire to prevent access, either of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">physical, psychological, or practical nature.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] There is no doubt that Susan Ramcharitar agreed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Minutes of Settlement permitting the adoption of Adrian only on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the condition that she be given access. Notwithstanding this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settlement, difficulties with access quickly emerged and it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clear that the adopting parents had every intention of attempting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to deprive Susan Ramcharitar of access. This intention cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given legal effect. There is overwhelming evidence that access to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Susan is in the child's best interests. What is clearly not in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Adrian's best interests is to have his adoptive parents continue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their preoccupation with thwarting this access.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] We do not, however, see any basis for an order of mediation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mediation cannot be effective unless both sides are genuinely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">open to the process. In the past five years, Molly Ramcharitar</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Pillalamari Jagam have given every indication that they are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not prepared to cooperate with mediators. Accordingly, we think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an imposed process of mediation would impose an undue burden on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Susan Ramcharitar with no likelihood of constructive results.
