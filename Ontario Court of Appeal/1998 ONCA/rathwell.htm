[1]  The appellant was charged with first degree murder and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convicted of second degree murder by the verdict of a jury at a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial presided over by the Honourable Mr. Justice Meehan. He was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentenced to imprisonment for life with a parole ineligibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period of 10 years. He appeals his conviction. His appeal, for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the most part, centres on errors that the appellant contends were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EVIDENCE

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  The Shooting

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On March 27, 1992, the appellant lived on the 7th floor of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an apartment building in the City of London. At about 9:30 a.m.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on March 27th he visited his friend Bill Semple who lived on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">11th floor of the same building. He spent the day in Semple’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apartment playing cards and drinking with Semple and others who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dropped in for a visit. The appellant’s card-playing and drinking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were interrupted on two occasions when he left to obtain more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beer. In the morning, the appellant went to the beer store with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Semple and in the afternoon with Fred Howard. The appellant and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Semple were good friends who often drank together. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had met Howard for the first time on March 26, 1992.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  During the afternoon of March 27, 1992, Rene Fournier, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">friend of Semple’s, came to Semple’s apartment. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knew Fournier, having met him on a few previous occasions. At</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first the appellant and Fournier played cribbage while Howard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">looked on. Semple was on a couch facing the table where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was playing cards.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In due course, Howard said that he wanted to play two-handed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cribbage with Fournier, however, the appellant said that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wanted to play three-handed cribbage. When Howard would not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permit the appellant to play, the appellant slammed his fist on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the table and called Howard a “four-eyed crazy little sucker”,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Fournier a “fat French pig.”  Fournier took offence and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">slapped the appellant with his open hand. It was not a hard slap.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The appellant taunted Fournier by saying, “Is that the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">you’ve got?”  Fournier then slapped the appellant again with an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">open hand. Like the first slap, this slap was not hard. The slaps</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not appear to have any particular physical effect on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Shortly after the second slap the appellant threatened to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">kill Fournier. He went down four floors to his own apartment on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the 7th floor and removed his 22-calibre semi-automatic rifle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from under the sofa in his living room. He retrieved a box of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ammunition which was located in a tin on a window ledge. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">withdrew the magazine holder from the rifle and loaded 15 rounds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of ammunition.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Within five to ten minutes the appellant returned to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Semple’s 11th floor apartment. He entered the living room</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carrying his rifle at waist level on his right side. When he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrived Howard and Fournier were playing cards. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fired eight rounds in succession at Fournier. Two bullets struck</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fournier in his forehead, one in his neck and four in his lower</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mid-chest and abdomen. The eighth shot fired missed Fournier and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hit a wall. Fournier died almost instantly.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The appellant sat down at a table while Howard was in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process of telephoning the police. After speaking with the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Howard left Semple’s apartment to wait for the police by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elevator. The police and ambulance attendants arrived within</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">three or four minutes of Howard’s phone call.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant left the apartment before the police arrived.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He went to Lino Toffolon’s apartment on the 10th floor where he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">used Toffolon’s telephone to call directory assistance. Linda</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ogletree, the operator to whom the appellant spoke, testified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellant said, “I need my lawyer. Get me my lawyer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I’ve just shot someone. I need my lawyer.”  The appellant waited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the line while Ms. Ogletree attempted to contact the lawyer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellant had identified. When she could not make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contact after four or five rings, Ms. Ogletree offered to call</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the police. The appellant said that the police were already on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their way and hung up the phone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Bill Bier, an 8th floor tenant in the appellant’s apartment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">building, testified that after the shooting the appellant went to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his apartment to use the telephone. He said that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opened the apartment door, put his index finger to his lips and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said, “Shh, I just shot a man. I want to use your phone.”  Bier</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had no trouble understanding the appellant. He said that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant appeared to be in a quandary but otherwise appeared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calm and concerned. Bier said that the appellant made a number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone calls in which Bier overheard him say, “Can you help</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">me?” and “I shot a man.”  The appellant took a can of beer with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him when he left Bier’s apartment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] At about 5:45 p.m., the appellant telephoned a community</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dental student who had done some dental work for him. The dental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">student’s roommate, James Takacs, answered the phone. Takacs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that during the phone call the appellant said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          … “Hey, man, you’re not going to believe
          this, but I just blew this guy’s head right
          off … I’m not shitting you” … He said he
          grabbed his shotgun and pumped eight rounds…
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          He said “he was a six foot four 300 pound
          motherfucker and there was no way to get to
          him” … He was just too big and he had no
          choice, so [he]went and got his shotgun and
          shot him…
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          He described how “there was blood, coming out
          of his nose and there was blood all over the
          place… It’s kinda funny, you know, how much
          blood there is in someone.”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant then asked Takacs to call his lawyer. When</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Takacs said that he did not know who the appellant’s lawyer was,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant became angry and threatened him. Takacs said the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s mood seemed to change from being in control to being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agitated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] At 6:06 p.m., the appellant telephoned the London Police and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said that he, “fucking blew the guy’s head off.”  During the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone conversation he identified himself to Constable Morton</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and told Constable Morton what his home address was. Constable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Morton told the appellant to meet the police in front of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apartment building. Constable Morton in turn advised the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the scene to expect the appellant’s arrival and he further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">told them that the appellant was drunk.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The police were dispatched to Semple’s apartment at 5:32</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p.m. and arrived at 5:35 p.m. with ambulance personnel. When they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrived they found the deceased sitting on a chair with blood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flowing from his ears, nose and abdomen. He had no vital signs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The deceased was removed from the apartment by the ambulance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attendants shortly after their arrival.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] After making his phone calls the appellant returned to his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">own apartment and picked up his jacket. He locked his door</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because he knew the police would be there shortly. He then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">returned to Semple’s apartment carrying an open beer. After the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant knocked on the door, a police officer opened the door</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to see the appellant wearing his jacket and holding a beer. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police immediately arrested the appellant. When the police asked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him where the gun was, he directed them toward the sofa. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police quickly located the rifle under the sofa.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] When two police officers escorted the appellant out of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apartment, as they approached the elevator, the appellant stated,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“I really fucked up this time; I really fucked up.”  As they went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">through the lobby of the apartment building the appellant shouted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to another tenant who he knew, “I shot him Ken, I shot him.” The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenant to whom the appellant spoke said that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeared drunk but not as drunk as he had seen him on other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occasions. When he walked through the members of the media who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had gathered outside the apartment building, the appellant told</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them to get out of the way, “… or I’ll blow your heads off.”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The appellant testified he had no memory of the events of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">March 27, 1992 after about noon until he found himself in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police cruiser. He recalled seeing blood coming out of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deceased’s mouth and of hearing the deceased making a gurgling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sound after he was shot. He also recalled seeing Howard on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone. He said he had no memory of the various telephone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">calls he made after the shooting.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) The Appellant’s Circumstances

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The appellant was 40 years old at the time of the shooting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In 1987 he had sustained a head injury resulting in left temporal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and left frontal lobe damage. His neurological injuries resulted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the onset of epilepsy and the development of a personality</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disorder which left him impatient, impulsive and quick to anger.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He received a disability pension because of his injuries. He had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescriptions for medication to control his epileptic seizures</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and depression. In addition, he was an episodic alcoholic.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iii)     Alcohol Consumption

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] A number of witnesses who observed the appellant before and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after the shooting testified that they knew that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had been drinking because they could smell alcohol on his breath</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and because of the appellant’s sometimes slurred speech. However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some of these witnesses testified that the appellant was calm,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lucid and exhibited no difficulty moving around, walking at a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">normal pace or getting into the back of the police cruiser.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] At the request of the defence, Constable Walsh performed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breathalyzer tests on the appellant at 8:14 p.m. and 8:36 p.m. –</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about three hours after the shooting. The breathalyzer readings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were .241 and .250 mg. of alcohol per 100 ml. of blood. Soon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after the appellant was in custody, he was taken to hospital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where a number of tests, including blood tests, were done. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">blood tests showed blood-alcohol levels of between .200 and .220</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mg. of alcohol per 100 ml. of blood. These tests were done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sometime after 1:49 a.m. and before 3:40 a.m., on March 28, 1992.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Based upon the breathalyzer and blood test results Dr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hirst, a toxicologist and pharmacologist called by the defence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estimated that the appellant would have had a blood-alcohol</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reading in the range of .267 to .311 mg. of alcohol per 100 ml.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of blood at the time of the shooting. He based his assessment on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a number of assumptions including the assumption the applicable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elimination rate was that of an average person. Dr. Hirst</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that anyone with a blood-alcohol concentration of .267</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to .311 would demonstrate difficulties with gross motor skills</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such as balance and locomotion; he would lethargic, slow and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sedated, exhibiting problems with speech, memory, judgment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concentration. He acknowledged that fine motor skills would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compromised before gross motor skills.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The appellant’s brother, Ernest Rathwell, testified that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would not be unusual for the appellant to consume a case of beer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in one day. He also said that after the appellant's head injury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in 1987, his drinking became more problematic. Daniel Rathwell,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another brother, testified that the appellant drank beer, “like</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was water.”  The appellant acknowledged having a serious</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drinking problem and that he was aware of the adverse effects of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mixing alcohol with the various medications that he had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (iv) Brain Damage

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Dr. Young, a neurologist, testified that the appellant had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suffered injury to his brain’s frontal and temporal lobes. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brain damage caused the appellant’s epileptic seizures and may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have affected his ability to form long term goals, his memory and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his impulse control. His diminished impulse control left the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant restless and easily angered. When alcohol was involved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the appellant became angered, he could become physically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Dr. Young and Dr. Boyd, a psychiatrist, both testified to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">having witnessed the appellant lose control as a result of a</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The appellant advances seven grounds of appeal. Six of them</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">centre on alleged misdirections in the charge on the intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required for murder having regard to the appellant’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intoxication, his brain damage, and the combined effect of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alcohol, drugs, brain damage and the deceased’s allegedly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provocative acts. The appellant also takes issue with the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge’s charge on provocation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The appellant’s seventh ground of appeal relates to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury’s request to be provided with a dictionary. This request was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not framed as a question to the trial judge about access to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dictionary. Rather, the request was made by a juror to a court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constable who was responsible for the jury during its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deliberations. As it turned out, the court official involved told</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury that a dictionary would not be forthcoming.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Since the appellant’s central submissions relate to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge on the intent required for murder, I will address that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general issue first. In doing so I will deal with aspects of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intent issue, including intoxication (by alcohol and drugs), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect of the appellant’s 1987 brain injury and the combined</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  The Intent Required for Murder

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] The appellant submits that the charge on the issue of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intent required for murder was confusing and that it would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">left the jury in doubt about the onus of proof with respect to it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and cause the jury to infer that the appellant had the intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required for murder from the fact that he shot the deceased.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] In my opinion, the charge was fair and balanced. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s experienced trial counsel (not Mr. Hughes) had no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objection on any aspect of the charge with respect to the issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the intent required for murder. Indeed, the appellant’s trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel had only one objection to the charge and that objection</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned the charge on first degree murder.1

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Near the beginning of his charge, after the trial judge had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructed the jury that they were responsible for making</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings of fact and after he had generally reviewed what direct,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstantial and expert evidence were, the trial judge dealt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the issue of identity, that is who killed  Rene Fournier.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That made sense in the circumstances, since the defence had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised the identity issue, based to a large measure on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s evidence that he had no memory of shooting the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant. In any case, evidence the appellant caused Fournier’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">death is overwhelming and the appellant conceded for the purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this appeal that the fact that the appellant shot and killed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fournier is not disputed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] The trial judge then, in a very general way, alerted the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury to the position(s) of the defence. He said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          During the course of this trial you have
          heard two theories of defence. One of those
          theories of defence is drunkenness and
          intoxication and the other is provocation.
          You may return a verdict of not guilty if
          some of you have a reasonable doubt on the
          defence theory of intoxication and some of
          you have a reasonable doubt on the defence
          theory of provocation, providing that all of
          you unanimously have a reasonable doubt as to
          the guilt of the accused in regard to the
          specific charge of murder.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In other words you do not have to be
          unanimous on any single defence theory but
          you have to be unanimous that there is a
          reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
          accused in relation to the commission of
          murder.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The trial judge then instructed the jury on the meaning of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">homicide, culpable homicide, second degree murder and first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">degree murder. I see nothing confusing about this part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge. Nor, in my view, did the trial judge err in this part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charge. When he advised the jury of what constituted second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">degree murder, the trial judge told the jury what the intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required for murder was. The jury would have clearly understood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the outset that the Crown was required to prove the guilt of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] It was against the background of this overview that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge returned to the issue of the intent required for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">murder and how the Crown might prove that intent. In this part of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charge the trial judge referred to the “sane sober person”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common sense inference of intent:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          Thus, in deciding whether Thomas Rathwell
          intended or meant to cause the death of Mr.
          Fournier, you are entitled, as a matter of
          common sense, to draw an inference that a
          sane and sober person – about which I will
          have more to say later – intends the natural
          and probable consequence of his or her
          voluntary act.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If you decide that Mr. Fournier’s death would
          be a natural consequence of the actions of
          Mr. Rathwell, you are entitled to conclude
          that he intended to kill him by those
          actions. However, you are not required to
          make this conclusion. You may decide that he
          did not intend to kill him, even though that
          death was a natural consequence of his
          action.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the end, you will have to consider all of
          the surrounding circumstances including what
          the accused said and did, in order to decide
          whether the Crown has proved Mr. Rathwell did
          indeed mean to cause the death of Mr.
          Fournier.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Before you can find that the accused had the
          necessary criminal intent, you must be
          satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this
          intent was the only reasonable inference to
          be drawn from the proven facts. Remember that
          the question for you to decide is what
          Rathwell in fact intended. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Throughout the charge, the trial judge emphasized that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury must consider “all the surrounding circumstances” in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt that the appellant had the intent required for murder.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The trial judge made it clear that before the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered first degree murder, they had to be satisfied that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown had established all of the elements of second degree murder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beyond a reasonable doubt. In the circumstances, the cardinal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">element of murder that was in issue was the intent required for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">murder.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] After he dealt with provocation (an issue to which I will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">return), the trial judge charged the jury on what he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterized as the “defence of intoxication.”  He did so by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following a two-step process. First he told the jury that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had the capacity to form the intent required for murder having</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regard to his ingestion of alcohol and second he said that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury had to decide whether the appellant in fact formed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intent required for murder.2  Notwithstanding his references to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant’s capacity to form the intent required for murder,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge made it clear that the critical question for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury was whether the appellant had the intent required for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">murder. He repeatedly emphasized that the jury must consider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence of intoxication and all other evidence relevant to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue of intent. The “other evidence” included evidence of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s brain injury, his ingestion of drugs and the acts the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant relied upon in support of his provocation defence. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealing with the rolled-up effect of the evidence in relation to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue of intent, the trial judge said in his charge:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          On the evidence you could find that because
          of a combination of the physical injury,
          alcohol and drugs, that the accused is more
          easily provoked and that he does not have the
          same control mechanism to restrain his
          emotions after drinking.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          …
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Now, if you believe or are left with a
          reasonable doubt that as a result of the
          alcohol, the phenobarbital, and his mental
          condition, he did not actually have the
          intent to kill due to this combination of
          factors, you must find him not guilty of the
          offence of murder. You would then, in the
          circumstances, if you are satisfied that he
          is the person who did the shooting, you would
          find him guilty of the lesser, included
          offence of manslaughter.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">boilerplate were eliminated, or at least adjusted to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular circumstances. In a case like this, if there is to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a reference to the sane, sober person, the jury should be told</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the inference that a person intends the natural and probable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consequences of his acts applies only when the person being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered is sane and sober, and, in the circumstances of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, in possession of otherwise intact mental faculties. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition, the jury should be told (as the jury was here) that all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the evidence bearing upon the issue of intent should be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered when the jury deals with the intent required for</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] The charge would have been better had the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approached the common sense inference that a sane and sober</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person intends the natural and probable consequences of his act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from a somewhat different perspective since, in this case, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was manifestly not sober, and his mental capacity was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in issue. 3  Thus, the sane sober person analogy did not apply to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant. However, I think that the jury would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understood that what had to be determined was the intent of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant in light of his consumption of alcohol and prescription</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drugs and his brain injury.  Put another way, I think that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge made it clear to the jury that the appellant was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a sane and sober person at the time of the shooting. In addition, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructed the jury that the combination of the appellant’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mental disorder, and evidence of intoxication, drug consumption</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and provocation, though falling short of insanity or provocation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in law may nevertheless negate the specific intent to commit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">murder and thus render manslaughter the appropriate verdict.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In addition, it would have been better had the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">avoided language isolating intoxication as a “defence.”  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence was that the appellant did not have the intent required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for murder. Some of the evidence that was relevant to that issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was evidence suggesting that the appellant was intoxicated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, by any normal measurement, his ingestion of alcohol was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enormous given his blood-alcohol concentration readings. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue in this case was not so much whether the appellant was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intoxicated, but rather whether his consumption of beer, when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taken with the other factors relevant to the issue of intent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave rise to a reasonable doubt on the issue whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant intended to kill Fournier (s. 229(a)(i)), or whether he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended to cause injury to Fournier, by shooting him, and knew</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that was likely to cause death (s. 229(a)(ii)). As I have said,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charge on the issue of intent left no doubt that the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intent required for murder. There was evidence from which the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury could infer that the appellant did have the required intent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notwithstanding his consumption of alcohol and drugs and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brain damage. I see no reversible error in the charge on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue of intent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] The appellant also submits that the trial judge’s charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggested that there was a different intent required for second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">degree murder than for first degree murder. I see no merit in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this submission. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the elements of murder as set out in s. 229(a) of the Criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Code and provided a copy of the relevant section (and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant sections) for the jury to consider during the charge and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cause Fournier’s death or that he meant to cause Fournier bodily</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to classify it as first degree murder. In my view, the charge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clear in explaining that the only difference between first and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">second degree murder was the additional requirement for first</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) Provocation

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] The trial judge dealt with provocation relatively early in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his charge. In addition to providing the jury with a copy of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">232 of the Criminal Code, the trial judge said by way of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overview:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          In this trial there is evidence before you
          indicating that on the date in question the
          accused was provoked into committing the
          offence of murder. I will discuss with you
          how the defence of provocation may reduce the
          offence of murder to the offence of
          manslaughter.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The law provides that a killing which would
          otherwise be murder becomes manslaughter
          where the defence of provocation applies,
          even though the person who caused the death
          intended to do so. …
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I wish to emphasize that the defence of
          provocation applies only to murder. It only
          reduces the offence of murder to the lesser
          offence of manslaughter.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] In my view, the trial judge’s charge on provocation, as set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out above, is clear and correct. When the trial judge directed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury on the objective part of the provocation defence, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          The second ingredient is that the wrongful
          act or insult must be of such a nature as to
          be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person
          of the power of self-control. The reason for
          requiring the wrongful act or insult to be
          sufficient to deprive the ordinary person of
          the power of self-control is to avoid the
          injustice of allowing a person who is
          exceptionally excitable, quarrelsome or ill-
          tempered to rely on the defence of
          provocation. The objective, ordinary person
          avoids that possibility. However, you should
          use your common sense in attributing to the
          ordinary person any general characteristics
          such as sex, age or race which may be
          relevant to the provocation question. You
          must ask yourself whether the wrongful act or
          insult was of such a nature to be sufficient
          to deprive an ordinary person in the same
          situation or circumstances as the accused, of
          the power of self-control. If the answer is
          “no”, the provocation defence does not apply.
          If the answer is “yes”, you must consider the
          third ingredient of the provocation defence.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Later in his charge the trial judge emphasized that the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should consider all of the circumstances, including the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s personal characteristics, in determining whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had lost his power of self control in response to an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unlawful act or insult. He reviewed the evidence of the allegedly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provocative acts in this part of his charge. He reminded the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the medical evidence and the evidence of the appellant’s two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brothers that the appellant was a person who had a low patience</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          If you decide that he was actually provoked,
          you must decide one final thing – was the
          provocation sudden and did the accused act
          upon it suddenly and before there was time
          for his passion to cool.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The insult or wrongful act and the accused’s
          response to it must be sudden. Sudden
          provocation means the wrongful act or insult
          strikes upon a mind unprepared for it and
          sets the passion aflame.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Now, in regard to those third and fourth
          ingredients, about whether the accused was
          actually provoked and whether it was sudden,
          you must look into the mind of the accused
          and assess what actually happened there.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          We have here a great deal of evidence as to
          the mental condition of the accused, his
          temperament, his behaviour when he has been
          drinking. All those matters are to be taken
          into consideration by you in deciding whether
          the accused was actually provoked and acted
          upon that provocation suddenly and before
          there was time for his passion to cool.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is, as well, in this particular case,
          special direction which deals with the
          cumulative effect on an ordinary person of
          provocation/ drunkenness in this type of
          offence, where you must take into
          consideration the fact that it may well be
          that people who are under the influence of
          alcohol are more easily provoked than they
          would be when they were sober.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">you must still go on to consider whether on the basis of all of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This direction was obviously part of the “rolled-up” charge in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had proved the intent required for murder beyond a reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt. The trial judge did this satisfactorily in the rolled-up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge, however, he did not go on to make it abundantly clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the defence of provocation had to be considered if the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealt with provocation the trial judge made this proposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">abundantly clear. I am satisfied that any confusion arising from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the infusion of provocation into the rolled-up charge occasioned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] During the jury’s deliberations a juror asked one of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court constables for a dictionary. Someone notified the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge, who was not then in court, of this request. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge advised the person who advised him of the dictionary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">request that it was not proper to provide any books to the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Somehow the dictionary request matter was brought to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attention of the Crown Attorney who raised the issue in open</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court to ensure that the jury’s request was considered in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presence of the accused and to determine whether any further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action was required.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] In the course of the discussion of this issue in open court,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown counsel suggested that the jury could be told that if they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had any difficulty with any particular word they could submit a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question asking for a definition. The defence position was that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury were properly advised that they could not have a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dictionary, however, the defence complained that the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ought to have advised counsel of the jury’s request in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presence of the appellant. Defence counsel did not accept the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown’s suggestion that the matter should be pursued further with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury. He said, “to that extent, with due respect, I think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">maybe we should have been told. I am not saying anything further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or raising anything more about it.”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] It appears to me that the matter was not fully pursued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of defence counsel’s position and in part because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge somehow took it that Crown counsel was making a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personal attack on him for having somewhat informally advised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constable involved to tell the jury that they could not have a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dictionary. In any case, the appellant does not take issue with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the decision of the trial judge but now suggests that the request</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a dictionary may reflect “confusion” within the jury.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] There is nothing in the record to indicate that the jury was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confused and it would make no sense now to speculate about why</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one or more of the jurors wanted a dictionary. This jury clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understood that they could ask questions.4  It seems to me that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if the jury  continued to be troubled by the meaning of a word,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or words, the jury would have simply asked the trial judge for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assistance. That did not happen. I would, therefore, not give</font></pre>
