    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    Both the plaintiff Albert Reichmann and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand appeal the order of Chilcott J. dated July 4, 1997.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand is not now a party to the litigation,
though it stands to benefit from the litigation should the
plaintiff succeed in his action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The order under appeal made various orders for
production and discovery in this litigation.  Those parts of
the order that apply to the plaintiff are clearly
interlocutory and no right of appeal to this court lies from
those parts of the order.  Indeed, the plaintiff sought
leave to appeal the order of Chilcott J. to the Divisional
Court and leave was refused.  Although this court could
exercise its jurisdiction under s.6(2) of the Courts of
Justice Act to hear the plaintiff's appeal, we decline to do
so. We see no reason why we should entertain an appeal from
an interlocutory order on issues of production and discovery
between parties to litigation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Coopers &amp; Lybrand is in a different position.  The
order of Chilcott J. is final as it pertains to Coopers &amp;
Lybrand because the trustee and administrator is not a party
to the litigation.  Thus Coopers &amp; Lybrand has a right of
appeal to this court.  On that appeal the plaintiff is
entitled to be heard and indeed was heard because he may be
affected by the order made against Coopers &amp; Lybrand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    Coopers &amp; Lybrand's appeal raises two issues:  the
order for production and the order for discovery of two of
its officers.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       1.  The Order for Production</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Chilcott J. ordered Coopers &amp; Lybrand to produce all
documents in its possession pertaining to the Jerusalem City
Hall project including all correspondence exchanged with the
plaintiff.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand has already produced a box of
documents relevant to the threshold issue of the plaintiff's
entitlement to an interest in the project.  The production
order under appeal is far more sweeping.  We are not
satisfied that the responding parties have established an
adequate basis for such an order.  They did not request
these documents from Coopers &amp; Lybrand nor did they
establish that Coopers &amp; Lybrand has any other documents in
its possession that are relevant to the issues
in the litigation.  An order for the large scale production
of documents should not be routinely made against a non
party.  The kind of sweeping order made by the motion judge
does not reflect the policy underlying r.30.10(1).  We
therefore do not think that the order for production against
Coopers &amp; Lybrand in paragraph 3 of Chilcott J.'s order
should stand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       2.  The Order for Discovery</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    The order for discovery causes us even greater
concern. Even accepting that Coopers &amp; Lybrand is not a true
stranger to the litigation because it stands to benefit from
the claim, we do not think that the motion judge properly
exercised his discretion under r.31.10(2).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    The plaintiff has not yet been examined for
discovery.
The information sought has not been requested directly from
Coopers &amp; Lybrand.  And on the record before us we reject
the responding parties' submission that the information has
been constructively refused.  We do not view the plaintiff
or his counsel as an agent for the court-appointed trustee.
Thus we think it is now unfair to compel two officers of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand to submit to an examination for discovery.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    There may come a time in this litigation when an
order to examine a representative of Coopers &amp; Lybrand is
appropriate, but at this stage such an order is premature.
We observe that Chilcott J. did not find that the responding
parties had been unable to obtain the information but only
that they will be unable to obtain it, a finding that
emphasizes the prematurity of the order.  Whatever practical
benefit there may be to the order of Chilcott J. must give
way to the requirements of r.31.10(2). Coopers &amp; Lybrand is
not a party and an order for discovery of a non-party is an
exceptional order which should not be made unless the
criteria in r.31.10(2) have been satisfied.  In our view,
these criteria have not been satisfied.  Accordingly, the
order to examine Roxanne Anderson and David Planques should
be set aside.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    We add that even if an order to examine an officer of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand was justified, the order should have
applied only to one officer, not two, and should have been
restricted to discovery on the threshold issue of
entitlement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   In the light of our disposition we think it is
unnecessary on this appeal to address Coopers &amp; Lybrand's
submission that any attack on the quick claim deed should be
made in the bankruptcy court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]   Accordingly, the plaintiff's appeal is dismissed with
costs.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand's appeal is allowed.  Paragraph 3
of the order of Chilcott J. is varied by deleting all
references to Olympia and York Developments Limited, Coopers
&amp; Lybrand OYDL Inc. and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Limited.
Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of the order of Chilcott J. are set
aside.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand is entitled to its costs of the
motion before Chilcott J. and of this appeal to be paid by
the responding parties.</font></pre></td>
