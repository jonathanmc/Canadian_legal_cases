    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should not, in her view, have been registered. According to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordinary meaning of the term, Apollo was registered and it was</font></pre>

relating to &quot;the amount actually paid&quot;, with which the trial

clearly was made did not meet the requirement.
