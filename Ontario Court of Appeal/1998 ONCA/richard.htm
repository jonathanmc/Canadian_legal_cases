</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant has worked for the respondent for over 25</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years. She sued the respondent claiming that she was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compensation under a plan instituted by the respondent for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compensation of employees who had made work-related suggestions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which were implemented by the respondent. The action proceeded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the simplified procedure provided for in Rule 76.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant contended that in November 1989 she made a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion directed at reducing the costs associated with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">installation, disconnection and repair of a certain type of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone circuit. She was involved in this area in the course of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her employment and was familiar with the problems associated with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this type of telephone circuit. The appellant claimed that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion she made in November 1989 was eventually implemented</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the respondent in 1994 and resulted in substantial savings for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The respondent's position was that the procedures</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">implemented in 1994 had been suggested by other employees before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant made her suggestion and that the suggestions made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the other employees were under active investigation and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration by the respondent when the appellant made her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion in November 1989. Under the terms of the compensation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan, an employee is not entitled to compensation if a proposal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">put forward is under active consideration by the company at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time the employee made the suggestion. The respondent also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contended that it had awarded compensation under the plan to two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other employees whose suggestions had preceded that made by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant. Finally, the respondent alleged that the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim had been fully and impartially investigated under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedures set up by the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Both parties moved for summary judgment under Rule 76.06(1).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent relied on various documents which on their face</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established that the proposal put forward by the respondent was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under evaluation by the respondent in the summer of 1989. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent also relied on the affidavit of a Bell manager who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">swore that the documents accurately reflected what had happened.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant filed an affidavit. She contended that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's documents had been altered to make it appear as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">though her proposal had been under consideration before she made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her suggestion in November 1989. It was her position that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other proposals referred to in the documents had been under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration prior to that date but that references to her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposal was added to those documents at some point after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 1989 to make it appear as though her proposal was under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consideration before November 1989. The appellant also filed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affidavits of two Bell employees who indicated that the solution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adopted by the company in 1994 employed the ideas contained in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant's November 1989 suggestion. These employees had no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge of whether the idea put forward by the appellant were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under investigation by the respondent prior to November 1989.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Rule 76.06(14) provides that a motion for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be granted unless:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          the judge is unable to decide the issues in
          the action in the absence of cross-examination; or

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          it would be otherwise unjust to decide the
          issues on the motion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  A bald assertion that the documents relied on by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent had been altered and do not reflect the events as they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actually occurred would not justify a refusal to grant summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment under Rule 76.06(1). However, in this case, there is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more than a bald assertion. The appellant made the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">points in the course of her argument:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (1)  The documents relied on by the respondent contain
     errors, discrepancies and inconsistencies which could lend
     credence to the appellant's contention that the documents
     were altered to &quot;backdate&quot; the respondent's consideration of
     the proposal which was eventually adopted in 1994. In
     particular, irregularities in the document dated July 4,
     1989 suggest that the references to the proposed solution
     identified as &quot;alternative IV&quot; were added to the document
     some time after the rest of the document was prepared.
     Alternative IV was the option eventually acted upon by the
     company in 1994 and is, according to the appellant,
     identical to the suggestion she put forward in November
     1989.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (2)  The respondent's initial reaction to the suggestion
     made by the appellant in November 1989 was inconsistent with
     the position the respondent now takes. The suggestion was
     accepted for evaluation and was not rejected for quite some
     time. If, as the respondent now contends, that suggestion
     contained a proposal which was already under active
     evaluation by the respondent, the suggestion should have
     been rejected immediately as ineligible for compensation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (3)  There was evidence that the proposal contained in the
     appellant's suggestion was the proposal eventually adopted
     by the respondent to solve the problem.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  None of these arguments establish the appellant's claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">They do, however, raise valid questions of fact which must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">answered in order to make a proper determination of the merits of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant's claim. A proper determination of these factual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">questions cannot be made without cross-examination of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and those involved in the creation of the documents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied on by the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  On this record, neither party should have been granted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary judgment under Rule 76.06(1). The appeal is allowed, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment dismissing the appellant's action is set aside and an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order will go directing that the matter proceed to trial under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rule 76.</font></pre></td>
