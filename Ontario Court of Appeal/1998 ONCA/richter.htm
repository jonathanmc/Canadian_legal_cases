[1]  The appellant sued for damages in the sum of U.S, $</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1,758,000.00. It claimed these moneys were due August 11, 1994,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was the settlement date upon the termination of an interest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rate currency swap transaction (contract) it had entered into</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  By its terms, the contract would have terminated on August</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">11, 1994 because on that date the appellant was insolvent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, on that date, the appellant obtained what is referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as a stay order from Mr. Justice Houlden. The order was made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Creditors Arrangement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36. The order restrained all counter-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties, and that included the respondent, from terminating a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">swap contract with the appellant without the appellant=s written</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consent or the order of the court. But, relevant to this action,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stay order specifically set out the procedures by which such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a contract might be terminated by the respondent after having</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been given the opportunity to elect to do so by the appellant, or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the appellant its self. The stay order provided:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Sub-paragraph 22(b) Y Treasury may Y
          send to the relevant counter-party a notice
          providing such counter-party with the
          opportunity to terminate all of the
          Derivative Contracts between such Counter-
          party and Treasury upon making payment of the
          settlement amount owing thereunder forthwith
          to TreasuryY In the event that the other
          party to such Derivative Contract does not
          chose to exercise that right subsequent to
          service of such notice and within three days
          of such service, Treasury may assign its
          rights and obligations under all of its
          Derivative Contracts with the counter-partyY.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Sub- paragraph 22(c) Y notwithstanding
          any other provision of this paragraph 22,
          Treasury shall be entitled to enforce any of
          its rights under any Derivative Contract to
          terminate such contract and to become
          entitled to any payment pursuant to such
          contract as a defaulting party.
                

[3]  On August 15, 1994, pursuant to sub-paragraph 22(b), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant gave the respondent notice that it had the opportunity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to terminate the contract and pay any settlement due, failing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which the appellant might assign it rights and obligations under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contract to an assignee of designated credit rating.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  There was an issue on the pleadings and in the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the respondent had elected to terminate the contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant to this notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  On December 12, 1994, about four months after the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had served the respondent with the notice pursuant to sub-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 22(b), the appellant served the respondent with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice said to be under sub-paragraph 22(c). By that notice, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant purported to terminate the contract, with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">settlement date August 1994, notwithstanding interest changes in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the interim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  The evidence was that between the dates in August and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December interest rates had change greatly to the advantage to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The case was not tried in the usual way. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heard no viva vocia evidence and was not called upon to make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings of credibility. Commendably, counsel had placed before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge the relevant documents and passages from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examinations for discovery as the evidence upon which the case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was to be decided.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  As pleaded and presented to the trial judge, the matter was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">primarily factual. The trial judge, in a lengthy judgment, gave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">careful consideration to all of the evidence. He held that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had failed to prove its case. He found the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not make a binding election in August 1994 (or at all) to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminate the contract, that there was no agreement to terminate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">based an August 11th termination date, and that the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not, by its notice of that date, terminate the contract on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 12 effective August 11, 1994.  There was evidence to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support these findings and conclusions. Particularly, evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellants treated the contract as continuing after the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order of Houlden J., and after the notice of August 15, 1994, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordingly the respondents did too, thereby acted to their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detriment. Had they believed the contract was terminated during</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">August 1994, the respondents would have replaced it, thereby</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">managing its risk appropriately.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  We are not persuaded there was any error made by the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge by reason of which we should interfere.


[10] We are told that because of legislation now in place no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">orders, such as that made in this case, will be made in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future. The case is then of limited significance. Perhaps only to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those others who were also counter-parties to derivative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contracts with the appellant, each of whom we are told, received</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the notice of August 15th from the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
