    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The respondents appeal the judgment of Loukidelis J. of the
Ontario Court (General Division) in which he made the following
orders:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    1.   the respondents are in
          contempt of the order of Mr. Justice
          Marchand, dated December 21, 1995;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    2.   the respondents are to pay a
          fine of $1,500 to the office of the Local
          Registrar, Parry Sound, Ontario, within 30
          days;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    3.   the respondents or either of
          them are restrained from interfering with the
          agents of the applicants who enter upon the
          access road to repair or maintain same;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    4.   the respondents= cross-motion
          is dismissed; and
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    5.   the respondents are to pay to
          the applicants their costs of this motion on
          a solicitor-client basis.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  This motion for contempt arises out of a long standing
dispute about the status of the access road passing over the
respondents= property to that of the appellants, James and
Gertrude Betty Ritchie. This matter has been to this court on two
previous occasions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  There is no longer any issue about improving the access
road. The work has been done in compliance with the order of
Loukidelis J.  The appellant now submits that the finding of
contempt against the appellants should not stand in view of the
fact that the appellants have been attempting in good faith to
obtain clarification of the decision of this court dated June 14,
1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The language of this court is very clear and requires no
clarification. The court stated:
                    Whether or not the appellants had
          an obligation to restore and maintain the
          access road to the respondents' cottage, they
          are not entitled to obstruct the respondents
          in their efforts to make the road passable so
          that the respondents may have the benefit of
          the statute.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The position of both appellants has been consistent
throughout and was reiterated by their counsel on the opening of
the appeal,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The appellants do not want the
          respondents using this access road and are
          prepared to use any legal means to prevent
          them from doing so.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  It is apparent to us as it must have been to the judge in
appeal that the appellants intended and still intend to use every
means available to them to prevent the respondents from
exercising their right of access. There is no suggestion of
remorse or apology on their part in the material before us.
Indeed they appear more determined than ever to justify their
conduct in continually frustrating the attempts of the
respondents to make use of the access road. For this court to
ignore their conduct would raise the perception that our courts
are futile and ineffective in the face of defiance to our orders.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
