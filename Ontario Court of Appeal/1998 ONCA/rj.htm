[1]  This appeal against conviction turns on whether a trial
judge's refusal to grant an adjournment to an un-represented
accused has resulted in the denial of the accused's right to a
fair trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  After a trial before The Honourable Mr. Justice Dilks and
jury, the appellant was convicted on January 19, 1996 of  one
count of sexual interference, one count of invitation to sexual
touching, and one count of sexual assault. The complainant on all
three counts was his daughter. On April 29, 1996, the appellant
was sentenced to three years incarceration. He now appeals his
conviction on a number of grounds; however, the dispositive issue
is that of the trial judge's decision to not grant two
adjournments sought by the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant's preliminary inquiry was held on December 12,
1994, at which he was committed to stand trial. On January 11,
1995  he attended at his judicial pre-trial in the Ontario Court
(General Division), at which a trial date was set for June 5,
1995. On May 30, 1995, the appellant's counsel at that time was
removed as counsel of record, an application to adjourn the trial
was granted, and the matter was adjourned to June 27, 1995 to set
a new trial date. On June 27, 1995, a new trial date of January
15, 1996 was set and marked to proceed &quot;with or without counsel&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On January 15, 1996, lawyer Howard Fletcher appeared before
Mr. Justice Dilks  seeking an adjournment of the appellant's
trial. He stated that he had only been contacted by appellant's
mother the week before, and that  he had only met the appellant
himself the night before. He explained that he had not yet been
retained, and would not go on the record at that time, but that
he expected to be retained in short order. Mr. Fletcher also
indicated that he would be able to conduct the trial in two
months' time, that is, in March of 1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant's mother, H.R., testified on the application.
She said that, in the preceding six weeks, she had contacted at
least four Toronto lawyers on behalf of her son, but that they
were too expensive. She also testified that the appellant had
contacted some lawyers in Kitchener, but had failed to retain
anyone in that city.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Mr. Justice Dilks denied the application for an adjournment.
In his reasons he made reference to the fact that the appellant
had the opportunity since June 27, 1995 to obtain the services of
counsel, and that he had been warned at that time that the matter
would proceed with or without counsel. The trial was then
adjourned until the next day, January 18, 1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  After jury selection on the morning of January 18, 1996, the
trial was adjourned until 2:15 that afternoon, in order that
another lawyer could attend before Mr. Justice Dilks on behalf of
the appellant. Mr. Abrahams then appeared before the trial judge
seeking an adjournment of the trial. He indicated that should an
adjournment be granted, he would be prepared to go on the record
as the appellant's counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Mr. Justice Dilks denied this request. He indicated,
however, that he was willing to give Mr. Abrahams until 10:00
a.m. the following morning to prepare for the trial. Mr. Abrahams
replied that he would not be able to attend then, but suggested
that he might be available two weeks hence. In addition, Mr.
Abrahams stated that he was prepared to re-elect to have the
trial proceed by judge alone. Mr. Justice Dilks also declined to
grant Mr. Abrahams' request.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appellant represented himself throughout the
proceedings. Although he did not testify himself, he examined his
own witnesses, and cross-examined his daughter, the complainant,
who was the Crown's only witness. This cross-examination took the
better part of one afternoon and the following morning, and
comprises some 70 pages of transcript. As it happened, just prior
to the trial date the complainant had made additional allegations
against her father, which allegations asserted that the appellant
had performed oral sex upon her. These allegations had not been
made previously. The appellant only became aware of these
allegations during the course of the trial itself, and was put
into the position of having to cross-examine his daughter on this
point.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We are all of the opinion that the trial judge was not
apprised of, or did not fully appreciate, that his refusal to
grant an adjournment meant that the appellant, without the
assistance of counsel, was facing fresh allegations of a most
serious nature. Although Crown counsel would have been aware of
the new allegations, they were not disclosed to the trial judge
or to the appellant until after the trial had started.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant did have a lawyer present before the trial
judge who stated that he was prepared to go on the record as
trial counsel in the event that an adjournment was given, that he
was prepared to re-elect trial before a judge alone and he was
prepared to proceed in a matter of weeks. It is apparent from
this position that the appellant was prepared to give up a
fundamental right to a trial by jury and that he was in no way
attempting to unnecessarily delay his trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] We feel that in the circumstances of this case some leniency
should have been accorded to the appellant who, as the father of
the complainant on a charge of sexual assault, was obliged
personally to confront his daughter on the witness stand and
cross-examine her on details of her allegations about his
misconduct. This was a situation that should be avoided if it is
at all possible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Under all the circumstances, we are not satisfied that the
appellant received a fair trial. Accordingly, we are allowing the
appeal, setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial.</font></pre></td>
