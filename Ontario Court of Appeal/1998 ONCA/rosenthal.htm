    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Humphrey J. on July 28, 1998 because service of the notice of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prescribed by Rule 4(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The test for the court is fourfold:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (1)  Did the Crown form a bona fide intention to appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            within the prescribed time limit?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (2)  Has the Crown demonstrated any lack of diligence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            its attempts to serve the respondent? (This is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            sometimes referred to as whether the Crown has</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            [1987] B.C.J. No. 241 (B.C.C.A.) (Q.L.), although in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            (3) Even if the Crown was not reasonably diligent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            has there been prejudice to the respondent from the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    The respondent accepts that the Crown made the decision to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal within the time prescribed. The decision was made on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Thursday August 20. On Monday August 24, Crown counsel's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secretary contacted Detective Merrit, one of the investigating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers, to confirm his availability to serve Mr. Rosenthal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personally. Her position is that she advised the officer of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deadline for service and sent him the material by rush courier.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, he says that he did not realize the urgency of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">timing, and did not open the material which was in his mail box</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on August 25, until the afternoon of August 26. The deadline for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">service was August 27.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    It was only on August 27 at 11:15 a.m. that the officer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first tried to serve Mr. Rosenthal at his address but there was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no answer. He detailed another officer to try again which he did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at 6:00 p.m. and there was still no answer. No further attempts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were made that evening although it is conceded that service would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been effective until 12:00 midnight.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Crown counsel does not take the position that Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rosenthal was evading service. She also concedes that the police</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could have done more to try to serve Mr. Rosenthal within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time limit, but says that what they did was reasonable. They</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">eventually served him on September 3, 1998 at his appointment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with his probation officer. No attempt was made to contact his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial counsel, apparently on the theory that that might have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alerted him to try to avoid service and necessitate a motion such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as this. On September 2, the trial counsel's office advised the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police that they would accept service.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    In my view, taking the lowest threshold test for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown, it cannot be said that the Crown exercised reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diligence to serve Mr. Rosenthal within the prescribed time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limit. Having taken until one week before the deadline to make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the decision to appeal, if there was any concern about alerting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Rosenthal then the Crown or the police were obliged to obtain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his home and work addresses and ensure that he was in town so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that when they got the papers ready, the service could be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effected. To do nothing until the last day, and then only try at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a residence at 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., not the most likely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">times to find a person at home on a summer work day, cannot in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the circumstances be said to be reasonable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    As a result of these findings, there is no need to deal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the issues of prejudice or merit.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    The application is denied.
