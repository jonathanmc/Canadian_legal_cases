[1]   We agree with the trial judge that the conduct of  the
appellant  towards his step-daughter was most  reprehensible
and  it  amounted to a serious breach of trust. Under  these
circumstances,  we are not persuaded that  the  trial  judge
erred in refusing to impose a conditional sentence.
[2]  That said, we note that apart from the two incidents of
sexual touching, the misconduct in question essentially
amounted to sexual exploitation. In view of that, we believe
that the trial judge over-emphasized the principles of
general deterrence and denunciation in arriving at the 18
month sentence she imposed. Moreover, although the trial
judge referred to the significant mitigating factors
favouring the appellant, we are not persuaded that she gave
sufficient weight to them.
[3]  In all of the circumstances, we think that the sentence
of 18 months imprisonment was clearly excessive and that a
sentence of 8 months, plus two years’ probation, should have
been imposed.
[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted and the
sentence is reduced to one of 8 months plus two years
probation.</font></pre></td>
