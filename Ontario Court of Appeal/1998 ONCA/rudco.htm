</strong>

[1]  This appeal concerns payments made by a contractor or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subcontractor from funds received on a construction project</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">towards its general overhead expenses before paying amounts owing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to its subcontractors for the same project. The issue is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these payments reduce or eliminate the contractor’s or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subcontractor’s trust obligations to its subcontractors which are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">created by s. 8 of the Construction Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 3</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(the “Act”). On a motion under Rule 21(1)(a) Coo J. held that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they did not. I agree with that conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The plaintiff, Rudco Insulation Ltd. (“Rudco”), sued the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate defendant, Toronto Sanitary Inc. (“TSI”) and the two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual defendants Bruno Lisi (“Lisi”) and Morris Piccone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(“Piccone”) for the sum of $216,555.16 owing in contract for work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performed on three separate construction projects (“the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">projects”). Lisi and Piccone are the only two officers and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors of TSI. After the exchange of pleadings, Rudco brought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a motion under Rule 21(1)(a) for the determination of a question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of law. This appeal brought by TSI, Lisi and Piccone, is from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order made on that motion. The defendant, Lakeshore J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Construction Ltd. was not a party to the motion or to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The facts are simple and not in dispute. TSI was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subcontractor on the projects. Rudco entered into contracts to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perform piping insulation services as a subcontractor to TSI.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">After TSI received payment under its contracts and before paying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">monies owing to Rudco, TSI made payments towards its general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overhead expenses. TSI became insolvent and Rudco remains unpaid.</font></pre>

[4]  The payments to Colbourn (an engineer on staff at TSI) and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Piccone shown in Schedule 6 were management wages for actual work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supplied by them to TSI during one of the projects and included</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matters such as foreman’s work, on-site project management,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordering materials and supplies, associated paperwork and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supervision of the trades.



[5]  All of the amounts shown in Schedules 6, 8 and 9 (“the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overhead expenses”) were pro-rated allocations to the projects of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">TSI’s general overhead expenses. The overhead expenses exceeded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amount of Rudco’s claim.



[6]  Coo J. held that the recipients of the overhead expenses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were not persons to whom trust benefits are conferred under s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8(1) of the Act and that the payment of the overhead expenses did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not reduce TSI’s trust obligations to Rudco under s. 10 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act.



[7]  Although Coo J. was not specifically asked to determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the payment of overhead expenses breached TSI’s trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations, the inevitable result of his finding is that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did. The practical significance of this finding is that Lisi and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Piccone as officers and directors of TSI may personally be liable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Rudco for the breach of trust under s. 13 of the Act.1



[8]  Rudco’s motion also sought a determination whether or not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the value of the materials taken from TSI’s inventory which were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">used on the projects reduced TSI’s trust obligations. Coo J. did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not address this question in his reasons or in his order. In my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, we do not have enough evidence to decide this issue in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">context of a Rule 21 motion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS



[9]  This case turns on the interpretation of the trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions set out in Part II of the Act.  The relevant sections</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          8. (1) All amounts,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  owing to a contractor or subcontractor,
          whether or not due or payable; or
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  received by a contractor or
          subcontractor,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          on account of the contract or subcontract
          price of an improvement constitute a trust
          fund for the benefit of the subcontractors
          and other persons who have supplied services
          or materials to the improvement who are owed
          amounts by the contractor or subcontractor.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  The contractor or subcontractor is the
          trustee of the trust fund created by
          subsection (1) and the contractor or
          subcontractor shall not appropriate or
          convert any part of the fund to the
          contractor’s or subcontractor’s own use or to
          any use inconsistent with the trust until all
          subcontractors and other persons who supply
          services or materials to the improvement are
          paid all amounts related to the improvement
          owed to them by the contractor or
          subcontractor.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          10. Subject to Part IV (holdbacks), every
          payment by a trustee to a person the trustee
          is liable to pay for services or materials
          supplied to the improvement discharges the
          trust of the trustee making the payment and
          the trustee’s obligations and liability as
          trustee to all beneficiaries of the trust to
          the extent of the payment made by the
          trustee.



[10] Section 8(1) creates a trust in favour of subcontractors and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other persons who have supplied services or materials to an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">improvement. It is conceded that the projects were improvements,2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the monies received by TSI from the projects were trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">funds and that Rudco, as a subcontractor, was a beneficiary of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those trusts for the monies which it was owed. Section 8(2)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precludes the trustee from using trust funds for its own purposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or any purposes inconsistent with the trust until all of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiaries of the trust have been paid.



[11] Section 10 provides that a payment made by the trustee to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person for services or materials supplied to the improvement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharges the trustee’s obligation to all beneficiaries of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust to the extent of the payment. The persons referred to in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 10 to whom payment may be made are also beneficiaries of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust created by s. 8(1).



[12] Applying s. 10 to this case, the issue is whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payments made by TSI for the overhead expenses were payments to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persons who supplied services or materials to an improvement; if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so those payments would discharge TSI’s trust obligation to Rudco</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the extent of such payments; if not the payments were to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">persons who were not beneficiaries and were made in breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">TSI’s trust obligations.



[13] It is common ground that the recipients of the overhead</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expenses did not supply materials to an improvement and the only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way that payments to them could discharge TSI’s trust obligations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be if the payments were made for services supplied to an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">improvement within the meaning of s. 10.
 </font></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]  “Supply of services” is defined in s. 1 of the Act as
follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          “supply of services” means any work done or
          service performed upon or in respect of an
          improvement, and includes,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  the rental of equipment with an
          operator, and
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  where the making of the planned
          improvement is not commenced, the supply of a
          design, plan, drawing or specification that
          in itself enhances the value of the owner’s
          interest in the land,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and a corresponding expression has a
          corresponding meaning: (“prestation de
          services”)  [Emphasis added.]



[15] While the defined term “supply of services” does not exactly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coincide with the phrases “supplied services” in s. 8 or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“services supplied” in s. 10, the only reasonable interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is that the three phrases refer to the same concept. Both the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordinary meaning of the words and the concluding words of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition lead to this conclusion.



[16] The persons to whom the overhead expenses were paid did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perform services upon an improvement and therefore the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation of the phrase, “in respect of an improvement” in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the definition is critical. The appellants argue for a broad</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation under which any service that contributes either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directly or indirectly to the completion of an improvement would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be included. Without such expenses they argue, there would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been no improvement because TSI must necessarily have incurred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the overhead expenses in order to perform its work. It would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an unreasonable interpretation of the Act they say, if a general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor or a subcontractor is not entitled to pay such things</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as staff payroll, office rents, insurance premiums and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accountant’s fees from project funds, as these costs arise in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">normal course of business. As a result, the appellants argue that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the persons who were paid overhead expenses attributed to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work performed on the projects are persons who performed services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“in respect of an improvement.”




[17] The factors to be considered in statutory interpretation are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">well established. In Bapoo v. Cooperators General Insurance Co.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1998), 36 O.R. (3d) 616 (C.A.), Laskin J.A., at p. 620, set out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the factors as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          The modern approach to statutory
          interpretation calls on courts to interpret a
          legislative provision in its total context.
          The court’s interpretation should comply with
          the legislative text, promote the legislative
          purpose and produce a reasonable and just
          meaning.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In determining who is entitled to the benefit created by s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">8(1) there are two factors that deserve considerable weight. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first is that s. 8(1) creates a preference for one class of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditors that did not exist at common law; the second is that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the central purpose of Part II of the Act, which creates the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust benefit, is to provide a financial preference for those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">down the contractual chain on construction projects. Both of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these factors have been relied upon in a number of cases.


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Before considering the case law it is important to note that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Construction Lien Act came into force in April, 1983,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repealing the Ontario Mechanics’ Lien Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 261.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Although the language in the previous Act and the protection</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">afforded creditors were different in some respects, the general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose was the same and cases decided under the Mechanics’ Lien</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act have been referred to by courts in interpreting the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Providing proper care is taken with respect to the specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">changes, references to cases under the previous Act are helpful</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in interpreting the current legislation.



[20] Further, s. 14, which is in Part III of the Act, provides</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lien protection to the same class of creditors who are given the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust benefit by s. 8(1). Section 14(1) provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          14. (1)  A person who supplies services or
          materials to an improvement for an owner,
          contractor or subcontractor, has a lien upon
          the interest of the owner in the premises
          improved for the price of those services or
          materials. [Emphasis added.]



[21] In combination, ss. 8(1) and 14(1) provide for a preference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and security interest for one class of creditor not enjoyed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other creditors of the same debtor. Cases dealing with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlement to liens are therefore relevant to the interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the sections in Part II of the Act dealing with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlement to trust benefits.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The first principle that I draw from the cases is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following: because the legislation creates a preference and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security for certain creditors that did not otherwise exist at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common law, it ought to be given a strict interpretation in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining whether a particular creditor is a person to whom the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefit is given.


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In Clarkson Company Limited et al. v. Ace Lumber Limited et</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">al., [1963] S.C.R. 110, the Supreme Court of Canada considered a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lien claim by two companies who had rented construction equipment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a subcontractor. The case turned on the interpretation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mechanics’ Lien Act which created lien protection for “any person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who performs any work or service in respect of ... constructing a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">building.”  Ritchie J., at p. 114 said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               With the greatest respect, I am,
          however, of opinion that the proper approach
          to the interpretation of this statute is
          expressed in the dissenting opinion of Kelly
          J.A. where he says that:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The lien commonly known as the
          mechanics’ lien was unknown to the common law
          and owes its existence in Ontario to a series
          of statutes, the latest of which is R.S.O.
          1960, c. 233. It constitutes an abrogation of
          the common law to the extent that it creates,
          in the specified circumstances, a charge upon
          the owner’s lands which would not exist but
          for the Act, and grants to one class of
          creditors a security or preference not
          enjoyed by all creditors of the same debtor;
          accordingly, while the statute may merit a
          liberal interpretation with respect to the
          rights it confers upon those to whom it
          applies, it must be given a strict
          interpretation in determining whether any
          lien-claimant is a person to whom a lien is
          given by it. [Emphasis added.]




[24] For the reasons set out in Clarkson Company Limited, this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court adopted a strict interpretation approach in George Wimpey</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada Limited v. Peelton Mills Ltd. et al. (1982), 35 O.R. (2d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">787 (C.A.). The court held that a contractor who performed work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on a public street could not assert a lien claim against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjoining land benefited by the work. The work was not done “in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect of” the adjoining land. Thorson J.A. examined the history</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the legislation and noted that the words “in respect of” were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">introduced into the legislation solely for the purpose of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedying the historical problem that a lien could only be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained if work had been done upon the work site itself.



[25] In applying the strict interpretation approach to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlement, courts have described the test in a number of ways.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In 697470 Ontario Ltd. v. Presidential Developments Ltd. et al.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 334 (Div. Ct.), the plaintiff subcontractor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had supplied construction management services including reviewing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenders, selecting and co-ordinating the trades and supervising</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the site superintendent. In dismissing the claim for a lien,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rosenberg J. referred to Clarkson Company Limited above and held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at p. 337:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          ...the work performed by the appellant was
          not so directly related to the construction
          of the improvement to entitle the appellant
          to a lien under the Act. [Emphasis added.]



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In Oliver v. Muer Construction Ltd. (1985), 12 C.L.R. 1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Ont. H.C.J.) the plaintiff solicitor represented the defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in obtaining severance for residential lots which substantially</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">increased the value of the property. In refusing a claim for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lien, the court found that the legal services performed did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have the degree of nexus and were too remote from the improvement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to fall within the scope of the definition of “supply of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">services.”


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] In my view, the reasoning in these cases applies in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpreting entitlement to the trust benefit under s. 8(1) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Act. Importantly, a strict interpretation of s. 8(1) is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistent with the legislature's purpose in creating the trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits set out in Part II of the Act.3



[28] The most obvious purpose of Parts II and III of the Act is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to provide a financial preference and a security interest to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those down the contractual chain on construction projects.4  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trust and lien protections reduce the risk of non-payment in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">event of insolvency by those above and undoubtedly assist those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">below, often small businesses, in more readily obtaining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financing. The statute brings greater stability and security to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the construction industry than would exist at common law.



[29] The Construction Lien Act was based largely on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recommendations of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Draft Construction Lien Act (the “Advisory Committee”).5  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Advisory Committee stated at p. (xxiii):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          The trust funds isolate contract monies, and
          require them to be used for paying suppliers
          who have contributed towards the making of an
          improvement. By making these funds a trust,
          the suppliers to a payer are given protection
          in the event that the payer becomes
          insolvent, since the monies will not then
          form part of his estate. In addition, the
          trust rights permit the tracing of contract
          funds that are used for an improper purpose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Further down on p. (xxiii) the Committee stated:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          By providing these rights, the lien
          legislation facilitates the granting of
          credit within the construction industry. The
          protections afforded by the Mechanics’ Lien
          Act have now become an integral factor in the
          provision of credit in that industry. Thus,
          the Act makes it easier for construction to
          take place, since it assures that credit will
          be made available. In addition, by providing
          a uniform regime of rights to all suppliers
          in the industry, that Act reduces both the
          costs of negotiating both construction
          contracts and subcontracts, and also the
          uncertainties inherent in any complex system
          of contractual relationships.




[31] If the trust provisions are interpreted as the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argues, to include as beneficiaries persons who are recipients of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the overhead expenses of a contractor or subcontractor, the trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefit to those down the chain would be reduced or eliminated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">An expansion of the class of creditors entitled to the benefit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has the obvious result of reducing the benefit to those who are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clearly intended to be within the class.



[32] A number of courts have considered the specific issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overhead expenses. The preponderance of authority has held that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the payment of overhead expenses does not reduce the trust</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obligations of a contractor or subcontractor. See Emco Supply v.</font></pre>

          These trusts reflect the pyramidic nature of
          the payment scheme devised under the Act and
          are aimed at creating, as it were, a fortress
          of impregnability against deductions by
          either the owner or a contractor from the
          trusts imposed in favour of the respective
          beneficiaries down the line.


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Killeen J. went on to reason that s. 8 does not allow a</font></pre>
