    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The respondents were convicted by a jury of conspiracy to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vitone to an 18-month conditional sentence to be followed by 18</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">months probation. He sentenced the respondent Russo, who had a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">related but dated criminal record, to a 23-month conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence to be followed by 23 months probation. The terms of both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditional sentences imposed significant requirements and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions on the respondents. The Crown seeks leave to appeal</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The charges arose out of a large-scale drug investigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which targeted persons other than the respondents. In the course</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of that investigation, intercepted communications established</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Russo had agreed to supply 4 kilograms of cocaine to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person named Destefano who was one of the targets of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">investigation. The intercepted communications also established</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Vitone had agreed to obtain the cocaine for Russo.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Destefano was to sell the 4 kilograms to a person who was, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact, an undercover police agent. The respondents were in contact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with Destefano for about 2 months. They made unsuccessful efforts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to locate a supplier of the cocaine. The trial judge found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they would not have been able to obtain 4 kilograms of cocaine as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they had promised Destefano. He further held that the police made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrests some two days before the proposed sale to Destefano</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because they knew that it was likely that the respondents would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not be able to produce 4 kilograms of cocaine. The respondents'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">efforts to find a supplier continued up until Destefano's arrest.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The respondent Vitone was 29 years of age at the time of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentencing. His pre-sentence report was positive. He is a chef</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and his employer describes him as a valued employee. He has no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criminal record.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The respondent Russo was 41 years old when sentenced. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comes from a stable family background, is married and has two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">children. His pre-sentence report was also positive. Russo works</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the family business and, by all accounts, is a hardworking,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reliable contributor to that business. Russo has 5 prior criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convictions. However, all occurred at least 10 years prior to his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involvement in this conspiracy. Two of the offences are drug-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">related, including a conviction in 1984 for which Russo received</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a sentence of 9 months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge gave thoughtful and careful reasons for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence. He reviewed the circumstances of the offence and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offenders in detail. He also considered the Criminal Code</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions governing sentences in general and the imposition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditional sentences in particular. He provided a thorough and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">careful analysis of the case law. In the end, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided that a term of imprisonment within the reformatory range</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was appropriate. He further held, applying the criteria in s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">742.1 of the Criminal Code, that conditional sentences were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate and in keeping with the relevant principles of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentencing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Section 686 of the Criminal Code directs that this court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must review the &quot;fitness&quot; of a sentence under appeal. Contrary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">previous authority from this court (e.g. R. v. Simmons (1973), 13</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.C.C. (2d) 65, per Brooke J.A. at 72), recent decisions of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme Court of Canada have held that the fitness review is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited one. An appellate court can vary the sentence imposed at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial only where the trial judge has made an error in principle</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or where the sentence imposed is outside the acceptable range of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence available in the circumstances: R. v. M.(C.A.), [1996] 1</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in principle in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that the enactment of the conditional sentence provisions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effectively lowered the appropriate range of sentence so as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">render sentences of less than 2 years appropriate in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances where prior to the enactment of the conditional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentencing provisions, a sentence of 2 years or more would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been necessary. In making this submission, the Crown relies on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following passage from the trial judge's reasons:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I do not know what the &quot;starting-point&quot;
          sentence is for conspiracy to traffic in
          cocaine; if there is one, on my reading of
          the cases it may be three years. I, as well,
          do not know whether any such &quot;starting-point&quot;
          will, in the fullness of time, be altered by
          the Court of Appeal of this province in
          recognition of the new sentencing regime
          introduced by Parliament in September 1996.
          However, I do not see how a &quot;starting-point&quot;
          can be applied in a given case without
          consideration being given to the empirical
          evidence cited in Wismayer [(1997), 115
          C.C.C. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.)] and to the
          principles embodied in conditional sentences.
          To do otherwise would, I believe, ignore the
          underlying shift in the philosophy of
          sentencing which is upon us. It is for this
          reason, I should think, that many pre-
          September 1996 sentencing decisions must be
          followed with caution. As I have already
          alluded to earlier in these Reasons, a pre-
          September 1996 starting-point sentence of
          three years can become a sentence of less
          than two years simply because of the sheer
          utility of s. 742.1 and the better justice it
          may afford. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Read in isolation, this passage supports the Crown's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contention. Conditional sentences are available only where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate term of imprisonment is less than 2 years: Criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Code s. 742.1(a). The appropriate term of imprisonment is fixed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by reference to the fundamental purposes of sentencing described</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in s. 718 and the principles of sentence set down in s. 718.1 and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code. If a consideration of these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purposes and principles dictates a term of imprisonment beyond 2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">years, a conditional sentence is unavailable. Sentencing someone</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a conditional sentence which, of necessity, must be less than</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2 years, even where that person meets the criteria of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">742.1(b), is a fundamental error in principle if on an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of the appropriate principles of sentencing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proper range of sentence begins at 2 years or more.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  On my reading of the entirety of the trial judge's reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for sentence, I do not agree that the trial judge fell into the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error alleged by the Crown. Earlier in his reasons, the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge referred to R. v. Pierce (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 321 at 336</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">XV, where Finlayson J.A. said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          My own view is that a simpler approach would
          be to avoid a rigid two-step process in the
          first place. Where a trial judge is asked to
          impose a conditional sentence and no minimum
          sentence is called for by the Code, surely
          the easiest method is to decide on general
          sentencing principles whether the
          circumstances of the offence and the offender
          call for a penitentiary sentence as opposed
          to a reformatory sentence. If they clearly
          call for a penitentiary sentence, there can
          be no resort to a conditional sentence. If
          they do not, or if there is some doubt on the
          matter, then the full panoply of sentencing
          guidelines should be brought into play to
          determine what should be the appropriate
          sentence. ... [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The trial judge went on to say, &quot;I have some doubt as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether a fit sentence should be a penitentiary or reformatory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence.&quot; I take this to mean that the trial judge found himself</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in that area described by Finlayson J.A. in the above-quoted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passage from Pierce where a reformatory length sentence could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be ruled out as inappropriate. Having decided that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate range of imprisonment did not exclude a reformatory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence, the trial judge was entitled to look at the various</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentencing options available in deciding where within that range</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to fix the respondents' sentences.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] My conclusion that the trial judge did not fall into the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error in principle alleged on by the Crown does not end the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter. It must still be determined, applying the purposes and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles of sentencing set out in the Code, whether a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">penitentiary term was &quot;clearly called for&quot; in the circumstances</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of these offenders and this offence. The Crown argues that any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence under two years falls well outside the appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">range.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In deciding that a penitentiary term was not required, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge quite properly put considerable emphasis on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positive features of each respondents' character and background.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I think, however, he fell into two errors in principle when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considering the nature and gravity of the offence. First, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">emphasized the respondents' inability to actually deliver the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drugs they had agreed to deliver to Destefano. He clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regarded this as a mitigating factor. No doubt, this would have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been a significantly worse case had the respondents actually</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained and delivered 4 kilograms of cocaine. I cannot regard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their failure to do so, however, as properly placed on the credit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">side of the ledger for sentencing purposes. The respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreed to deliver 4 kilograms of cocaine to a drug trafficker.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When they did so, they intended to make good on that promise.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Discussions to that effect went on for some 2 months. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents did not withdraw from or abandon the conspiracy and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their attempts to acquire the promised cocaine continued up to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the date of Destefano's arrest. Neither operated under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extenuating circumstances like those found in R. v. Stevens</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 372 (Man. C.A.) which could be said to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mitigate their culpability. They deserve no credit for the fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that their criminal aspirations exceeded their grasp. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge erred in principle in discounting the gravity of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offence because the respondents were unable to deliver the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cocaine as promised.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Second, the trial judge rejected the Crown's submission that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the amount of cocaine the respondents had agreed to deliver to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Destefano was an aggravating factor on sentence. He said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Since the offenders were wholly unable to
          unearth cocaine in any quantity, I do not see
          how this court can attach much weight to an
          amount that was never forthcoming.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The exact nature of the criminal conspiracy entered into by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents should have been a important consideration in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposition of sentence. These respondents were prepared to supply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a massive amount of cocaine to a person they believed to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drug trafficker. Their agreement contemplated a large-scale</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commercial transaction in a deadly substance. While ultimately no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">profit was made, there can be no doubt that profit was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motive. These respondents were prepared to do significant damage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to others so that they could make money.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Conspiracies that contemplate the sale of large amounts of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drug like cocaine clearly pose a much more significant danger to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the community than do agreements to supply small amounts to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">others for purely personal use. The amount the respondents agreed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to sell to Destefano indicates that they were ready and willing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to participate in the drug trade at a very high level. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge erred in principle in giving no weight to the magnitude of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the crime contemplated by the agreement made by the respondents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The two errors identified above caused the trial judge to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significantly underestimate the seriousness of the offence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining the appropriate sentence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Having found errors in principle, this court is entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review the trial record and impose what it regards to be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appropriate sentence: R. v. Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">719 (C.A.). This is so whether the appeal is brought by accused</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">90 (C.A.). I think, however, that the court should be reluctant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to vary a non-custodial sentence to a custodial sentence on a</font></pre>
