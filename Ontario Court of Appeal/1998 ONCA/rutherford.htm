    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge ordered the appellant to pay the
respondent the sum of $216,689.85, representing one-half the
amount of a winning Lottario ticket in the July 17, 1993,
draw, based on his finding that the respondent had purchased
the ticket with the appellant and agreed to share any proceeds
equally. The trial judge reviewed the conflicts and weaknesses
in the evidence of the respondent and properly applied the
burden of proof. He accepted the evidence of the respondent.
We cannot say that he erred in so doing.  It was open to the
trial judge to infer from all the circumstances, including the
conduct of the appellant, that the ticket which had been co-
purchased was the ticket which won the lottery. That was
sufficient to dispose of the case. The appeal is dismissed
with costs to the respondent.</font></pre></td>
