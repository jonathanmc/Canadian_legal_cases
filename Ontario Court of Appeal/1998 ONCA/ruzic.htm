    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Section 17 of the Criminal Code provides a statutory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence of duress for persons who have been compelled by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threats of death or bodily harm to commit a criminal offence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that they would not otherwise have committed. But s. 17</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposes restrictions on the defence not found at common law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The statutory defence is available only if the threats are of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediate death or bodily harm and the threatener is present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the offence is committed; and it is not available if a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person commits any one of 22 excluded offences. The main issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this appeal is whether these statutory restrictions violate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because they permit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the conviction of persons whose actions are morally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involuntary.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The respondent, Marijana Ruzic, was tried before Herold</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. and a jury on charges of unlawfully importing 2 kilograms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of heroin into Canada on April 29, 1994, contrary to s.5(1) of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.N-1 and of possession</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and use of a false passport contrary to s.368 of the Criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Code. The respondent admitted importing the heroin and using a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">false passport but claimed that she had done so under duress.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">She said that a man named Mirko Mirkovic had threatened to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">harm or kill her mother in Serbia unless she brought the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heroin to Canada. She also said that the Serbian police could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not protect her mother. Her claim of duress did not meet the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;immediacy&quot; or &quot;presence&quot; requirements of s. 17 of the Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Therefore, during her trial she asked for a declaration that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.17 of the Code violated s.7 of the Charter and was of no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">force or effect. The trial judge ruled that s.17 of the Code</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did violate s.7 of the Charter and was not saved by s.1. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore declined to charge the jury on the statutory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence. Instead he charged the jury on the common law defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of duress. On December 9, 1994, the jury acquitted the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent on both charges.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant, the Attorney General of Canada, appeals</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the acquittal on the charge of importing heroin. It submits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the trial judge erred in ruling that s.17 was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unconstitutional and in removing the statutory defence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duress from the jury. In the alternative, the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elements of the common law defence of duress. The intervener,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Attorney General of Ontario, supports the position of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  The Respondent's Importation of Heroin

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Crown's case on importing heroin was put in by an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreed statement of facts, which was read to the jury. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">following is the summary of the agreed statement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On April 25, 1994, the respondent, then 21 years old,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took a bus from Belgrade, Yugoslavia where she lived with her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother, to Budapest, Hungary. The following day, April 26, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flew from Budapest to Athens, Greece. Three days later on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">April 29, 1994, she flew from Athens to Toronto. She travelled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  When the respondent arrived in Canada she was carrying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">over 2 kilograms of heroin with a street value of about $1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">million. The heroin was in three separate packages strapped to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent's waist under her clothing. The respondent also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had a false Austrian passport in the name of &quot;Roswitha</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic&quot; and a return ticket to Athens with a departure date</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of August 10, 1994.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Although the respondent was examined and searched on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrival in Canada, Canadian immigration officials did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">initially discover the heroin. The respondent was first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">briefly interviewed by an immigration officer. She presented</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her false passport and said that she knew a couple of people</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Canada. The officer decided that an in depth secondary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination was needed. A few minutes later another</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immigration officer, Nicole Laporte, began the secondary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination of the respondent. During this examination the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent lied to immigration officials and gave an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">implausible account of why she had come to Canada. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's lies and the implausibility of her story were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quickly detected by Laporte and the other immigration</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers. At trial the respondent admitted her lies and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimed they supported her evidence that she was acting under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duress.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  During the examination Laporte discovered that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent had only $80 U.S. and $22 Canadian in her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession. The respondent said that she intended to leave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada on May 10 or 11. She claimed that her parents paid for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her airline ticket and she said that she was going to visit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two friends of her parents in Canada: Nicolas Kodinakis and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Vladimir Jankovic. The respondent told Laporte that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">planned to stay at a hotel for two nights and then take a taxi</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Jankovic's house. However, the telephone number she gave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for Jankovic was not in service. The respondent then said that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she would stay only one night in Canada and would return to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Athens the following evening.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The secondary examination was then adjourned to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">completed the next day. The respondent was detained at a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention centre overnight. When she arrived at the detention</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">centre she was searched by Punam Mangat, a security officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mangat asked the respondent to remove her coat, conducted a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pat-down search and felt a &quot;very strange&quot; bulge on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's right hip. Mangat asked the respondent what it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was and the respondent replied &quot;something that nature has done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to me.&quot; The respondent had tears in her eyes. Mangat took the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent to the washroom and asked her to pull down her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tights. Mangat touched the bulge and, believing it to be an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overgrown bone or some other abnormality, did not examine it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further. The respondent's luggage was also searched but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing unusual was found.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The following morning April 30, 1994, Laporte resumed her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">secondary examination and obtained a statement from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent with the assistance of an interpreter. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent admitted that she had only just met Nicolas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Kodinakis on the plane and that she had lied earlier when she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said he was a friend of her parents. She also said that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knew only one person in Canada &quot;Ivan&quot;, a name given to her by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her girlfriend. She corrected herself and said the name given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to her was &quot;Vladimir&quot;. She said she had never met Vladimir.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent told Laporte that while she was at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detention centre she had telephoned her girlfriend. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expected her girlfriend to get in touch with Vladimir and then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contact her. She also told Laporte that she came to Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because she &quot;wanted to do something crazy&quot; and &quot;just had the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">urge to travel now.&quot; She said that she now wanted to go home.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When the secondary examination was completed Laporte</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recommended that the respondent not be admitted to Canada.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] A second immigration official, Brent MacWilliam, then</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interviewed the respondent. During the interview he found the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent evasive and nervous. MacWilliam decided to hold an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inquiry under the Immigration Act R.S.C. 1985, c.I-2. into the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent's immigration status. The respondent would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detained in custody pending the completion of the inquiry.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MacWilliam told the respondent, however, that she could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">withdraw her application for admission to Canada and that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could leave on the next available flight to Athens. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was then returned to the detention centre. When the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent arrived at the centre Mangat conducted another pat-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">down search of her and felt the same unusual bulge she had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">felt the day before. Later, while the respondent was on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone, another security officer searched the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">room. This officer picked up the respondent's black leather</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">coat and discovered the three packages of heroin. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was then arrested.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  The Respondent's Evidence of Duress

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] After the respondent was arrested she gave a statement to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the police in which she admitted bringing the heroin into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada but explained that if she had not done so her mother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would have been harmed. She said that she brought the heroin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into Canada for the mafia and she identified the person who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sent her as Mirko Mirkovic. In her statement the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repeatedly stressed her concern for her mother's safety. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant portion of her statement is as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q. Who was it that you were bringing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             heroin into Canada for?

The police officer who took her statement felt that the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The respondent testified at trial and gave a fuller</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The trial judge told the jury that &quot;her statements as you read</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them and as you consider them in her evidence, should be read</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that she and her mother lived alone in an apartment in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Belgrade, as her parents had separated. In 1994 the respondent</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said &quot;[p]eople die in the streets. We don't have a law; it's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corruption. And the crime it's very high and so people are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">afraid.&quot; She said that in the last two or three years she no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">longer trusted the authorities in her country. An expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witness who testified for the defence about living in Belgrade</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Correspondingly, the people had lost faith in the ability of</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1994, about two months before the date of the alleged offence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic approached her while she was walking her dog and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said: &quot;Hi, how are you? Is that your dog? It's a sweet dog.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">You are a pretty girl.&quot; The respondent replied: &quot;Yes, it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nice to meet you&quot; and left. She explained that she was trying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not to be too nice but also not to be too rude, because she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">felt Mirkovic was the kind of man who could hurt her. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">described him as a very big man, very tall and strong. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believed that he was a &quot;bad man&quot;, a &quot;warrior&quot; who was paid to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">kill people in the war.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] A few days after their first encounter Mirkovic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approached the respondent again. This time he knew her name,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">although she had not told it to him. Mirkovic then began</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approaching the respondent once or twice a week, each time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when she walked her dog. He knew many details of her personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">life though she had not told him anything. He knew that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not live with her father and that she lived alone with her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother. He began to call her, though she had not given him her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telephone number. He observed how young her mother looked and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that her mother &quot;looked good&quot;. Mirkovic told the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he knew her every move.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Mirkovic began threatening the respondent. He told her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he liked to &quot;cut people&quot; with a knife. Although he never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cut her, he did show her his knife. She also knew that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carried a gun because she felt it once when he tried to grab</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In late March Mirkovic started approaching the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more often. She testified that he treated her as if she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;his property&quot;. In April he made sexual advances toward her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He touched her body, and on a few occasions tried to remove</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her clothes. She resisted. Mirkovic told her that he would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">like to have sex with her mother. He threatened to hang her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dog and a few times he hit the dog on its legs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The respondent testified that she did not discuss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic with anyone including her mother because she believed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he would hurt anyone she told. He said that he had people</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">everywhere. She did not tell the police in Belgrade about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic because she believed that the police were corrupt. At</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the end of March the respondent decided to run away to stop</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anything more from happening. She told her mother that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wanted to leave Belgrade because she couldn't watch the war</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anymore. Her mother arranged for the respondent to go to Crete</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where she could stay with friends who would help her find</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">work. The respondent was supposed to depart for Greece around</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">April 15. However, she changed her mind about going to Greece</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after Mirkovic began to make threats about her mother. She was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">afraid to leave her mother alone.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] On April 21, Mirkovic approached her while she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">walking her dog. He pushed her against the wall and stuck a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">needle in her arm. She began to bleed. Mirkovic laughed and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tried to &quot;suck her blood&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The next day, April 22, Mirkovic grabbed the respondent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">again while she was walking her dog, and burned her arm with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lighter. He told her that he would do anything he wanted with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her. He warned her not to run away and told her that if she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was &quot;not good&quot; he would hurt her mother. Dr. Philip Berger,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Chief of the Department of Family Medicine at Wellesley</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hospital and an expert in burn marks and deliberate burns</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified for the defence. On May 6, 1994, Dr. Berger examined</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two burn marks on the respondent's left shoulder. In his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion, the burns were 10 to 14 days old, which was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistent with the respondent's evidence that the burns were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">caused on April 22. Dr. Berger also testified that the burn</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marks were consistent either with the respondent's description</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of how they were caused or with self-inflicted burns.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] On April 23 the respondent left her apartment to go buy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">something. Mirkovic accosted her and took her into an alleyway</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where he injected a substance into her. He told her &quot;you see,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">you are my property, I can do whatever I want with you.&quot; The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent returned home and became ill. She testified that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when she was injected she smelled an odour similar to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">odour of the heroin seized from her possession.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] On April 25, 1994 Mirkovic called the respondent and told</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her to meet him in 30 minutes at the Slavia Hotel. He told her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;to pack [her] stuff and to be there.&quot; She packed up some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">things and left for the hotel without telling her mother where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she was going. When she met Mirkovic at the hotel he took her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into a women's washroom and strapped the three packages of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heroin to her body using an elastic bandage. He told her she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be travelling to Canada and not to &quot;joke with him.&quot; She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said that she could not do it but he told her he did not care</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what she thought. He said that if she did not do what he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wanted he would &quot;do something to her mother.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Mirkovic gave the respondent a bus ticket from Belgrade</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Budapest. He also gave her the false passport and some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">money. He instructed the respondent to travel to Budapest, buy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a plane ticket to Athens and then travel to Athens. When she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrived in Athens she was to buy a plane ticket to Toronto.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">When she arrived in Toronto she was to take a taxi to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Majestic Restaurant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The respondent arrived in Budapest early in the morning</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on April 26. She thought of returning home but did not do so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because she believed that Mirkovic would kill her. She bought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a plane ticket to Athens, spent the day in a cheap hotel and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">late that evening boarded the plane to Athens. Mirkovic had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not followed the respondent. She testified that she was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concerned for her own safety; she was concerned only for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">safety of her mother.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] She arrived in Athens at 2:00 a.m. on April 27. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that she did not know anyone in Athens. She said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that she could not go to the police in Athens because the only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">way to help her mother was to do what Mirkovic wanted. She</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">followed Mirkovic's instructions and purchased a plane ticket</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to Toronto but she went to the wrong airport, missed her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flight and had to exchange her ticket for the next available</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flight. Two days later, on April 29, 1994, the respondent left</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for Toronto.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] The respondent acknowledged that she knew what she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doing was illegal. She testified that she would never have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">come to Canada if she had another choice. She believed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the only way to help her mother was to do what Mirkovic asked.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">She admitted, however, that she lied to Canadian immigration</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers. She also acknowledged that she had ample opportunity</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on April 30, before she was caught, to return to Athens with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the body packs of heroin. She testified that she doubted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic would believe she had been denied entry into Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The respondent also explained that she could not get rid of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the drugs because Mirkovic would kill her or kill her mother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if he found out. She was asked by the Crown if she felt safer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">once she was out of Mirkovic's presence and she answered:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;from him? My mom was in danger. I didn't think about me</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (c)  The Theories of the Crown and the Defence

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] The Crown's theory was that the respondent became</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attracted to Mirkovic because of his money and power. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown alleged that the respondent started shooting up heroin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and burned herself with the lighter while she and Mirkovic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were stoned. The Crown also alleged that the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">volunteered to bring the heroin into Canada.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The respondent denied these allegations. She claimed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she brought the heroin into Canada under duress, because she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">feared her mother would be harmed if she did not comply with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mirkovic's demands. By their verdict the jury obviously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected the Crown's theory and agreed that Ms. Ruzic's story</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at least raised a reasonable doubt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (d)  The Trial Judge's Ruling and Charge to the Jury

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] At trial the respondent challenged the constitutionality</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of s.17 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge ruled that s.17</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violated s.7 of the Charter and could not be saved under s.1.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He gave the following reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             ... I could give reasons at great
          length but the reasons are really very
          simple. They are the reasons Mr. Justice
          Thomas gave in Parris, the reasons that
          Mr. Justice Fish gave in Langlois, and the
          duty in my view - not compulsion but duty
          of the trial judges in courts of similar
          jurisdiction - to be consistent with their
          rulings until a higher court has told them
          they are in error. That being the case I
          have charged the jury on the basis of the
          common law defence of duress as I
          understand it, and not on s.17.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In R. v. Langlois (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 28, Fish J.A. of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Quebec Court of Appeal held that s. 17 was unconstitutional</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because the statutory defence was restricted to threats of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediate death or bodily harm by a person who was present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the offence was committed. In Fish J.A.'s opinion, these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions permitted the conviction of a person who was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;morally blameless&quot; contrary to the principles of fundamental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justice in s. 7 of the Charter.1 In R. v. Parris (1992), 11</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.R.R. (2d) 376 (O.C.G.D.), Thomas J. applied similar</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Two: the threats were of such gravity
          or seriousness that the accused believed
          that the threats would be carried out.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Three: the threats were of such
          gravity that they might well have caused a
          reasonable person in the same situation as
          the accused, to act in the same manner she
          did.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             To put that another way, would a

          her age and her background, have responded
          to the threats.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] To put the constitutional issue in context, I will first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discuss the rationale for the defence of duress and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions on the availability of the defence under s. 17 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Criminal Code and at common law.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  The Rationale for the Defence of Duress

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] The defence of duress has been described as a concession</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to human frailty. It reflects the law's compassion for those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who have been forced by threats of death or bodily harm to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commit a criminal act that they would not otherwise have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">committed. In D.P.P. v. Lynch, [1975] A.C. 653 at 670 (H.L.),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lord Morris eloquently explained this basis for the defence:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... it is proper that any rational system
          of law should take fully into account the
          standards of honest and reasonable men. By
          those standards it is fair that actions
          and reactions may be tested. If then
          someone is really threatened with death or
          serious injury unless he does what he is
          told to do is the law to pay no heed to
          the miserable, agonizing plight of such a
          person? For the law to understand not only
          how the timid but also the stalwart may in
          a moment of crisis behave is not to make
          the law weak but to make it just. In the
          calm of the court-room measures of
          fortitude or of heroic behaviour are
          surely not to be demanded when they could
          not in moments for decision reasonably
          have been expected even of the resolute
          and the well disposed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In Canada, the rationale for the defence of duress</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">emerges from two important Supreme Court of Canada cases: R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Perka, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232 and R. v. Hibbert (1995), 99</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.). Neither was a Charter case. Perka</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discussed the rationale for the defence of necessity. Hibbert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied this rationale to the defence of duress.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Dickson J., who wrote the majority judgment in Perka,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied on the work of the American legal theorist, George</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fletcher, to make two points. First, Dickson J. adopted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fletcher's distinction between defences that are &quot;excuses&quot; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defences that are &quot;justifications.&quot; Dickson J. viewed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessity as an excuse. A person commits a wrongful act but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the act is excused because, realistically, it was unavoidable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Punishing unavoidable violations of the law would be unjust.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] Second, Dickson J. agreed with Fletcher that excuses like</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessity rest on the notion of &quot;moral or normative</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involuntariness.&quot; In using the word involuntariness, Dickson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. was not referring to the principle that, for criminal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability, the actus reus of the offence must be voluntary.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Instead, he meant that persons acting under necessity are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acting involuntarily because realistically they had no choice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but to break the law. In his view, the law should not punish</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actions that are morally involuntary. Dickson J. discussed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this rationale in a long passage at pp. 249-50:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             George Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal
          Law (1978), describes this view of
          necessity as &quot;compulsion of circumstance&quot;
          which description points to the conceptual
          link between necessity as an excuse and
          the familiar criminal law requirement that
          in order to engage criminal liability, the
          actions constituting the actus reus of an
          offence must be voluntary. Literally this
          voluntariness requirement simply refers to
          the need that the prohibited physical acts
          must have been under the conscious control
          of the actor. Without such control, there
          is, for purposes of the criminal law, no
          act. The excuse of necessity does not go
          to voluntariness in this sense. The lost
          alpinist who on the point of freezing to
          death breaks open an isolated mountain
          cabin is not literally behaving in an
          involuntary fashion. He has control over
          his actions to the extent of being
          physically capable of abstaining from the
          act. Realistically, however, his act is
          not a &quot;voluntary&quot; one. His &quot;choice&quot; to
          break the law is no true choice at all; it
          is remorselessly compelled by normal human
          instincts. This sort of involuntariness is
          often described as &quot;moral or normative
          involuntariness&quot;. Its place in criminal
          theory is described by Fletcher at pp. 804-
          05 as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                  The notion of voluntariness adds
             a valuable dimension to the theory of
             excuses. That conduct is involuntary -
             - even in the normative sense --
             explains why it cannot fairly be
             punished. Indeed, H.L.A. Hart builds
             his theory of excuses on the principle
             that the distribution of punishment
             should be reserved for those who
             voluntarily break the law. Of the
             arguments he advances for this
             principle of justice, the most
             explicit is that it is preferable to
             live in a society where we have the
             maximum opportunity to choose whether
             we shall become the subject of
             criminal liability. In addition, Hart
             intimates that it is ideologically
             desirable for the government to treat
             its citizens as self-actuating,
             choosing agents. This principle of
             respect for individual autonomy is
             implicitly confirmed whenever those
             who lack an adequate choice are
             excused for their offences.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             I agree with this formulation of the
          rationale for excuses in the criminal law.
          In my view this rationale extends beyond
          specific codified excuses and embraces the
          residual excuse known as the defence of
          necessity. At the heart of this defence is
          the perceived injustice of punishing
          violations of the law in circumstances in
          which the person had no other viable or
          reasonable choice available; the act was
          wrong but it is excused because it was
          realistically unavoidable.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             Punishment of such acts, as Fletcher
          notes at p. 813, can be seen as
          purposeless as well as unjust:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             ... involuntary conduct cannot be
             deterred and therefore it is pointless
             and wasteful to punish involuntary
             actors. This theory ... of pointless
             punishment, carries considerable
             weight in current Anglo-American legal
             thought.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Significantly, Dickson J. strictly limited the defence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessity to ensure that it would succeed only when a person's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct truly was morally involuntary. He imposed three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitations on the availability of the defence: a person must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">act &quot;in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril&quot;;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">compliance with the law must be &quot;demonstrably impossible,&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is, there must be &quot;no legal way out&quot;; and, because people</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be expected to withstand some pressure, the harm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inflicted in breaking the law must be less than the harm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sought to be avoided.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In Hibbert, the accused was charged with attempted murder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for his role in the shooting of one of his friends. He claimed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he was forced by an armed man whom he knew to be a drug</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealer to lure his friend to the lobby of an apartment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">building where the dealer shot his friend several times. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused testified that he did not want to help the drug dealer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but he did so because he feared for his life. Because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused knew that the drug dealer intended to kill his friend,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he would have been guilty of attempted murder as a party but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for his defence of duress. At trial, the accused was acquitted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of attempted murder but convicted of the included offence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aggravated assault. This court dismissed the accused's appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but the Supreme Court of Canada allowed his further appeal and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordered a new trial because the trial judge had misdirected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury on mens rea and duress.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Hibbert established two propositions. First, ordinarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duress does not negate the mens rea of an offence. Duress is a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">true defence. It relieves a person of criminal liability after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that person has committed the actus reus of the offence with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the necessary mens rea. According to Lamer C.J.C., at p. 205:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;As a practical matter, though, situations where duress will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operate to &quot;negate&quot; mens rea will be exceptional, for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">simple reason that the types of mental states that are capable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of being &quot;negated&quot; by duress are not often found in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definitions of criminal offences.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] Second, Hibbert established that the defence of duress,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">like the defence of necessity, is an excuse based on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rationale of moral involuntariness. The court was of the view</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that &quot;the similarities between the two defences are so great</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that consistency and logic requires that they be understood as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">based on the same juristic principles&quot; (at p.224). The main</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difference between the two defences is the source of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threat: in duress, the threat comes from a third party; in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessity, the threat comes from another cause. Thus, as Lamer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.J.C. observed, duress is a particular application of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence of necessity.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Just as the court in Perka limited the availability of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defence of necessity, the court in Hibbert similarly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited the availability of the defence of duress. It did so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by holding that the defence is unavailable if the accused had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a safe avenue of escape. If the accused had a safe avenue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">escape or a legal way out, the accused's conduct was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">morally involuntary. As Lamer C.J.C. explained at pp. 224-25:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The rule that the defence of duress is
          unavailable if a &quot;safe avenue of escape&quot;
          was open to the accused is simply a
          specific instance of this general
          requirement -- if the accused could have
          escaped without undue danger, the decision
          to commit an offence becomes, as Dickson
          J. observed in the context of necessity,
          &quot;a voluntary one, impelled by some
          consideration beyond the dictates of
          necessity and human instincts&quot;.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Hibbert, which dealt with duress at common law, therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">focuses on whether a realistic choice or a safe avenue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">escape existed as the measure of moral involuntariness. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">focus on a safe avenue of escape highlights a key difference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the statutory and the common law defence.</font></pre>

          excused for committing the offence if the
          person believes that the threats will be
          carried out and if the person is not a
          party to a conspiracy or association
          whereby the person is subject to
          compulsion, but this section does not
          apply where the offence that is committed
          is high treason or treason, murder,
          piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault,
          sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Paquette, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] The accused in Carker was an inmate who participated in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prison riot and was charged with mischief for wilfully</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damaging public property. He relied on the defence of duress,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claiming that he had committed the offence because other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inmates threatened to kill or seriously injure him. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme Court said he could not rely on s. 17 for two reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was not threatened with immediate death or bodily harm</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because the threatening inmates were locked up in separate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cells when they made the threats; and the threatening inmates</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were not in the accused's cell and therefore were not present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when he committed the offence. Professor Stuart has commented</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that &quot;only an extreme literalist would suggest that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation in Carker was demanded by the wording of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">section&quot;: Stuart at pp. 430-31.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] The court did say in Carker that s. 17 &quot;codified and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exhaustively defined&quot; the law of duress. But the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retreated from that position in Paquette. In Paquette, two men</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">robbed a convenience store and, during the robbery, one of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">men shot and killed an innocent bystander. Mr. Paquette was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not present during the robbery and the shooting but the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claimed that he was an accomplice and he was charged as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party to non-capital murder. He said that he only participated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the robbery because he had been threatened with death. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not, however, rely on s. 17 because murder and robbery</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are excluded offences. But the court held that s. 17 applies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only to persons who commit offences themselves, that is, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principals. It does not apply to persons who commit offences</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as parties. Persons charged as parties can rely on the common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law defence which, in Canada, does not exclude any offence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from its reach. See also R. v. Curran (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d)</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The decision in Paquette might well have been intended to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">blunt the harsh effect of s. 17, but, together with Carker and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the language of s. 17 itself, it has produced a law of duress</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Canada that has been severely criticized by many legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">scholars. Several of the criticisms are collected and referred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to by Fish J.A. in Langlois at p. 37 C our law of duress has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been described as irrational, anomalous, perverse, illogical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and fundamentally wrong.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] Whether or not these criticisms are justified, under our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">current law the statutory defence, as interpreted by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme Court of Canada, cannot be invoked by persons whose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct might well be thought to raise a legitimate claim of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duress. Section 17 will not protect a person who acts under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threats of future harm even though the threat acts on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person's mind and deprives the person of any realistic choice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but to commit the offence. Nor will s. 17 ordinarily protect a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">person who commits a criminal offence for fear of harm or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">death to a child or other member of the family. Even if s. 17</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">embraces threats to harm third parties, in the typical hostage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, the threatener is not present when the criminal offence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is committed. Usually, the threatener has taken the child</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hostage at a location far removed from the scene of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offence and threatens to kill the child unless the parent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commits the crime. Although the pressure to commit the offence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is overwhelming and understandable when one's child is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threatened, s. 17 is unavailable to the parent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] On the evidence of Ms. Ruzic, the present case is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">similar. Although Ms. Ruzic's mother was not physically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrained, she was threatened with future harm or death</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unless her daughter imported the drugs to Canada. The threat</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not of immediate harm and the threatener was not present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when Ms. Ruzic committed the offence. But according to Ms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ruzic she committed the offence because the police in Serbia</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not protect her or her mother and she had no other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">realistic option. Although her evidence raised a defence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duress, s. 17 was not available to her.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] The common law defence of duress, with its focus on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">safe avenue of escape test, is less restrictive and more</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flexible. The common law defence is available though the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">threatener is not present when the offence is committed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">though the threat is of future, not of immediate harm and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">though the threatened harm is directed at a family member, not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the accused. See R. v. Hudson, [1971] 2 Q.B. 202 (C.A.),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hibbert, Langlois, R. v. Morrison (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 447</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Ont. D.C.) and Kent Roach, Criminal Law (1996) p.188. Indeed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Hibbert, at p. 205, Lamer C.J.C. uses the case of a person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who is told that his or her child is being held hostage at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">another location and will be killed unless the person robs a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank as an example of duress at common law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] Admittedly, if the threat is not of immediate harm and if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the threatener is not present when the offence is committed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the accused will more likely have a safe avenue of escape by,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for example, seeking the protection of the police. But the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hostage example and Ms. Ruzic's plight show that the immediacy</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and presence requirements are not invariably substitutes for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lack of a safe avenue of escape or the lack of a realistic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">choice. As Martin J.A. observed in R. v. Mena (1987), 34</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.C.C. (3d) 304 at 319-23 (Ont. C.A.), &quot;the existence of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">safe avenue of escape is the operative test&quot; and &quot;whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused had failed to avail himself of an opportunity to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">escape, which was reasonably open to him, is a question for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury.&quot; Martin J.A. noted that &quot;the common sense of a jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may be relied upon to reject spurious defences of duress&quot; (at</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.  Is Section 17 of the Criminal Code Unconstitutional?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] The constitutionality of s. 17 of the Code raises several</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues, most of them difficult. A threshold issue is whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 17 should be subjected to constitutional review or whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the scope of the defence should be left to Parliament and to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statutory interpretation by the courts. If the restrictions in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 17 are reviewable under the Charter, a second issue is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the proposition that Parliament may not limit defences</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to permit the conviction of persons whose conduct is morally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involuntary should be treated in the same way as the accepted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle of fundamental justice that Parliament may not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">define offences to permit the conviction of the morally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">innocent or morally blameless. If convicting persons whose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct is morally involuntary violates a principle of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fundamental justice, a third issue is whether s. 17 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Code permits such convictions. A fourth issue C and a possible</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alternate ground of unconstitutionality C is whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions in s. 17 are so arbitrary or unfair that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violate s. 7 of the Charter. A fifth issue is whether any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">violation of s. 7 can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The final issue is what remedy the court should order if s.17</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contravenes the Charter. I will address each of these issues.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  Constitutional Review of a Statutory Defence under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Charter.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] The federal Crown, supported by the provincial Crown,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">urged this court to resist the temptation to subject s. 17 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Code to Charter scrutiny. Their argument has two branches:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first, made by the federal Crown, is that the language of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 17 can be broadly interpreted by the courts to conform to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the common law elements of duress; the second branch of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument, made by both Crowns, is that although the definition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a criminal offence may be reviewed under s. 7 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Charter, the scope of a statutory defence is a matter solely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for Parliament.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] The federal Crown submits that the immediacy and presence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions in s. 17 of the Code are proxies for the safe</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">avenue of escape test at common law. Mr. Michaelson, on behalf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the Attorney General of Canada, argued that, if broadly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpreted, s. 17 conforms to the common law defence and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court should strive for an interpretation that avoids a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">declaration of unconstitutionality.2 Mr. Trotter, on behalf of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Attorney General of Ontario, parts company with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">federal Crown on this question. He acknowledges that the scope</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the duress defence under s. 17 and at common law are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same, and that the common law is more favourable to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused. I agree with Mr. Trotter. The Supreme Court of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada's interpretation of s. 17 in Carker and Paquette</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precludes at least a provincial appellate court from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpreting the section more broadly or more flexibly: see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Langlois, supra, at pp. 37-38. A more expansive interpretation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of s. 17 must come from the Supreme Court itself. But, in my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, interpreting s.17 to conform to the common law defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would strain the words of the section.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Moreover, the facts of this case prove Mr. Trotter's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">point. All parties to this appeal acknowledge that if the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was charged on s. 17 of the Code, they could not acquit Ms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ruzic. Neither she nor her mother was threatened with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediate harm or death and her threatener was not present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when she committed the offence of importing heroin. Although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the threatened harm was not immediate or imminent, Ms. Ruzic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that it was nonetheless a real threat, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">profoundly affected her. Although her threatener was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present when she committed the offence, she testified that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was still in a position to carry out his threat. Ms. Ruzic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believed that neither she nor the police could protect her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother. Ms. Ruzic's circumstances show that the immediacy and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presence restrictions in s. 17 of the Code cannot always be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equated with the lack of a safe avenue escape. Thus, Ms. Ruzic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not raise a defence of duress under s. 17; she could,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, plead this defence under common law principles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Whether her defence was believed was a question for the jury.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] A more troubling question is whether the scope of s. 17 C</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no matter how narrow or broad C should be for Parliament to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decide and not for the court to review under the Charter.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actus reus and mens rea of an offence C has a constitutional</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability after a person has committed the actus reus of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offence and ordinarily with the necessary mens rea. The courts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have consistently called for deference to Parliament's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determination of the scope of statutory defences because</font></pre>

          inquiry. The real concern is not whether
          the accused must disprove an element or
          prove an excuse, but that an accused may
          be convicted while a reasonable doubt
          exists. When that possibility exists,
          there is a breach of the presumption of

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          the principles of fundamental justice.



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] Like Professor Shaffer, I do not see why the notion of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moral blameworthiness should be restricted to the mens rea of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a criminal offence. Actions taken in defence can make a person</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">morally blameless despite the presence of mens rea. A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction does not automatically follow a finding that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accused committed the actus reus of the offence with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessary mens rea. For example, persons who act in self-</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acquittal because they are justified in protecting themselves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from aggression. Persons who act in self-defence are not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">morally blameworthy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] The defence of duress is similar to the defence of self-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence. Duress forms part of the law of necessity and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">self-defence and moral blameworthiness are linked because self-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence is &quot;rooted in one of criminal law's core values, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protection of autonomy ... the criminal law recognizes that in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some very limited circumstances, one is entitled to commit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what would ordinarily be a criminal offence in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protect autonomy.&quot; In Chaulk McLachlin J. made the same point</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] Persons acting in self-defence are allowed to use force,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">even to kill, to protect their autonomy. They do not have a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are not morally blameworthy. Similarly, persons who commit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criminal offences under duress are not acting autonomously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because they do not have a realistic choice. They, too, are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not morally blameworthy and therefore punishing them for their</font></pre>

          the state's interest (whatever it may be),
          it seems to me that a breach of
          fundamental justice will be made out, as
          the individual's rights will have been
          deprived for no valid purpose. This is, to
          my mind, essentially the type of analysis
          which E. Colvin advocates in his article
          &quot;Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of
          Rights and Freedoms&quot;, 68 Can. Bar Rev. 560
          (1989), and which was carried out in
          Morgentaler. That is, both Dickson C.J.C.
          and Beetz J. were of the view that at
          least some of the restrictions placed upon
          access to abortion had no relevance to the
          state objective of protecting the foetus
          while protecting the life and health of
          the mother. In that regard the
          restrictions were arbitrary or unfair. It
          follows that before one can determine that
          a statutory provision is contrary to
          fundamental justice, the relationship
          between the provision and the state
          interest must be considered. One cannot
          conclude that a particular limit is
          arbitrary because (in the words of my
          colleague, McLachlin J.) &quot;it bears no
          relation to, or is inconsistent with, the
          objective that lies behind&quot; the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and presence restrictions s. 17 of the Criminal Code denies</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this defence arbitrarily and unfairly and therefore infringes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 7 of the Charter.



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (e)  Is Section 17 Saved by Section 1 of the Charter?

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] Having concluded that s. 17 of the Criminal Code violates</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 7 of the Charter, I now consider whether the violation can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be justified under s. 1. In my view, it cannot be so justified</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for three reasons. First, the Crown has the onus to justify an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">infringement of the Charter and, in this case, neither the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">federal nor the provincial Crown offered a s. 1 justification.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[97] Second, although in principle s. 7 violations may be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified under s. 1, I am not aware of any Supreme Court of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada case in which a deprivation of the right to life,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liberty or security of the person not in accord with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles of fundamental justice has been held to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified under s. 1. Indeed, in R. v. Heywood (1994), 94</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 523 (S.C.C.), Cory J., for the majority,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubted whether a s. 7 violation could ever be justified under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 1, except, perhaps, during a war or other national</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">emergency.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[98] Third, the restrictions on the defence of duress in s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">17, which violate s. 7 of the Charter, do not satisfy the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proportionality component of the Oakes test for s. 1. I will</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assume that the objective of the &quot;immediacy&quot; and &quot;presence&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictions in s. 17 is to limit the defence of duress to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases of moral involuntariness. That is a &quot;pressing and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">substantial&quot; objective, which meets the first component of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Oakes. But the &quot;immediacy&quot; and &quot;presence&quot; restrictions fail</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the proportionality component. They are not rationally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">connected to the objective and they do not impair an accused's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 7 rights as little as possible. Limiting the defence to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases where the accused had no safe avenue of escape is a less</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictive alternative. Therefore the violation of s.7 is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified under s.1.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] For these reasons I agree with the trial judge and with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Fish J.A. in Langlois that s. 17 of the Criminal Code</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[108]     In the impugned passage, the trial judge invited the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury to consider Ms. Ruzic's personal circumstances, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were highly unusual and highly relevant. Later in his charge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge emphasized that the existence of a safe avenue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of escape must be looked at objectively, though taking into</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In my view, his instruction conformed to the Supreme Court's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision in Hibbert. Therefore, I would not give effect to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">E.  Conclusion

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[109]     For these reasons, I agree with the trial judge and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with the Quebec Court of Appeal in Langlois that s. 17 of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Criminal Code violates the Charter because it infringes s. 7</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and is not saved by s. 1. I would declare s.17 of no force or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect to the extent that it prevents an accused from relying</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the common law defence of duress preserved by s.8(3) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Code. I also find no error in the trial judge's charge to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury on the common law of duress. Accordingly, I would dismiss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown's appeal.

  1 Fish J.A. also concluded that s. 17 was unconstitutional
because certain offences were excluded from the reach of the
defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  2 Of course, common law rules themselves may be reviewable
under the Charter. But the respondent, Ms. Ruzic, did not
challenge the constitutionality of the common law elements of
the defence of duress. See R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654
and R. v. Daviault (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
