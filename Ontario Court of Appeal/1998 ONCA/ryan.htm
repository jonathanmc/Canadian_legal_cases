    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  At the commencement of the hearing, the appellant sought

leave to file a fresh factum which raised an issue that had not

been raised in first instance or in the Notice of Appeal. Counsel

for the respondent indicated that she was prepared to address

this issue. Hence leave was granted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  The appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence

before the trial judge to prove the alleged act of bankruptcy and

seeks a new trial on this basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  In our view, there was ample evidence to support the trial

judge's finding that the appellant had ceased to meet his

liabilities generally as they became due within the six months

next preceding the date of the filing of the petition, within the

meaning of s.42(1)(j) of the Bankrupcy Act. There was evidence of

a substantial judgment in favour of the petitioning creditor and

evidence of two other judgments which remained unsatisfied and in

respect of which writs of execution were filed. Furthermore, the

debtor did not dispute that he had ceased to meet his liabilities

generally as they became due and led no evidence on this issue at

the trial. His dispute, rather, was entirely focussed on the

validity of the judgment in favour of the judgment creditor, an

issue that is not raised on this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  Having regard to the manner in which the case was presented

to the trial judge and the evidence before him, we are of the

view that he was entirely justified in granting the petition.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
