    <pre><b><font face="Courier New" size="3">FINLAYSON J.A.:</font></b></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted before Reilly J. of the Ontario
Court (General Division) of sexual touching of a person under the
age of 14 pursuant to s. 151 of the Criminal Code, invitation to
sexual touching of a person in a relationship of dependency
pursuant to s. 153, engaging in anal intercourse pursuant to
s. 159, and of  invitation to sexual touching of  a person under
the age of 14 years pursuant to s. 152.  He received a sentence
of five years for the anal intercourse conviction and four years
for the other three convictions. All four sentences were to be
served concurrently. He appeals the conviction for anal
intercourse only.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  All the sexual activity embraced by the four convictions
took place between the appellant and his stepson commencing in
the summer of 1991, that is, when the complainant was under
fourteen years of age, and terminating in 1993 when he was over
fourteen. The activity included fellatio, mutual masturbation,
and anal intercourse, some of which was reciprocal. For much of
the period covered by the indictment, these incidents occurred on
virtually a day to day basis. It is not clear on the evidence or
from the reasons of the trial judge when the anal intercourse
commenced relative to the stepson's fourteenth birthday.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  It is conceded by the Crown that the conviction for anal
intercourse under s. 159 of the Code cannot stand, as section 159
has been ruled unconstitutional by this court because it is
violative of section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms (&quot;Charter&quot;): see R. v. M. (C.) (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d)
481 (Ont. C.A.). However, the Crown asks this court to exercise
its jurisdiction under s. 683(1)(g) of the Code to amend the
indictment to conform to the evidence and to substitute for the
original count of anal intercourse a count in the following
language:
                    and further, that between the 1st
          day of June, 1991 and the 31st day of
          October, 1992, at the City of Cambridge, in
          the Province of Ontario, he did sexually
          assault Wesley Resendes (Santos), to wit: by
          engaging in acts of anal intercourse with
          Wesley Resendes (Santos), contrary to the
          Criminal Code.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Crown relies upon R. v. Irwin (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d)
316 (Ont. C.A.) as authority for the proposition that
s. 683(1)(g) of the Criminal Code provides that a court of appeal
may amend the indictment to charge a different offence unless it
is of the opinion that the accused has been misled or prejudiced
in his defence or appeal. In the opinion of Doherty J.A.,
speaking for the court, there is no reason why the scope of the
power to amend on appeal should be different from the scope of
the power to amend at trial. Like the power given to trial judges
by s. 601 of the Criminal Code, the power to amend on appeal
reaches defects in substance or form, and variations between the
evidence and the charge. Broad powers of amendment at the trial
and appellate stages promote the determination of criminal cases
on their merits, and avoid a multiplicity of proceedings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There are two reasons why Irwin has no application to this
appeal. First, the count charging anal intercourse was an
absolute nullity and therefore there is no power to amend either
in the trial court or the court of appeal. In any event, this is
not one of those rare cases where an amendment to charge a new
offence on appeal should be made.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In striking down section 159, in  R. v. (M.) C., supra, the
majority of this court agreed with the concession of the Crown on
appeal that s. 159 drew a distinction upon the ground of age and
that this distinction was discriminatory in that a person under
the age of eighteen could not, without the risk of criminal
prosecution and potential liability to imprisonment for up to ten
years, engage in acts of anal intercourse with a person eighteen
years of age or older. This distinction based on age could not be
justified under s. 1. Notwithstanding the narrow ground of
discrimination found by the majority, the decision of the court
was to &quot;declare s. 159 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and
effect&quot;. See also R. v. Roy (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 442 (Que.
C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The question before this court is to determine what the
legal effect is of such a declaration upon the appellant's
conviction for anal intercourse. Is the verdict in appeal from a
law that is &quot;of no force and effect&quot; a nullity or is it merely
voidable? The case law does not appear to have addressed this
question directly. In R. v. Moore (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 289
(S.C.C.), the Court dealt with the power of a trial judge to
amend a defective information. In this case the defect was a
failure to set out an essential averment. The case really turned
on whether quashing a defective information that could have been
amended and resulted in a verdict on the amended indictment gave
rise to the plea of autrefois acquit. The court was divided, with
Lamer J. writing for the majority and Dickson C.J.C for the
minority. At p. 311, Lamer J. stated:
                    Since the enactment of our Code in
          1892 there has been, through case-law and
          punctual amendments to s. 529 and its
          predecessor sections, a gradual shift from
          requiring judges to quash to requiring them
          to amend in the stead; in fact there remains
          little discretion to quash. Of course, if the
          charge is an absolute nullity, an occurrence
          the condition of which the Chief Justice has
          set out clearly in his reasons, no cure is
          available as the matter goes to the very
          jurisdiction of the judge. In such a case the
          doctrines of autrefois acquit is never a bar
          to the relaying of the charge because the
          accused was never in jeopardy and the
          disposition of the charge through quashing
          was for lack of jurisdiction.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  It is implicit in the above passage and the similar
discussion of the issue by Dickson C.J.C. at p. 297 of Moore,
supra, that a count in an information or indictment that is an
absolute nullity cannot be amended either at trial or in the
court of appeal notwithstanding the wide powers of amendment in
[now] ss. 601 and 683(1)(g) of the Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appellant was convicted of an unconstitutional offence,
one that he should not have been charged with in the first place
because it did not exist at law. No cure is available because the
matter goes to the very jurisdiction of the court. Contrary to
the Crown's submission, the conviction on this count is a
nullity. Prejudice to the appellant does not enter into the
discussion. The appropriate disposition is to quash the verdict
of guilty and substitute a verdict of acquittal on this one
count.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Moreover, even if the count charging the s. 159 offence was
not an absolute nullity and was capable of amendment, this is not
one of those rare cases where an amendment charging a new offence
can properly be made on appeal. In this reasons in Irwin, supra,
Doherty J.A. introduced the following important caveat at p. 331:
                    Cases where an amendment
          substituting a different offence for the
          offence charged at trial can be properly made
          on appeal will be few and far between. I
          think this is one of those rare cases where
          the amendment can be made. While the
          amendment changes the substantive offence
          from assault causing bodily harm (s. 267) to
          unlawfully causing bodily harm (s. 269), the
          amendment does no more than put a new label
          on the appellant's culpable conduct. The
          substance of the allegation remains
          unchanged. I would amend the indictment to
          charge the appellant with unlawfully causing
          bodily harm to Andrew Behling and dismiss the
          appeal.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The Crown submits that there is but one issue in this case
and that is whether the appellant would suffer any prejudice from
the amendment. As counsel puts it in his factum: &quot;[T]he ultimate
question for the Court is how does the proposed amendment impact
on the ability of the accused (or the appellant) to respond to
the allegation against himY&quot;. In addition to Irwin, supra, he
relies upon an unreported endorsement of this court in R. v.
King, released April 27, 1998; [1998] O.J. No. 1817. In the
submission of the Crown, the acts disclosed here fully justify
the amendment sought, as the appellant  had the opportunity to
respond to all the charges by testifying and denying that any
sexual activity, not just anal intercourse, took place. While
consent is a defence to sexual assault, it is not a realistic
consideration in this particular case. There is, submits the
Crown, no air of reality to such a defence on these facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] With respect, this misses the point. An accused person is
entitled, under s. 11(a) of the Charter to be informed of the
specific offence with which he is charged. Having completed the
trial on the basis that he was facing a conviction for a specific
crime, a crime that this court later determined was not
constitutionally valid and accordingly did not exist, the
appellant is entitled to have his conviction quashed. If the
Crown wishes to try him on the offence set out in the proposed
amendment, it is in a position to do so by laying a new charge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In my opinion, it cannot be said that to permit an amendment
on these facts would merely &quot;put a new label on the appellant's
culpable conduct&quot;, in the words of Doherty, J.A. in Irwin, supra.
The offence of anal intercourse has its origin in the offence of
buggery that in turn is predicated on the biblical sin of sodomy.
It is an offence which had carried its own particular stigma and
for which consent was no defence. Its antecedent or related
offences of buggery and sodomy were of a different type or order
than the other sexual offences as is illustrated by the comments
of Wilson J., in R. v Hess (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.) at
181:
               The legislature has concluded that
          sodomy and buggery are forms of penetration
          which should be dealt with separatelyYOnce
          again, we are faced with distinctions aimed
          at biologically different acts that go to the
          heart of society's morality, and involve
          considerations of policy.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] R. v. Barbeau  (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) is closer
to our situation than Moore, supra, but by no means dispositive
of it. Here the accused was charged with a sexual assault alleged
to have occurred in 1982; however, the provision of the Code
creating this offence was not proclaimed in force until January
1983. After the preliminary hearing which committed the accused
for trial, the accused successfully applied for an order quashing
the indictment on the basis that he was charged with an offence
not known to the law. The Crown then laid a fresh indictment
charging him with the offence of indecent assault. The accused
argued that this indictment was invalid because the preliminary
inquiry had been void ab initio. Cory J., speaking for the court,
stated at pp. 136-37:
               The original indictment charging sexual
          assault rather than indecent assault was
          valid in every respect except for the
          nomenclature used to identify the offence.
          The parties proceeded throughout the
          preliminary inquiry on the assumption it was
          valid. The evidence identified the actions
          which constituted the incidents of sexual
          assault or indecent assault, depending on the
          title used to identify the touching or
          fondling. The actions were the same; the
          evidence was the same. The testimony given at
          the preliminary inquiry constituted a prima
          facie case that the accused had committed an
          offence described as indecent assault prior
          to January 4, 1983, and sexual assault
          thereafter.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In the circumstances the error in
          the &quot;labelling&quot; or title of the offence
          constituted a voidable error and not one that
          was void. The situation might be different if
          an entirely new offence had been instituted
          by the legislation of January 4, 1983. For
          example, if it was only after that date that
          &quot;air piracy&quot; was declared an offence, then an
          indictment alleging that the accused had
          committed air piracy prior to that date would
          be void as it would not disclose a crime
          known to the law at the relevant time.
          Similarly, in this case, if the evidence
          adduced at the preliminary hearing had
          established a prima facie case of sexual
          assault, but not that of indecent assault,
          then the indictment would have been void as
          it would not have disclosed an offence known
          to the law at the relevant time. It follows
          that, in the circumstances of this case, it
          was in order for the Crown to present a fresh
          indictment which conformed to the evidence
          adduced at a preliminary hearing whose
          validity had not been challenged. The Crown,
          at that point, proceeded in accordance with
          s. 574(1) of the Criminal Code: see Re
          McKibbon and The Queen (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d)
          193, 6 D.L.R. (4th) 1, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 131;
          R. v. Copeland (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 186
          (B.C C.A.).
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] I do not see the issue in this appeal as one of mere
&quot;labelling&quot;, or &quot;nomenclature&quot;. The appellant was charged with an
offence with a specific delict and one to which the defence of
consent was not available. As noted by Wilson J. in Ness, supra,
the offence of which the appellant was convicted is in a
different moral or conceptual category to the one the Crown now
offers in substitution. The Crown must have thought so too. It
was not obliged to charge the appellant under s. 159 of the Code.
It could have charged him, as it now proposes, with sexual
assault and relied upon the anal intercourse as the averment. The
Crown presumably proceeded under s. 159 because it perceived some
tactical advantage from not having to negative consent, or
because it was seeking a conviction that carried a special
stigma. The trial judge gave effect to this latter consideration
by imposing a sentence of five years for this conviction for anal
intercourse as opposed to his sentences of four years for the
sexual activities embraced by the other convictions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] I do not think that Irwin, supra, applies to this case. In
Irwin, Doherty J.A. was dealing with two constitutionally valid
criminal charges, one of which was in Doherty J.A.'s view more
applicable to the culpable conduct of the accused than the other.
As he pointed out, the cases where such an amendment can be made
on appeal will be few and far between. In my opinion, this is not
such a case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] So far as this court's unreported disposition in King,
supra, is concerned, I do not think that it has any precedential
value. There, the appellant appeared in person and wanted to
abandon his appeal. Nonetheless, the court, without giving
reasons, decided to quash Acounts in the indictment which cannot
stand, being counts for buggery&quot;. One count was then amended to
charge an act of gross indecency without averring a specific
sexual act. Since there was no change in the sentence, the
appellant, if he thought about it at all, must have regarded the
downgrading of the stigma attached to his conviction as a bonus.
While the endorsement made reference to Irwin, supra, there was
nothing to indicate why the case was being extended to substitute
a different conviction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Accordingly, I would quash the verdict of guilty on the
count of anal intercourse. Since the appellant was never in
jeopardy, a new charge of sexual assault would not be barred by
autrefois acquit. However, in the light of the ongoing sentences
for the counts not under review, the Crown might give some
consideration to exercising its discretion in favour of not
laying such a charge.  As I previously indicated, the trial judge
sentenced the appellant to five years on the anal intercourse
count, and four years on the other counts, all four sentences to
be served concurrently. There is no appeal from sentence by the
Crown or the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Disposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction for anal
intercourse and enter a verdict of acquittal.
