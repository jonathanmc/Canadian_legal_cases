lang=EN-US>      On March 18, 1982, the
    appellant armed himself with a revolver and a quantity of ammunition and
    entered Courtroom 4 at Osgoode Hall in Toronto.  Although the appellant would later claim that he came to the
    courtroom to commit suicide, he was observed to walk deliberately towards the
    front of the courtroom where he shot and killed two men and seriously wounded a
    third.  The appellant left the courtroom
    and ultimately left Canada.  He was
    eventually arrested in India in 1990 and extradited to Canada in 1992.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Upon his return to Canada
    the appellant stood trial on two counts of first degree murder and one count of
    attempted murder.  The appellant chose
    to represent himself on the trial for these most serious of offences.  The various judges of the Ontario Court
    General Division who dealt with the appellant, including the trial judge, Then
    J., were concerned that the appellant should receive a fair trial.  They also wished to ensure that the legal
    issues that might arise would be properly argued so that the trial was
    conducted according to law.  Accordingly, prior to trial, a lawyer who had briefly acted for the
    appellant was appointed <i>amicus curiae</i>.  As well, the trial judge permitted two
    lawyers to act as legal advisers to the appellant.  These lawyers gave him advice throughout the trial, argued some
    of the legal issues, and conducted parts of the defence, including the closing
    jury address.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Notwithstanding this
    array of legal advice and the elaborate steps taken by the trial judge to
    ensure a fair trial conducted according to law, the appellant now argues that
    he was deprived of a fair trial because the court appointed his former lawyer
    as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  The appellant also complains about the
    conduct of Crown counsel in cross-examining an important defence expert witness
    and the charge to the jury on reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      In my view, the appellant
    received a fair trial untainted by any reversible error and I would dismiss
    this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><b><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Only a very brief summary
    of the facts of the offences is necessary in view of the grounds of
    appeal.  In January and February 1982,
    disputes arose in the Shromani Sikh Society in Toronto relating to the voting
    registration process to elect the executive for the Temple.  The election was scheduled for March 1982
    and the appellant was a candidate for an executive position.  The appellant alleged that there were
    various irregularities in the process for registering voters.  The appellant believed that Amarjit Singh
    Tatla was responsible for these irregularities.  The appellant retained counsel who obtained an <i>ex parte</i> interim injunction on March 8,
    1982 to enjoin the election until a proper voters’ list was prepared.  The case was to return to court on March 18,
    1982 to determine whether the injunction should be continued.  Prior to March 18, 1982, the appellant had
    discussions with Tatla and others and there was evidence that he believed the
    issue had been settled.  In fact, there
    was no settlement and a hearing commenced the morning of March 18th before the
    Honourable Mr. Justice Osler.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The appellant was not in
    the courtroom when the hearing began.  Just prior to the lunch break, Osler J. suggested that the parties
    attempt to settle the case over the lunch hour.  The appellant came to the courthouse in response to a call from
    his lawyer and met briefly with his lawyer.  He appeared agitated and seems to have gained the impression that the
    case was not going well.  The parties,
    including the appellant, re-entered the courtroom shortly after 2:00 p.m. and
    the hearing proceeded.  At some point in
    the proceedings, the appellant left the courthouse and went to his car where he
    retrieved a revolver and ammunition.  He
    returned to the courtroom and as soon as the judge gave judgment dissolving the
    injunction, the appellant shot and wounded Tatla and shot and killed Oscar
    Fonseca, Tatla’s lawyer, and Bhupinder Singh Pannu, an associate of Tatla’s.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      As indicated, it was the
    appellant’s evidence that he had originally returned to the courtroom with the
    intention of committing suicide.  There
    was evidence that the appellant was under a great deal of pressure as a result
    of a number of personal problems.  The
    appellant had recently been fired from his job.  He was under considerable financial pressure.  The appellant was active within the
    community helping Sikh refugee claimants and his wife believed that he was
    spending too much time on this work and not devoting enough time to his
    family.  He testified that on the
    morning of the shooting, his wife had given him an ultimatum that he must
    either spend more time with his family or she would divorce him.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The defence argued that
    at the time of the shootings the appellant was in an altered state of mind and
    was incapable of planning and deliberation.  The defence also argued that the defence of provocation was available to
    the appellant as a result of an alleged insulting gesture made by Tatla towards
    the appellant in the courtroom.  The
    defence called a psychologist and psychiatrist to provide evidence about the
    appellant’s state of mind.  The
    psychiatrist, Dr. Cooper, testified that the appellant had a history of
    depression and suffered from a personality disorder, a combination of a
    paranoid personality and a borderline personality.  Dr. Cooper testified that a person with a borderline personality
    could have “breaks with reality” as the stresses increased.  Dr.&nbsp;Malcolm, a psychiatrist retained by
    the Crown, agreed that the appellant suffered from a personality disorder but
    it was his opinion that the appellant was capable of planning and deliberation
    and knew what he was doing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was represented by
    counsel, Mr. Roach, at his preliminary inquiry.  However, on a motion by the Crown, Mr. Roach was ordered removed
    from the record because he had a conflict of interest.  The ground of appeal concerning appointment
    of <i>amicus curiae</i> arises from the
    appointment of Mr. Christopher Black as <i>amicus
    curiae</i>.  The circumstances leading
    to his appointment are as follows.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following the preliminary inquiry, the
    appellant appeared without counsel in the Ontario Court (General Division) on
    March 24, 1993 and stated his intention to defend himself.  He was strongly urged by the presiding judge
    to retain counsel.  On June 3, 1993, Mr.
    Black appeared with the appellant before Watt J.  At that point, the trial was scheduled to begin on June 14,
    1993.  Mr. Black explained to Watt J.
    that he had been retained for only a short time and that his retainer was
    limited to assisting the appellant with the defence.  Mr. Black originally stated that while he was to cross-examine
    all the witnesses, make all legal arguments and address the jury, the appellant
    wished to reserve the right to also cross-examine witnesses.  However, as Watt J. probed further in an
    attempt to clarify the exact scope of Mr. Black’s retainer, it became clear
    that the division of responsibilities between Mr. Black and the appellant in
    the conduct of the trial was vague and that the appellant claimed the right to
    conduct most of the trial himself.  For
    example, when Watt J. attempted to determine who would conduct the jury
    selection, the appellant said, </span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Whenever I feel
    any necessity to take advice from Mr. Black I will take his advice.  But I still intend to do most of the trial
    myself.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After further discussions, Watt J.
    adjourned the case to June 9th.  On that
    date, Mr.&nbsp;Black applied to be removed from the record and stated that the
    appellant wished to represent himself.  Mr. Black explained that he could not continue to act on the basis of
    the limited retainer.  In his view, such
    an arrangement was “totally unworkable” and he could not serve a useful
    purpose.  Crown counsel then raised the
    possibility of Mr. Black being appointed to act as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  Mr. Black
    stated that he was prepared to accept such an appointment and that his relationship
    with the appellant continued to be a good one and that the appellant had
    confidence in him.  The appellant
    accepted this arrangement.  Mr. Black
    stated that the appellant was willing to have him act as <i>amicus curiae</i> “as long as he gets to make the final decisions” and
    to “run the show his way”.  Accordingly,
    Watt J. appointed Mr. Black as <i>amicus
    curiae</i> and adjourned the case for trial to June 14, 1993.</span></p>

    before German J.  The trial did not
    proceed at that time.  The appellant
    raised a complaint about disclosure from the Crown and in passing stated that
    he did not need Mr. Black’s assistance.  He did not explain this comment.  He did not ask that Mr. Black be discharged as <i>amicus curiae</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial began on September 27,
    1993.  At that time, the appellant
    appeared with Mr. Hamalengwa, a lawyer the appellant described as his legal
    advisor.  The trial judge agreed to
    allow Mr. Hamalengwa to assume this role. The appellant stated that he was
    unsure of Mr. Black’s role in the proceedings and at one point indicated that
    he did not wish Mr. Black to remain.  The appellant never explained why he did not wish Mr. Black to continue
    as <i>amicus curiae</i> and Mr. Hamalengwa
    was of the view that Mr. Black should remain.  Following further discussions on that day and the next, the appellant
    accepted Mr. Black’s role.  Then J.
    explained the role of <i>amicus curiae</i> in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT:  Mr. Samra, the <i>amicus curiae</i> role that Mr.&nbsp;Black is presently adopting is not
    in a capacity of being a legal advisor to you.  You are the counsel of record.  You are your own counsel and you are defending yourself.  You have decided to do that and you’ve
    explained why you’ve decided to do that.  Your advisor in this case is Mr. Hamalengwa and whoever else you feel
    that you are to obtain legal advice from and we’ve also gone through that.  The role that Mr. Black assumes in this
    proceeding, as I understand it, is because you are unrepresented and you are
    representing yourself, albeit you are receiving legal advice from Mr.
    Hamalengwa.  The court, in that
    circumstance, would find it advantageous to have representations made on legal
    points or other points that arise that touch your interest on your behalf.  Because, it might happen that because you’re
    unrepresented and perhaps even with legal advice that some matters that might
    be favourably mentioned on your behalf, might fall through the cracks, and Mr.
    Black’s role is to make sure that everything that can be said on your behalf is
    said.  I hope I have explained it
    adequately.  He is not your legal
    advisor.  He is not your lawyer.  What he is is a person who is here to help
    the court make sure that everything that can be said in your favour is said or
    done.  So, I hope that I’ve done that in
    a way that you can understand so you can appreciate what Mr.&nbsp;Black’s role
    here is.  Does that clear it up for you?</span></p>

    trial, the appellant’s acceptance of Mr.&nbsp;Black’s role wavered.  At some points he appeared quite content to
    have Mr. Black present and even consulted with him at times.  However, on at least two occasions the
    appellant applied to have Mr. Black discharged as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  The only
    reason given by the appellant for this change is that he perceived that on
    occasion Mr. Black made submissions on legal issues that did not support the
    position he was attempting to put forward and he had lost confidence in
    him.  The trial judge refused to remove
    Mr. Black and the trial proceeded.  </span></p>

    Lockyer took the court through virtually all of the interventions by Mr.

    it, is that it was not open to the court to appoint Mr. Black as <i>amicus curiae</i> because, as the
    appellant’s former lawyer, Mr. Black was in a conflict of interest.  Mr. Lockyer submits that the appearance of a
    fair trial was destroyed.  Alternatively, he argues that the appellant was actually prejudiced by

  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>1.         Did the trial judge err in law in

  <p class=headingQUOTE><b><span lang=EN-US>Question One:         Appointment of Mr. Black as <i>amicus curiae</i></span></b></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was not argued, nor could it be,
    that a superior court has no power to appoint <i>amicus curiae</i> at the trial of an unrepresented accused.  The appellant’s argument therefore must be
    that the court erred in appointing Mr. Black as <i>amicus curiae</i> because of a potential or actual conflict of
    interest.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have already indicated that when
    Watt J. first appointed Mr. Black, the appellant did not allege any conflict of
    interest.  Nor was any such allegation
    made when Then J. confirmed Mr. Black’s role at the outset of the trial.  In my view, the mere fact that Mr.&nbsp;Black
    had previously been retained by the appellant in this matter did not preclude
    his appointment as <i>amicus curiae.</i>  The problem of conflict of interest has
    usually arisen because counsel has been retained to act for a client opposed in
    interest to the former client.  Sopinka
    J. expressed the test for a disqualifying conflict of interest in <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i> (1990), 77
    D.L.R. (4th) 249 at 267 (S.C.C.) as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>[t]he test must
    be such that the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be
    satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.  That, in my opinion, is the overriding
    policy that applies and must inform the court in answering the question:  Is there a disqualifying conflict of
    interest?  <u>In this regard, it must be
    stressed that this conclusion is predicated on the fact that the client does
    not consent to but is objecting to the retainer which gives rise to the alleged
    conflict</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Typically, these
    cases require two questions to be answered:  (1)  Did the lawyer receive
    confidential information attributable to a solicitor-and-client relationship

    there a risk that it will be used to the prejudice of the client?  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    used to prejudice the client, at p. 268:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>The second
    question is whether the confidential information will be misused.  <u>A lawyer who has relevant confidential
    information cannot act against his client or former client.</u>  In such a case the disqualification is
    automatic.  No assurances or
    undertakings not to use the information will avail.  The lawyer cannot compartmentalize his or her mind so as to
    screen out what has been gleaned from the client and what was acquired
    elsewhere.  Furthermore, there would be
    a danger that the lawyer would avoid use of information acquired legitimately
    because it might be perceived to have come from the client.  This would prevent the lawyer from
    adequately representing the new client.  Moreover, the former client would feel at a disadvantage.  Questions put in cross-examination about
    personal matters, for example, would create the uneasy feeling that they had
    their genesis in the previous relationship.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    information either to Watt J. or Then J. from which they could have concluded
    that Mr. Black would be in a conflict of interest if he were appointed as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  The appellant and Mr. Black appeared to be on good terms and the
    appellant at least initially had confidence in him.  The only reason given for the termination of Mr. Black’s retainer
    was his reluctance to fulfil the legal advisor role as envisaged by the
    appellant.  It is apparent that Mr.
    Black considered that role unworkable because it was inconsistent with what he
    perceived to be the role of defence counsel.  While I think it is fair to assume that Mr. Black had relevant

    advantageous to have the advice of counsel who is not acting for the

    the role of <i>amicus curiae</i> in this

    submissions of the appellant or his advisors.  Moreover, Mr. Black’s role was limited.  He was to advise or make suggestions.  He would not be cross-examining or examining any witnesses nor making

    indicted accused were represented by the same lawyer.  While the issue was therefore different from the issue presented
    by this case, the nature of appellate review in the two cases is similar.  He held as follows at pp. 238-39:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>It is important
    to distinguish between the respective functions of a trial judge and an
    appellate court when faced with a conflict of interests claim. Where the issue
    is raised at trial, the court must be concerned with actual conflicts of
    interests and potential conflicts that may develop as the trial unfolds. In
    deciding whether counsel should be permitted to act for co-accused, trial
    judges must to some degree, speculate as to the issues which may arise and the
    course the trial will take. The trial judges' task is particularly difficult
    since they cannot be privy to the confidential discussions which may have
    passed between the clients and counsel and which may reveal the source of
    potential conflicts. Given those circumstances, trial judges must proceed with
    caution and when there is any realistic risk of a conflict of interests they
    must direct that counsel not act for one or perhaps either accused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Where the
    allegation of a conflict of interests is raised for the first time on appeal,
    the perspective is very different. The appellate court looks backward at the
    completed trial. The court has the full trial record and may have further
    material detailing the circumstances surrounding the joint representation and
    the effects of that representation on counsel's ability to defend the appellant. <u>Unlike the trial court, the appellate court is not concerned with
    prophylactic measures intended to avoid the potential injustice which may flow
    from compromised representation. Instead, the appellate court must determine
    whether counsel's representation was in fact compromised in such a way as to
    result in a miscarriage of justice. The concern on appeal must be with what
    happened and not with what might have happened</u>. It makes no more sense to
    find ineffective representation, based on the possibility of a conflict of
    interest, than it does to find ineffective representation based on the mere
    possibility of incompetent representation.</span></p>

    of unfairness.  Those examples rest on
    the proposition that because Mr. Black made legal submissions opposed to the
    appellant’s apparent wishes there was an appearance of unfairness.  I have already indicated why, in my view,

    to the cross-examination on the basis that it was irrelevant to Dr. Malcolm’s
    qualifications and was calculated to annoy the jury.  Mr. Black supported the Crown’s position.  He submitted that the proposed
    cross-examination might not only inflame and insult the jury but also could
    “jeopardize the whole process” and precipitate an application for a
    mistrial.  This led the trial judge to

    they may just say, well, a position on all these psychiatrists, they will be

    sufficient to dispose of the issue.  The
    trial judge, however, went on to say that there was some danger that the jury,

    did not prejudice the appellant nor lead to an unfair trial.  The ruling with respect to Dr. Malcolm came
    near the end of this very lengthy trial.  The trial judge had seen the two defence experts testify and was in a
    good position to determine whether the proposed cross-examination of Dr.
    Malcolm might prejudice the accused’s psychiatric defence.  The appellant’s advisors argued otherwise
    and ordinarily a great deal of weight must be given to this kind of tactical
    decision by defence counsel.  However,
    Mr. Hamalengwa and Mr. Bonzi-Simpson were not defence counsel.  They were merely advising the appellant and
    taking instructions from him.  It was
    certainly open to the trial judge to take the view that the course proposed by
    the appellant and his advisors was an ill-advised one and could in the result
    redound to the prejudice of the defence.  The trial judge had a duty to ensure that the appellant received a fair
    trial notwithstanding the submissions of his advisors:  <i>R. v.
    Osolin</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 524 (S.C.C.).  </span></p>

    that he did, <i>amicus</i> was merely
    performing the role entrusted to him.  His submissions did not make use of confidential information nor in any
    other way represent a conflict of interest.  In his submissions, <i>amicus</i> presented a more objective view of the merits of the course proposed by the
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    and several other of the objections really come to this: without Mr. Black’s
    interventions the trial judge might well have ruled the other way and since an
    appellate court has no way of knowing whether this is so, prejudice to the
    defence is established.  I do not
    agree.  The appellant’s argument
    confuses two different issues.  If the
    trial judge erred in law in his ruling, this can be a distinct ground of
    appeal.  No such argument was made in
    this case.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the alternative, the defence could
    argue that the process by which the decision was made was unfair.  However, there is nothing unfair in <i>amicus curiae</i> making submissions that
    are of assistance to the court.  The
    process followed by the trial judge was entirely fair and open.  Thus, for example, with respect to the
    cross-examination of Dr. Malcolm, after Mr. Black made his submissions Mr.
    Hamalengwa was permitted to respond and did so.  The principles of natural justice were protected by the
    procedures adopted by the trial judge.  Mr. Black did not make use of confidential information and for the
    reasons already expressed, the fact that his submissions did not coincide with
    the appellant’s wishes was not unfair nor did it constitute prejudice.</span></p>

    his family or she would divorce him.  It
    was the theory of the defence that this event contributed to the appellant’s
    altered mental state at the time of the shooting later in the day.  By the time of the trial, the appellant and
    his wife were divorced.  The appellant

    examination-in-chief, the defence brought an application for a stay of
    proceedings as a result of non-disclosure by the Crown.  It was alleged that the Crown had failed to
    disclose a number of items, including the notes of an interview by the police
    of the appellant’s former wife a few hours after the shooting.  Mr.&nbsp;Hamalengwa learned of this
    interview for the first time when he interviewed Mrs. Samra prior to calling
    her as a witness.  At this point,
    neither the defence nor Crown counsel had the notes of this interview.  In the course of his submissions on the
    application for a stay of proceedings, Mr. Hamalengwa stated that the defence
    had proposed to call Mrs. Samra in the hope that she would support the
    appellant’s testimony.  However, if she
    did not, the defence would have applied to treat her as a hostile witness.</span></p>

    had some difficulty seeing how the defence was irreparably prejudiced.  Mrs. Samra had not yet testified and it was
    uncertain whether she would testify.  The defence would have the notes of her interview before they had to decide
    whether to call her as a witness.  Crown
    counsel also made it clear that he had no intention of calling Mrs. Samra, and
    since he had never seen the notes himself he had not made any use of them in
    the course of the trial.  The trial was
    then briefly adjourned to give the police an opportunity to see if they could
    find the notes of the interview.</span></p>

    police reports were found and disclosed.  As it turned out, there was nothing in these reports of any substance,
    except for one brief reference by Mrs. Samra to troubles with the
    marriage.  Mr. Hamalengwa, however,
    submitted that the defence would have been conducted in an entirely different
    manner had this report been disclosed.  The trial judge had considerable difficulty with this submission,
    especially since Mrs. Samra had not yet testified.  I agree with the trial judge.  The submission is patently without substance.  Further, Mr. Hamalengwa also stated the following:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>And we had
    difficulty in getting Mr. Samra’s former wife here because, after eleven years,<u> we didn’t even know what she was going to say</u>.  We didn’t know whether she was going to acknowledge there was
    problems in the marriage.  She might
    come here and say, “Our marriage was made in heaven.  Don’t blame me for all these problems,” but had we had that
    statement, I asked for an adjournment.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    defence would have been “more forceful” in attempting to secure Mrs. Samra’s
    attendence had they known about the notes.  These submissions too seem misconceived and without substance.  The trial record demonstrates that prior to
    receiving this latest disclosure, the defence had taken the necessary steps to
    compel Mrs. Samra’s presence at the trial.  Based on the record of proceedings to that point, the trial judge was
    bound to dismiss the motion to stay the proceedings, at least as it was based
    on the late disclosure of the police notes respecting Mrs. Samra.  </span></p>

    to talk to Mrs. Samra, he was unaware of the fruits of that investigation.  The appellant stated that if Mr. Black had
    any other information it was obtained “in the light of the solicitor-client
    relation” and the appellant applied to have Mr. Black discharged as <i>amicus curiae</i>.</span></p>

    clear that he was not going to make any use of the information conveyed by Mr.

    &quot;fully satisfied&quot; that Mr.&nbsp;Black's comments would not have
    influenced the trial judge.  That statement
    is very telling on the question of prejudice to the appellant.</span></p>

    application to discharge Mr. Black said the following:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Black, in
    the context of this debate, stated that private investigators hired by the defence
    had approached Mrs.&nbsp;Samra.  He did
    not state the nature of their communication with Mrs. Samra.  It is Mr. Samra’s position that Mr. Black
    should not have divulged that fact, the knowledge of which was acquired while
    Mr. Roach represented the accused.  For
    this reason, and for reasons previously expressed by him, he invites the court
    to remove Mr. Black as <i>amicus curiae.</i></span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>In ruling on the
    motions for a mistrial and a stay of proceedings, which were both based on a
    lack of disclosure by the Crown, I wish to state emphatically for the record
    that my decision to dismiss those motions did not depend in any way whatever on
    the fact that the defence had interviewed Mrs. Samra, because, as must be
    obvious, the contents of the interview have not been revealed and are
    privileged.  In my opinion the referral
    to the fact that investigators were hired and approached Mrs. Samra by Mr.
    Black has not in any way prejudiced the position of the accused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, in
    my view there is nothing which requires me to discharge Mr. Black as <i>amicus curiae.</i>  I am confident he will continue to provide the court with
    submissions on legal issues which support the positions advanced by the accused
    to the best of his ability.  The application
    accordingly is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    raises two questions.  First, was the
    appellant prejudiced by the disclosure of confidential information?  Second, did the trial judge err in refusing
    to discharge Mr. Black in light of that disclosure?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have no difficulty with the first
    question.  The trial judge did not make
    use of this information, nor did Crown counsel.  The course of the trial was not influenced by the disclosure.  The appellant himself acknowledged at the
    trial that he was not prejudiced by the disclosure of this information by Mr.
    Black.  The trial judge was correct in
    dismissing the application for a mistrial or a stay of proceedings and it was
    not argued otherwise on this appeal.  The delayed disclosure of the police interviews was explained by Crown
    counsel and the delay did not prejudice the defence case in any way.  There was no possible basis for either a
    mistrial or a stay of proceedings.  See <i>R. v. Dixo</i>n (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (S.C.C.).</span></p>

    satisfied that the trial judge erred in failing to discharge Mr. Black from his
    duties as <i>amicus curiae.</i>  It would seem from the dialogue between Mr.
    Black and the trial judge that he assumed Mr. Black believed he was bound to
    disclose the information as an officer of the court because Mr. Hamalengwa was
    misleading the court about what the defence knew about Mrs. Samra.  As noted above, Mr. Hamalengwa had said, “we
    didn’t even know what she was going to say”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Just before making this statement, Mr.
    Hamalengwa had also expressly accused the Crown of a “cover-up” and of
    deliberately suppressing this and other evidence.  He suggested that the Crown was guilty of an attempt to obstruct
    justice.  These allegations by Mr.
    Hamalengwa were entirely without any foundation and should not have been made.  They do, however, shed some light on why Mr.
    Black took the step of informing the court of the true state of affairs, as he
    believed them to be.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not suggest that Mr. Hamalengwa’s
    improper conduct justified Mr. Black's breaching solicitor-client privilege, if
    he did so.  I also need not decide
    whether, by making the submissions he did, Mr. Hamalengwa waived
    solicitor-client privilege with respect to this issue.  That issue was not argued before us.  Mr. Hamalengwa was not the appellant’s
    counsel and it is not entirely clear whether he had the authority to waive
    privilege.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, in the circumstances I have
    not been persuaded that the trial judge erred in refusing to discharge Mr.
    Black.  This was the first and, as it
    turned out, the only time that an actual conflict of interest might have arisen
    and where possibly confidential information was disclosed.  However, as I have said there was no adverse
    effect on the appellant’s defence as a result of that conflict of
    interest.  The trial judge was satisfied
    that Mr. Black could still be of assistance and that his continued presence
    would not prejudice the appellant’s defence.  In my view, he was entitled to come to this conclusion.  As pointed out, the incident that lead to
    the disclosure by Mr. Black was unusual and precipitated by unfounded
    allegations by one of the appellant’s advisors.  On this record, I do not think that any reasonable person fully
    informed would think there was an appearance of unfairness to the appellant or
    that there had been any miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of that conclusion I need not
    decide whether Mr. Black actually was in a conflict of interest.  I would, however, point out that it is not
    at all obvious that he was.  It was not
    alleged that Mr. Black was in a conflict because of his duties to his former
    client and a new client but in a conflict because of his duties to the
    appellant and his duties to the court.  That alleged conflict arose because of the, presumably innocent, misrepresentation
    made by Mr. Hamalengwa that the defence had no idea what Mrs. Samra would
    say.  Even apart from the question of
    whether the appellant implicitly waived privilege, I have considerable doubt
    that this conflict between Mr. Black’s duty to his former client and his duty
    to the court was a disqualifying conflict of interest.  It is not unusual that counsel may find
    themselves in a conflict between their duty to the client and their duty to the
    court.  It has never been suggested that
    when such a conflict arises counsel is always disqualified from continuing to
    act in the case.  </span></p>

    complains about the treatment of this evidence in the charge to the jury.  The trial judge fairly and fully reviewed
    Dr. Cooper’s evidence and in the course of that review stated the following:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>You will recall
    that Dr. Cooper was cross-examined as to his alleged views expressed in the <u>Globe

    namely, “depending on the defence the lawyer wishes to offer, I can find anyone
    insane.”  The <u>Globe and Mail</u> did
    not print his request for retraction nor were there further steps taken by Dr.
    Cooper.  It will be for you to assess
    the evidence of Dr. Cooper.  Bias on the

    portions of the cross-examination should not have been permitted.  The opinions of Dr. Malcolm and Mr.
    Greenspan about some psychiatrists were inadmissible hearsay.  Dr. Cooper did not accept Dr. Malcolm’s
    opinion as true or as applying to him and in my view the fact that he did not
    sue the newspaper for libel cannot fairly be taken as an implied admission that
    the statement was true.  The comment was
    inflammatory and should not have been put before the jury.  The comment attributed to Mr. Greenspan is
    of a different nature and I did not understand Dr. Cooper to disagree with the

    attributed directly to Dr. Cooper, in my view, this cross-examination was
    proper.  As I read that
    cross-examination, Dr. Cooper did not deny making the statement: “When I look
    at a case, I always ask the lawyer what he wants.  When a lawyer is happy and his client is happy, then I’m
    happy.”  To the contrary, he seems to
    concede that he did say it, although the reporter may have taken the comment
    out of context.  This is how Dr. Cooper
    explained the comment:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>As a doctor, I
    was going to say when you see a person and he’s a patient, you help the

    why you are in medicine, not to hurt people, to help people.</u>  So if you want to interpret that as being
    biased or you’re a hired gun, fine, that’s your interpretation of it.  All I can state is that the reporter had the

    what I’m saying.  …&nbsp;As far as that
    is concerned, <u>I feel quite comfortable in my statement.  I agree, when you are able to assist someone
    who is a patient, whether it’s a lawyer, anyone, you feel better about it.</u>  There is no more fun in having spent a lengthy
    time saying to the lawyer, “I’m sorry, can’t be of assistance,” and what he
    does, he does hire, no doubt about it.  There is the thing, they don’t get the opinion they want, they go to

    context.  This is a part of his
    explanation:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Basically, I

    decides whether a person is mentally ill, not me.  <u>I’m asked directly – when I was making a comment anybody can

    statements.  It was then for the jury to
    determine whether those comments represented Dr. Cooper’s true point of view
    and the effect, if any, on Dr. Cooper’s credibility.  As the trial judge told the jury, the comments appeared to

  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>In the present
    case, the impugned direction did not instruct the jury to apply proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt in two stages. In our opinion, however, it was a misdirection
    to instruct the jury to examine the evidence in a first stage, to eliminate all
    evidence except that which the jurors accepted as true and reliable (a lower
    standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt), and then to consider only the
    residual in arriving at their verdict. This involved the injection of
    artificial rules for the jury and constituted ''an intrusion into the province
    of the jury''. We believe it is wrong and prejudicial to confine the jury, in
    their initial findings of fact, to evidence accepted as true and reliable;
    evidence which is neither rejected nor accepted should survive to the final
    stage of the jury's determination on the crucial application of reasonable
    doubt.</span></p>

    the passage quoted above in this case amounted to misdirection.  However, he invites the court to find that

    whole.  In <i>Miller</i>, this court was unable to apply the proviso in s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> by reference to the balance of the charge.  The court reasoned as follows at p. 544:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>In our opinion,
    the misdirection cannot be cured by a reading of the charge as a whole. As
    pointed out earlier, the jury was invited to consider in two stages the
    evidence favourable to the defence, including the appellant's statement and the
    evidence of the appellant's mother relating to an alibi, as well as the
    evidence relied on by the prosecution. We are of the view that a proper general
    direction as to the burden of proof on the Crown, as to reasonable doubt, and
    as to the presumption of innocence, cannot correct or neutralize a colourful
    but erroneous specific direction on the two-stage process which would strike
    the imagination of the jury. The apparent inconsistencies between the two
    directions would have been confusing at best, probably misleading the jury into
    thinking that reasonable doubt came into play only at the second stage of the
    deliberations, when considering evidence which they had not rejected at the
    first stage.</span></p>

    here testified.  Evidence may also
    appear in the form of physical exhibits or, for example, photographs, articles

    the evidence is considered that a proper and just conclusion may be reached.  It is only in the event that the total and
    cumulative effect of the evidence, often greater than the sum of its individual
    parts, satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt, that the guilt of the accused

    trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>If you should

    defence.  You must clearly understand
    that no such obligation or onus rests upon the accused in respect of any
    defence or any other issue.  The

    analysis it is for you to determine which expert evidence you accept and what
    weight you wish to attach to it.  You

    reason, particularly in cases where that evidence is not the subject of dispute
    between the parties in this case.  If,
    however, there is a conflict between the expert called by the Crown and that
    called by the defence, as, for example, the difference in opinion between Dr.
    Long and Dr. Cooper on behalf of the defence and Dr. Malcolm on behalf of the
    Crown, as to whether the accused was capable of planning and deliberation,
    despite the effect of certain stressors or his personality disorders, a further
    instruction is required.  Before you
    accept the opinion of Dr. Malcolm, called by the Crown, that the accused was
    capable of planning and deliberation, that he was thinking clearly, despite the

  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>The Crown, quite

    submits, however, that such remarks have to be looked at in their context
    within the whole of the charge to the jury. More specifically, the Crown argues
    that the charge as a whole made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take
    a binary view of the evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to
    reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>By my count, the

    (emphasis added). When the offending passages are read with the above and
    subsequent admonitions, it is clear -- and, I believe, must have been clear to
    the jury -- that the trial judge means &quot;accept beyond a reasonable
    doubt&quot; when he refers to &quot;accepting&quot; Crown evidence, and means

lang=EN-US>               Dr. Cooper
    acknowledged that he was at a significant disadvantage because he saw the
    appellant for the first time over a decade after the shootings.  Throughout his testimony, Dr. Cooper
    suggests that the appellant is a very different person from the man who did the
    shootings.  Dr. Cooper also acknowledged
    that his opinion was dependent on the accuracy of the appellant’s description
    of events and his thought processes at the time.</span></p>
