[1]  The appellant was convicted on her plea of guilty to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">possession of a narcotic for the purposes of trafficking and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentenced to two years in the penitentiary.  She appeals</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction and sentence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant was not directly involved in the sale of 200</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grams of heroin that was made to an undercover police officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He had met with the vendor and the two of them travelled by car</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the appellant=s seamstress shop.  The vendor went into the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shop and returned with the cocaine that he exchanged for $32,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A search of the seamstress shop revealed a supply of heroin.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In her appeal against conviction, the appellant asks that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her plea of guilty be struck out because she received improper</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advice from her counsel.  She says that she had always maintained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her innocence and only pled guilty because her counsel told her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she would receive a sentence of nine years if she pleaded not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">guilty and was convicted after trial but, if she pleaded guilty,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she would receive a sentence that she would be allowed to serve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the community.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We would not give effect to this argument. The appellant had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided written instructions to her trial counsel, which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stipulated the offence to which she would be pleading guilty, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">potential consequences of her plea, and the basis upon which her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plea of guilty would be entered. She did not repudiate these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions during the protracted sentencing proceedings, made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">up of three separate hearings over a twelve week period, despite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the fact that the trial judge initiated a detailed dialogue as to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the nature and extent of her knowledge of what she was pleading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Accordingly, we are in no doubt that she was well aware of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the seriousness of the charges against her and that she knew she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was facing a substantial custodial sentence.  The appeal against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction is dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  As to sentence, we are all of the opinion that the sentence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposed is excessive. The trial judge appears to have thought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it was irrelevant that the appellant was wilfully blind to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the nature of the narcotic involved, as opposed to having</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge that it was heroin. This is not correct. Although the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant had to be sentenced as being in possession of heroin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the purpose of trafficking, the fact that she did not know it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was heroin was a mitigating factor. This factor, together with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her passive role in the commission of the offence and the fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that she received no real benefit from it, justifies a reduction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in her sentence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence is reduced to six months imprisonment.</font></pre></td>
