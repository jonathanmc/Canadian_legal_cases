    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with established authority, we will comment on the merits of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposed appeal.  In our view, this is one of those rare cases.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    The respondent was acquitted on the ground that each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sample of his breath was not taken &quot;as soon as practicable after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed&quot;, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required by s.258(1)(c)(ii) of the Criminal Code.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The police intercepted the respondent at 6:55 p.m. while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was operating his boat on a lake.  At 7:03 p.m. the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was arrested and advised of his Charter rights.  At 7:05 p.m. the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">police and the respondent began a short journey to the town dock</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where the respondent was turned over to a police officer at 7:20</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">p.m. to be taken to the Midland detachment of the O.P.P. so that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">samples of his breath could be obtained.  The first sample was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained at 7:34 p.m., and the second sample, at 7:54 p.m.  It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apparent that only 31 minutes elapsed between the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arrest on the lake and when the first sample was obtained.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The trial judge was concerned with the failure of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown to provide evidence to explain what happened during the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fourteen minutes from the time the respondent left the dock and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first sample was obtained.  Because the Crown had failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explain what occurred during this brief period and his view that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was &quot;entitled&quot; to know what happened, he concluded that he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unable to &quot;paint in the entire picture of everything that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transpired in that interval&quot;.  Accordingly, he found that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown had failed to satisfy the requirements of s.258(1)(c)(ii)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and acquitted the respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    The reasoning of the trial judge was affirmed by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal judge.  MacDougall J. made reference to the decisions of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court in R. v. Phillips (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 150 and R. v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Payne (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 548 in which it was held that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">test of practicability is reasonableness and that the court must</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be satisfied that the conduct of the police in the interval</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the arrest and the taking of the breath sample was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances.  However, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">then went on to conclude:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            In order for the court to determine
            whether the delay was reasonable having
            regard to all the circumstances,
            evidence must be introduced describing
            what was happening throughout the time
            period between the time of arrest and
            the breathalyzer test being administered
            in order for the court to determine if
            the police officer's conduct was
            reasonable.
            ...
            Because the trial judge found that there
            was a 14 minute unexplained delay, the
            judge was therefore entitled to find
            that there was a reasonable doubt that
            the tests were taken as soon as
            practicable.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    It would have been our view had we granted leave to appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that both the trial judge and the appeal judge misconstrued the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meaning of &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; and in imposing an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidentiary burden on the prosecution to account for every minute</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the time of arrest and the administration of the first</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">test, rather than focusing on whether the police had acted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonably, and expeditiously, in all the circumstances.  Their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decisions were contrary to an established line of authority.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">addition to the Phillips case and the Payne case, see, for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">example, R. v. McCarthy (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 280 (Newf. C.A.);</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R. v. Carter (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 450 (Sask. C.A.); R. v.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    The following comments of Craig J.A. in R. v. Cambrin</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            The framers of the legislation never
            intended that the prosecution would have

            between the time of the arrival of the
            accused and the taking of the first
            test.  As Mr. Justice Macdonald, in
            giving the judgment of this court, in R.
            v. Carter, pointed out, the test adopted
            by the appeal judge in that case, and
            apparently adopted by the appeal judge
            in this case [at p.407] &quot;would require a
            trial Judge to find that the condition
            specified in para. (c)(ii) had not been
            met without evidence explaining a delay
            of as little as five minutes&quot;.</font></pre></td>
