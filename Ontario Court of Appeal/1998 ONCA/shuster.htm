    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The motion judge properly identified the sole issue: did the
respondent mortgagee take reasonable steps to obtain proper value
before selling the property under power of sale? The affidavit of
the representative of the respondent provided ample support for
the conclusion that the respondent did act reasonably. The
affidavit filed by the appellant offered no basis to doubt that
conclusion. At its highest, the appellant's material may be read
as raising some controversy as to the actual validity of the two
appraisals relied on by the respondent mortgagee. The appellant's
material does not, however, cast any doubt on the reasonableness
of the respondents' reliance on those appraisals and the decision
to sell the property at an amount equal to the higher of the two
appraisals and greater than the price at which the second
mortgagee was prepared to sell the property.</font></pre>
