[1]  The testimony of Mr. Loveless as to what Kendall said to him

was admissible in reply. The Crown, however, permitted Loveless

to go on at considerable length, describing the scene and the

parts of  Noonan and the appellant in it. This was evidence which

should have been led as part of the Crown’s case in chief. Coming

as it did in reply, it had the effect of splitting the Crown’s

case.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge’s charge indicated to the jury that

Kendall’s alleged statement, if made, could be considered by the

jury only in the context of Kendall’s credibility. This, however,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not cure the prejudice to the appellant created by the bulk

of Loveless’ reply evidence, which could only have been

admissible as part of the Crown’s case in chief. It is not at all

clear that the verdict would have been the same had this improper

reply evidence not been given.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed, the conviction

quashed and a new trial directed. Since the appellant has served

her sentence, including the 200 hours of community service,

serious consideration should be given by the Crown as to whether

the matter should be pursued.</font></pre></td>
