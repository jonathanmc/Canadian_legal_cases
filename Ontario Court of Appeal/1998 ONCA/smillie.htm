[1]  The appellant applies to review the order of Finlayson J.A.
refusing to stay the divorce judgment of Thompson J. dated
December 12, 1997. The appellant seeks to have the interim
support order made by Thomas J. on August 31, 1994 reinstated
pending the disposition of the appeal. Under the order of Thomas
J., the respondent was required to pay interim spousal and child
support in the amount of $320.00 per week. Under the order of
Thompson J., the respondent is required to pay spousal and child
support in accordance with the order of Thomas J. until March
31st and thereafter to pay child support in the amount of $525.00
per month. He is no longer required to pay any amount for spousal
support.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The judgment of Thompson J. followed protracted negotiations
between counsel for the parties that had reached the stage of
draft minutes of settlement based on correspondence between
counsel. The thrust of the appellant’s appeal is that either she
did not agree to the minutes of settlement and that her lawyer,
Stephen A. Barker, acted without authority, that she was coerced
by Mr. Barker into agreeing to the settlement, or that the
settlement was unconscionable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The respondent brings his own motion and applies to quash
the appeal on the basis that it is manifestly devoid of merit. In
the alternative, he renews the motion previously made before
Finlayson J.A. for an order for security for costs. He also
applies for directions concerning the conduct of the appeal. Our
disposition of these various motions is as follows.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Review of the order of Finlayson J.A.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  There is no basis for staying the judgment of Thompson J. On
its face, the judgment was made in accordance with minutes of
settlement. The amount ordered for child support appears to be in
accordance with the federal child support guidelines. The
appellant informs us that she has now obtained employment.
Counsel for the respondent informs us that the respondent has
renewed the mortgage and has undertaken to continue to renew the
mortgage until the appeal is disposed of. The appeal is to be
heard on October 5, 1998. The appellant’s appeal will be a
difficult one and in our view, the balance of convenience favours
maintaining the arrangement as set out in the judgment of
Thompson J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Motion to quash
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellant will have a number of difficult hurdles to
overcome in order to succeed on her appeal. However, we are not
satisfied that the appeal is so manifestly devoid of merit that
there is no reasonable probability that the appellant could
succeed. We are particularly concerned that the appellant, who is
acting in person, has not yet had the opportunity to present all
of the fresh evidence that she hopes to put before the Court.
This is not one of those rare cases where it is appropriate to
exercise the power given this court by s. 134(3) of the Courts of
Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. See Schmidt v. Toronto-
Dominion Bank (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Security for costs
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  This is also not a proper case for security for costs. The
appellant has no counsel and appears to have limited means. We
have not been persuaded that there is good reason to believe that
the appeal is frivolous and vexatious notwithstanding the
shifting positions taken by the appellant in the trial court and
in this court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Directions
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  To ensure that the panel hearing this appeal is in a
position to completely dispose of all of the issues potentially
arising in this appeal, the parties will comply with the
following directions:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    1.   The appellant shall serve upon
          counsel for the respondent by August 14, 1998
          any material, in addition to her responding
          affidavit dated July 27, 1998, which she will
          seek to introduce as fresh evidence. The
          appellant shall also serve an updated
          financial statement upon counsel for the
          respondent by August 14, 1998.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    2.   Three copies of this same
          material shall be placed in sealed envelopes
          and filed with the Court of Appeal by August
          21, 1998.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    3.   As a result of the allegations
          made by the appellant against Mr. Barker in
          her factums, her oral submissions and her
          responding affidavit, the appellant is deemed
          to have waived solicitor client privilege and
          the respondent may obtain an affidavit from
          Mr. Barker in response to the appellant’s
          application to admit fresh evidence.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    4.   The respondent shall serve and
          file an updated financial statement by August
          21, 1998.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    5.   All cross-examinations by the
          parties on any affidavits to be placed before
          the Court of Appeal shall be completed by
          September 8, 1998.
          </font></pre>

the appeal.</font></pre></td>
