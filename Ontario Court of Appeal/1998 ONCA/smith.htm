    Smith was a medical doctor who was licensed to practice in Ontario from 1964
    until his license was suspended by the appellant, The College of Physicians and
    Surgeons of Ontario (“the College”), on December 2, 1992. Dr. Smith committed
    suicide on December 21, 1992.  On April 28, 1995, two years and four months
    after his death, his widow, the respondent Joanna Smith, brought an action
    against the College and other named defendants for the following relief:</span></p>
  <p class=Level3><span lang=EN-US>a)         as
    executrix of the estate of Michael S.W. Smith, seeking declaratory relief,
    damages for wrongful death, damages for loss of income from December 2, 1992,
    until December 21, 1992, special damages and punitive damages;</span></p>
  <p class=Level3><span lang=EN-US>b)        in
    her personal capacity, seeking declaratory relief, punitive damages, and
    damages pursuant to the <i>FLA</i> for loss of income and support resulting
    from the wrongful death, and for loss of guidance, care and companionship; and</span></p>
  <p class=Level3><span lang=EN-US>c)         as
    litigation guardian for the four minor children of the late Michael S.W. Smith,
    claiming declaratory relief, punitive damages and damages pursuant to the <i>FLA</i> for loss of income and support resulting from the wrongful death and for loss
    of guidance, care and companionship.</span></p>

    the defendants under rule 21.01(1)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> for the  determination of certain questions of law raised by the pleadings.
    Most questions pertained to limitation periods. A cross-motion was brought by
    the plaintiffs seeking, amongst other relief, an extension of the applicable
    limitation periods.</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US

    determination by the motions judge was whether Joanna Smith’s action as
    executrix of the estate of Michael S.W. Smith was statute-barred. It was
    conceded that that part of the action was governed by the provisions of the <i>Trustee
    Act</i> and that it was brought outside the two-year limitation period
    prescribed under s.&nbsp;38(3) of that statute. However, the plaintiffs sought
    an extension of the limitation period based on special circumstances. The
    relevant provisions of the <i>Trustee Act</i> read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>s.&nbsp;38(1) Except
    in cases of libel and slander, the executor or administrator of any deceased
    person may maintain an action for all torts or injuries to the person or to the
    property of the deceased in the same manner and with the same rights and
    remedies as the deceased would, if living, have been entitled to do, and the
    damages when recovered shall form part of the personal estate of the deceased
    but if death results from such injuries no damages shall be allowed for the
    death or for the loss of the expectation of life, but this proviso is not in
    derogation of any rights conferred by Part V of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>...</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(3) An action under
    this section shall not be brought after the expiration of two years from the
    death of the deceased.</span></p>
  <p class=Level6><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The motions judge
    held that he had no discretion to extend this time limit. Consequently, he
    dismissed Joanna Smith’s action as executrix of the estate. No appeal is taken
    from this order.</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The next question was
    whether the claims brought by Joanna Smith and by the infants under s.&nbsp;61
    of the <i>FLA</i> are “derivative” in nature. In other words, must they fall as
    a consequence of the expiration of the limitation period under the <i>Trustee
    Act,</i> or do they stand alone to be governed solely by their own limitation
    period under the <i>FLA?</i> The relevant provisions of the <i>FLA</i> are the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>s.&nbsp;61 (1) If a
    person is injured or killed by the fault or neglect of another under
    circumstances where the person is entitled to recover damages, or would have
    been entitled if not killed, the spouse, as defined in Part III (Support
    Obligations), children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, brothers and
    sisters of the person are entitled to recover their pecuniary loss resulting
    from the injury or death from the person from whom the person injured or killed
    is entitled to recover or would have been entitled if not killed, and to
    maintain an action for the purpose in a court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>

  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(4) No action shall
    be brought under subsection (1) after the expiration of two years from the time
    the cause of action arose.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The action referred
    to in s.&nbsp;61(1), which the person injured or killed by the wrongdoing of
    another is entitled to bring or would have been entitled to bring had he or she
    not been killed, will be referred to for the purpose of this appeal as “the
    principal action.” </span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US

    that the <i>FLA</i> claims stood “on their own merits” and were not subject to
    the limitation period governing the principal action. Rather, they were
    governed solely by the two year limitation period set out under s.&nbsp;61(4)
    of the <i>FLA</i>. The defendants submit that the motions judge erred in
    finding that the <i>FLA</i> claims can stand alone without regard to the
    limitation period governing the principal action.</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The third question to
    be determined by the motions judge was whether the infants’ <i>FLA </i>claims
    were prescribed by s.&nbsp;61(4) of the <i>FLA.</i> The motions judge held
    that, by reason of s.&nbsp;47 of the <i>Limitations Act,</i> the limitation
    period did not start to run until each infant attained the age of majority.
    Section 47 provides that:</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>[w]here a person entitled
    to bring an action mentioned in section 45 or 46 is at the time the cause of
    action accrues a minor, . . .  the period within which the action may be
    brought shall be reckoned from the date when such person became of full age or
    of sound mind.</span></p>
  <p class=Level6><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>Consequently, because
    of the infants’ ages, the motions judge held that their claim was not
    statute-barred. The defendants take the position that s.47 of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> does not apply to the infants’ <i>FLA</i> claims because s.47 only
    applies to actions “mentioned in section 45 or 46&quot;. Neither of these
    sections specifically refer to the <i>FLA</i> right of action.<a href="#_ftn1"

    whether Joanna Smith’s <i>FLA</i> claim would be allowed to proceed. It was
    statute-barred under s.&nbsp;61(4), having been brought more than two years
    after the cause of action arose, but was subject to the exercise of the court’s
    discretion under s.&nbsp;2(8) of the <i>FLA</i> to extend the limitation
    period:</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>s.&nbsp;2(8) The
    court may, on motion, extend a time prescribed by this Act if it is satisfied
    that,</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(a)      there are apparent grounds for relief;</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US

  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US

    by reason of the delay.</span></p>
  <p class=Level6><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The motions judge
    held that Joanna Smith did not bring herself within the provisions of
    s.&nbsp;2(8)(b) and, consequently, dismissed that part of her action. Joanna
    Smith cross-appeals from this dismissal of her <i>FLA</i> claim.</span></p>

    position that the motions judge erred in finding that the <i>FLA</i> claims
    could stand alone without regard to the limitation period governing the
    principal action. They submit that this question has been authoritatively
    settled by this court and by the Supreme Court of Canada. They submit that the
    right of action created by s.61 of the <i>FLA</i> and its predecessor,
    s.&nbsp;60 of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> (“the<i> FLRA</i>”), has been
    consistently described as derivative and held not to be separate from the
    principal cause of action for the purpose of determining the applicable
    limitation period. Consequently, it has been held that, if the principal cause
    of action is statute-barred, the derivative action cannot proceed.</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US

    under s.61(4) of the <i>FLA</i>, the defendants argue that the claims are
    nonetheless statute-barred because they were commenced more than two years
    after the cause of action arose. They submit that s.61 <i>FLA</i> claims fall
    outside the scope of s.47 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> and that, consequently,
    the infant plaintiffs cannot benefit from the extension provided under s.47.</span></p>
  <p class=Level1><span lang=EN-US

    the <i>FLA</i> claims are derivative of the principal action or whether they
    stand alone, the plaintiffs presented two different positions. In his oral
    argument on the appeal, counsel for the plaintiffs supported the approach
    adopted by the motions judge and argued that the <i>FLA</i> claims were not
    subject to the limitation period governing the principal action. However, the
    plaintiffs take a different approach in their factum.  It is conceded in the
    factum that, on a plain reading of s.&nbsp;61(1) of the <i>FLA,</i> if the
    statutory limitation period has expired for the principal right of action and
    no principal action has been commenced, the derivative claims also expire
    notwithstanding the provisions of s.&nbsp;2(8) of the <i>FLA</i> and
    notwithstanding s.&nbsp;47 of the <i>Limitations Act.</i> The plaintiffs state,
    however, that the limitation period for the principal right of action in this
    case is not the two-year period under s.&nbsp;38(3) of the <i>Trustee Act</i> but rather the limitation period which would have governed an action commenced
    by Dr. Smith for the same wrong had he not died. It is common ground that this
    latter period would be six years by virtue of s.&nbsp;45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations
    Act.</i> I will consider the position adopted in the factum as an alternative
    approach on this issue.</span></p>

    Ontario Divisional Court in <i>Toner v. Cherrington</i> (1993), 104 D.L.R.

    decision in <i>Murphy v. Welsh</i> and to conclude that the<i> FLA </i>claims
    are barred by the expiration of the limitation period governing the principal
    action. For reasons that follow, I do not think that these authorities can be
    distinguished on the basis that they were decided under the <i>FLRA.</i> Nor do

  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>There appears to be
    no dispute that the cause of action available to a dependant under s.61(1) FLA

    tortfeasor within the factual situation surrounding his or her injury or death. </span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>It is only to this

    “separate from” or “distinct from,” or as a “claim under” that of the
    principal. It is clear that once created through the fulfilment of the
    pre-condition or requirement of s.61(1), the dependants have a cause of action
    separate from that of the principal. Thereafter it has a life of its own, not

    the FLA does not begin to run until the infants have attained their majority.</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>It is my opinion that

    Cory J.A., speaking for this court, held that a <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> derivative claim cannot be commenced after the expiration of the limitation

    c.&nbsp;2, s.&nbsp;79).  Under the latter, it was the death itself that gave
    rise to the beneficiaries' cause of action.  Referring to the action under the <i>Family

    the late Maria Von Cramm suffered.  The son and daughter cannot have a cause of
    action which is distinct from and separate from the cause of action of their
    mother.  We agree with the conclusion expressed by Griffiths&nbsp;J. in <i>Re
    Butler Trucking Co. et al. and Brydges et al.</i> (1984), 46 O.R. (2d) 686 at

    of the deceased to personally maintain an action for damages in the
    circumstances of the accident if he had not been killed.  In the decision of <i>Fera

  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

    reverse situation: can the derivative action expire before the expiry date of
    the principal action?  The issue, of course, does not arise in the case of
    death.  It arises only in cases where the person injured enjoys a longer
    limitation period than the two years provided for in s.&nbsp;60(4) of the <i>Family
    Law Reform Act</i>.  In my view, s.&nbsp;60(4) cannot be read to force a
    derivative action to proceed before or in the absence of a main action by the person
    injured.  Even though this conclusion may seem to do violence to the apparently
    plain language of the subsection, the proper interpretation, in my opinion, is
    to limit the scope of s.&nbsp;60(4) to cases of death, and to tie the
    limitation period, in cases of injuries, to the limitation applicable to the
    main action by the person injured.  This is not only consistent with the

    that raised in the above-noted cases under the <i>FLRA</i>. The policy
    considerations discussed in those cases apply equally to <i>FLA</i> claims. I
    see no basis for distinguishing these authorities on the basis that they were
    decided under the earlier regime. The amendments made to the legislation do not
    affect the interpretation of the relevant statutory provision. A reference to
    the distinction between the two statutes was actually made in <i>Swain Estate

    Although this has not been raised by either party, it appears that everything
    about this action occurred before the coming into force of the <i>Family Law
    Act, 1986</i>, on March 1, 1986, except the actual issuing of the statement of

    the plaintiffs a right of action in circumstances where the deceased person
    “would have been entitled [to recover damages] <i>if not killed</i>.” It is
    submitted that the words “if not killed” in effect supersede s.38(3) of the <i>Trustee

    argument is foreclosed by the decision of this court in <i>Swain Estate</i>. In <i>Swain Estate</i>, the plaintiffs argued that they should have the benefit of
    the extended limitation period which would have benefitted the deceased infant
    had she not died. In support of this argument, the plaintiffs relied on the
    wording found under s.38(1) of the <i>Trustee Act</i> which gave them a right
    to maintain an action for the injuries to the deceased “in the same manner and
    with the same rights and remedies as the deceased would, if living, have been
    entitled to do.” They argued that those words were wide enough to incorporate
    the limitation period that the deceased infant would have been subjected to had
    she lived. This court held that this argument could not succeed in view of “the
    inescapable effect” of what is now s.38(3). The court concluded (at p.176):</span></p>
  <p class=Level2><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>If the minor - or
    anybody else for that matter- dies before the expiration of that limitation
    period, s.38 of the <i>Trustee Act</i> takes effect and, for the reasons
    expressed above, the administrator or executor must commence the action within
    two years of the death, regardless of any longer time which would have remained
    to the deceased to bring an action had he or she lived.</span></p>

    be disputed that the principal action in this case is subject to the <i>Trustee

    s.38(3). The court must conclude that the applicable limitation period for the
    principal action is two years.</span></p>

    action arose on December 2, 1992 at the time he was suspended by the College.
    The limitation period which applied to any right of action which he may have
    had was six years. By reason of his death on December 21, 1992, this limitation
    period was truncated to two years from his death. The action, which included
    both the principal action and the <i>FLA</i> claims, was not commenced until
    April 28, 1995, more than two years after his death. The principal action was
    therefore statute-barred at that time. In accordance with <i>Murphy v. Welsh</i> and decisions of this court on this issue, the <i>FLA</i> claims brought by
    either the widow of the deceased or his children are also statute barred,
    regardless of the provisions of s.47 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> or s.2(8) of
