<b>DUNNET J. (ad hoc):</b>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal is brought from the dismissal of the appellants'
action pursuant to rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. The
motions judge held that the respondent orthopaedic surgeon, Dr.
F. Robert Southcott, had established that there was no genuine
issue for trial based on his finding that the appellants' claim
for medical malpractice was statute-barred under section 17 of
the Health Disciplines Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.4 (the &quot;Act&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Overview</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In 1974, the appellant, Sharyn Elaine Soper, suffered a
right knee injury in a motorcycle accident. In July 1991, the
respondent performed an arthroscopic examination of her knee
which revealed that there was a tear of the medial meniscus,
osteoarthritis and a torn posterior cruciate ligament.
Consequently on November 6, 1991, the respondent performed a
posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction of the appellant's
knee at the St. Thomas-Elgin Hospital (the &quot;hospital&quot;).
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     a)   appellant's knowledge
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In November 1991, the appellant began to keep a diary with
details concerning the condition of her knee, as well as doctors'
appointments, hospital admissions and surgical procedures. Her
daughter, a nurse, expressed concerns regarding her care and
treatment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On January 3, 1992, the appellant reported to the respondent
that she had fallen on her right knee three days earlier and
there was an effusion present. On January 17, 1992, the appellant
was re-admitted to hospital by the respondent to manipulate her
knee in order to improve its range of motion. The knee was also
debrided. She was discharged on January 29, 1992. Two days later,
the appellant was admitted to hospital again, suffering from
septic arthritis of her knee. She was discharged on February 20,
1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On June 1, 1992, the appellant was admitted to hospital for
a further debridement performed by the respondent. On July 27,
1992, in the respondent's absence, she was seen by another
orthopaedic surgeon, who admitted her to hospital for acute
synovitis of her knee. While in hospital, the appellant attempted
to solicit a second medical opinion without success because of
her concerns about the condition of her knee. She remained under
the care of the respondent until October 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant was eventually referred to another orthopaedic
surgeon in January 1993, and from March 8 until March 22, 1993,
she was admitted to hospital because of infection in her knee.
She underwent arthroscopic debridement, sub-total synovectomy and
irrigation of the knee. She was discharged home on a course of
six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, following which her right
knee infection was eradicated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     b)   retention of legal counsel
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On April 26, 1993, the appellant consulted a solicitor to
investigate and determine whether there was any basis for
proceeding with a medical negligence claim. In July 1993, the
solicitor sought and received approval to have the investigation
funded by the Ontario Legal Aid Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;). In August
1993, the solicitor requested the hospital records. He did not
request the clinical notes and records from the respondent.

[8]  In November 1993, the appellant was advised by her treating
orthopaedic surgeon that she had two options: a high tibial
osteotomy or total knee replacement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  On December 20, 1993, the solicitor received the hospital
records and the following day, he sent them to a consultant he
had retained in order to assist him in assembling the relevant
documentation for submission to a medical expert for an opinion
as to whether the respondent had been negligent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In January 1994, the solicitor received a report from the
appellant's treating orthopaedic surgeon commenting on the
current condition of her knee and suggesting that replacement
surgery may be required. In June 1994, he sought approval from
the Plan to obtain an opinion on the issue of medical negligence.
As a result of correspondence he received from the Plan, the
solicitor obtained instructions from the appellant in the late
fall of 1994 to discontinue investigation of the claim pursuant
to the terms of a Legal Aid Certificate and to retain an expert.
On December 19, 1994, the appellant underwent a total knee
replacement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The statement of claim was issued on March 30, 1995. The
medical expert opinion was sought in May of 1995 and received in
July of that year. The expert was of the opinion that had more
aggressive therapy occurred initially, the joint infection might
have been avoided.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Findings of the Motions Judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The motions judge held that on December 20, 1993, when the
appellant's solicitor received the medical reports from the
hospital, which included the clinical notes and records of the
respondent, the appellant had in her possession all the necessary
facts from which it could be determined whether the respondent
breached the applicable standard of care. He stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Before she retained counsel, she knew that
          she had had an infection in her knee joint,
          which had persisted for some time. She knew
          that the infection had flowed from the
          surgery performed by Dr. Southcott. She had
          several subsequent operations. As early as
          November 1991, her daughter, who was a nurse,
          expressed concerns to her about the care and
          treatment she was receiving from Dr.
          Southcott and stated she could not understand
          why the plaintiff was not hospitalized and
          treated with intravenous antibiotics. On July
          27, 1992, the plaintiff expressed concerns to
          her family physician about the care and
          treatment she was receiving from Dr.
          Southcott.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                            . . . .
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The allegations of negligence against Dr.
          Southcott, which are contained in the
          statement of claim, parallel those in the
          expert's opinion; namely, that the infection
          was the cause of the plaintiff's difficulties
          and that Dr. Southcott had failed to monitor
          the infection satisfactorily and had failed
          to order a sufficiently aggressive course of
          antibiotic treatment to prevent or counteract
          it. If the statement of claim could be issued
          on March 30, 1995, before the expert's report
          was obtained, I do not see why it could not
          have been issued within one year from the
          date upon which the hospital records were
          received. The fact that the statement of
          claim was issued before the expert report was
          received and contained allegations of
          negligence that echoed the expert opinion
          demonstrates that the plaintiff was already
          in possession of sufficient facts with which
          to allege negligence.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The motions judge found that the appellant had more than
sufficient time within the year after receiving the medical
records on December 20, 1993 to fulfil her duty to act reasonably
and diligently to complete whatever investigation was necessary
and to acquire whatever opinion was needed to satisfy herself
that the respondent had failed to meet the applicable standard of
care.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Analysis
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Section 17 of the Act provides:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          17.   No duly registered member of a College
          is liable to any action arising out of
          negligence and malpractice in respect of
          professional services requested or rendered
          unless such action is commenced within one
          year from the date when the person commencing
          the action knew or ought to have known the
          fact or facts upon which the person alleges
          negligence or malpractice.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In Findlay v. Holmes, (unreported, July 3, 1998) this court
applied the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Peixeiro
v. Haberman (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 429 in holding that the
discoverability principle postpones the running of the statutory
limitation period until the plaintiff knows, or by reasonable
diligence could have known, the material facts upon which to
bring an action. Further, this court also held, in adopting the
reasoning of White J. in Gaudet et al., v. Levy et al. (1984), 47
O.R. (2d) 577 (H.C.J.), that s. 17 of the Act requires the
plaintiff to act with reasonable diligence in discovering the
material fact or facts upon which to found an action in
negligence or malpractice. In Findlay, we stated that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is a question of fact depending on the
          circumstances of the case as a whole, as to
          when knowledge of the material fact or facts
          was acquired by the plaintiff. While in many
          cases, as suggested by White J., the facts
          will only become known upon receipt of a
          medical opinion with respect to the
          applicable standard of care, there will also
          be cases where the plaintiff will have actual
          or deemed knowledge of the material facts:
          immediately after the surgery or treatment,
          some time later if the results are unexpected
          but the plaintiff is advised to wait until
          the problem resolves, or upon receipt of the
          clinical history.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc. (1998), 156
D.L.R. (4th) 222, this court dealt with the proper role of a
judge when hearing a motion for summary judgment and the
applicability of the discovery rule in relation to the Family Law
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, ss. 2(8) and 61(4). Speaking for the
court, Borins J.(ad hoc) states at p.229:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the application of the discoverability
          rule to the facts of a particular case
          necessarily requires a finding of fact about
          when the plaintiff discovered the facts in
          respect to the remedy sought, or, through
          reasonable diligence, ought to have
          discovered the facts.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In any motion for summary judgment, the judge is to decide
whether the moving party has established that there is no genuine
issue for trial. The evidence on the motion must satisfy the
court that there is no issue of material fact which requires a
trial for its resolution. Borins J. points out that the court's
function is not to resolve the issue of fact, but rather to
determine whether a genuine issue of fact exists. He goes on to
say in Aguonie at pp.235-6:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...it must be clear to the motions judge,
          where the motion is brought by the defendant,
          as in this appeal, that it is proper to
          deprive the plaintiffs of their right to a
          trial. Summary judgment, valuable as it is
          for striking through sham claims and defences
          which stand in the way to a direct approach
          to the truth of a case, was not intended to,
          nor can it, deprive a litigant of his or her
          right to a trial unless there is a clear
          demonstration that no genuine issue exists,
          material to the claim or defence, which is
          within the traditional province of a trial
          judge to resolve.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Ontario New Home Warranty Program v. 567292
          Ontario Ltd. (1990), 71 O.R. (2d) 535 (Ont.
          H.C.) is a case which illustrates that,
          generally speaking, it is not appropriate for
          a motions judge, hearing a motion for summary
          judgment where the application of the
          discoverability rule is central to its
          resolution, to resolve this issue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Where a defendant pleads a statutory limitation period, the
plaintiff has the burden of proving that the cause of action
arose within the limitation period (Clemens v. Brown (1958), 13
D.L.R. (2d) 488 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 491). Where a defendant brings
a motion for summary judgment based on a statutory limitation
period and the plaintiff adduces evidence giving rise to material
facts requiring a trial in order to evaluate credibility, weigh
evidence and draw factual inferences, if the defendant satisfies
the court that there is no issue of fact requiring a trial for
its resolution, the defendant will have satisfied the
requirements of rule 20.  The limitation defence then will have
been made out.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The appellant submits that her claim against the respondent
raises genuine issues for trial. She states that while the
respondent was treating her, she was unhappy with the result, but
she had no reason to believe that the infection or its recurrence
was caused by inadequate or inappropriate treatment, and this is
a question of credibility which requires a trial for its
resolution.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Further, she submits that there is no evidence that the
hospital records contain evidence that the respondent failed to
adhere to the appropriate standard of care. Moreover, the motions
judge was unable to say that the medical records contained facts
upon which the appellant could allege negligence because he did
not have the records before him on the motion to make such a
finding. The limitation period, therefore, could not commence
until the appellant received a professional medical opinion as to
the appropriate standard of care.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The appellant also submits that the issue of whether the
actions of the appellant fell below that which a reasonable
person conducting a diligent investigation of the facts would
have done is a question of fact which should be determined by a
tribunal of fact, capable of hearing the witnesses, assessing
credibility, hearing expert evidence and looking at a complete
history of the matter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The respondent submits that the appellant had actual
knowledge of the facts upon which she alleges negligence more
than one year before the action was commenced. Prior to retaining
counsel in April 1993, she knew that she had an infection in her
knee which had persisted and she knew that the infection had
flowed from the surgery in November 1991. The same month, her
daughter had concerns about her treatment and in July 1992, the
appellant herself expressed concerns to her family doctor about
her treatment by the respondent. In the alternative, she, through
her solicitor, had actual knowledge of the requisite facts by
December 1993 when she received the medical records from the
hospital pertaining to her treatment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The respondent states that Aguonie, supra, is
distinguishable because the Family Law Act expressly empowers the
court to extend the limitation period, whereas there is no
similar provision available in the Act. In addition, there is
nothing unusual about facts surrounding limitation defences that
make them any less ascertainable on summary judgment motions than
other facts that are adjudicated upon such motions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The motions judge held that upon receipt of the hospital
records, the appellant had in her possession sufficient facts
upon which she could allege negligence. There was no evidence
that the records were missing a material fact which the appellant
required before she could recognize a cause of action. There was
no issue before him as to the sufficiency of the records. He
examined the statement of claim and knew that the hospital
records were in hand. Consequently, he was driven to the
inescapable conclusion that the material facts were known to the
appellant in December 1993. Moreover, between December 1993 and
March 1995, no significant steps were undertaken in the
prosecution of the investigation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] In Law v. Kingston General Hospital (1983), 42 O.R. (2d) 476
(H.C.J.) Griffiths J. held at p. 479:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In many cases, I suspect that the
          necessary facts will not be acquired by the
          plaintiff alleging medical malpractice until
          his solicitor has had a reasonable
          opportunity to review all pertinent hospital
          and medical records. Section 17 prescribes
          that the time will run when the plaintiff
          knows or ought to have known of facts upon
          which he asserts allegations of negligence.
          That time will frequently run from the moment
          the solicitor for the plaintiff carrying out
          diligent investigation is first apprised of
          all the facts. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">And, to the same effect, White J. in Gaudet, supra, at p. 582:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is a question of fact as to when the
          information developed by his solicitor or by
          himself has reached the stage that a
          reasonably prudent person, with appropriate
          access to medical knowledge (appropriate in
          the sense of that which could be discovered
          by a reasonably prudent solicitor, or
          plaintiff following a reasonably diligent
          investigation) would have determined that he
          had prima facie grounds for inferring that
          his doctor had been negligent or had engaged
          in malpractice upon him. [Emphasis in
          Original.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Limitation periods are not enacted to be ignored. The plaintiff
is required to act with due diligence in acquiring facts in order
to be fully apprized of the material facts upon which a
negligence or malpractice claim can be based. This includes
acting with diligence in requesting and receiving a medical
opinion, if required, so as not to delay the commencement of the
limitation period. In some cases, a medical opinion will be
necessary to know whether to institute an action. In other cases,
it will be possible to know material facts without a medical
opinion, and the medical opinion itself will simply be required
as evidence in the litigation. In the latter instances, the time
of receipt of the medical opinion is immaterial to the
commencement of the running of the limitation period.

Disposition
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] I agree with the motions judge that the appellant had in her
possession, material facts upon which to found her claim once her
solicitor was in receipt of the hospital records, which included
the clinical notes and records of the respondent. She is deemed,
therefore, to have been in possession of the material facts on
December 20, 1993. Contrary to the submissions of the appellant,
the allegations against the respondent in the statement of claim
are not mere speculation. Such allegations could only have been
gleaned from the hospital records. As the motions judge found,
they parallel those in the expert's opinion. Accordingly,
applying the principles enunciated in Aguonie, supra, there is no
genuine issue for trial on the question of the applicability of
s.17 of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] I would dismiss the appeal, but in the circumstances,
without costs.
