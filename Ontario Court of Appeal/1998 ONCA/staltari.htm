    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property in Ottawa, Ontario.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The respondent had a listing agreement for the sale of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property. The listing agreement provided for an exclusive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marketing period to the listing agent of ten days from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">completion of a marketing brochure, and thereafter for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">commission to be shared equally between selling and listing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brokers. However, it also stated that the vendor would not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liable to any broker other than the listing broker, and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">listing broker would indemnify the vendor against any claim from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a &quot;co-operating&quot; broker.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant knew of the project and the listing agreement,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and informed the respondent that it wished to introduce</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prospective purchasers to the property. In response, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent sent a letter to the appellant setting out the terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon which the appellant could market the property. The only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">portion of that letter which could be construed as any form of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractual offer reads:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ....commencing Monday, October 10th, we will
          consider prospect registrations from
          recognized commercial real estate brokers,
          including yourself, of clients not already
          contacted in writing or by phone by Colliers
          [the respondent], with respect to our
          exclusive listing of Amesbrooke Development.
          Any such registration of a prospective
          purchaser by an outside broker, must be
          approved by Colliers in advance of
          confidential information regarding the
          subject property being provided to such
          prospects.
          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Although it does not seem to have been of concern to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, it should be noted that there is no provision in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">listing agreement for registration with the respondent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prospective clients. In addition, the listing agreement requires</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent to co-operate with other agents in marketing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On October ll, the day after the expiration of the exclusive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">marketing period, the appellant faxed a letter to the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">asking that SGM Investments Ltd. be registered as a prospect. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent provided written confirmation of the registration of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">SGM that same day.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The next day, October 12, Mr. Staltari of the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation met with Mr. Levinson, the president of SGM, to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discuss the property. On his return from his meeting with Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Levinson, a faxed letter from the respondent was awaiting him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rescinding the registration of SGM as his prospect, because SGM</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had already been contacted about the property by the respondent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Apparently, there was more than one principal of SGM and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge found that a different representative had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contacted by the respondent before October 11. There was evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to support that conclusion and we would not interfere with it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  If there was a contract between the parties, it was based on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the offer from the respondent that prospects would be registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if they had not been previously contacted by the respondent. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acceptance of the offer was the appellant's letter requesting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registration of SGM. The respondent's written confirmation merely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmed the acceptance.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The real question is not whether the court could grant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relief from the respondent's mistake when it first confirmed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registration of SGM but, rather, whether the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acceptance fulfilled the terms of the offer -- i.e., whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prospect named in its letter, SGM, was a prospect not already</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contacted by the respondent. Because of the finding of the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge that SGM had already been contacted by the respondent prior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the end of the exclusive marketing period, the acceptance by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff did not comply with the pre-condition of the offer.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  When the respondent first confirmed the registration, it did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so on the basis that the acceptance did comply. As soon as it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found out that SGM had already been contacted by Colliers, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error of the respondent in its original registration of SGM as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prospective client of the appellant was very quickly remedied,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and caused no damage to the appellant. Therefore, there was no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">valid contract, and no actionable estoppel by conduct.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The trial judge awarded solicitor and client costs to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent from the date of an offer from it to settle the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action. Rule 49 does not provide for solicitor and client costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in a situation such as this, and they should be awarded in cases</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only where there are very special circumstances; none exists in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The judgment is varied only to the extent of striking out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the provision dealing with costs and substituting therefor an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award of costs throughout on a party and party basis. In all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other respects the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
