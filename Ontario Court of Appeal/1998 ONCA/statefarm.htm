    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">                     ENDORSEMENT
</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]     The  motions judge's conclusion is stated at p.8  of  her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons as follows:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            I  find  that  wording of  Royal  Policy
            especially Endorsement #2 makes it clear
            that  the  Royal policy was intended  to
            provide  coverage excess  to  any  other
            primary  coverage in effect.  The  State
            Farm  policy  is  only excess  to  other
            property   insurance   on   specifically
            described property.  The Royal policy is
            not  property  insurance on specifically
            described property.  On a plain reading,
            the  Royal policy is excess to the State
            Farm policy.


       Endorsement #2 reads as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                      OTHER INSURANCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            Notwithstanding   Condition   9,   Other
            Insurance,  of Section IV  -  Commercial
            General  Liability Conditions, we  shall
            not  be  liable if, at the  time  of  an
            occurrence covered by this policy, there
            is  any other insurance which would have
            attached  had  this insurance  not  been
            effected   except  that  this  insurance
            shall  apply only as excess  and  in  no
            event  as  contributing  insurance,  and
            then only after all other insurance  has
            been exhausted by virtue of losses paid.
            (emphasis added)

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The motions judge has read this endorsement as applying to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any  outstanding  insurance coverage as if  the  wording  of  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  been effected&quot;.  These words imply that a policy would have,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but did not in the result, attach because of the existence of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Royal  policy.   Among  such  policies  that  were  canvassed  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument,  the one that fits the description of this  subjunctive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expression  is a policy which declares that it has no application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if  another  policy provides coverage; what has  been  termed  an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]     In our view it is a sensible and complete application  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  meaning  of  the words in the policy to  conclude  that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention was to &quot;trump&quot; escape clauses in other policies, rather</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">than  to say that the provisions of s.9 were inapplicable to  any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstance where there was another policy providing coverage.
