    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by the defendants Kenneth James and James


and Associates from the order of Trafford J. of the Ontario Court

(General Division), sitting as a motions judge, wherein he

dissolved an order of Hollingworth J. as against the appellants.

Trafford J. also dismissed the action framed in conspiracy to

defraud as against the appellants and awarded costs of the action

on a party and party scale fixed in the amount of $9,950.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  The appellant Kenneth James is a barrister and solicitor and

carries on the practice of law in the cities of Toronto and

Brampton under the firm style of James and Associates. The

individual respondents are trustees of the Church of Jesus Christ

of Latter Day Saints (hereinafter the &quot;Church&quot;) and the President

of the Lethbridge Stake is the landholding corporation and agent

of the Church in Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  On October 23, 1990, the respondents commenced proceedings

against the defendants by way of action. The action claimed that

from at least January 1989 until September 1990, the defendants,

including the appellants, wrongfully and maliciously conspired

and combined among themselves to defraud and to injure the

respondents to this appeal. The fraud alleged related to the

acquisition by the appellants and other defendants of certain

lands for the Church using Church funds, which lands were

subsequently and secretly conveyed to nominees of the defendants

and then partially reconveyed to the Church at grossly inflated

prices. The defendants were said to have retained some of the

lands for themselves in addition to having realised a secret

profit on the so-called &quot;flip&quot; of the properties reconveyed. In

addition, the defendants were alleged to have misrepresented

themselves as acting on behalf of the plaintiff Church in the

initial acquisitions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  The relief claimed included, inter alia:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">    (a)  an interim and interlocutory order restraining the

appellants from dealing with deposit monies of $21,000 and

restraining the appellants from removing records and documents

located in the offices of the appellants;

    (b)  an interim and interlocutory order authorizing the

respondents to enter forthwith the premises of the appellants for

the purpose of removing documents and records into the custody of

the respondents' solicitor;

     (c) an accounting, judgment for the deposits in the amount of

$21,000, damages of $2,000,000, punitive damages and solicitor

and client costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  On motion made by the respondents without notice before

Hollingworth J. on October 23, 1990, the respondents obtained an

interim and interlocutory order within the framework of the above

claims. The order is referred to variously by the parties as a

Mareva injunction and an Anton Piller order. Indeed, the order

comprised both of these extraordinary interlocutory remedies.

Specifically, as regards these appellants, the order restrained

and enjoined them from transferring, removing, disposing of,

destroying or otherwise dealing with records and documents of all

land negotiations contained in their offices, and authorized the

respondents' duly authorized representatives to enter upon the

premises of the appellants for the purpose of searching for and

removing into the custody of the respondents' solicitors

documents and records relating to the said land negotiations and

transactions. The order also directed the Sheriff to accompany

the respondents' agents to assist and keep the peace during the

execution of the said order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  In moving for this interlocutory relief, the respondents

made the usual undertaking pursuant to rule 40.03 of the Rules of

Civil Procedure that they would abide by any order concerning

damages that the court might make if it ultimately appeared that

the granting of the order has caused damage to the responding

party for which the moving party ought to compensate the

responding party.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  Pursuant to the order of Hollingworth J., the respondents'

authorized representatives entered upon the premises of the

appellants without notice on October 24, 1990 and searched for

and removed into the custody of the respondents' solicitors

documents and records relating to the said land negotiations and

transactions. The respondents also notified the Law Society of

Upper Canada of the allegations against the appellants and the

Society commenced an investigation of the matter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  In their statement of defence, delivered on December 17,

1990, the appellants denied all the allegations made against

them. They have done so consistently throughout these

proceedings.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  In spite of the seriousness of the allegations, and the

length of time that the action was outstanding, this matter never

proceeded to trial. We are advised that the respondents settled

the action with respect to the defendants other than the

appellants. In February 1991, the Church reached a settlement

with the co-defendant King, the terms of which are confidential.

In February of 1992, the Church reached a settlement with the

remaining co-defendants, except the appellants. The terms of this

settlement were also confidential, but we were advised that they

did include, inter alia, that the action be dismissed as against

those co-defendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] However, the action against the appellants was not

dismissed. Nor has the action been pursued by the respondents.

There has been no examination for discovery with respect to the

main action. Nor have affidavits of documents been exchanged or

interlocutory motions made in connection with the main action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] By notice of motion returnable on November 3, 1992 before

the Master in Toronto, the respondents sought leave to

discontinue the action as against the appellants, on a without

costs basis. An affidavit of Gerald Hyde was filed in support of

the motion. An affidavit sworn by the appellant James was filed

by the appellants. Although the appellants did in April 1993

cross-examine Hyde on his affidavit, the respondents never cross-

examined the appellant James on his affidavit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] On October 30, 1995, the plaintiff's motion for leave to

discontinue the action as against the appellants was adjourned by

Master Peterson sine die to be brought back in Weekly Court

before a judge on a date to be fixed by the Registrar. It was

subsequently made returnable on December 5, 1995. At the same

time the appellants brought a motion before a Judge in Weekly

Court, for an Order, inter alia:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  dissolving as against the appellants the Order of the

Hollingworth, J.;

     (b)  dismissing this action as against the appellants with

costs on a solicitor and client basis;

     (c)  directing a reference or trial of the issue as to the

damages suffered by the appellants by reason of the granting of

the Order of Hollingsworth, J. as continued.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] Tafford J. heard the motions On December 5, 1995. He

dissolved the order of Hollingsworth J., as continued, as the

against the appellant, and dismissed the action as against the

appellants with costs of this action on a party and party scale

fixed in the amount of $9,950.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><strong>
Issue</strong>   Did the motions judge err in not granting costs to

the appellants on a solicitor and client basis in view of the

undertaking as to damages given by the plaintiffs at the time

they sought the injunction and other relief?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] The motions judge proceeded on the basis that he was

satisfied that when the statement of claim was issued, the

plaintiffs had a reasonable basis to believe that the defendants

(the appellants in this hearing) were parties to a dishonest

scheme to defraud the Church through a series of land &quot;flips&quot;. He

acknowledged that the appellants continued to assert their

integrity but that a full trial would be necessary to determine

this issue between the parties. He found that there were no

damages caused by the issue of the interim injunction and

therefore no basis to enforce the undertaking as to damages given

on the motion to obtain the injunction. He awarded the

appellant's party and party costs fixed at $9,950.00. He awarded

to the respondent Church the costs of the motion before him,

fixed at $750.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] It seems to me, with respect to the motions judge, that he

treated the issue of costs solely as an exercise of his

discretion in an abandoned action. In this situation, costs

follow the event and in the ordinary case they would be

restricted to party and party costs. Since the action was

justified, in the opinion of the motions judge, there was no

basis for imposing an additional sanction on the plaintiffs

simply because they had alleged fraud.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] This position is supported on appeal by counsel for the

Church who relies upon the recent decision of the Supreme Court

of Canada in Young v. Young, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3. The Young case

involved the award of solicitor and client costs by a trial judge

in a custody action because in his opinion the custody claim had

&quot;little merit&quot;, the respondent attempted to mislead the court,

was recalcitrant with respect to complying with interim orders

and unnecessary proceedings had resulted: (1989), 24 R.F.L. (3d)

193 (B.C. S.C.). The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld this

award with respect to a total of four days of the trial and four

days of interlocutory proceedings: (1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 46. On

further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the appeal on this

issue was dismissed. McLachlin J. stated at p.34:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The Court of Appeal's order was
          based on the following principles with which
          I agree. Solicitor-client costs are generally
          awarded only where there has been
          reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous
          conduct on the part of one of the parties.
          Accordingly, the fact that an application has
          little merit is no basis for awarding
          solicitor-client costs; nor is the fact that
          part of the costs of the litigation may have
          been paid by others. The Court of Appeal
          meticulously considered all the proceedings
          in the light of these principles to arrive at
          its conclusion that only partial solicitor-
          client costs were justified.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] However, I am not convinced that Young is determinative on

the facts before us, as it involves instances of trial

misconduct. It does not address the entitlement of a successful

party to claim his expenses in retaining a solicitor as his

damages within the meaning of an undertaking as to damages. In my

opinion, the approach of the motions judge to the motion in

appeal was in error. He found that there were no damages in the

action because the result of the settlement was that the lands

allegedly withheld from the Church and the secret profit said to

have been made were remitted to the Church. The respondents'

counsel supports this finding and argues that since the appellant

and denied that they had benefited from a secret profit, they had

suffered no damage in the action. This may be so, but what of the

appellants' legitimate expenses in hiring a lawyer to defend

themselves against the unproven allegations of professional

misconduct and conspiracy to defraud? Are these not damages in

the circumstances of this case?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] The result arrived at by the motions judge is not consonant

with the critical role played by undertakings made in pursuit of

interlocutory relief. They find their origins in equity. It is

trite law, but bears repeating here, that a plaintiff's

undertaking as to damages reflects the recognition by the court

of the risk that a defendant may be wrongfully damaged by an

injunction granted on a summary hearing. Courts exercising

equitable jurisdiction have long required undertakings before

exercising their powers in this regard; rule 40.03 is but the

codification of this equitable principle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] The importance of an undertaking is all the more critical

when the interlocutory relief sought and granted consists of

Mareva injunctions and Anton Pillar orders, as was the case here.

In addition, the increasing ease with which plaintiffs may obtain

interlocutory relief necessarily requires correspondingly

enforced undertakings. In this regard, I adopt the language of

Zuber, J.A., writing in Nelson Burns &amp; Co. et al. v. Gratham

Industries Ltd (1987), 23 C.P.C. (2d) 279 (Ont C.A.) at 288:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          As a result of a decision of the
          House of Lords in American Cyanamid Co. v.
          Ethicon Ltd, [1975] A.C. 396, [1975] 1 All
          E.R. 504, the balance of convenience test has
          largely displaced an earlier view that an
          applicant could obtain an interlocutory
          injunction only if he could show a strong
          prima facie case. Whatever the differences
          may be between the two standards, it is now
          plain that in Ontario interlocutory
          injunctions are easier to obtain than was the
          case prior to the American Cyanamid case.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Because of this change, and because
          of the number of such injunctions that are
          sought, it is appropriate to emphasise the
          serious nature of the undertaking to pay
          damages which is a condition of the issuance
          of the interlocutory injunction. In the
          ordinary course the unsuccessful plaintiff
          must understand that he is obliged to pay
          damages in accordance with his undertaking
          without quibble, and Courts generally will be
          unsympathetic towards those who seek to
          resile from such an obligation.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Although there is discretion, both in equity and in rule

40.03, to excuse a plaintiff of its obligations under an

undertaking, there is no reason in this case to excuse the

respondents. There is no &quot;special circumstance&quot;, to use the

language of Vieweger Construction Co. v. Rush &amp; Tompkins

Construction Ltd., [1965] S.C.R. 195 (S.C.C), that would lead

this court to excuse this plaintiff. Although it is open to a

plaintiff to argue that it sought the interlocutory relief in

good faith, that is seldom a determinative factor in deciding

whether an undertaking will be enforced; see Trustees of Wasaga

Beach v. Fielding, [1947] O.R. 321 (H.C.), affirmed [1947] O.R.

1012 (Ont. C.A.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] There is at least one Ontario case that suggests that

damages following the granting of interlocutory relief cannot

include a defendant's costs. In Israel Discount Bank of Canada v.

Genova (1992), 13 C.P.C (3d) 112 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), the

plaintiff commenced proceedings against a number of defendants

which it claimed had attempted to defeat its interest in a

mortgage and to defraud the plaintiff of the proceeds of the sale

of the property at fair market value. It obtained a Mareva

injunction and an Anton Pillar order pending trial, and made the

corresponding rule 40.03 undertaking. The defendants brought a

motion before the court requesting that the interlocutory relief

be lifted and that their costs be awarded, on a solicitor and

client basis, under the rubric of damages flowing from the

undertaking.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22] Dunnet J. lifted the interlocutory order [reasons reported

at (1992), 13 C.P.C. (3d) 114] but found that an award of damages

could not include a party's costs, on any scale. Dunnet J.

canvassed the cases cited by counsel, and found at p. 115 that

none could be taken as directly holding that an award of costs

could not be made under the rubric of damages; however, she found

that they could be taken as &quot;indirect&quot; authority for that

proposition.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] Central to Dunnet J.'s analysis was her interpretation of

Deisler v. U.S. Fidelity Co., [1917] 3 W.W.R. 214 (B.C. C.A.),

affirmed (sub nom. The United States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co. v.

Deisler) (1917), 59 S.C.R. 676., which she took as authority for

the proposition that an award made upon an undertaking may not

include the costs of the action. There, an action had been

brought upon a bond entered into to secure the damages that might

be recovered in an action. The plaintiff sought interlocutory

relief prohibiting the defendant from further trespasses upon the

plaintiff's mineral claim. The defendant, seeking to prevent the

granting of such relief, entered into a bond in which it

guaranteed it would &quot;pay all such damages as may be awarded to

the Y plaintiff Y&quot;. To give effect to this bond, the defendant

provided a security of $25,000; Deisler, supra, reasons of Martin

J.A., at 216. The plaintiff having succeeded at trial, it sued on

the bond, claiming that the award ought to comprise damages,

interest thereupon, and its costs in the action. The trial court

awarded all three. The defendant appealed on the award of costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[24] For a 2 to 1 majority, MacDonald C.J.A held at p. 216 that

costs ought not have been awarded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The defendant agreed to pay the
          damages recovered in that action and nothing
          more. At the time the bond was executed the
          action was pending, and if it had been
          intended to secure the payment of costs also,
          one would expect that such a term would have
          been included in the bond.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[25] The Supreme Court upheld this decision without reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[26] I do not believe that Deisler may be taken as dispositive of

the question in Israel Discount Bank of Canada and before this

court in the instant case. I say so for three reasons. First, it

is critical to note that in Deisler, it was the defendant who had

made an 'undertaking' in the form of a bond. This runs completely

contrary to our current practice, in which it is the party

seeking interlocutory relief who must bear the risk of paying

damages should it be unsuccessful in the main action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[27] Second, the B.C. Court of Appeal clearly determined the

availability of costs on its reading of the bond as a contract

between the two parties. Had the parties wished to include costs

in the bond, they were free to do so. Such an approach of strict

construction may have been correct on those facts, but it is not

an appropriate way of interpreting undertakings. It has been

repeatedly held that undertakings do not create a relationship

between two parties and are not contractual in nature; see

Digital Equipment Corp. v. Darkrest Ltd., [1984] Ch. 512; John F.

Renshaw (Canada) Inc. v. Captiva Investments Ltd. (1989), 70 O.R.

(2d) 458 (H.C.J.). In our case, what is required is an

interpretation of the word &quot;damages' that gives effect to Rule

40.03, rather than a approach based in the law of contract.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[28] Third, the approach that Dunnet J. takes as being suggested

by Deisler is incompatible with the equitable origin of

undertakings, and unduly limits the discretion that is found both

in equity as well as in rule 40.03. In my opinion, this

discretion is wide enough, in the appropriate circumstances, to

include an award of costs. As Spry writes in Equitable Remedies

(5th ed.) (Toronto: Carswell, 1997) at p. 487:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Y the power of the court Y to
          require an undertaking of any kind from the
          plaintiff or to impose any condition before
          granting an interlocutory injunction is very
          wide, and it is not limited to particular
          classes of undertakings or conditionsY.it may
          be exercised, not only wherever the balance
          of justice at that time would otherwise be
          found to incline against the grant of relief,
          but also if the giving of an undertaking or
          the imposing of a condition of the kind in
          question is desirable in order to enable the
          court more easily to achieve justice between
          the parties Y hence what are the precise
          conditions or undertakings that are
          appropriate in any particular case depends on
          the circumstances in question and,
          especially, on prospective hardship or
          prejudice to the parties and such other
          discretionary considerations as arise.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] I am of the opinion that as rule 40.03 is but the

codification of equitable practice, it is to be exercised within

the bounds of discretion dictated by equitable principles.

Accordingly, in the appropriate case, costs may indeed be awarded

under the rubric of damages. This is such a case. The appellants

endured, for more than five years, the damage to their

professional reputation that flows from the serious allegations

made here. In addition, they have borne the expense of defending

against the action and the attendant motions. Simply because they

had no stake in the substantive issues that were the basis of the

action is no reason to conclude that the interlocutory injunction

caused them no damage. The only issue that remains is the scale

on which the costs should be ordered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[30] This court has not previously decided the question before

us. However, there have been instances where a motions judge, in

an exercise of discretion in awarding costs on an abandoned or

discontinued action, has decided to elevate the usual scale of

costs to solicitor and client based upon the nature of the

allegations made in the action. Had this been done in the case in

appeal, the cost issue would be academic. While the case law on

this question is divided, it is instructive as to the factors

that motions judges have looked to in making such an award. Most

have found that an award on this scale is appropriate where

allegations of fraud and other serious malfeasance are either

baselessly made or are never proven at trial; where the effect of

the allegations made or of the granting of the interlocutory

relief is to seriously affect a defendant's professional

reputation; and where a plaintiff fails to retract unmeritorious

allegations in a timely fashion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[31] The appellants rightly identify Apotex Inc. v. Egis

Pharmaceuticals (1990), 2 O.R. (3d) 126 (Gen. Div.), leave to

appeal to Divisional Court refused, (1990), 2 O.R. (3d) 126n, as

a leading case on this question. It established the proposition

that the moving party for an interlocutory injunction ought to

pay the costs of the respondent on a solicitor and client basis

when the motion lacks merit and includes allegations of fraud,

deceit, and conspiracy. In that case, the plaintiff sought an

interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendant from entering

prematurely the Canadian market for a drug.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[32] When the motion was heard, the plaintiff had already entered

the market for the drug in advance of the defendant. Because

Henry J. concluded, at 129, that the &quot;allegations Y were made

without any acceptable evidentiary basis but were speculation

only&quot;, he held that it was &quot;a classic case for the award of

solicitor-and-client costs&quot; against the plaintiff for making

groundless accusations in support of an extraordinary remedy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[33] Lawson v. Toronto Hospital Corp. (1991), 52 O.A.C. 186 (Gen.

Div.) is another case that stands for the proposition that, where

a motion for interim relief is found to be baseless and is an

attack on the defendant's professional reputation, solicitor

client costs may be awarded. There, Davidson J. followed Apotex

and ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of several defendants

who were forced to defend against a motion for an interim

injunction on the solicitor and client scale. The plaintiff had

made but failed to prove &quot;very serious&quot; allegations of wrongdoing

against doctors and managers of the hospital over which &quot;the

professional integrity of the respondents was at stake.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[34] Coran v. Doyle, [1992] O.J. No. 991 (QL) (Gen. Div.)

involved a dispute over a sale of property that did not close

because the defendant defaulted. In addition to a claim of breach

of contract, the plaintiff alleged a fraudulent conveyance

involving the transfer of shares in a corporation among several

defendants. She sought an injunction and a certificate of pending

litigation against the defendants to restrain them from disposing

of shares in the corporation or of any interest in the property

until the final disposition of the action. The motion for an

injunction was dismissed for lack of merit and the plaintiff was

ordered to pay solicitor and client costs of the defendants on

the motion. It was not relevant, West J. determined, that this

dispute was between individuals of modest means while the Apotex

case involved large corporate competitors.</font></pre>

[35] In Singdeer Investments Ltd. v. Holiday Inns Inc. (1994), 47

A.C.W.S. (3d) 27 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), Dennis Lane J. imposed

solicitor and client costs on the plaintiff for its unsuccessful

motion seeking an injunction to prevent the breach of a lease and

a franchise agreement. The plaintiff had alleged that the co-

defendants conspired to negotiate a &quot;sham&quot; agreement to terminate

the franchise deal. The judge awarded solicitor and client costs

against the plaintiff in respect of one co-defendant but ordered

party-and-party costs in respect of the other defendant because

some of the plaintiff's allegations were proved to be true.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[36] A case in which the plaintiff abandoned its motion for an ex

parte injunction was Glanford Aviation Services Ltd. v. Marsh

(1993), 42 A.C.W.S. (3d) 794 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)). Unlike the

other cases, however, the claim for an injunction did not include

allegations of wrongdoing. Rather, the case involved allegations

of breach of contract. The plaintiff abandoned its motion after

the judge refused to grant the injunction without notice to the

defendants, and following two adjournments. Marshall J. granted

the defendant's request to be indemnified forthwith on the

solicitor-client scale on the basis that the defendants &quot;were

virtually pulled out of bed for the plaintiffs Y and worked very

hard to prepare adequate responses&quot; to the plaintiff's

submissions. In addition, the effect of the injunction would have

effectively been to prevent Marsh from doing business at all.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[37] In Yang v. Mao (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 466 (Gen. Div.), the

plaintiff obtained an interim Mareva injunction against the

defendant over allegations of fraud, misappropriation of funds,

and forgery. The injunction was dissolved when the defendant led

evidence that the plaintiff had forged some of the documents he

used to obtain the ex parte injunction. The plaintiff

subsequently withdrew the motion for an injunction without

explanation. In addition there was no indication that the

plaintiff intended to pursue the main action further. Winkler J.

determined that an award of solicitor and client costs against

the plaintiff was an appropriate sanction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[38] Further, Winkler J. held, at p. 476, that rule 37.09(3) of

the Rules of Civil Procedure places no restriction on a judge's

discretion to determine the scale of costs on an abandoned motion

because the rule is silent as to the scale of costs. He stated,

at 476-77:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the case of motions for
          injunctive relief and other extraordinary
          remedies, it is trite that the applicants
          must meet the highest standard of candour and
          disclosure to the court. This is particularly
          so in the case of a Mareva injunction. Y
          [W]here respondents to such motions are put
          to the expense of replying to a request for
          such relief, often on an emergency basis,
          only to have the motion abandoned or
          withdrawn when responding materials are
          served, the only means by which the court may
          punish such an abuse is by an award of
          solicitor and client costs. The case at bar
          is a case in point.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Mele v. Thorne Riddell (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 674 (Gen. Div.),

is, in my opinion, dipositive of this question. There, the

defendant obtained (under Rule 23.05) solicitor and client costs

of the action against the plaintiff--one of thirty-four plaintiffs

in the action--who had obtained leave to discontinue the action.

The statement of claim included unfounded allegations of fraud

and criminal behaviour, including accepting a secret commission,

that were not publicly withdrawn until the beginning of the

trial. Dambrot J. therefore concluded, at p. 677, that A[t]o

completely absolve [a] plaintiff of responsibility for unfounded

allegation because of [its] withdrawal at the courtroom door

would fail to deter reckless allegations from being pleaded in

the first instance, or maintained after they are known to be

without foundation&quot;. The judge also commented about the harm done

to the defendant's reputation as a result of having to defend

against allegations of wrongdoing, noting that such harm

continues as long as unfounded charges remain on the public

record. At p. 677 Drambot J. wrote:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          Where unfounded allegations of
          fraud or improper conduct seriously
          prejudicial to the character or reputation of
          a party are made in an action, a court may
          depart from the usual scale of costs and
          award costs on a solicitor-and-client scaleYA
          plaintiff who proceeds in this manner must be
          prepared for the cost consequences if the
          allegations turn out to be unfounded. Y
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] Ordinarily, this court will not interfere with an order of

costs. It is a classic exercise of discretion and will not be

treated lightly. However, I am not satisfied that the motions

judge recognised the significance of the undertaking as to

damages given by the defendants in order to obtain this most

intrusive injunctive relief against the appellant solicitors.

Instead of asking himself if it was reasonable for the plaintiffs

to assert fraud, in my opinion he should have addressed the issue

of whether the solicitor-client costs incurred by the appellants

in order to successfully defend themselves against the serious

allegations relating to their practice constituted damages within

the meaning of the undertaking. On my reading of the endorsement,

he appeared to have accepted the argument of the respondent

Church in this court that costs were outside the purview of

damages within the meaning of the undertaking.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[41] I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that costs on a

solicitor-client basis must always be granted pursuant to the

undertaking as to damages given by a plaintiff seeking injunctive

relief. But this is not to say that they are not warranted in the

particular case. I think the motions judge erred in not taking

into consideration whether the full costs of retaining a

solicitor fell within the ambit of the undertaking as to damages.

That undertaking was given to the court to obtain the injunction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[42] In my opinion, properly considered, this case more than

warranted an award of solicitor and client costs. Since the

respondents maintained to the end, including on this appeal, that

the allegations were true, such an award is the only public

rehabilitation of the appellants' reputation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
     Disposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[43] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order

of Trafford J. relating to costs and substitute an order on the

undertaking comprising costs on a solicitor and client basis to

be assessed. For the same reasons, I would also allow solicitor

and client costs to the appellants on the motion here and below.
