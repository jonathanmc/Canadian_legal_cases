    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">ABELLA J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Gordon Stuckless pleaded guilty before Watt J. to 24 counts
of indecent and sexual assault relating to an almost twenty-year
history of assaulting boys between the ages of 10 and 15.  His
total sentence was two years less a day, to be followed by
probation for three years.  The Crown appeals this sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  There were hundreds of incidents.  They occurred in Toronto
between 1968 and 1988 when Stuckless was working for Maple Leaf
Gardens as an assistant equipment manager, for Park Public School
and Lake Wilcox Public School as a teacher's assistant, and for a
number of local minor hockey and lacrosse teams as a volunteer
coach.  At the time of sentencing, Stuckless was 48 years old.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The details of the offences to which Stuckless pleaded
guilty are set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts, which
describes the methodology used by Stuckless as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... He would begin by befriending them.  In
          some cases he would also befriend the parents
          of the victims, thus gaining their trust.
          The parents would allow the victims to go to
          hockey games and movies with the accused.  In
          other cases, he would befriend the victims
          and gain their trust by allowing them into
          Maple Leaf Gardens for Toronto Maple Leaf
          practices, and for Toronto Toros and Toronto
          Marlies Hockey games.  He would take the
          victims to movies, buy them meals or give
          them hockey sticks or other memorabilia.
          Many of the children whom Stuckless abused
          came from low income families in Regent Park.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The sexual conduct with the boys included fondling them;
performing oral sex on them; having them perform oral sex on him;
masturbating them; having them masturbate him; masturbating in
front of them; mutual masturbation; rubbing against them until he
ejaculated; having the boys perform sexual acts with each other
in front of him and his Maple Leaf Gardens supervisor, George
Hanna, while he and Hanna masturbated; having the boys perform
oral sex on George Hanna; and participating with Hanna in group
sex with the boys.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The relationships with the boys lasted anywhere from several
days to several months or several years.  They took place in a
variety of locations, including Maple Leaf Gardens, the boys'
homes, movie theatres, classrooms, showers, cars, Cherry Beach,
and Stuckless' home.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The various impacts of the abuse on the victims included
depression, loneliness, trauma, shame, pain, guilt, nightmares,
helplessness, fear, loss of confidence, rage and self-hatred.
Some quit school, developed  a dependency on drugs and alcohol,
had difficulties in developing and maintaining personal
relationships, or required extensive counselling, all of which
impaired their ability to get or keep a job.  Many felt their
lives had been ruined.  There were several suicide attempts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Pursuant to R. v. Garcia and Silva, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124
(Ont. C.A.), additional facts were taken into account for
purposes of sentencing.  These facts related to one count of
sexual assault involving 7 victims, covering a period from 1978-
1987 in Toronto; and two counts of sexual assault involving a
single complainant in Newfoundland, covering a period from 1992-
1995.  Stuckless pleaded guilty to these offences in March, 1996
and was sentenced to 14 months, followed by a period of
probation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE REASONS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The sentencing judge observed that Stuckless' pattern was
initially to establish a &quot;relationship of trust and confidence
with his target&quot;, or to take advantage of an already established
position of trust by virtue of his being a teacher's assistant or
hockey coach.  He then, as Watt J. stated, &quot;consistently and
without apparent hesitation, violated the trust reposed in him.&quot;
His conduct was further described as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          His conduct was purposeful, his approach
          predatory.  He had but one goal in mind.  The
          boys were merely means to an end, the sexual
          gratification of Gordon Stuckless.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... [T]he crimes of Gordon Stuckless were an
          integral part of an overall scheme of
          defilement.  They were not situational,
          momentary lapses of judgment when reason was
          temporarily dethroned.  They were, rather,
          carefully orchestrated, deliberate and
          predatory.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          For nearly twenty (20) years, Gordon
          Stuckless systematically abused two (2) dozen
          vulnerable persons.  He cultivated, only to
          violate their trust.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          For nearly two (2) decades, Gordon Stuckless
          routinely targeted and cultivated more than
          two (2) dozen naive, often disadvantaged,
          boys to satisfy his own sexual fantasies and
          desires.  Equally routinely, he violated a
          position of authority and a trust that he had
          so assiduously created and sedulously
          fostered.  He was indifferent to his victims,
          unaware and uncaring of the effects,
          immediate and long term, on those whom he had
          victimized.  His approach was purposeful,
          predatory and single-minded.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Watt J. recognized that the offences left a &quot;profound and
enduring impression&quot; on the victims, but he nonetheless
emphasized that Stuckless &quot;neither caused nor threatened actual
bodily harm&quot; or force, &quot;apart from the coercion which is implicit
in conduct which takes place in the context of any relationship
where there is a power imbalance&quot; (emphasis added).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] He concluded, therefore, that while these offences would
warrant a substantial term of imprisonment, they would not
attract the maximum punishment of 10 years sought by the Crown.
In his view, &quot;the crimes of Gordon Stuckless are nearer to the
lower end of the spectrum... .&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] After reviewing the circumstances of the offences, Watt J.
then examined those of the offender.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Dr. Peter Collins, a Clarke Institute forensic psychiatrist
who first assessed Stuckless in 1995 in connection with his 1996
guilty plea, gave evidence for Stuckless at his sentencing
hearing.  Dr. Collins referred to an earlier period of group
treatment at the Clarke Institute resulting from a 1988
conviction for similar offences.  This was not a particularly
successful period of treatment, according to Dr. Collins, due to
Stuckless' failure to disclose or acknowledge that he was a
pedophile.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The diagnosis offered by Dr. Collins was that Stuckless was
a &quot;homosexual pedophile.&quot;  Because pedophilia relates to pre-
pubescent children, Stuckless was more particularly diagnosed as
a &quot;hebephile&quot;, that is, &quot;a variant of pedophila in which the
erotic choices are children who have reached pubescence.&quot;  Dr.
Collins concluded, however, that Stuckless was both a pedophile
and a hebephile.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] According to Dr. Collins, these are lifelong sexual
preferences for which there is no cure.  The &quot;mainstay&quot; of
treatment is sex-drive reducing medication.  Accompanying the
chemical injections, the treatment requires individual
counselling and participation in relapse prevention groups.  Dr.
Collins felt that Stuckless was motivated to take the medication,
and was in fact scheduled to start taking it a few days after he
was arrested on these charges.  This evidence was elicited during
the examination-in-chief of Dr. Collins:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   He came in to see me on February 3rd
          [1997].  I told him that I was going to refer
          him to our sexual behaviours clinic.  He was
          agreeable.  We discussed sex-drive reduction.
          He felt that he could do it on his own
          without medication.  I cautioned him that I
          didn't feel that this was very wise and he
          agreed to go on the medication.  (Emphasis
          added.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Okay.  And I understand that he was
          arrested prior to when the rest of that
          happened?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Yes.  The next time I was supposed to
          see him and start him on medication would
          have been February 11th, and I believe that
          is when, in between those appointments, when
          he was rearrested.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Dr. Collins also considered as positive the sex offender
treatment Stuckless received when he was incarcerated at the
Ontario Correctional Institute in 1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Dr. Collins acknowledged that it was a matter of some
controversy whether or not in-custody treatment of any kind is
effective.  In his own opinion, &quot;the important thing is what
happens once they leave.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The prognosis for Stuckless was clarified by Dr. Collins as
follows during his examination-in-chief and cross-examination:
Examination-in-chief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Nineteen ninety-seven, in January, he
          wasn't out long enough for us to know how
          much of this he was actually going to do, and
          I understand that, but having completed the
          full O.C.I. program, having contacted you,
          and assuming that he would carry through on
          his willingness to take medication, does that
          have any effect, those new facts, on his
          likeliness to reoffend?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Well, it lowers the risk.  I mean, if we
          start off at the base line that they're
          always at risk to reoffend, we're looking at
          risk-enhancing factors and risk-reducing
          factors.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Because he was admitting that he had a
          problem, had been through a program, and that
          program independently said that he was -- had
          done well, plus he was willing to have a
          trial with sex-drive-reducing medication,
          those are all risk-reducing factors for
          reoffending.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Cross-examination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Persons who suffer from pedophilia are
          always at risk to reoffend.  Do you agree?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   In my professional opinion, yes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   It's a life-long condition?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Yes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Persons of whatever preference they may
          be may continue to act well into their sixth
          and seventh decade and even beyond.  Isn't
          that correct?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   That is correct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Okay.  And I'm going to suggest to you
          that it follows from that, you know, that
          your real ability to evaluate the success of
          any treatment program for any individual,
          including that for the accused in this case,
          would be based upon -- your best ability to
          evaluate that treatment program would be
          after you have had a series of counselling
          sessions, experience on the drug in question,
          and after psychological testing and other
          testing procedures to evaluate the whole
          person?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Most definitely.  It's a longitudinal
          approach.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Right.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   You have to establish a rapport.  You
          have to have a therapeutic relationship, but
          you have to follow someone over a long period
          of time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Notwithstanding your favourable
          prognosis, there is nonetheless a risk that
          this accused, notwithstanding everything that
          we can do for him, will reoffend against
          other children?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   I say that generally of any pedophile,
          not just of Mr. Stuckless, but ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   But let's be clear.  You're also saying
          that about Mr. Stuckless, aren't you?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   I am saying that about Mr. Stuckless
          only because, in my limited contact with him,
          not in treating him in '95, but assessing
          him, he was now admitting that he was a
          pedophile.  And certainly that admission and
          the willingness for treatment continued until
          I saw him again in February 3rd, where I
          officially became his doctor on February 3rd.
          And he was then at least willing to take sex-
          drive-reducing medication. You're a hundred
          per cent correct that it would have been a
          period of time afterwards to see whether that
          treatment or willingness to engage in
          treatment continued.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   And that's when you would be in the best
          position to assess the risk, after?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Absolutely.  I can only give a
          professional opinion based on having assessed
          hundreds of these individuals, and he still
          falls within a group that I felt has many
          risk-reducing factors.  But the proof is what
          happens over a period of time.  (Emphasis
          added.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In addition to the evidence of Dr. Collins, Watt J. took
favourable notice of the enthusiastic report of Stuckless'
progress from April, 1996 to January, 1997 at the Ontario
Correctional Institute, his gainful employment during his adult
life, his guilty plea, and his genuine remorse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Having reviewed the nature of the offences and the offender,
Watt J. then undertook an examination of the relevant sentencing
principles.  He reiterated the objectives of sentencing outlined
in s. 718 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as am. by
S.C. 1995, c. 22, s.6, including denunciation, deterrence,
separation from society of offenders where necessary,
rehabilitation, responsibility, and harm to victims.  He noted
that sentences should be reduced or increased, depending on
whether there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances
relating to the offence or the offender (s. 718.2(a)), and that
abusing a position of trust or authority is an aggravating
circumstance (s. 718.2(a)(iii)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] He noted that it is a fundamental principle that the
sentence imposed be proportionate to the gravity of the offence
and the degree of responsibility of the offender (s. 718.1).  He
also invoked the &quot;totality&quot; principle, whereby in cases involving
multiple offences, the sentencing judge must first determine the
gravamen of the conduct underlying the offences, then decide what
total sentence would most appropriately reflect the essence of
the overall conduct (R. v. Jewell and Gramlick (1995), 83 O.A.C.
81 at pp. 88-9).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Watt J. also took into account the following factors:  that
persons with lifelong sexual preferences like pedophiles and
hebephiles are not likely to be deterred by imprisonment;  that
the absence of penetration and anal intercourse denote the
absence of violence and their absence, therefore, &quot;removes them
as a basis for sentence enhancement&quot;;  that Stuckless has already
been imprisoned for similar and relatively contemporaneous
crimes;  that Stuckless had &quot;undertaken rehabilitative steps&quot;
between the offences and the sentencing; that Stuckless spent 8
months in custody prior to sentencing;  and that Stuckless should
not be sentenced for the full scope of the activity - the &quot;full
dimensions of the iceberg&quot; - only for the scope proven by the
Crown.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] When, based on the foregoing factors, Watt J. came to decide
what sentence should be imposed, he first identified the gravamen
of the charges against Stuckless as the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the performance of repeated acts of
          fondling, fellatio and masturbation upon and
          with children whose participation had been
          obtained by breaches of a position of trust
          or authority.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In proceeding to the second stage of the analysis - the
determination of an appropriate aggregate sentence - Watt J.
acknowledged the complexity of the task, &quot;especially ... in the
case of historical offences committed by an offender who has made
considerable strides towards self-rehabilitation in the
intervening years.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] He then proceeded to balance what he called the &quot;offence
factors&quot; in the following way:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In this case, there are several factors which
          aggravate.  There are a very significant
          number of individual incidents.  The
          complainants were young and vulnerable.  Many
          have been profoundly affected in the short
          and long term by the accused's conduct.  The
          offences were committed over a period of
          nearly two (2) decades.  The crimes of Gordon
          Stuckless were not casual encounters.  They
          were, rather, carefully choreographed and
          astutely managed.  Most involved a breach of
          trust or authority.  The relationship was one
          that was sedulously fostered by the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is, however, another side to the
          offence coin.  There was no actual or
          threatened violence towards any complainant
          beyond what was implicit in the interference
          with the physical integrity of the
          complainant which constitutes the offence
          itself.  No weapons were used, nor their use
          threatened.  There was no anal intercourse
          committed, attempted or threatened.  There
          were no collateral crimes.  There has also
          been no repetition of this behaviour, apart
          from an incident in Newfoundland, since these
          offences concluded.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It should also be made clear that Gordon
          Stuckless is being sentenced for what he did,
          not where he did it, or where he worked when
          he did it.  He doesn't get more because he
          worked at Maple Leaf Gardens, or committed
          some of his offences there.  Neither does he
          get less.  The publicity accorded this
          offender and his offences does not change the
          nature of the offence, or the circumstances
          of the offender.  It does not make the crime
          more serious, nor the offender more
          dangerous, or more likely recidivate.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The crimes of Gordon Stuckless are nearer to
          the lower end of the spectrum of behaviour
          comprehended by the legal definitions which
          apply.  They are aggravated by their number
          and the period during which they occurred,
          further the abuse of a position of trust or
          authority.  To be measured against these
          aggravating features, however, are the
          absence of additional violence, attempts at
          penetration and collateral crime.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The &quot;offender&quot; considerations were summarized to be:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Gordon Stuckless is a 48 year old pedophile,
          more accurately, same sex hebephile.  His
          disorder involves a lifelong pattern of
          preference of prepubescent or adolescent
          sexual partners.  It is a form of disorder
          which may be controlled, but not cured.
          Untreated, it is more likely than not to
          produce recidivism with opportunity to do so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The accused has made considerable efforts and
          recorded some success in his attempts at self-
          rehabilitation. He has done so both in and
          out of custody.  He has completed a lengthy
          program for sex offenders at the Ontario
          Correctional Institute.  He recognizes and
          acknowledges that he is a pedophile.  He has
          come to understand the plight of his victims
          and is able, however incompletely, to
          empathize with them.  He has expressed a
          willingness to take sex-drive reducing
          medication, acknowledged as the only
          effective curb, if any, on the likelihood of
          recidivism.  There are, of course, no
          guarantees.  Old habits die hard, even if the
          spirit is chemically blunted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          By his pleas of guilty, Gordon Stuckless has
          acknowledged his responsibility for having
          committed these offences.  He has
          acknowledged, further, the harm that he as
          done to his victims, and to the community at
          large.  He waived the preliminary inquiry,
          entered his pleas at trial and did not cross-
          examine any complainant who chose to testify
          on the sentencing hearing.  He has brought
          closure, at least in that sense, to the
          litigation phase of the past.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is also conceded that Gordon Stuckless
          ought be treated as a first offender for the
          purposes of this sentencing.  If prosecuted
          in a timely manner for these offences, he
          would have been treated as a first offender.
          His earlier recorded convictions, it follows,
          ought not be considered as prior offences for
          sentencing purposes.  (Emphasis in original.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is my further finding that Gordon
          Stuckless is remorseful for the harm he has
          wrought in the lives of his victims.  It was
          not a conclusion that he reached early, I
          suspect one that he did not reach easily.  It
          has only come more recently after
          institutional and other counselling and
          treatment.  It is nonetheless there.  The
          pleas of guilty, waiver and apology bear
          witness to it.  There are doubtless those who
          will not see it that way.  They, somewhat
          cynically, will or may regard it as a recent
          purchase made only to better complect himself
          for sentencing purposes. They are entitled to
          their views, as am I.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          One other consideration that bears mention
          here, more discussion later in connection
          with the applicable sentencing principles, is
          pre-trial custody.  It is a fact that, prior
          to disposition, the accused has been detained
          in custody, in segregation, due to the nature
          of his offences and in part, no doubt, the
          publicity surrounding them, for approximately
          eight (8) months.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] These observations were followed by a discussion about the
limitations of general deterrence.  Watt J. cited R. v. B.
(1990), 360 O.A.C. 307 for the proposition that it was an error
to make general deterrence the sole principle of punishment,
particularly when the possibility of rehabilitation was more
likely to protect society.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] He also relied on R. v. D. (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 366 (Ont.
C.A.) and R. v. Robertson (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 573 (Ont. C.A.),
which held that general deterrence was inapplicable in cases
involving pedophiles since pedophiles are not deterred by
imprisonment.  These cases led Watt J. to conclude that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A lifelong condition of sexual preference
          cannot be deterred in one, nor by example in
          others similarly circumstanced, by the
          unthinking, retributive imposition of
          inflated terms of imprisonment.  Lengthy
          periods of incarceration may also have
          deleterious effects on existing
          rehabilitative efforts, and stifle or
          extinguish others.  Lengthy incarceration has
          an immediate and visible effect, yet when it
          is done, it offers little or no protection
          for society.  The goal of sentencing is not
          achieved when the offender walks out of jail
          at the end of the term, untreated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The relevance of post-offence rehabilitation
          is also worthy of specific reference.  A
          person convicted of crime is sentenced as he
          or she appears before the sentencing judge.
          What he or she has done since the offence,
          and prior to sentencing, is a relevant
          consideration for the sentencing judge.  Self-
          rehabilitation, by its influence on
          recidivistic tendencies, also helps protect
          society.  Where there is demonstrated self-
          rehabilitation, conventional general
          deterrence may not be accorded such priority
          as might otherwise be the case to avoid the
          risk of &quot;dehabilitation&quot; [sic].  See, R. v.
          M. (D.E.S.) (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 371 at 377
          (B.C.C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Accordingly, he concluded that the appropriate aggregate
sentence was a penitentiary term of 3 to 4 years.  By giving one
year's credit for pre-sentence custody, the appropriate range of
sentence was reduced to 2-3 years.  Watt J. recognized that while
these sentences were located &quot;towards the lower middle end of the
range&quot;, no sentence would &quot;ever restore what Gordon Stuckless
wrongly took from his victims&quot;.  He therefore felt obliged to
formulate a sentence which he thought would best protect society.
And this, in turn, led him to conclude that a penitentiary term
&quot;would unlikely assist in the rehabilitation of the accused&quot; and
that &quot;it is doubtful that it would deter him or other pedophiles
or hebephiles from similar conduct.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Because Watt J. concluded that the &quot;disorder from which he
and others suffer is not cured or deterred by imprisonment&quot;, but
is, rather, &quot;controlled, or can be, by medication willingly taken
and some insight into the disorder&quot;, he opted for a limited
emphasis on imprisonment and an enhanced one on rehabilitation:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Is it more consistent with the fundamental
          principles of sentencing to incarcerate for a
          longer period to punish the past and hope
          that the future won't materialize as has the
          past?  Or is it wiser to shorten somewhat the
          imprisonment but put in place a post-release
          scheme that ensures supervision, punishes
          failure to comply, assists in rehabilitation
          and provides a longer period of control
          albeit not all within prison venues?
          (Emphasis in original.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my respectful view, the aggregate sentence
          that protects the public best is one that
          provides control over Gordon Stuckless, both
          in and out of custody, for a period longer
          than the authorities warrant if incarceration
          were the only sentencing option used.  I have
          reached this conclusion for several reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the first place, a sentence which blends
          custody and supervision furnishes a measure
          of control over the accused for a substantial
          period in a way that is compatible with and
          not inimical to the fundamental purpose of
          sentencing, the protection of society.  To
          incarcerate, even for a longer period,
          without post-incarceration supervision is to
          invite recidivism, not endeavour to prevent
          it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A blended sentence also ensures placement in
          a provincial institution, in particular one
          where the offender has been previously
          incarcerated, and provides a program best
          suited to his needs and the ongoing efforts
          to diminish the risk of re-offending.  The
          proximity of the institution may also assist
          more expeditious commencement of the post-
          incarceration treatment programs, even permit
          them before the end of the term.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          As a practical matter, a blended sentence
          ensures supervision, more importantly control
          for a longer period than would a term of
          incarceration.  When supervision ceases,
          treatment will have occurred.  It is
          treatment that provides the best defence
          against recidivism.  It is treatment that,
          unlike most offenders, Gordon Stuckless is
          willing to take.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] With a &quot;very strong recommendation that the entire sentence
be served&quot;, Watt J. accordingly sentenced Gordon Stuckless to a
total sentence of two years less one day in an Ontario
reformatory, followed by three years' probation with the
following conditions:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)  that the accused shall report to a
          probation officer within two (2) working days

          as directed by the probation officer, but not
          less than once per month;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) that the accused remain within the
          Province of Ontario unless prior written
          permission to go beyond that jurisdiction has
          been obtained from the court or probation
          officer;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iii)     that the accused, in accordance
          with his express agreement to do so, shall

          designate, forthwith upon his release, and
          thereafter as required by Dr. Collins or his
          designate, and submit to the injection or
          other administration of such sex-drive
          reducing and/or other medication as Dr.
          Collins or his designate may prescribe in
          order to control the accused's sexual
          preferences for prepubescent or adolescent
          children;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iv) that the accused shall furnish proof

ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] There is no specific formula for balancing the sentencing
factors in s. 718 of the Criminal Code.  As Lamer C.J.C. stated
in M. (C.A.), supra, at p. 566:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The determination of a just and appropriate
          sentence is a delicate art which attempts to
          balance carefully the societal goals of
          sentencing against the moral blameworthiness
          of the offender and the circumstances of the
          offence, while at all times taking into
          account the needs and current conditions of
          and in the community.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In his extensive reasons, the sentencing judge made
reference to all the factors and principles he considered
relevant.  He also acknowledged that his task involved not merely
knowing what to take into account, but how to balance those
factors in a way which yields an appropriate sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] I appreciate that sentencing is a matter of discretion, and
that a sentencing judge ought to be accorded a substantial
measure of deference.  In my view, however, the sentence imposed
by Watt J. was manifestly unfit (R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227;  R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] The unreasonableness of the sentence flowed, in my view,
from two errors in principle:  the sentencing judge's view that
the component of force or violence was absent and the offences
were, therefore, on the &quot;lower end of the spectrum&quot; of sexual
assaults; and his conclusion that since general deterrence has no
role in sentencing pedophiles the rehabilitative factor is
correspondingly to be given primary consideration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] These errors resulted in a reduced emphasis on the many
aggravating factors in this case, namely:  the pre-meditation
involved; the number of victims and years of victimization; the
history of failed treatment and denial of responsibility by
Stuckless; the abuse of trust and confidence of vulnerable boys;
the profound impact on the victims; and the fragility of the
prognosis regarding rehabilitative prospects over time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The result was a sentence outside the &quot;acceptable range&quot;
that was, consequently, clearly inadequate (R. v. Pepin (1990),
98 N.S.R. (2d) 238 at p. 251 (N.S.C.A.)) and demonstrably unfit
(R. v. M.C.A., supra at p. 569).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Characterization of the Offences</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Watt J. characterized these offences as attracting an
aggregate sentence in the lower end of the range.  In this, he
misappreciated how serious these offences were (R. v. Henein
(1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 257 at p. 267 (Ont. C.A.)).  Watt J.
identified the gravamen of the charges as consisting of repeated
acts of &quot;fondling, fellatio and masturbation upon and with
children whose participation had been obtained by breaches of a
position of trust or authority.&quot;   This is undoubtedly true, but
this technical characterization fails to capture the full nature
and scope of the offences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] While Watt J. felt himself constrained not to calculate &quot;the
full dimensions of the iceberg&quot;, he was nonetheless presented
with a factual context of staggering proportions.  These were not
unconnected, isolated acts of sexual or indecent assault, they
were part of a systematic twenty year pattern of unrelenting
predatory and exploitative sexual conduct involving children.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] In fact, Watt J. referred to an &quot;overall scheme of
defilement&quot; on several occasions in his reasons, but this scope
appears to have played little role ultimately in measuring the
seriousness of the offences.  Instead, Watt J. consistently
referred to the seriousness of the conduct by adding the
attenuating observation that there was no violence, force,
weapons, or penetration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] It is true that there were no beatings or weapons used by
Stuckless, but that is because his strategy involved the
exploitation of trust, not the use of overt force.  All the boys
were either in a relationship of trust with Stuckless because he
was their coach or teacher, or they came to trust him because he
nurtured their confidence in order to ease the route to the
inevitable sexual abuse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Rather than threats, Stuckless used the irresistible lure of
Maple Leaf Gardens to entice many of these vulnerable boys into
his web, offering them access to its otherwise unattainable
amenities in order to reduce their resistance to his sexual
assaults.  It does not diminish the seriousness of these offences
that Stuckless used the magnetic aura of Maple Leaf Gardens
rather than a more overtly forceful form of manipulation to prey
on these children.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] The absence of penetration does not automatically relegate
the sexual abuse of children to the &quot;lower range&quot; of sexual
offences.  There is no question that &quot;additional force&quot;,
&quot;collateral crimes&quot;, and penetration are aggravating factors.
But their absence does not thereby transform them into mitigating
circumstances, nor neutralize the other aggravating factors found
in this case:  the abuse of trust, the number of victims, the
frequency of the assaults and their devastating impact on the
lives of the victims.  These offences were, individually and
collectively, unconscionable.  Any characterization which
purports to diminish their magnitude, is unacceptable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] I am unable to find a single reported appellate decision in
recent years which does not view the sexual abuse of children as
extremely serious, whether or not there is penetration.  In
saying there was no violence &quot;apart from the coercion implicit in
the relationship between the parties&quot; (emphasis added) or &quot;beyond
what was implicit in the interference with the physical integrity
of the complainant&quot;, Watt J. misappreciated how serious these
offences were.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Sexual abuse is an act of violence.  When committed against
children, the violence is both physical and profoundly
psychological.  It is coercive and exploitative conduct, and
represents the use of compulsion against someone who is
defenceless.  As Moldaver J. stated in R. v. McF., released April
27, 1992, unreported, (Ont. Gen. Div.):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I cannot conclude that [the accused] should
          be treated in a more lenient fashion simply
          because he refrained from the use of threats
          of physical harm or the infliction of limited
          and measured amounts of force.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... I must again reiterate the feelings that
          I have expressed in similar cases where the
          lack of serious physical harm has been
          advanced as a factor to be considered in
          mitigation.  The crimes of incest and sexual
          assault are inherently violent.  They can and
          often do have a crippling effect upon the
          psychological and emotional well-being of the
          victim.  Conduct which brutalizes the mind
          can be far more devastating, painful and long-
          lasting than conduct which causes injury to
          the body.  (Emphasis added.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] Stuckless' relentless sexual exploitation of children
involving multiple victims and offences over a predatory two
decade odyssey, unfettered by conscience and facilitated by the
manipulation of trust, is reprehensible.  For the sentencing
judge to conclude that &quot;the crimes of Gordon Stuckless are nearer
to the lower end of the spectrum of behaviour comprehended by the
legal definitions which apply&quot;, warranting sentences &quot;towards the
lower middle end of the range&quot;, is an error in principle.  The
totality of the sentences imposed in this case is not
proportionate to the gravamen of the offences, and does not
adequately reflect their seriousness (R. v. Jewell and Gramlick,
supra;  R. v. M.(G.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 310 (Ont. C.A.);  R.
v. Peterson (1996), 106 C.C.C. 9(3d) 64 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v.
Chadbourne, [1996] O.J. No. 2591 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Aird,
unreported, January 3, 1991, (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Kenny (1994),
393 A.P.R. 199 (Nfld. C.A.);  R. v. Ralph (1993), 331 A.P.R. 220
(Nfld. C.A.);  R. v. Cooper (1994), 39 B.C.A.C. 227 (C.A.);  R.
v. A.(F.S.) (1996), 109 C.C.C. (3d) 427 (N.B.C.A.);  R. v.
Monaghan, [1988] B.C.J. No. 2582 (B.C.C.A.);  R. v. Bennett,
[1986] B.C.J. No. 645 (B.C.C.A.);  R. v. Cadden, [1989] B.C.J.
No. 1573 (B.C.C.A.)).
The Role of General Deterrence and Rehabilitation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The second error in principle, in my view, is the
determinative role accorded by Watt J. to the possibility of
rehabilitation, and his corollary conclusion that general
deterrence is of no relevance in cases involving pedophiles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Watt J.'s reliance, in particular, on the 1979 case of
Robertson, supra, was problematic.  Robertson was part of a line
of cases holding that pedophilia was more properly dealt with
through suspended sentences and a period of treatment, on the
theory that incarceration does little to rehabilitate or deter
the offender.  The Crown in Robertson, in fact, did not even seek
a term of imprisonment at trial.  But Robertson was explicitly
rejected by this court one year later in Henein, supra, and
subsequent cases (R. v. Clubb (1984), 20 O.A.C. 157;  R. v.
Cambil (1983), 1 O.A.C. 139;  R. v. Nye (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d)
180 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Veysey (1989), 34 O.A.C. 73;  R. v.
H.(W.) (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] In Henein, this court dealt with a Crown appeal from a
sentence of three years probation where the accused was convicted
of five counts of gross indecency involving boys aged 11 to 13,
with the abuse spanning an 11-month period. The trial judge
imposed a suspended sentence on the basis that he was bound by
Robertson, even though he was inclined to impose a period of
incarceration.  MacKinnon A.C.J.O. allowed the appeal, explicitly
rejecting the Robertson approach, at pp. 267-68:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... it was urged upon us that the case law
          has developed to the extent that it now
          supports a conclusion that almost all such
          cases as the instant one call for a suspended
          sentence plus treatment for a lengthy
          probationary period.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I do not agree that such a disposition is
          inevitably right for these cases and that the
          abhorrence of the public of such conduct and
          the inherent gravity of the offence itself
          must always be disregarded in the interests
          of the accused, because, ultimately, the
          interests of the accused in his
          rehabilitation and that of society coincide.
          From a review of the recent cases it can be
          seen that custodial sentences in some cases
          are appropriate notwithstanding the accused
          suffers from paedophilia regard being had to
          the gravity of the particular conduct which
          forms the subject of the offence or offences
          ... .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my view, on the facts of this case there
          must be a period of imprisonment imposed.
          The offences were serious and incarceration
          can be a specific deterrence to this man as
          well as properly expressing the abhorrence by
          the public and repudiation by the Court of
          this conduct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Watt J. made no reference to Henein or its jurisprudential
descendants.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] His reliance on R. v. B., supra, is similarly troubling.
While he correctly states that the court concluded that excluding
the possibility of rehabilitation in sentencing is an error, he
neglects to observe that the court's final disposition was to
dismiss the appeal against sentence because the gravity of the
offence outweighed the benefits of rehabilitation.  At pp. 309-
10, the court stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The main aim of sentencing is the protection
          of society which is more likely to be
          accomplished by the rehabilitation of the
          appellant than by an overly severe
          denunciatory sentence.  Nevertheless, in view
          of the appellant's background and the gravity
          of his offence, the sentence of eight years
          cannot be considered to have been unfit when
          it was imposed.  (Emphasis added.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] Watt J. appears to have disregarded the need for a
denunciatory sentence reflecting Stuckless' &quot;moral culpability&quot;
and society's outrage.  Chief Justice Lamer, in M.  (C.A.),
supra, at p. 558, reiterated the significance of these factors in
the determination of an appropriate sentence as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Retribution requires that a judicial sentence
          properly reflect the moral blameworthiness of
          that particular offender.  The objective of
          denunciation mandates that a sentence should
          also communicate society's condemnation of
          that particular offender's conduct.  In
          short, a sentence with a denunciatory element
          represents a symbolic, collective statement
          that the offender's conduct should be
          punished for encroaching on our society's
          basic code of values as enshrined within our
          substantive criminal law.  As Lord Justice
          Lawton stated in R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60
          Cr. App. R. 74, at p. 77:  &quot;society, through
          the courts, must show its abhorrence of
          particular types of crime, and the only way
          in which the courts can show this is by the
          sentences they pass&quot;.  (Emphasis in
          original.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(See also R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344 at p. 357
(Ont. C.A.) and s. 781.1 of the Criminal Code which states:  &quot;A
sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender.&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] Watt J. cited no basis for disregarding the relevant
jurisprudence, and no evidentiary foundation for his conclusion
that imprisonment will not deter the offender or others who are
pedophiles.  It is, with respect, a quantum leap to deduce that
since pedophiles have an ingrained, lifelong sexual propensity,
they are not deterred by imprisonment.  Neither Dr. Collins, nor
anyone else, gave evidence about the effect of imprisonment on
the longterm prospects for the rehabilitation of pedophiles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] Absent evidence, it is difficult to justify the categorical
conclusion by Watt J. that pedophiles, unlike others in society,
are unlikely to be deterred by a term of imprisonment imposed on
other pedophiles.  This would mean that a pedophile could, as
Gordon Stuckless did, sexually exploit children for a generation
without fear that the consequences will be in any way
proportional to the crimes committed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] These were not isolated acts worthy of compassionate review.
They represented a deliberate, manipulative, destructive, and
shameless pattern of sexual abuse.  Pedophilia is an explanation,
not a defence.  Society is entitled to protection no less from
pedophiles than from those who sexually abuse children without
this tendency.  General deterrence is a concept which seeks, in
part, to protect the public by signalling, through imprisonment,
a potential consequence to others of the condemned conduct.
There is no basis for concluding that it has, or ought to have, a
reduced role in the sentencing of pedophiles.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] This does not mean that rehabilitation, or the circumstances
of the particular offender, are unimportant in sentencing sexual
abusers of children; it means, rather, that when one takes
rehabilitation into account, it must be in the context of the
seriousness, number and duration of the offences committed.  Even
Stuckless' social worker at the Ontario Correctional Institute,
who gave extremely positive evidence about Stuckless' progress in
the relapse prevention programme, acknowledged how much more
difficult it is to treat someone with a &quot;long pattern of
ingrained behaviour&quot; who commits multiple offences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] Not only, however, was there no evidence to support the
sentencing judge's conclusion that general deterrence is not a
relevant factor, or is, at best, a &quot;flexible&quot; factor in
sentencing pedophiles, there was no evidence that Stuckless' own
rehabilitation was best satisfied by a reformatory term.  It is
undoubtedly true that the six months Stuckless served in the
Ontario Correctional Institute helped him to recognize that he
ought to change.  But it is worth noting that as late as February
3, 1997, Stuckless still preferred to rely on counselling rather
than taking the chemical injections.  It was only after Dr.
Collins urged him to reconsider, that he finally agreed he would
start the medication on February 11th.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] Dr. Collins' evidence was that until 1996, there was no
evidence of Stuckless' motivation to change his behaviour.  Until
then, Stuckless steadfastly denied that he was a pedophile.  He
had already served a brief period of incarceration followed by
probation for his 1988 conviction for indecent assault.  Yet he
re-offended in 1992 and, according to the agreed facts at the
sentencing hearing, was still committing such acts in 1995.  This
evidence far from demonstrates that Stuckless had rehabilitated
himself since committing these offences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Dr. Collins' evidence was that since there was no cure, to
be effective in reducing recidivism, the medication required
accompanying counselling and an ongoing willingness to cooperate.
The evidence was that Stuckless' motivation appeared to have
improved substantially as a result of his imprisonment and
treatment following his 1996 conviction.  There is no evidence,
however, from Stuckless or any expert on his behalf, on how, or
whether, a longer term of imprisonment would effect this
motivation when he was released.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] There is no evidence that early release plus probation would
ensure his continuing motivation any more than would a
significant term of imprisonment, particularly where the
behaviour is, as here, longstanding and the offences
multitudinous.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] The almost exclusive reliance by Watt J. on the
rehabilitative model was, accordingly, an error in principle
based on the relevant jurisprudence and the evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] The public has an undeniable interest in protecting itself
through the rehabilitation of Stuckless.  But in the absence of
convincing evidence that a reduced, blended sentence would offer
that outcome, the public's interest in protecting its children
from sexual abuse and exploitation is entitled to greater
deference.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] The sentence imposed on Gordon Stuckless was not &quot;just and
appropriate.&quot;  The sentencing judge's errors in principle caused
him to devise an aggregate sentence that, in total, was well
below what is appropriate for offences of this gravity, extent
and duration.  The sentence, considered in its entirety, is
demonstrably unfit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] I agree that these are not offences which attract the
maximum of 10 years, but they are nonetheless of sufficient
gravity to warrant a substantial penitentiary term.  In my view,
given Stuckless' recent efforts at rehabilitation, a fit sentence
would be a total of 6 years.  I agree with Watt J. that Stuckless
should be credited with 12 months for his pre-sentence custody,
making 5 years the remaining sentence to be served.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence, and
allow the appeal by varying the sentence imposed on Gordon
Stuckless to 5 years as follows:  3 years on counts 7, 23, 30,
31, 35, 45, 46, 53 and 54; 4 years on counts 32 and 33; and 5
years on all other counts.  The sentences are to be served
concurrently.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">AUSTIN J.A. (concurring in the result):
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] It has been said that the most difficult task faced by a
judge is that of sentencing.  I agree with that statement.  This
case illustrates its truth.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] Gordon Stuckless pleaded guilty on September 8, 1997, to
indecently assaulting and sexually assaulting 24 boys, ages ten
to fifteen, over a period of almost twenty years.  He was
sentenced on October 27, 1997, to two years less a day, plus
three years' probation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] The Crown appeals this sentence.  Abella J.A. would allow
the appeal, set aside the order below, and vary the sentence to
one netting five years after taking into account pre-sentence
custody.  I agree with that result but for reasons which differ
in some respects.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] Abella J.A. found that the trial judge made two errors in
principle.  The first was his view that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The crimes of Gordon Stuckless are nearer to
          the lower end of the spectrum of behaviour
          comprehended by the legal definitions which
          apply.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The second was that, as she put it:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... since general deterrence has no role in
          sentencing pedophiles, the rehabilitative
          factor is correspondingly to be given primary
          consideration.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] I agree that the trial judge committed the first of these
errors.  I also agree with the remarks of Moldaver J. in R. v.
McF., quoted by Abella J.A. in her reasons.  The psychological
damage occasioned in this case precludes any possibility of a
finding that these offences were at the lower end of the range.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[70] Before dealing with the second error, it is necessary to
consider the sentence imposed below.  That sentence was one of
imprisonment for two years less a day, plus three years
probation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] Abella J.A. was critical of the reliance of the judge below
on the decision of this court in R. v. Robertson (1979), 46
C.C.C. (2d) 573 and his failure to consider and be guided by R.
v. Henein (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (Ont. C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] I am not persuaded that the judge below was misled by
Robertson. Nor am I persuaded that he gave undue importance to
rehabilitation at the expense of deterrence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] Rather, it seems to me that the primary objective of the
sentence was protection of the public.  I rely in this regard
upon the following statement of the judge below:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... The goal of sentencing is not achieved
          when the offender walks out of jail at the
          end of the term, untreated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] One of the terms of probation was that the respondent submit
to &quot;injection or other administration of such sex-drive reducing
and/or other medication as Dr. Collins or his designate may
prescribe in order to control the accused's sexual preferences
for pre-pubescent or adolescent children.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] Protection of the public was to be achieved, first, by two
years' incarceration, and then, on a more permanent basis, by the
administration of a sex-drive reducing medication. Dr. Collins
referred to this as &quot;chemical castration.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] Chemical castration is not an option normally available to a
trial judge. It became available here as a term of probation on
the consent of the respondent through the submissions of his
counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] Probation is not available where the sentence is for a term
of imprisonment for two years or more. Accordingly, if the court
below wished to act on the offer of chemical castration, it would
be limited to the imposition of either a fine, or a sentence not
in excess of two years less a day. A sentence of imprisonment in
excess of two years could not have probation added to it and
therefore could not include chemical castration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] In my view, the court below was faced with this dilemma: the
offences in issue demanded a denunciatory sentence in excess of
two years less a day, but chemical castration would provide
longer term protection for the public.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] In opting for longer term protection for the public, the
judge below erred in two respects. The first error was that he
put himself in a position in which he would be unable to impose a
sentence paying due regard to denunciation and deterrence,
specific and general. The second error was that he relied too
heavily on the evidence with respect to the medication in
question.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] That evidence was the testimony of Dr. Collins, and it
provided very little information as to the precise nature of the
medication, how it works, and the effect of it on persons such as
the respondent. Apart from the fact that it was to be
administered by injection, that it reduces sex drive and
fantasies, and that the respondent had been cleared for it by an
endocrinologist, little else was revealed. The evidence does not
indicate how often the medication was to be administered or its
possible side effects. Nor is there any evidence as to how long
the injections were to continue, that is, for a year, or five
years, or for life.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] The respondent never actually received any of the
medication. There is no evidence as to how, or if, he will
respond to it. Apart from Dr. Collins' statement that &quot;it's the
best control that we have available,&quot; there is no evidence as to
its effectiveness. There is no assurance that the medication will
have the desired effect or, in the alternative, will have it to
the extent or degree necessary to protect the public.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] Having regard to the vagueness and uncertainty of the
evidence, it was, in my view, an error for the judge below to
rely on it in imposing the sentence he did.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] I would allow the appeal and impose the sentence proposed by
Abella J.A.</font></pre></td>
