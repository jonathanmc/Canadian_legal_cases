    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[1]  The appellants appeal the judgment of Gotlib J., made on an
application under r. 14.05(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
Their main ground of appeal is that the motion judge erred in
failing to give effect to the defences of laches, acquiescence,
waiver and estoppel. They contend that the motion judge
misapplied these defences because she asked herself the wrong
question in determining what Sun Life had to know to trigger the
defences and because she misapprehended the evidence on the
rental history of the other part of the property.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In our view, the appellants' contention is answered by the
failure of its property manager to produce the certificate called
for under the lease. Rider No.2 to the lease provides in part:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             ... and upon completion of all demising
            walls the Lessor's architect, contractor
            or consultant, using BOMA measurements
            shall issue a certificate setting out
            the exact area of the ground floor of
            the demised premises and thereupon all
            necessary adjustments, if any, in the
            Minimum Rent shall be made in accordance
            with such certificate. The Lessee shall
            be entitled to the basement of the
            demised premises rent free.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The landlord did not comply with its obligation under this
Rider. Having failed to do what it was obligated to do, the
landlord must accept the consequences of its noncompliance. The
requirement to issue a certificate was not, as the appellants
submit, a provision for the benefit of the landlord that the
landlord could waive. It was a provision for the benefit of both
parties. Because the appellants did not issue the certificate
they are precluded from relying on the equitable defences they
assert.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The certificate was important because, without it neither
party knew the accurate rentable area. The appellants argue that
it was sufficient for the tenant to know that it had a right in
the lease to the certificate. We disagree. The motion judge
correctly held that the equitable defences asserted by the
appellants could apply only if the tenant had knowledge of the
error in the rentable area.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellants also argue that the motion judge failed to
consider the evidence on the rental history of the other part of
the property. This evidence was relevant to the issue of
prejudice. The motion judge observed:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                There is no evidence before this
            court as to the rental history of the
            remaining premises said to be 1200
            square feet so, that there is no method
            for this court to deal with the
            prejudice, if any, to the landlord
            resulting from this series of errors.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Admittedly, in their affidavit material the appellants did
advert to the rental history of the other part of the property.
Their evidence on this point, however, was weak. The leases were
not before the court and the evidence does not establish that the
appellants could have obtained more rent had the true dimensions
of the property been known.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Finally, we are not persuaded that the order of the motion
judge, including her direction that the landlord obtain at its
expense a certificate of the total rentable floor area, was
unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  For these reasons the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
