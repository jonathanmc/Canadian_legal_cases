    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">BY THE COURT:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The issue raised by this appeal is whether Conant J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correctly applied s.21(1) of the Business Corporations Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1990, c.B.17 (the &quot;OBCA&quot;) in finding that the appellant,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Geoffrey Huang, was personally liable to the respondents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alexander Szecket and Alberto Geddo, for the breach of a contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which the appellant, and others, entered into with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents &quot;on behalf of a company to be formed&quot;, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances where the company was not formed and the contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not performed.  It is the position of the appellant that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under s.21(4) of the OBCA he was not bound by the contract.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant has also appealed from the trial judge's award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of damages on the ground that the amount awarded to each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent was excessive on a proper interpretation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision of the contract that provided for their remuneration.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Dr. Szecket was awarded U.S.$304,726 and Mr. Geddo was awarded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">U.S.$227,995.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Conant J. also found liability on the part of Mr. Huang on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the basis of negligent misrepresentation, although it would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appear that damages were assessed as arising from the breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contract.  An appeal was also taken from this finding.  Given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it is our opinion that Conant J. correctly decided that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant was liable under s.21(1) of the OBCA, we do not propose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to deal with whether this finding was erroneous.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The facts that underlie this appeal are straightforward and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">essentially not in dispute.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Dr. Szecket, a research scientist, and his associate, Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Geddo, a consulting engineer, developed a process, or technology,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the bonding of dissimilar metals called &quot;Dynamic Bonding&quot;,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for which Dr. Szecket held three patents.  In the mid-1980s they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lived, and were employed, in the Toronto area.  About 1985 they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were approached by Mr. Huang who represented that he was aware of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specific opportunities in Taiwan for the development of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' technology, including the financing required to do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">so.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Over the next three years, considerable discussion took</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">place between the respondents and the appellant and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">associates toward the goal of the formation of a business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship to develop and market the respondents' technology in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Taiwan.  The parties exchanged their views concerning the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proposed business venture mainly through correspondence.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents travelled to Taiwan to investigate the plant and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facilities where Mr. Huang proposed that the business would be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">located, and to meet Mr. Huang's associates.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On July 18, 1988, the respondents and Mr. Huang signed a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">letter of understanding, the purpose of which was &quot;to define a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mutual understanding&quot; among them of the proposed business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">venture.  On August 13, 1988, a co-operation agreement was signed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the respondents and Mr. Huang, as well as by his associates,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Hsu Mien and Luis Lan Lu.  This agreement expanded upon the terms</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the letter of understanding, provided that Mr. Lu would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;immediately make available&quot; the funding for the venture and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated the preparation and execution of &quot;a formal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement&quot;.  It contained the following recital:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
          The following Parties agree to cooperating in
          introducing advanced high energy explosive
          bonding technology to Taiwan under the
          following terms and conditions:


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Subsequent to August 13, 1988, a rudimentary draft of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contemplated formal agreement was prepared.  Shortly after its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">preparation, a more comprehensive draft agreement was prepared by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a solicitor retained by the respondents.  This draft served as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the vehicle for the final round of negotiations among the parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and culminated in the final agreement dated September 1, 1988,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was not executed until the end of October, 1988.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The evidence disclosed that it was the respondents' wish</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mr. Mien and Mr. Huang personally guarantee the benefits the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents were to receive under the contract.  To that end, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents instructed their solicitor to include the following</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision in the second draft of the proposed contract:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The parties MIEN and HUANG personally
          guarantee the payment to the Licensor of the
          Licence and Technical Assistance Fees payable
          during the initial three year term of this
          agreement as set forth in Article 3 of this
          Agreement.



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In addition, this draft provided that Mr. Mien and Mr. Huang were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to execute the agreement &quot;Personally and on behalf of a Company</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be incorporated&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] However, Mr. Mien and Mr. Huang were opposed to providing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their personal guarantees.  Consequently, when the final draft of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the agreement was prepared it did not contain the above provision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the words &quot;Personally and&quot; below the signatures of Mr. Mien</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Mr. Huang had been deleted.  The agreement contained no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provision expressly providing that Mr. Mien or Mr. Huang were not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bound by the contract or entitled to its benefits.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analysis of the reasons of Conant J. discloses that he appears to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">chose to take this approach is not entirely clear.  However, it</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a guarantee by Mr. Huang and Mr. Mien of the obligations of the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Section 21 of the O.B.C.A., which is
          reproduced in para. 44 [p.590 ante], reflects
          the inviolability of the corporate form.  The
          corporation is given the option to adopt a
          contract entered in its name, or on its
          behalf, before coming into existence, instead
          of being bound automatically to pre-
          incorporation agreements upon incorporation.
          As such, the corporation is required to take
          positive steps if it wishes to adopt the
          contract.  This requires that it have
          knowledge of the contract and its terms.  In
          this way, s.21 accepts and propagates the
          philosophical and legal fiction of the
          corporation as a separate and distinct
          personality.  However, it does not do so at
          the expense of third parties, who are not
          without recourse in circumstances where the
          contract is breached.  Although the
          corporation is not automatically bound by the
          contract at its inception, third party
          interests are protected.  Section 21(1)
          ensures that the promoter is bound by the
          agreement until it has been adopted by the
          corporation, unless, under s.21(4) the
          parties expressly provide that the promoter
          is not bound by the contract or entitled to
          its benefits.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">express provision relieving Mr. Huang from personal liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under s.21(1) if the company was not incorporated, or if it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incorporated, and failed to adopt the contract.  Had he wished to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">avail himself of s.21(4), Mr. Huang could have sought the consent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the respondents to include an appropriate provision in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.  In the absence of such a provision, it follows, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">our view, that Conant J. was correct in his application of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.21(1) to the circumstances of this appeal and his conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mr. Huang was personally liable for the breach of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract.  We note that in his reasons, Conant J. did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider the application of s.21(4).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] We feel obliged to comment on the analysis undertaken by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge in determining the appellant's liability.  With</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect, we question his reliance on the Westcom case, supra,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which made his analysis of the evidence and s.21(1) unnecessarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complex.  We have not been asked to consider the correctness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the decision in Westcom, and, therefore, we decline to do so.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any event, it is distinguishable on its facts from this appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where there is no evidence that Mr. Huang believed he was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contracting on behalf of an existing company that, in fact, did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not exist, as was the case in Westcom.  In this appeal, all the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence pointed to only one conclusion - that the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Mr. Huang knew, and, indeed, intended, that Mr. Huang, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his associates, were contracting on behalf of a company to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incorporated.  As Borins J.A. concluded in his analysis of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law  pertaining to pre-incorporation contracts in the Sherwood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, in a situation like this where the company is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incorporated and the contract is not performed, liability for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breach of the pre-incorporation contract depends on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of s.21, which was enacted to replace the common law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Accordingly, Westcom was of no assistance to the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in resolving the issue of Mr. Huang's personal liability.  There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no need for him to undertake the two stage analysis suggested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by Westcom and first determine whether it was the intention of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the parties to the pre-incorporation contract that Mr. Huang</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incur personal liability before determining the ultimate issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his liability through the application of s.21(1).  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">represented one of the problems arising from the common law of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pre-incorporation contracts, which the legislature intended to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedy by the enactment of s.21.  As we have stated, personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability of the promoter is established by s.21(1) and prevails</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unless either contracted out of pursuant to s.21(4), or displaced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the adoption of the contract by the company subsequent to its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incorporation pursuant to s.21(2).  Indeed, on its facts this is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a simple and straightforward case, which clearly attracts the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of s.21(1).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Damages

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] As we have indicated, the trial judge assessed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' damages on the basis that each was deprived of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earning U.S.$2,600 a week for the three year term of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract.  This weekly sum is derived from the provisions of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article 3(i) of the agreement, which is reproduced in paragraph</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14].

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] Counsel for the appellant attacked the assessment on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis of the understanding expressed in Article 3(i) that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">component of the weekly sum of U.S.$2,600 was an &quot;overseas</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowance&quot; of U.S.$1,000 which &quot;may de-escalate in accordance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a Co-operation Agreement signed between the parties on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">August 15, 1988&quot;.  Counsel submitted that because the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were not required to remain overseas, the damages should have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been assessed on the basis that the respondents were deprived of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earning U.S.$1,600 a week.  Because the respondents had worked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overseas for 16 weeks, and were paid for doing so before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">returning to Canada in March, 1989, the effect of this submission</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be to reduce the amount of the damages of each respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by U.S.$140,000.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In our view, there is no merit to this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, we find it difficult to understand its underlying logic.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">After all, the reason why the respondents were unable to work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overseas was because the contract was not performed.  It is trite</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law that as a result of the breach the respondents are entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be placed in the position they would have been in had the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract been performed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Moreover, in our view, a proper interpretation of Article</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3(i) requires consideration of the relevant provision of the &quot;Co-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">operation Agreement&quot;, which was incorporated by reference into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article 3(i), as well as consideration of the other provisions of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Article 3 that provided for remuneration for the respondents, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular, the payment to the respondents of 10% of the profit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the company to be formed and a royalty of 10% of the net sales</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the company for a ten year period.  The relevant provision of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Co-operation Agreement is found in paragraph [15] of our</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons.  It provided that the allowance of U.S.$1,000 a week</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;will become deescalated [sic] when the company shall succeed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiving work orders of substantive nature (USD3 Million Plus)&quot;.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] In our opinion, the intention of the parties was that each</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent would receive compensation of U.S.$2,600 a week for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the three year term of the contract.  This amount contained two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">components, one of which was a base weekly compensation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">U.S.$1,600.  As for the other component, it was anticipated that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the company was up and running and earning a profit and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">generating royalties, U.S.$1,000 would be generated from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents' 10% share of the company's profits and their 10%</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">share of the royalties.  Thus, properly interpreted, the weekly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowance of U.S.$1,000 was intended to reflect a start-up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowance for the company.  This amount was to be &quot;de-escalated&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to accord with the respondents' share of the company's profits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and their royalties, provided that each week each respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received U.S.$2,600.  In the final analysis, it is clear to us</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the respondents had negotiated a weekly remuneration of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">U.S.$2,600 and that they were deprived of it because the contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not performed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESULT

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] For all of the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs.
