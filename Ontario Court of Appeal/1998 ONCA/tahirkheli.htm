    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant and two other persons named Sandhu and Khan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were charged with conspiracy to traffic and trafficking in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heroin.  Khan absconded the jurisdiction before trial.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant and Sandhu were convicted of both counts by a court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">composed of Gotlib J. and a jury and they appealed their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction.  Sandhu's appeal has been dismissed as an abandoned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.  The appellant raises numerous grounds of appeal.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 1   Did the trial judge unreasonably restrict cross-
          examination in relation to reasonable grounds with
          respect to the authorization to intercept private
          communications?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant has conceded that he challenged only two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statements in the affidavit when he applied to cross-examine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affiant.  The trial judge decided that neither statement was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adequately supported in the affidavit and disregarded both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statements.  Once the trial judge decided to disregard these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statements, there was no purpose to allowing cross-examination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to either statement.  Furthermore, it has not been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">challenged that even without the two disputed statements, there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was a proper basis to name the appellant in the authorizations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">We see no error in the trial judge's exercise of her discretion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this issue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 2   Did the trial judge err in refusing to admit the
          bodypack evidence in relation to the test of
          investigative necessity?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Although during the application to cross-examine the affiant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel did not seek to tender the bodypack interception into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence, it is conceded by the Crown that the appellant should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been allowed to introduce the bodypack tapes into evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, the trial judge was informed of the relevant points that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel claimed the bodypack demonstrated and it is clear that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge concluded that this evidence could not alter the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis for investigative necessity.  Moreover, it was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable to believe that the police would simply rely on a drug</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dealer about the details of the drug information and the bodypack</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence could not have undermined the practical need for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorizations.  No substantial wrong resulted from this error.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 3   Did the trial judge err in determining that the test
          for investigative necessity had been satisfied?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We agree with the Crown's position that the authorizing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge had to be satisfied that investigative necessity had to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shown with respect to the investigation as a whole, not with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to each individual named.  In the circumstances of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, investigative necessity was overwhelmingly demonstrated as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it would have been impossible to investigate this international</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drug smuggling operation without an authorization.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 4   Did the Crown engage in inappropriate cross-examination
          with respect to the undercover officer's prints on the
          drug exhibits?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  This evidence was relevant to demonstrate that fingerprints</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are not always left on everything people touch.  This issue was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subject to full cross-examination and this evidence could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have misled the jury.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 5   Did the Crown engage in inappropriate cross-examination
          with respect to certain telephone calls?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Evidence of the origin, destination and person(s) who made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the telephone calls was highly relevant to the issue of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">association between both the appellant and the person being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">called and between the appellant and Khan.  We see no impropriety</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that would have prejudiced the appellant.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ISSUE 6   Did the trial judge err in failing to provide a &quot;D.W.&quot;
          instruction?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  This was not a case where the jury would have been left with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the mistaken impression that its decision came down to a simple</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credibility contest between the Crown witnesses and the defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witnesses.  The appellant has not identified any questionable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passage in the trial judge's charge that could have left the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with that impression.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  On the contrary, on two separate occasions, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">emphasized to the jury that the case was not a credibility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contest (there is a reasonable basis, on the evidence, for this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction) and she repeated on many occasions that the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had to prove its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Although Crown counsel and counsel for the co-accused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggested a &quot;D.W.&quot; type of instruction, experienced counsel for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant did not object to the charge and did not request</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such an instruction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We are satisfied that there could have been no confusion in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury's mind as to the proper burden of proof and that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understood that it could still have a reasonable doubt even if it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believed the Crown witnesses and disbelieved the defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witnesses.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] We would not give effect to any of the grounds of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In conclusion, we note that the combination of the direct and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstantial evidence against the appellant was capable of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishing a strong case against the appellant.  We see no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason to doubt the verdict.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appeal is dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">BORINS J.A.:  (Dissenting)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of Finlayson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Labrosse JJ.A. and while I agree with their disposition of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the first five issues, I am, with respect, unable to agree with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their conclusion on the final issue.  In my view, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erred in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principles of R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (Sup. Ct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Can.).  As I will explain, such a charge was required in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of this case, which was heavily dependent on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstantial evidence, because of the appellant's defence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">innocent explanation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] It is evident that the instructions to the jury were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsatisfactory.  Counsel for both accused and counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown had numerous objections.  The trial judge instructed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury for 2-3/4 hours, and the objections took two hours to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present.  Counsel for the Crown agreed with many of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objections raised by the defence, including, the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure to instruct the jury in accordance with the principles of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">W.(D.).  In the end, she agreed to recharge the jury on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approximately ten of the concerns raised by counsel, but not her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failure to include the model charge recommended in W.(D.) by Cory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The trial judge recharged the jury the next morning.  It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a reasonable inference that by then the jury had deliberated for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">five to six hours.  She had not instructed the jurors to delay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their deliberations until counsel had completed their objections.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Her failure to do so was the subject of comment and concern by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown counsel. (pp.4605; 4620-1).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] To appreciate the context in which the defence and Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel requested a W.(D.) charge, it is helpful to identify the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions that the trial judge gave the jury on the burden of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proof and reasonable doubt.  In my view, they were sparse.  At</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pp.4403-5 she discussed credibility, after she had observed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;credibility is very important in all cases, and it certainly is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">here&quot;.  After explaining the presumption of innocence, she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explained the burden of proof and reasonable doubt at pp.4407-8</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and instructed the jury:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether
          either of the accused committed any one or
          more of the offences with which he is
          charged, it is your duty to give that accused
          the benefit of the doubt and find him not
          guilty on such charge or charges.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] After a lengthy, and, in my view, confusing explanation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">how the jury was to go about determining whether the appellant,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and his co-accused, were members of the conspiracies of which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they were charged, the trial judge told the jury at pp.4433-4:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If you conclude that he did not [intend to
          become a member of the conspiracy], or if you
          are left in [sic] a reasonable doubt, you
          must acquit either [of] those men about whom
          you are left in [sic] reasonable doubt.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                   [emphasis added]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This was the key instruction given by the trial judge on whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown had proved that the appellant was a member of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conspiracy in respect to which he was charged.  Not only did it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fail to comply with W.(D.), but it appears to place the onus on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant to establish that he did not intend to be a member</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the conspiracy.  However, the apparent reversal of the onus of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proof was not raised by the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] During the course of her review of the position of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant at pp.4501-6, the trial judge said:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          &quot;You should not choose whom to believe, but
          if you find that the evidence...raises a
          reasonable doubt you must acquit.&quot;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finally, she outlined the position of the Crown and concluded her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions without further reference to the burden of proof or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable doubt.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] It is also necessary to examine what the trial judge said</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about the burden of proof and reasonable doubt in her recharge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Although she had refused to give a W.(D.) instruction, in her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ruling on counsels' objections to her charge she stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          &quot;The 'reasonable doubt' doctrine will be
          covered in the re-charging to the jury on the
          issue of conspiracy.&quot; (p.4614)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The main focus of the recharge was intended to rectify the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inadequacies of her instructions concerning the burden of proof</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in respect to the offence of conspiracy, and her failure to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separate the evidence against the appellant and his co-accused</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and to relate the evidence to the issues.  Most of the hour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required to recharge the jury dealt with these points.  The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge refused to permit counsel to raise objections to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recharge.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Although the trial judge said she would cover reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt when recharging the jury on conspiracy, all she said about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it was this:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Having considered that additional evidence,
          then you as a jury must decide if you are
          satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
          Tahirkheli participated in the conspiracy and
          was a member of the conspiracy, then you must
          convict. (p.4637)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nothing was said about the innocent explanation given by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, although the trial judge indicated in discussing a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different issue that she was aware that this was his defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(p.4642).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] However, toward the end of her recharge she gave a brief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction about what she described as the &quot;doctrine of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable doubt&quot;.  She instructed the jury that it applied to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">each of the five counts.  Then she said:  &quot;And you must not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">convict if you have a reasonable doubt&quot;. (p.4647).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In neither the charge, nor the recharge, therefore, did the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge use the model charge recommended in W.(D.).  It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant, in my view, that she failed to do this despite the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fervent request of Crown counsel that she do so.  During his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objections to the charge, he stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          With respect to the 'reasonable doubt'
          doctrine, I concede, consent, and urge upon
          Your Honour, as well, to bring home to the
          jury in the standard way...the trilogy of
          points [from W.(D.).] (p.4551-2)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The fact that Crown counsel joined counsel for the defence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">making the objection is deserving of considerable weight.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] I appreciate that the appellant's counsel did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifically object to the failure of the charge to contain a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">W.(D.) instruction.  This objection was taken by counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">co-accused.  In argument before this court, appellant's counsel</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">indicated that he did not feel it was necessary to make this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objection as it was made by co-counsel.  In my view, it is clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from Crown counsel's request for a W.(D.) charge that its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">omission affected both accused.  Had the trial judge agreed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">include a W.(D.) instruction in her recharge, it necessarily</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3d) 1 at 19 (Sup. Cr. Can.), defence counsel's failure to object</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a jury charge, while not irrelevant, is not determinative of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the instructions constituted mis-direction or non-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">direction resulting in reversible error.  As I have pointed out,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the failure of the appellant's counsel to object is significantly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diminished in the light of the objections taken by counsel for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the co-accused and the Crown.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Although the factual foundation of W.(D.) was a &quot;credibility</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">credibility is important&quot;.  The trial judge instructed the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that &quot;credibility is very important in all cases, and it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certainly is here&quot; (p.4403).  She further instructed the jury at</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          And the last issue is, was it Mr. Tahirkheli,
          or has Mr. Sandhu also been identified as an
          offender?  The real issue here is
          credibility, but not in the ordinary
          sense....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          With respect to Mr. Tahirkheli, it is a
          slightly different consideration; you must
          decide whether he intended to traffic or
          assist in the trafficking which occurred....
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">This instruction related to the trafficking charge of June 2,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which was central to the charge of conspiracy to traffic.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's defence to both charges was based on the innocent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explanation he had given.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] In my view, the following passage from the reasons of Cory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. in W.(D.) at 409 has direct application to this appeal:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In a case where credibility is important, the
          trial judge must instruct the jury that the
          rule of reasonable doubt applies to that
          issue.  The trial judge should instruct the
          jury that they need not firmly believe or
          disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses.
          Specifically, the trial judge is required to
          instruct the jury that they must acquit the
          accused in two situations.  First, if they
          believe the accused.  Secondly, if they do
          not believe the accused's evidence but still
          have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt after
          considering the accused's evidence in the
          context of the evidence as a whole: see R. v.
          Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont.
          C.A.); approved in R. v. Morin, supra, at
          p.207.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Ideally, appropriate instructions on the
          issue of credibility should be given not only
          during the main charge, but on any recharge.
          A trial judge might well instruct the jury on
          the question of credibility along these
          lines:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               First, if you believe the evidence
               of the accused, obviously you must
               acquit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Secondly, if you do not believe the
               testimony of the accused but you
               are left in reasonable doubt by it,
               you must acquit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Thirdly, even if you are not left
               in doubt by the evidence of the
               accused, you must ask yourself
               whether, on the basis of the
               evidence which you do accept, you
               are convinced beyond a reasonable
               doubt by that evidence of the guilt
               of the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If that formula were followed, the oft-
          repeated error which appears in the recharge
          in this case would be avoided.  The
          requirement that the Crown prove the guilt of
          the accused beyond a reasonable doubt is
          fundamental in our system of criminal law.
          Every effort should be made to avoid mistakes
          in charging the jury on this basic principle.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was important that the trial judge relate her instructions on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable doubt to the defence raised by the appellant.  This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows, as well, from the decision of this court in R. v.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that the acts of April 16 and June 2 on which the prosecution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied as circumstances of his guilt were innocent.  In a case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">where an accused has called evidence of an affirmative defence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge must avoid leaving the impression with the jury</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the accused bears some onus of proof with respect to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence as the trial judge did in the passage I have quoted in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paragraph 17.  In my view, what the trial judge should have done</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this case was not only to remind the jury that the onus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remains with the Crown to prove every element of the offence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beyond a reasonable doubt, but also to relate the fundamental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle of reasonable doubt to the defence of innocent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explanation as Cory J.A. stated in Parrington at 186-7, where he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recommended the model charge which he subsequently repeated in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">W.(D.).  Although throughout her charge and recharge the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge instructed the jury in general terms of the necessity of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, no specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge was given relating this principle to the defence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">innocent explanation.  In short, no attempt was made, in either</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the charge or the recharge, to relate the principle of reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt to the evidence of innocent explanation adduced by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] I appreciate that Jacquard stands for the proposition that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury.  However,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as that case also held, an accused is entitled to a jury that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understands how the evidence relates to the legal issues.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appreciate, as well, the need to apply a functional approach in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reviewing a jury charge and the need to do so in the greater</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">context of the trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] In this appeal, I believe that the functional approach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires this court to take into consideration that this was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial of two accused which lasted for ten weeks, in which 26</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witnesses testified, where much of the evidence constituted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intercepted communications and the majority of the evidence did</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not apply to the appellant.  It is also important to consider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the charge to the jury contained many inadequacies and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was substantial agreement among counsel in respect to them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Moreover,  it is to be noted that the recharge took place about a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">day after the charge after the jury had been deliberating for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">several hours, that the recharge constituted a fresh charge on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the approach the jury was required to take in considering the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offence of conspiracy that counsel were not permitted to make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">objections to the recharge, and that the jury returned twice with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a number of questions.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] In his reasons in W.(D.), Cory J. reproduced extensive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">passages from the main charge and recharge containing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions on the burden of proof and reasonable doubt given by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge.  Although the trial judge had not instructed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury using the language and approach which Cory J. recommended in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">W.(D.), he was satisfied that this omission was not fatal.  He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that the charge, when read as a whole, made it clear that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correct burden of proof and standard of proof to apply.  Indeed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in many cases in which the model W.(D.) charge has not been used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellate counts have been satisfied, in the circumstances of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those cases, that the jury was not left with any misapprehension</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about the correct burden of proof and standard of proof to apply.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] Unlike W.(D.), the effect of the charge and the recharge in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this appeal, when viewed as a whole in the context which I have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">described, did not adequately bring home to the jury that in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order to acquit the appellant it was not necessary that they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">believe his explanation, but that if they were left in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable doubt by it, they were obliged to acquit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Therefore, I would give effect to this ground of appeal, set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aside the conviction and order a new trial.
