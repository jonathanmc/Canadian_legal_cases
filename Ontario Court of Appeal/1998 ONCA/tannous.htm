    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[1]    The plaintiff was employed by what we will call &quot;Old
Axotec&quot; for almost six years when the assets of &quot;Old Axotec&quot; were
sold to &quot;New Axotec.&quot; Some of her income was derived from a
company called L.G.L. which subcontracted work to Old Axotec. The
plaintiff's interest in L.G.L. ended by the terms of a
shareholder agreement when her employment by Old Axotec
terminated at the time of the asset purchase. Donaghue, the
principal of Old Axotec became the general manager of New Axotec
and the plaintiff was hired by New Axotec in a management role
under Donaghue.
[2]    Six weeks after the asset sale Donaghue fired the
plaintiff and, as found by the trial judge, assaulted her.
[3]    We see no basis upon which to interfere with the trial
judge's finding that there was an assault, that it occurred in
the course of Donaghue's employment by new Axotec, that the
plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed, that she suffered emotional
disorders from the assault and the manner of dismissal, and that
failure to mitigate was not established. Given all the
circumstances, including the history of her employment with Old
Axotec, we would not disturb the rather generous nine month
termination period, nor the allowance of $15,000 for aggravated
damages and $2,500 for the assault.
[4]    The plaintiff earned $37,785.45 while employed by Old
Axotec, in addition to $13,625.00 dividend income from L.G.L.
That was the basis of the claim asserted in the statement of
claim. The trial judge conducted a lengthy examination of
Donaghue as to tax credits for dividend income and then, using
mathematics that could not be explained by counsel, he grossed up
the plaintiff's income to $50,000. The amount of gross-up is out
of proportion to the income and, in any event, her claim to
dividends ended with her employment by Old Axotec. The evidence
is not clear as to her precise income with New Axotec but in our
view the amount claimed, rounded to $38,000, is an appropriate
base.
[5]    The damages for wrongful dismissal should therefore be
reduced to $28,500.00.
[6]    The trial judge awarded all damages jointly and severally
against all defendants, implicitly on the basis of a conspiracy
by the corporations to arrange events so as to squeeze out the
plaintiff without paying a termination allowance. Without such
findings the only wrongful dismissal that led to damages was by
New Axotec, and it alone would be responsible.
[7]    The factum of Old Axotec and Donaghue lists 26 findings by
the trial judge that are not supported by the evidence. Most
relate to the conspiracy issue. The respondent's factum contains
only a general denial as to this lack of evidence. When pressed
during argument, the only meaningful reference by the respondent
was to the fact that the defendants had filed a single defence.
The trial judge makes specific reference to this in his reasons,
even though the parties were by that time separately represented.
There is no question that the lawyer who drafted the pleading
failed to recognize a conflict of interest between the clients,
but that is not a basis upon which to build findings of a
&quot;scheme&quot; that was &quot;planned&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot;. On the evidence the
principals of the two companies were strangers who made a
business deal, and because it was an asset sale, the employees of
the vendor company lost their jobs and took up new employment
with the purchaser company. This cannot be treated as a
conspiracy by reason of the form of a pleading and a general
finding of credibility against Donaghue.
[8]    In our view the joint findings of liability must be set
aside, except for that of assault which is properly the
responsibility of New Axotec and Donaghue. All damage recoveries
will therefore be against New Axotec alone, except for the $2500
damages for assault for which Donaghue will be jointly and
severally responsible.
[9]    That eliminates Old Axotec from any liability and the
claim against it should be dismissed. That company was
sufficiently associated with the complaints that there should be
an order for costs in favour of Old Axotec against New Axotec on
a party-and-party basis to the conclusion of the trial for that
portion of the proceedings when they were separately represented.
[10]   The appellants appeal against the award of solicitor-and-
client costs, and if not open for consideration without leave
because of the disposition of the appeal, leave to appeal is
granted.
[11]   The trial judge's reasons for awarding solicitor-and-
client costs include the fact that the defendants attacked the
plaintiff's credibility, that the damages awarded will not
completely indemnify her for her losses, and that no offer to
settle was made to the plaintiff. None of these is an appropriate
consideration under r.57.01(1) and cannot fall under the basket
provision of &quot;any other matter relevant to costs.&quot; In fact, the
plaintiff was successfully cross-examined on the issue of the
assault to the point that the trial judge termed her version as
&quot;preposterous&quot;. The damages awarded for her losses must stand as
the trial judge's true assessment without being topped up later
in a consideration of costs. Finally, the defendants are entitled
to defend without making an offer. If the plaintiff had made an
offer of less than her recovery she would be entitled to
solicitor-and-client costs. She didn't do so and she can't claim
the same relief on the basis of the defendants' failure to make
an offer.
[12]   These were errors in principle which justify our review of
the disposition of costs. In our view there was nothing unusual
about this trial and, given the adjustments on appeal, nothing to
justify an elevated level of costs.
[13]   The appropriate order to the conclusion of the trial is
that the plaintiff recover party-and-party costs, to be allocated
between New Axotec and Donaghue in the proportion that $46,000
(the total recovery against New Axotec) bears to $2,500 (the
recovery against Donaghue and New Axotec).
[14]   The judgment under appeal will be varied in accordance
with these reasons.
[15]   In all the circumstances we do not see fit to order any
costs of the appeal.</font></pre></td>
