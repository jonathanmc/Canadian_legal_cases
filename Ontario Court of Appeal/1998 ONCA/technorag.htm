    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    This is an appeal from an order granting summary judgment

to the defendants herein on the basis that there is no genuine

issue for trial against any of the them.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The plaintiff's claim against the defendant AECL is for

agent's fees under an agreement signed in Russia April 7, 1991.

Paragraph 7.1 of that agreement provides as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       7.1  Kurchatov and AECL acknowledge that
            their working relationship pertaining to
            the matters described in this Agreement
            will be conducted exclusively through
            Tecnorag A.G. and Tecnorag Ltd. And that
            the nature and terms of the relationship
            will be defined according to separate
            agreements which will relate to this
            Agreement as described above.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Section 2.1 of the agreement made it subject to the approval of

the relevant boards of directors including that of AECL.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Apparently although AECL personnel continued to deal with

Mr. Hordo, the President of Tecnorag throughout the winter of

1991, they were concerned about his role and his demands for

significant remuneration in that role as a go-between with the

Russian authorities. AECL had requirements for its agents and was

concerned that neither Mr. Hordo nor his companies met those

requirements, plus they were concerned that Tecnorag had a

conflict of interest in its various international dealings.

However, after signing the April 7 agreement, they continued to

deal with Mr. Hordo, to pay certain fees and expenses he required

and to suggest to him that they would be willing to continue a

relationship with him into the future &quot;following your

disassociation from Tecnorag Ltd. and Tecnorag A.G.&quot; (Letter of

May 10, 1991). But they told him they would not enter into an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement with Tecnorag. He says that he understood that they

would consider an agreement in some other form, and that they

were not proceeding with the Kurchatov Agreement so that nothing

was owed to Tecnorag.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The executives reported to the Board that they had reached

a settlement with Tecnorag and therefore the agreement with it

did not need to be approved. The Board then approved AECL

entering into a Nuclear Facilitating Agreement with Russia which

did not include Tecnorag. In his affidavit Mr. Hordo denies that

any settlement was reached.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Lax J. found that there was no genuine issue for trial in

part because the Board of AECL did not approve the April 7

agreement and therefore that agreement  could not be sued upon.

However, she did not address the issue of whether the Board was

misled into believing that it was unnecessary to approve the

agreement with Tecnorag because a settlement had been reached

with them which obviated the need for the approval. There is

clearly a disagreement between the parties on this issue. What

may turn on it is what the Board would have been obliged to do if

it had it been asked to consider approval of the agreement.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    In our view, because there is a significant factual issue

in dispute which could affect the merits and therefore the

ultimate outcome of the case, that amounts to a genuine issue for

trial.   The order below granting summary judgment against the

defendant AECL is therefore set aside.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    We agree with the learned motions judge that the pleadings

do not support an action against the individual defendants in

their personal capacities as opposed to their capacities as

officers of AECL. Therefore the appeal in respect of the

individual defendants is dismissed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    In light of the disposition of this appeal, the costs of

the individual defendants before Lax J. and on appeal are to be

paid by the plaintiff.  The costs of the plaintiff before Lax J.

and on appeal are to be paid by the defendant AECL.</font></pre></td>
