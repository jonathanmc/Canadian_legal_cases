    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal against convictions for break, enter,
theft of certain air conditioning equipment from Delta Air
Systems, and Theft Over and Possession of stolen property in
relation to the theft of a Dodge Van from Discount Car and Truck
Rentals.

[2]  The only evidence connecting the appellant to the van was a
fingerprint of his found on the outside of the driver's side door
of the van.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Crown relied on the doctrine of recent possession.
However, to prove possession the Crown must prove control over
the stolen item. There was no evidence to indicate whether the
fingerprint had been placed on the door before or after the
vehicle was stolen.  In the circumstances, it was not open to the
trial judge to infer that the appellant had control, and
therefore possession, of the van and the stolen property inside
of it from the fingerprint on the outside of the van. The
verdicts are all linked to the appellant's possession of the van
and are therefore unreasonable. The appeal is allowed, the
convictions are set aside and  acquittals entered.</font></pre></td>
