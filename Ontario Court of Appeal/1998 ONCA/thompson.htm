    <pre><strong><font face="Courier New" size="3">OSBORNE J.A.:</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice B. Smith which dismissed his claim for
damages for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, negligent
investigation and prosecution, and for relief under s. 24(1) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the &quot;Charter&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">OVERVIEW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of
Timothy Jewett, but on his appeal was granted a new trial. His
second trial ended in a mistrial. On his third trial, he was
acquitted by the verdict of the jury and the Crown's appeal from
his acquittal was dismissed. The appellant then sued the Queen in
Right of the Province of Ontario, the Attorney General of
Ontario, the three Crown attorneys who had been involved in his
three trials and 23 police officers who were in various ways
involved in the investigation of the murder of which he was
eventually acquitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  After delivery of the appellant's claim, all defendants
(respondents on this appeal) moved for summary judgment
dismissing the appellant's action (Rule 20.01(3)), and in the
alternative to strike out the appellant's claim on the ground
that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action (Rule
21.01(1)(b)), or was frivolous and vexatious (Rule 21.01(3)(d)).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  After extensive argument and a review of the lengthy motions
record, the motions judge granted summary judgment dismissing the
appellant's action. In addition, in respect of the three Crown
attorney defendants, he concluded that the appellant's claims
against them, other than his claim for malicious prosecution,
disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  After hearing submissions on the issue of costs following
the release of his reasons for judgment, the motions judge
ordered the appellant to pay all respondents solicitor and
clients costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellant has appealed from the judgment dismissing his
action and from the solicitor and client aspect of the costs
order made against him. On that latter issue, the appellant, if
not successful on his appeal, will require leave to appeal costs.
I will get to that issue at the end of these reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EVIDENCE ON THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  General Background</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  No affidavits were filed with respect to the motion for
summary judgment. However, no issue was taken with the form of
the evidence before the motions judge. Indeed, the motions judge,
in his reasons, acknowledged the extensive materials that had
been put before him by the defendants (respondents on appeal).
That evidence included references to the circumstances of the
investigation of the death of Timothy Jewett, the police
investigation, statements made by the appellant, the Crown brief
which had been supplied to the appellant's defence counsel prior
to the preliminary inquiry, and further matters pertaining to the
appellant's three trials. The appellant did not file any evidence
in response to the motion for summary judgment.1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  I will deal with the evidence in summary form since, for the
most part, there is no dispute about it, particularly as it
relates to the general circumstances of Timothy Jewett's death,
the police investigation and the appellant's three trials on a
charge of second degree murder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Timothy Jewett was killed on April 21, 1984. On April 25,
1984, the appellant was arrested and charged with the first
degree murder of Timothy Jewett. On July 13, 1984, after a
preliminary inquiry, the appellant was committed for trial on the
reduced charge of second degree murder. On March 5, 1985, his
first trial began. On March 15, 1985, he was convicted by the
verdict of a jury of second degree murder. He was sentenced to
life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 10 years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellant appealed his conviction and, in reasons
released on November 9, 1987, this court ordered a new trial. On
January 28, 1988, the appellant's application for judicial
interim release pending his new trial was dismissed. He had not
applied for bail before January 28, 1988.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] On September 6, 1988, the appellant's second trial began
before Watt J. After about five weeks of evidence, a defence
witness made some impermissible references to a lie detector and
Watt J. declared a mistrial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant's third trial for second degree murder began
before O'Driscoll J on February 21, 1989. On March 31, 1989, the
jury returned a verdict of not guilty and the appellant was thus
acquitted. The Crown's appeal from the appellant's acquittal was
dismissed on February 21, 1991.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] On August 21, 1991, the appellant sued the 22 police
respondents and on October 25, 1991, he sued the other
respondents. The two actions were consolidated on February 17,
1993.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In the consolidated action, the dismissal of which is in
issue on this appeal, the appellant sought special, general and
punitive damages from all respondents on the basis that the
police and Crown attorney respondents were negligent in
investigating Jewett's murder, laying the information against the
appellant, and in arresting, prosecuting, and continuing to
prosecute him on the charge of murder. He also claimed that the
respondents acted maliciously in respect of the murder
investigation, laying the information against him, arresting him
and prosecuting and continuing to prosecute him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In the consolidated action, the appellant also claimed
damages on the basis of what he pleaded was a breach of his
constitutional rights in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. This
part of the appellant's claim related to non-disclosure of
material in the Crown's hands that the appellant contended would
have cast doubt on his guilt. He sought compensation for the
alleged Charter violations through s. 24(1) of the Charter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) Timothy Jewett's Death - The Evidence Implicating the
          Appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Timothy Jewett's body was found at about 4:20 a.m. on April
22, 1984 on the Canadian National Railway (&quot;CNR&quot;) tracks in
Burlington. The police determined that between 9:05 and 9:20 p.m.
on April 21st Jewett was observed walking north on Brant Street
near Prospect in Burlington by an off-duty Halton Regional police
officer. Early in their preliminary investigation the police had
occasion to regard the appellant as a suspect in Jewett's death.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In April 1984, the appellant was staying at 2023 Bluefields
Drive in the City of Burlington. During the evening of April 21,
1984, a number of people, including the appellant, were at a
party at that address. In one version of events, the appellant
left the party between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. to hitch hike to his
aunt's home in Ancaster. In this version of events, the appellant
gave up his attempt to hitch hike to Ancaster because no one
would stop to pick him up. On his way back to Bluefields Drive,
he encountered Jewett and began talking with him. In short order
Jewett, who was intoxicated, began to argue with the appellant.
In the course of the argument Jewett tried to hit the appellant
with a beer bottle and the appellant ran. Jewett caught up with
the appellant at the CNR tracks located just off Brant Street in
Burlington. At that point the appellant, who was a martial arts
enthusiast, fought with Jewett and the fight caused injuries
which resulted in Jewett's death.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] After the fight the appellant left the CNR track area and
returned to the party at 2023 Bluefields Drive. Some who were at
the party told the police that he returned to the party between
10:00 and 10:15 p.m. that evening. Four witness stated that the
appellant changed his clothes after he returned to the party.
All witnesses agree that the appellant never left the party after
10:15 p.m., that is to say, if the appellant caused the
deceased's death, the altercation giving rise to it had to have
occurred before 10:15 p.m. on April 21, 1984.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Jewett's body was discovered by Stanley Stainton who was
walking along the railway tracks on his way home between 2:00 and
4:00 a.m. on April 22, 1984. The body was found near the
southwest corner of Brant Street and Plains Road in Burlington.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] When Stainton came upon the body that turned out to be
Jewett, he thought that the male he had come upon had passed out.
He tried to pick him up. Because a train was coming he dragged
the deceased face up 10 or 20 yards to get the deceased away from
the railway tracks. He eventually ran over to get help. After an
aborted attempt to make a telephone call he contacted a person at
a nearby gas station who telephoned the police.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The competing version of events developed by the police
investigation centred on the appellant's presence at the
Bluefields Drive party. A number of witnesses at the party
testified that the appellant was present at the party at the
critical time of 9:00 p.m. during the evening of April 21, 1984.
The appellant's position was that since he was at the party at
the time Jewett was seen by the off-duty police officer, he could
not have killed Jewett. To advance that position, he contended
throughout that various statements he made to the police (and
others) were involuntary. Those statements are important elements
of the police investigation of Jewett's murder. In addition, the
credibility and reliability of those present at the Bluefields
Drive party on April 21, 1984 were central to both the Crown and
the defence. The appellant knew who was at the party through the
disclosure process and the preliminary inquiry evidence, as well
as through his attendance at the party. Indeed, most of those at
the party were the appellant's friends.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iii)     The Appellant's Statements and Other Evidence
          Pointing to Him as a Suspect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] After the appellant was arrested he made a number of
statements. I do not intend to review them in detail. These
statements, notwithstanding the appellant's contention throughout
that they were coerced and not voluntary, were admitted in
evidence at all three of his trials.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] On April 24, 1984, the appellant told the police that he had
been asked by a friend to assault the deceased. He also told the
police that he had left the party where he had been on the night
of the murder between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. to hitch hike to a
relative's house. The area where the appellant was allegedly
hitch hiking was about a half mile from the location of the
deceased's body.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] On April 25, 1984, between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., an
acquaintance of the appellant said that the appellant told him
that he had killed the deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] On April 25, 1984, at 10:29 p.m., after being charged with
first degree murder, cautioned and given his s. 10(b) Charter
rights, the appellant gave a formal statement to the police. The
police transcribed the statement and the appellant signed it.
This statement was taken by the respondents Barnes and McWhinney.
In his statement the appellant admitted punching and kicking the
deceased near the place where the deceased's body was found. He
suggested that he was acting in self-defence.2 As I noted
earlier, this statement was admitted into evidence at all three
of the appellant's trials.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The appellant knew that Jewett's body had been found near
the CNR tracks in Burlington. Paul Vickers was the first CNR
employee to see the deceased's body. He noticed the body being
dragged by Stainton near the tracks at 4:20 a.m. on April 22nd
while he was passing on a train. At his third trial, the
appellant's counsel called Vickers and seven other CNR employees
to testify whether they would have been able to see Jewett's body
where it was found at specific times material to the particular
witness's presence in the relevant area. The police investigation
established that no CNR employees, including train crews, saw the
deceased's body before 4:20 a.m. on April 22, 1984.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The police investigation revealed other evidence which
pointed directly to the appellant as a suspect. As I have just
noted, there was evidence that the appellant changed his clothes
after he returned to the party on Bluefields Drive on April 21,
1984. The coroner concluded that Jewett's death was consistent
with injuries sustained as a result of the deceased having been
kicked and punched. The wounds from one of the blows received by
the deceased was consistent with a kick to the face. The
appellant had been trained in martial arts at the time of the
deceased's murder. The imprint of a shoe in the soil near the
location where Timothy Jewett's body was found was consistent
with a running shoe of a type worn by the appellant. Finally, a
number of witnesses noticed bruises on the appellant's hands
after the deceased's murder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] The motions judge dismissed the appellant's claims against
the Crown attorneys since he concluded that the claims disclosed
no reasonable cause of action. He dismised all of the appellant's
remaining claims on the respondent's summary judgment (Rule 20)
motion because the evidence disclosed no genuine issue for trial.
I will deal with the summary judgment issue first.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] The relevant parts of Rule 20 are:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          20.01(3) A defendant may, after delivering a
          statement of defence, move with supporting
          affidavit material or other evidence for
          summary judgment dismissing all or part of
          the claim in the statement of claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          20.02     An affidavit for use on a motion
          for summary judgment may be made on
          information and belief as provided in subrule
          39.01(4), but on the hearing of the motion an
          adverse inference may be drawn, if
          appropriate, from the failure of a party to
          provide the evidence of persons having
          personal knowledge of contested facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          20.04 (1) In response to affidavit material
          or other evidence supporting a motion for
          summary judgment, a responding party may not
          rest on the mere allegations or denials of
          the party's pleadings, but must set out, in
          affidavit material or other evidence,
          specific facts showing that there is a
          genuine issue for trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (2) Where the court is satisfied that
          there is no genuine issue for trial with
          respect to a claim or defence, the court
          shall grant summary judgment accordingly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (4) Where the court is satisfied that
          the only genuine issue is a question of law,
          the court may determine the question and
          grant judgment accordingly, but where the
          motion is made to a master, it shall be
          adjourned to be heard by judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] The purpose of the Rule 20 summary judgment provisions is to
remove from the trial system those cases in which there is no
genuine issue for trial. See Irving Ungerman Ltd. v. Galanis
(1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.) and 1061590 Ontario Ltd. v.
Ontario Jockey Club (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 547 (C.A.). It is clear
from the provisions of Rule 20.04(1) that a respondent on a
motion for summary judgment may not simply rely on allegations or
denials contained in the pleadings. Rule 20.04(1) provides that
the responding party must set out by way of affidavit, or other
evidence, &quot;specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue
for trial.&quot; The evidence must disclose the existence of a genuine
issue. That is not the case in respect of a motion under Rule 21,
where a pleading is attacked on the basis that it discloses no
reasonable cause of action (Rule 21.01(1)(b)), or because the
action, as pleaded, is frivolous or vexatious (Rule 21.01(3)(d)).
THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICE RESPONDENTS
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  Malicious Prosecution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Malicious prosecution involves a fraud on the process of
criminal justice. To succeed on his claim for malicious
prosecution the appellant must establish all of the following
elements:
     (a)  the proceedings must have been commenced by the
          defendant;
     (b)  the proceedings must have terminated in favour of the
          plaintiff;
     (c)  the absence of reasonable and probable cause; and
     (d)  malice, or evidence that the primary purpose of the
          prosecution was other than enforcing the law.
See Nelles v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Ontario, [1989] 2
S.C.R. 170.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] My review of the extensive record in this appeal reveals
that there is no evidence that the police respondents involved in
charging the appellant with first degree murder, or in pursuing
the appellant's prosecution, did not have reasonable and probable
cause to do so. Nor is there any evidence that any of the police
respondents acted with malice at any time. Indeed, it seems to me
that the evidence points in the opposite direction. I will refer
to it in a somewhat summary way.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] First, the police investigation disclosed that before the
deceased's death, the appellant told others that his friend
Darren Exner asked him to kill Jewett. The appellant told
Constable Stonehill that Exner had asked him to &quot;beat up&quot; Jewett.
At his third trial the appellant admitted that this latter
statement was true.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] The appellant admitted his involvement in Jewett's death in
statements made to the police at the time of and after his
arrest. The police also had evidence that after his arrest, while
in custody, the appellant told Michael Bizier, who occupied a
nearby cell, that he had killed the deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] The appellant seeks to minimize the impact of his police
statement by arguing that his &quot;confessions&quot; were coerced by the
police and were thus involuntary. Indeed, in his factum the
appellant extensively reviews his police confessions under the
title, &quot;The So-Called Confessions.&quot; It seems to me that the
appellant seeks to re-argue issues unsuccessfully raised on voir
dires in his three trials. In all three trials the appellant's
statements to the police were found by the trial judges to have
been freely and voluntarily made. In any case, the police had the
appellant's confessions and it was entirely reasonable that those
respondents involved in laying the information took them into
account, along with the other evidence then available, when they
concluded that they had reasonable and probable cause to charge
the appellant with murder. There is no evidence of any
inappropriate involvement of the police or Crown attorneys during
the police investigation, or in charging the appellant with first
degree murder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The police were aware of a number of witnesses who were at
the party at Bluefields Drive who told them, and later testified,
that the appellant left the party and returned at about 10:00
p.m. on April 21, 1984, at which time he changed his clothing.3
If this evidence were accepted, the appellant had the opportunity
to kill Jewett. Furthermore, a shoe imprint near Jewett's body
was consistent with a running shoe similar to the shoes worn by
the appellant on April 21, 1984. Finally, the police
investigation revealed that the appellant had visible bruises on
his hands following the homicide.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] In my opinion, the evidence supporting the conclusion that
the police had reasonable and probable cause to charge the
appellant with murder is substantial, and it is not contradicted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] Moreover, there is no evidence, direct or circumstantial,
from which a trier of fact could conclude that any of the police
respondents acted with malice. In addition, apart from the two
police officers who laid the information, the police officers'
involvement in the case was limited to their roles as
investigators and later witnesses; the appellant's prosecution
was controlled by the various Crown counsel involved in the case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] The fact that the appellant was committed for trial,
although not determinative, does support the submission that
those involved acted with reasonable and probable cause. See
Temilini v. Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police et al.
(1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 664 (C.A.) and Currie v. Dargie (1984), 6
Admin. L.R. 169.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In my view, the motions judge was correct when he concluded
that the evidence in respect of the malicious prosecution cause
of action points to the conclusion that the police respondents
acted with reasonable and probable cause and without malice. The
evidence does not establish two of the four requirements for
malicious prosecution. There is, therefore, no genuine issue for
trial on the appellant's malicious prosecution claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) False Imprisonment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Each time the appellant was incarcerated, it was as a direct
result of either his sentence following his robbery conviction,4
or the later denial of his application for judicial interim
release. There is no genuine issue for trial on the false
imprisonment cause of action asserted by the appellant. See

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iii)     Negligent Investigation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] The appellant contends that the police respondents owed him
a duty to conduct the investigation of the Jewett homicide in a
reasonable manner and that they failed to discharge that duty.
More particularly, he submits that the police failed to conduct a
sufficient investigation in that they failed to follow up their
investigation of relevant leads, in particular with respect to
the appellant's alibi. This concerned his presence at the
Bluefields Drive party when Jewett was killed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] I do not think it is necessary to decide whether the police
involved owed a specific duty to the appellant, as opposed to a
duty to the public at large. Assuming for the purpose of analysis
that the police did owe a duty to the appellant to take
reasonable care in their investigation of the crime with which
the appellant was charged, in my opinion there is absolutely
nothing in the record to suggest that the police respondents
breached that duty. I agree with the motions judge who said, &quot;...
the prospect of success for negligent investigation or
prosecution is nil.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iv) The Appellant's Charter Claims</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] In his action, the appellant sought damages from all
respondents under s. 24(1) of the Charter as a result of what he
submitted were breaches of his ss. 7 and 11(d) Charter rights.
His claim was founded on non-disclosure which the appellant
submits compromised his right to make full answer and defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] It is now accepted that the Charter guarantee of the right
to make full answer and defence requires that all &quot;relevant&quot;
information in the possession of the Crown be disclosed to an
accused person. See R. v. Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.) and R. v. Durette, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 649.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] The scope of the Crown's obligation to disclose and the
defence's involvement in the disclosure process were considered
in R. v. Richards (1996), 70 B.C.A.C. 161 (C.A.). I agree with
the statement of McEachern C.J.B.C. in that case at para. 53:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In criminal law cases, there are some
          absolute requirements in addition to what the
          Crown proposes to adduce in evidence. For
          example, exculpatory information must always
          be disclosed. The Crown must be diligent in
          this connection. However, when the Crown
          makes broad disclosure, as in this case, and
          there is an identifiable area of inquiry
          known to the defence, such as the Manitoba
          documents, the defence cannot continue to
          demand everything and then complain at trial
          if documents within known categories have not
          been disclosed. In my judgment, with respect,
          the trial judge was right in the passage I
          have already quoted ... where he recommended
          a process similar to civil procedure where
          the defence is expected to make specific
          enquiries of the Crown. Where there is reason
          to believe the Crown has documents which are
          not being disclosed, the defence ought to
          make a detailed demand before bringing any
          pretrial application it believes is necessary
          in order to make full answer and defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] In R. v. Wilson (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 115, this court had
occasion to consider the scope of the Crown's disclosure
obligation. Carthy J.A., at p. 120, suggested that the Crown's
obligation to disclose should be administered on a common sense
basis:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... It would be counter-productive of the new
          disclosure principles to insist upon
          standards of scrutiny that are so exacting
          that acute, after the fact analysis overtakes
          reasonable and honest reactions to evidence
          which comes to the attention of the police or
          the Crown. If disclosure is to accomplish its
          purposes, Crown representatives must be
          encouraged to be open to the spirit of what
          is intended. That is best accomplished by an
          ultimate test of reasonableness, and by
          erring always in doubtful cases on the side
          of disclosure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] In summary, material must be disclosed if there is a
reasonable possibility that it could be used to meet the Crown's
case, to advance the defence case or to assist in making a
decision in respect of the conduct of the defence. See R. v.
Dixon (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 1; R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
451.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] The appellant argues that police respondents failed to
disclose information about the observations of other CNR
employees who were working between 9:15 p.m. on April 21st and
4:20 a.m. on April 22nd on trains on the line near where Jewett's
body was found. The appellant claims that this prevented him from
making full answer and defence to the charge that he faced and
that his Charter rights were thus violated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The Crown provided the appellant's experienced trial counsel
with the Crown brief before the preliminary inquiry. The Crown
brief contained the &quot;will-say&quot; statement of Paul Vickers, the CNR
employee who first discovered Jewett's body near the CNR tracks
at 4:20 a.m. on April 22, 1984. None of the other CNR employees
had seen Jewett's body before 4:20 a.m. on April 22nd. I note
here that the fact that other CNR employees on trains which had
passed by the area where Jewett's body was located before 4:20
a.m. on April 22, 1984 and not seen the body does not, of course,
establish that the body was not there, only that no one saw it.
In any case, a cursory inquiry would have revealed the number of
trains that passed by the relevant site and the identity of all
of the CNR employees on those trains.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] Vickers' will-say statement makes it clear that he was a CNR
employee. In my view, it would have been obvious to the defence
at the appellant's first trial5 that since Vickers was the first
CNR employee to see Jewett's body near the tracks, other CNR
train crew who passed through the area before 4:20 a.m. did not
see Jewett's body. This conclusion is inescapable. It seems to me
that if the appellant's defence counsel wanted confirmation, he
should have requested the Crown to provide it. The fact that no
such request was made, as Cory J. put it in R. v. Dixon at p. 19
makes it &quot;difficult to accept a submission that the failure to
disclose affected the fairness of the trial.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] The material that the Crown did not provide (the names, etc.
of CNR employees who did not see Jewett's body by the tracks)
was, as I have said, obvious in the sense that the defence knew,
or ought to have known, that if Vickers was the first CNR
employee to see Jewett's body, other CNR employees on trains
passing through the area before 4:20 a.m. did not see the body. I
see no violation of the Crown's obligation to disclose relevant
evidence. In addition, if the defence wanted the names and
addresses of the other CNR employees, the defence could, and
should have, requested the Crown to provide it. See R. v.
Bramwell, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1126.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] In my opinion, there is no genuine issue for trial in
respect of the appellant's claim for compensation under s. 24(1)
of the Charter based upon the alleged violation of his rights
under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. I think the motions judge
was correct in so holding.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE CROWN ATTORNEYS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] The claims made against the three Crown attorneys involved
in the appellant's three trials match those made against the
police respondents. I will deal with the malicious prosecution
claim first.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] Nelles makes it clear that the general immunity of the
Attorney General and his agents does not extend to actions for
malicious prosecution. The essential elements of malicious
prosecution have been pleaded. Thus, the claim as pleaded cannot
be said to be a claim that does not disclose a reasonable cause
of action or a claim that on its face is frivolous and vexatious.
The malicious prosecution claim made against the Crown attorneys
is therefore not a claim that can properly be struck out under
Rule 21.01(1)(b) or Rule 21.01(3)(d). However, based upon the
material filed on the summary judgment motion (material that I
have referred to in connection with the liability of the police
respondents), it is my opinion that the motions judge was correct
in concluding that the malicious prosecution against the three
Crown attorneys was a claim with respect to which there is no
genuine issue for trial. The Crown attorneys involved throughout
had reasonable and probable cause to pursue the prosecution of
the appellant. There is absolutely no evidence of malice, or
evidence from which malice could be inferred.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] With respect to the claims against the three Crown attorneys
for negligent prosecution, negligent investigation and false
imprisonment, I think the motions judge was correct in concluding
that those claims disclose no reasonable cause of action. Nelles
qualified the Crown's common law immunity from suit only to the
extent of permitting actions for malicious prosecution, but not
for negligence. Thus, the appellant's claims against the Crown
attorneys generally based on negligence in the performance of
their duties disclose no reasonable cause of action. See Munro et
al. v. Her Majesty The Queen in the Right of Canada (1993), 16
O.R. (3d) 564 (Div. Ct.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] On the assumption that the Crown attorneys' common law
immunity does not extend to the appellant's claim for relief
under s. 24(1) of the Charter, for the reasons that I have
previously set out, I find that there is no genuine issue for
trial with respect to that claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Since I have found that the action against the three Crown
attorneys involved was properly dismissed, it must follow that
the action against Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Ontario and
the Attorney General of Ontario should also be dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">COSTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] In his factum, the appellant approached the issue of costs
on the premise that if he were successful on his appeal he should
receive solicitor and client costs of the appeal and of the
respondent's motion for summary judgment. In oral argument, the
appellant took the position that the motions judge was wrong in
ordering the appellant to pay solicitor and client costs of the
respondent's successful motion for summary judgment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Since I would dismiss the appeal, the issue of costs has to
be considered as a separate issue in the context of whether the
motions judge erred in principle in ordering the unsuccessful
appellant to pay solicitor and client costs, as opposed to party
and party costs, to the successful respondents. To argue costs as
a separate issue, the appellant requires leave. So that this
issue might be dealt with now, I would extend the time for
applying for leave to appeal costs and take it that the appellant
has sought leave.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] In his reasons dismissing the appellant's action, the
motions judge invited counsel to make submissions on costs if the
successful respondents sought solicitor and client costs. The
respondents did seek solicitor and client costs and after hearing
submissions from counsel, the motions judge, in written reasons,
concluded that the respondents were entitled to solicitor and
client costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] In dealing with the issue of costs, the motions judge
concluded that the allegations made against the respondents
amounted to allegations of &quot;fraudulent misconduct.&quot; He pointed
out that the claim made against the respondents alleged that the
individual defendants, &quot;... suppressed evidence for the purpose
of obtaining a wrongful conviction ... knowing there was no
evidence to prove his guilt.&quot; The motions judge concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the lengthy and detailed submissions made
          by counsel for the plaintiff to substantiate
          the impugned claims by reference to evidence,
          there was no resilying from the plaintiff's
          position even in the face of the court's
          concern for lack of any such evidence, which
          concern I repeatedly expressed throughout the
          lengthy interlocutory proceedings. Instead
          the claims of fraud were pressed and
          accentuated on behalf of the plaintiff,
          again, with what I found to be total lack of
          foundation for those allegations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] In my opinion, it was open to the motions judge to make an
order of solicitor and costs in this case where there was
absolutely no evidence to support the appellant's allegations.
Although Lamer C.J. made no specific reference to solicitor and
client costs in Nelles he did recognize, at p. 197, that costs
would act &quot;... as a deterrent to meritless claims.&quot; This was a
meritless claim which alleged fraudulent conduct on the part of
the individual respondents. I would not interfere with the manner
in which the motions judge exercised his discretion when he dealt
with costs on the respondents' successful summary judgment
motion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] For the reasons stated above I would grant leave to appeal
costs but would dismiss the appellant's appeal in respect of the
motions judge's costs order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss the appeal
with costs.
