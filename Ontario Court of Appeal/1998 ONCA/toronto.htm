[1]  Stan Whitty moves for an order extending the time for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">filing of a notice of appeal from the order of Cameron J. of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario Court (General Division) dated July 2, 1998. Cameron J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found the moving party in contempt of the judgment of Dunnet J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as modified by the order of Chapnik J. He also seeks a stay of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contempt order of Cameron J. directing that he sell his Motor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Home vehicle within 60 days and extending the order of Dunnet J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he refrain from parking the vehicle within a defined area of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his residence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  There is a long history of friction between the moving party</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and first, the City of  Etobicoke, and now the City of Toronto</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with respect to his attempts to park his Motor Home in front of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or in the driveway of his residence. He has failed at every level</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to either acquire the necessary permission from the municipality</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or to persuade the appropriate court that he should be permitted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to park his oversized vehicle on or near his residence in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contravention of the zoning by-law.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  It appears to me that he has received a great deal of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">leniency from the court and I can think of no reason to extend</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him a further indulgence. While he protests that he was ready and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">willing to initiate an appeal from the contempt order of Cameron</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. within the time limited for appeal, a careful reading of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">record indicates to me that he was only using the threat of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal to negotiate concessions from the municipality with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to being allowed to continue parking the vehicle. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brought this motion after rejecting the final offer from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">responding party and in the face of a further application to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court for directions as to how to proceed with the sale of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Motor Home under the contempt order.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Additionally, it is apparent that he was aware that his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal lacked merit. This appears from the last letter that his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">former solicitor sent to the solicitor acting for the responding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">party. He stated on September 2, 1998:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    I write to advise you that I have
          indicated to Mr Whitty that I am unable to
          conclude that the decision of Mr. Justice
          Cameron should be appealed. I understand that
          Mr. Whitty may retain other counsel to advise
          him and perhaps to appeal.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       The one matter that concerned me was whether Cameron J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had the right to order the moving party to sell the Motor Home</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that was the instrument of his contempt. On reflection, I think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that in the unique circumstances of the contempt in this case, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was entitled to rely upon Rule 60.11(5)(f) of the Rules of Civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Procedure, which authorises the judge making the finding of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contempt to order the contemner to &quot;comply with any order that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the judge considers necessary&quot;. Since the moving party had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obstinately and consistently refused to abide by the restrictions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposed on parking such a vehicle and because it was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle's presence on or near his residence that constituted the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">act of contempt, Cameron J. was entitled to compel him to dispose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the offending vehicle.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  For the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion is not made in good faith. It is yet another step in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ongoing conflict between the parties and reflects a stubborn</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refusal of the moving party to accept that he must comply with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the zoning provisions in his municipality. There is no reason why</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this conflict should be further protracted.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Accordingly, the motion is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
