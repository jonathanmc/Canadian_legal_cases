    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditor, Rose Anne Tremblay, by her then solicitor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The appellant made inquiries of her solicitor from time to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time as to the progress of the appeal as is made clear by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">correspondence filed on this motion.  There was no response from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her solicitor or his office.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    As a result, the appellant gave notice by a letter dated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">August 20, 1998 that she would act on her own behalf.  Before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that notice was received by the Court of Appeal office, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Registrar sent notice to her former solicitor of the Registrar's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention to dismiss her appeal for delay.  This was sent on to</font></pre>
