    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[1]   The  appellant was charged with second degree  murder  and,
after  a  trial before Zuber J. and a jury, she was convicted  of
the   included   offence  of  manslaughter   and   sentenced   to
imprisonment  for  seven years. Her defence of  self-defence  was
rejected  by  the  jury and she now appeals both  conviction  and
sentence.  The grounds of appeal as to conviction all  relate  to
the  charge to the jury and the prejudicial impact it is said  to
have had upon her plea of self-defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[2]   The  appellant  and the deceased lived together  for  three
years  in a commonlaw relationship. It was a stormy one, and  the
evidence  is clear that the appellant was regularly subjected  to
abuse.  On  the evening of April 23, 1993, the deceased  did  not
come  home  from work and went from tavern to tavern consuming  a
considerable  amount of alcohol. The appellant was expecting  him
to  join  her for an evening meal she was preparing and, when  he
did  not arrive, she went looking for him. She found him in a bar
drinking  with two women. She gave him the keys to the  apartment
and went off on her own to other taverns to spend the evening.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[3]  The appellant's evidence was that she eventually returned to
the  apartment, decided that they should no longer live together,
and  took the dresser drawers containing his clothing and  placed
them on a table in the dining room in contemplation that he would
pack  and leave. She knew that he would be angry when he returned
because  he  didn't like her following him to  bars.  To  protect
herself  she put a paring knife in her pocket. When he  returned,
there  was, as expected, a confrontation, in the course of  which
he  broke  a  dining  room chair. She retreated  to  a  porch  to
consider her position and then decided that she was not going  to
run  but  would  confront her circumstances. She  said  that  she
returned to the dining room and put the knife on a table.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[4]  She told the deceased that he had to leave and, as his anger
increased,  she put the knife back into her pocket  according  to
the  evidence of the appellant. The deceased was using  insulting
and  abusive language and then jumped up from his chair,  grabbed
her  blouse  and ripped it. One of the buttons of the blouse  was
torn  off and, she testified, the deceased threw her against  the
wall  and  they struggled. He was 6'3&quot; tall and weighed 225  lbs;
she  was  5'2&quot;  tall and weighed 110 lbs. The appellant,  on  her
evidence,  then reached into her pocket, removed  the  knife  and
stabbed  the deceased. She testified that if he had been able  to
get  her  to  the ground he would have killed her  and  that  she
didn't  mean  to  kill him or &quot;hurt him bad.&quot; The appellant  then
went to a neighbour for assistance and the police were called.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">The Charge as to History of Abuse</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[5]  There was considerable evidence at trial of the abuse of the
appellant  by  the deceased over the years of their relationship.
Dr. Peter Jaffe, Director of the London Family Court Clinic, gave
evidence  as  an  expert on the Battered-Woman Syndrome  and,  in
particular, its application to the circumstances and the  conduct
of  the  appellant. It was his opinion that on  the  day  of  the
offence  the  appellant was in a very lethal situation.  She  was
dealing with escalating violence and knew that when she got  home
she  was  in danger and could expect violence from the  deceased.
When  faced with his rage, she was in a situation where she  knew
she had to defend herself or protect herself.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[6]   The  appellant argues that the trial judge downplayed  this
evidence in his charge to the charge jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[7]   The essence of the trial judge's charge on this subject  is
as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          What  it  does mean though is this  that  you
          will recall that I mentioned to you that when
          you  look at this issue of self-defence, your
          analysis  of  what happened  and  as  to  her
          apprehension as to her position,  has  to  be
          looked  at  through her eyes. So a woman  who
          has   been  battered  before  is  much   more
          sensitive to her danger. In other words, some
          rather  slight  moves by a  husband  who  has
          beaten  up  a  woman before, may  cause  that
          woman to become immediately apprehensive that
          it is going to happen again. Whereas, a woman
          who  has  never been beaten before, may  say,
          well he just did a few little things. So that
          his evidence of her being battered before, if
          you  accept  it,  can explain her  heightened
          sensitivity   to  whatever   act   that   Mr.
          Stropkovics  did. That she can reasonably  be
          much  more apprehensive about her safety then
          what  otherwise would be the case and it will
          also  help  you in determining her reasonable
          perception  as  to  what she  has  to  do  to
          protect  herself. So that the  battered  wife
          then  is  in this position where her view  of
          things  can reasonably be somewhat  different
          than someone who has not been battered. As  I
          say,  leave  battered wives out of  this.  If
          someone does a certain kind of conduct  every
          Saturday night for a long time, it is not too
          difficult  to  expect that  it  is  going  to
          happen again, based on perhaps a little  less
          evidence then would otherwise be the case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[8]   In  my  view, this was a perfectly apt manner of presenting
Dr.  Jaffe's  evidence to the jury. The trial judge  removed  the
conclusory observation as to self-defence, which probably  should
not  have been stated before the jury, and translated the general
evidence  as  to the syndrome into the specifics of her  personal
experiences  and  her  expected  subjective  reactions  to  those
experiences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">The Charge As To The Appellant Having An Interest In The Outcome</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[9]   The  appellant complains of the following  passage  in  the
charge to the jury:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Next,  the question one can ask is  does  any
          witness  have an interest in the  outcome  of
          this case? Well the one person who has a very
          obvious interest in the outcome of this  case
          is  the  accused. Miss Trombley is  facing  a
          very  serious charge. So that in  looking  at
          her  testimony, you of course will take  into
          account  the  fact  that  she  has  a   great
          interest in how this trial winds up. Now that
          is  a  long way from saying that just because
          she  is the accused, you should discount  her
          evidence,  but it is a single factor  amongst
          all the others that I have mentioned that you
          will keep in mind when it comes to evaluating
          her testimony.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[10] This court has been critical of this type of instruction  in
R.  v.  Zurmati, [1993] O.J. No.1520 (C.A.); R. v. B.(L.) (1993),
82  C.C.C. (3d) 189 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. P.(G.F.) (1994), 89 C.C.C.
(3d) 176 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Fabian (1994), 23 W.C.B. (3d)  176
(Ont. C.A.). Isolating the accused in this fashion (as opposed to
referring  generally  to all witnesses) tends  to  undermine  the
burden  of proof and the presumption of innocence. In the present
case,  the  charge  is  replete  with  references  to  both   the
presumption  of innocence and the burden upon the Crown  and  the
prejudice  flowing from the above remarks was probably offset  to
the  point that the jury would not have misapprehended  how  they
should  approach  the evidence or resolve any  reasonable  doubt.
Nonetheless, it is my view that the isolation of the  accused  in
this fashion will invariably be inappropriate. It was obvious  to
every  juror that the accused had a strong motive to  state  that
she  was  acting  in  self-defence and without  intent  to  cause
grievous  harm.  It adds nothing to their awareness  to  have  it
inserted  in  the  charge,  and thus is  unnecessary.  If  it  is
unnecessary  but  may, because it is stated by the  judge,  erode
advice as to the presumption of innocence or the burden of proof,
then it should be avoided.

The Charge on Self-Defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[11]  Did the trial judge leave the jury with the impression that
s.  34(1) is where they should consider unintentional conduct and
that s. 34(2) is only applicable if the conduct is intentional?
[12]  For  convenience of reference, s. 34 of the  Criminal  Code
reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               34(1)      Every  one who is  unlawfully
          assaulted without having provoked the assault
          is  justified in repelling force by force  if
          the  force he uses is not intended  to  cause
          death or grievous bodily harm and is no  more
          than  is  necessary to enable him  to  defend
          himself.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (2)    Every   one  who  is   unlawfully
          assaulted  and who causes death  or  grievous
          bodily  harm  in  repelling  the  assault  is
          justified if</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (a)  he   causes   it  under  reasonable
                    apprehension of death  or  grievous
                    bodily harm from the violence  with
                    which  the  assault was  originally
                    made  or  with which the  assailant
                    pursues his purposes; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (b)  be believes, on reasonable grounds,
                    that  he  cannot otherwise preserve
                    himself   from  death  or  grievous
                    bodily harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[13]  In R. v. Pintar (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 483 (C.A.), this court
held  that s. 34(2) applies to both intentional and unintentional
conduct  and that a charge indicating that s. 34(2) applies  only
if  there is an intention to cause death or grievous bodily  harm
is  wrong  in  law. The appellant urges us to conclude  that  the
charge  in  the  present  case  had  the  effect  of  restricting
unintentional conduct to s. 34(1), or was at least ambiguous  and
may  have  dissuaded the jury from finding self-defence under  s.
34(2) even though they accepted the appellant's evidence that she
didn't  mean to kill him or &quot;hurt him bad&quot;. The Crown's  position
is  that in dealing with s. 34(2) the trial judge repeatedly used
the  expression &quot;even though you intend to cause death&quot; and that,
semantically, this expression carries the clear implication  that
unintended conduct is included. This is a very subtle issue,  but
a very important one, having regard to the fact that self-defence
was  a live issue on the facts as given in evidence. The ultimate
verdict  of manslaughter may have been based on the lack  of  the
necessary intent for murder. If the jury accepted the appellant's
evidence  that  she  did not intend to cause  death  or  grievous
bodily harm but felt that the force was too disproportionate  for
the application of s. 34(1), they may have been led to understand
that self-defence was not available under s. 34(2). The jury  may
have skipped over s. 34(2) and simply applied the finding of lack
of intent to reduce the charge of murder to manslaughter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[14]  Before analyzing the charge, I should observe  that  in  my
opinion  Zuber  J. was not intending to convey to the  jury  that
there  were two separate baskets, one for unintentional  and  the
other  for  intentional conduct. He was a  member  of  the  court
sitting on appeal in R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont.
C.A.),  where Martin J.A. discussed the interrelationship between
s.  34(1) and 34(2) and, in the course of his analysis, at  p.110
said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               In  my  opinion, the words in  s.  34(2)
          &quot;who  causes  death or grievous bodily  harm&quot;
          mean  &quot;even  though  he intentionally  causes
          death or grievous bodily harm.&quot; ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               Under   s.   34(2)  a  person   who   is
          unlawfully assaulted is justified even if  he
          intentionally  kills or intentionally  causes
          bodily  harm to his assailant subject to  the
          conditions specified in that subsection.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[15]  As  will be seen, Zuber J. simply repeated this  expression
&quot;even  though&quot; in his charge. My belief is that he  thought  this
was  a  sufficient means of conveying the sense of  a  cumulative
application  of  the  subsections to the jury.  The  question  is
whether  the transposition of this language from the  context  of
judicial  analysis to a charge to a jury created,  at  least,  an
ambiguity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[16]  The  relevant portions of the trial judge's charge  follow.
After reading s. 34(1) Zuber J. says:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Well  that  is sort of the general rule.  You
          can  use force to repel force. The case  here
          is   that   Elaine  Trombley  was  unlawfully
          assaulted in some way. That she was  grabbed,
          pushed  or  touched without  her  consent  or
          whatever. That does not seem to be really  an
          issue.  The  pivotal  part  of  this  section
          however is that the force that she would  use
          is  not  intended to cause death or  grievous
          bodily harm. [Emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">and concludes as to s. 34(1):</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Regrettably, death followed. Now it is up  to
          you  whether  this section or this  principle
          has  anything to do with this case, but as  I
          say, the issue here is that it swings on this
          statement that where death or grievous bodily
          harm is not intended. [Emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[17] Turning to s. 34(2), the charge reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  next  part of the code is probably  more
          apt  for this case, but again that is  up  to
          you. You may find the answer is in that first
          one. The second one is this:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               'Every  one who is unlawfully assaulted,
               even  though  she  intentionally  causes
               death   or  grievous  bodily   harm   in
               repelling  the assault is  justified  if
               she    causes    it   under   reasonable
               apprehension of death or grievous bodily
               harm.'</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          So  this  is the case then where even  though
          you intend to cause death, or grievous bodily
          harm. [Emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[18]  It should be noted that the trial judge has added the words
&quot;even  though she intentionally&quot; into the subsection  and  it  is
directly  juxtaposed  to the references to a  lack  of  intention
under s. 34(1). A few lines later, the charge reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          So  there  are two factors then.  The  person
          defending  themselves  has  to  be  under   a
          reasonable  apprehension that you are  either
          going to be killed or badly hurt and if  that
          is  your  reasonable  apprehension,  you  are
          entitled  to respond by intending  to  either
          kill or cause grievous bodily harm. [Emphasis
          added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[19]  Here  the  words &quot;even if&quot; or &quot;even though&quot; are  not  used,
leaving  a  direct  suggestion that s. 34(2) is  exclusively  for
intentional conduct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[20]  After  the  jury had retired, it returned  with  questions,
including a request to &quot;explain the latter half of self-defence.&quot;
In   response,  the  trial  judge  more  or  less  repeated   his
instruction on s. 34(1) and then continued as to s. 34(2):</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  second aspect of this one may be the one
          that  is more pertinent to this case  and  of
          course that depends entirely on your judgment
          of  the facts and it goes this way. Every one
          who is unlawfully assaulted even though, even
          though  she  intentionally  causes  death  or
          grievous  bodily  harm is  justified  if  she
          causes it under - there are two factors here,
          under  reasonable apprehension  of  death  or
          grievous bodily harm from Stropkovics. Either
          from the violence with which the assault  was
          commenced  or  with  which  it  was  pursued.
          [Emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">
[21]  Reviewing these excerpts, there is no question that if,  in
dealing with s. 34(2) the trial judge had used the words &quot;whether
or  not  she intended&quot; in place of each of the highlighted words,
there  could be no argument as to the meaning conveyed or  as  to
ambiguity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[22]  The Crown justifies the use of words &quot;even though&quot; in  part
by  reference to the use of those words by Martin J.A. in Baxter,
supra,  and then by Moldaver J.A. in Pintar, supra. All  of  this
must  be  considered  in  context.  The  trial  judge  in  Pintar
instructed the jury that s. 34(2) applied only if the conduct was
intentional.   The   Court   of   Appeal   said   that   was    a
misinterpretation  of the reasons in Baxter. The  trial  in  this
case  took place after the trial in Pintar and before the appeal.
As stated earlier, I do not think Zuber J. misinterpreted Baxter,
but the fact that another trial judge had done so raises concerns
that  a jury may have been similarly misled as to the application
of one of the most difficult sections in the Criminal Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[23] In Pintar, Moldaver J.A. stated at pp.512-513:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               It   is  important  to  underscore   the
          precise  words  which  Martin  J.A.  used  in
          interpreting this aspect of s. 34(2). He  did
          not say that s. 34(2) is available only if an
          accused   intentionally   kills   or   causes
          grievous  bodily harm. Rather,  he  used  the
          words  &quot;even  though&quot; and &quot;even  if&quot;.  To  my
          mind,  the words &quot;even though&quot; and &quot;even  if&quot;
          serve  to dispel any notion that Martin  J.A.
          intended to add a fourth constituent  element
          to s. 34(2) in cases of attempted murder. Had
          he  been of that view, I am confident that he
          would  have  said so expressly by  using  the
          words &quot;only if&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               In  interpreting  s. 34(2)  as  he  did,
          Martin J.A. concluded that Parliament had not
          expressed  itself clearly in  its  choice  of
          words  &quot;who  causes death or grievous  bodily
          harm&quot;. In order to harmonize s. 34(1) with s.
          34(2)  and  give effect to Parliament's  true
          intent, Martin J.A. considered it appropriate
          to  read additional words into the provision.
          In doing so, he did not place an extra hurdle
          in  the  way  of accused persons  seeking  to
          bring  themselves  within s.  34(2).  To  the
          contrary, he simply determined that unlike s.
          34(1),  s.  34(2) is available  even  if  the
          accused  intends  to kill or  cause  grievous
          bodily harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[24]  It should be noted that Martin and Moldaver JJ.A. were  not
suggesting  the  language of a charge  to  the  jury.  They  were
debating  the meaning of language in the Code and were  conveying
their meaning to an audience with a general understanding of  the
law of self-defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[25]  Further,  when  Moldaver J.A. came  to  summarize  he  also
clarified  and  removed  any potential  ambiguity.  At  p.513  he
stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          By    necessary   implication,   Parliament's
          silence may be taken to mean that s. 34(2) is
          meant  to apply to accused persons who intend
          to  kill  or cause grievous bodily  harm,  as
          well as to those who do not have such intent,
          but  who  do in fact cause death or  grievous
          bodily harm. [Emphasis added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">and at p.514 he further explained:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">           I would reject that interpretation and hold,
          as   a  matter  of  law,  that  s.  34(2)  is
          available to all accused persons charged with
          murder  whether they intend to kill or  cause
          grievous   bodily  harm,  or  not.  [Emphasis
          added]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[26]  On my observation of the facts, and recognizing that I lack
the  benefit  of  seeing  and  hearing  witnesses,  there  is   a
sufficient  body  of  evidence to support self-defence  to  offer
reality  to the supposition that the jury may have been  diverted
from  this  conclusion by an ambiguous direction. The history  of
violence  on  the part of the deceased, the relative statures  of
the  appellant and the victim, the broken chair, the button  torn
off  the blouse, and the evidence of the accused constitute  more
evidence  than  is  often found in support  of  such  a  defence.
Moreover,  to the extent that the defence was viable,  the  trial
judge twice urged the jury that s. 34(2) was the more appropriate
focus  of  attention, probably because plunging a knife into  the
deceased's  heart seemed too disproportionate for the application
of  s. 34(1). If, while impressing the jury to consider the  case
under s. (2), the trial judge left them with the impression  that
unintentional  conduct  could  not  be  considered   under   that
subsection,  then  the appellant was denied an acquittal  on  the
basis of the very evidence that she presented; that is, that  she
was in fear of death and did not intend to cause serious harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[27] For these reasons, it is my view that the verdict should  be
set aside and a new trial directed on a charge of manslaughter.

FINLAYSON J.A.: (dissenting)</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[28] I have read the reasons of Carthy J.A. and with respect I am
unable to agree with them as they relate to the trial judge’s
direction to the jury on self defence. Specifically, I do not
think that the charge would leave the jury with the impression
that s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code is only applicable if the
conduct of the appellant in repelling the assault was
intentional.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[29] My colleague has set out the facts accurately and referred
to all the applicable authority. Accordingly, I can be brief. For
ease of reference, however, I will set out the provisions of
s. 34 of the Code relating to self defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">              34(1)  Every one who is unlawfully
          assaulted without having provoked the assault
          is justified in repelling force by force if
          the force he uses is not intended to cause
          death or grievous bodily harm and is no more
          than is necessary to enable him to defend
          himself.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (2)  Every one who is unlawfully
          assaulted and who causes death or grievous
          bodily harm in repelling the assault is
          justified if
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (a)  he causes it under reasonable
               apprehension of death or grievous bodily
               harm from the violence with which the
               assault was originally made or with
               which the assailant pursues his
               purposes; and
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               (b)  he believes, on reasonable grounds,
               that he cannot otherwise preserve
               himself from death or grievous bodily
               harm.
              </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[30] There is no issue between counsel for the parties that the
force referred to in s. 34(1) must be unintentional and that the
force referred to in s. 34(2) can be either intentional or
unintentional. I do not understand them to disagree that the
trial judge in his charge clearly recognized this difference.
Where they part company is whether the trial judge in discussing
both parts of s. 34 used language that was sufficiently clear
that this court could be satisfied that he had not left with the
jury the erroneous impression that s. 34(1) is restricted to
unintentional conduct (which it is) and s. 34(2) is restricted to
intentional conduct (which it is not). Given that s. 34(2) is
more appropriate to the facts of this case than s. 34(1), the
concern is that the jury might feel that even if they believed
the appellant’s assertion that she did not mean to inflict death
or grievous bodily harm on the victim, that this conduct did not
afford a defence because it was unintentional.

[31] Put another way, counsel for the appellant does not take
issue with the instructions of the trial judge on s. 34(1) and
34(2) taken separately, but when read together, her concern is
that the jury would be left with the impression that only
s. 34(1) was available if the conduct in repelling assault was
unintentional. Her first example is the opening part of this
instruction where the trial judge made clear that s. 34(1) was
only available “where death or grievous bodily harm is not
intended”. He then introduced s. 34(2) by stating that it “is
probably more apt for this case” and paraphrased it thus:

               Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted,
          even though she intentionally causes death or
          grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault
          is justified if she causes it under
          reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
          bodily harm.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[32] He then adds:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               So this is the case then even though you
          intend to cause death, or grievous bodily
          harm.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[33] There can scarcely be any confusion up to this point. The
trial judge continued to use the phrase “even though” on every
other occasion where it could be appropriate, except one. In one
later reference to s. 34(2), the words “even though” were not
used. This deviation from pattern occurred when the trial judge
stated that an accused under a reasonable apprehension of death
or serious bodily harm “is entitled to respond by intending to
kill or cause grievous bodily harm”. There is no suggestion that
this statement was wrong, merely that it was incomplete.
Significantly, “even though” was used in the re-charge. Counsel
for the appellant submits that the fact of this single omission
amounted to charging the jury that the defence of self defence
under s. 34(2) was applicable “only if” the accused intended to
kill or cause grievous bodily harm.

[34] The trial judge’s approach to this charge and indeed the
very words he used were formulated by this court in R. v. Baxter
(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 at 110 and endorsed again in R. v.
Pintar (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 483. In Baxter, Martin J.A. for the
court stated at p. 110:
               In my opinion, the words in s. 34(2)
          “who causes death or grievous bodily harm”
          mean “even though he intentionally causes
          death or grievous bodily harm”.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">And at p. 111:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">               Where there is an issue as to whether
          the accused intended to cause death or
          grievous bodily harm the trial Judge,
          notwithstanding death or grievous bodily harm
          has resulted, should instruct the jury with
          respect to the provisions of s. 34(1) and
          then proceed to s. 34(2) as the applicable
          provision, in the event that the jury is
          satisfied that the accused intended to cause
          death or grievous bodily harm.
         </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[35] In the case in appeal, the expression “even though” was not
used on every occasion where it could have been permitted, but no
language to the contrary was ever used. This was not the Pintar
error where the trial judge interpreted ”even though” to mean
that “s. 34(2) only applies, if you conclude the accused intended
to cause the death . . .” [Emphasis added.] I cannot believe that
the members of the jury could misconstrue such a simple phrase as
“even though” to mean the opposite of its ordinary English usage.
To the extent that any juror had a concern arising out of the one
omission of the trial judge to repeat it, the matter was cleared
up on the re-charge.

[36] It seems to me, with great respect, that it is an error for
this court, so soon after Pintar, to find that the consistent use
of the words “even though”, without more, now constitutes an
error in law of such magnitude that it mandates a new trial. For
myself, I think our trial judges should be entitled to rely on
jury instructions approved by this court without the concern of a
mistrial because a panel differently constituted from that in
Baxter and Pintar has a fresh view of the adequacy of what to now
was a standard charge.

[37] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.
With respect to the appeal against sentence, I have some serious
reservations about the fitness of the sentence imposed but in
light of the order for a new trial, I do not think it appropriate
to comment further.</font></pre></td>
