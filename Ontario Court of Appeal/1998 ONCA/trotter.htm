</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This was a difficult essentially fact-driven case. The trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge reviewed the governing authority, the decision of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Supreme Court of Canada in Peter v. Beblow (1993), 44 R.F.L. (3d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">329, and concluded that there had been an unjust enrichment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that this was a proper case for a constructive trust.. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant has not demonstrated any error in the trial judge’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application of the tests set out in that case for determining</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether there has been an unjust enrichment and the choice of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In our view, there was ample evidence to support a finding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of unjust enrichment. The appellant concedes that there was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefit. The evidence supports the trial judge's findings of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corresponding deprivation and the absence of any juristic reason</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for the enrichment, as those elements are explained by McLachlin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. in Peter v. Beblow. Further, we would not interfere with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge’s decision that the contribution by the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gave rise to a constructive trust. This is not a case of a “minor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or indirect contribution”: Peter v. Beblow at p. 343.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Having found that the respondent’s contribution was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficiently substantial and direct to entitle her to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constructive trust, it was for the trial judge to determine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extent of the constructive trust: Pettkus v. Becker, [1980] 2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.C.R. 834 at 852-3. On the evidence, the trial judge concluded</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the respondent was entitled to one-half of the increased</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equity in the matrimonial home between 1974 and 1984 and one-half</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the savings and R.R.S.P.’s. We did not understand the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant to be arguing that if this was a proper case for a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constructive trust, the trial judge erred in his determination of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the extent of the constructive trust.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  With respect to the cross-appeal, the respondent abandoned</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all but one of the grounds. The respondent submitted that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge erred in failing to award a constructive trust in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">half of the increase in the equity in the matrimonial home for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the entire period of cohabitation. The trial judge said as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          While I agree with the [appellant’s] position
          that the divorce terminated [the
          respondent’s] rights with respect to the
          matrimonial home, I feel that I am entitled
          to look at the full period of cohabitation
          and, in particular, 9 ½ of 15 years. I am
          satisfied that by virtue of a constructive
          trust, I have little difficulty in finding
          that the applicant is entitled to ½ of the
          increased equity in the matrimonial home
          between 1974 and 1984.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       While this portion of the reasons is not free from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difficulty, in our view, the trial judge did not make the error</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attributed to him by the respondent of failing to take into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account the period of the marriage in determining the extent of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the constructive trust. It appears to us that the trial judge was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doing no more than attempting to arrive at a fair approximation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the value of the respondent’s efforts as reflected in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">family assets: Peter v. Beblow at p. 347. Given this approach,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the order with respect to the house cannot be looked at in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">isolation and without regard to the orders made by the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge in relation to the savings and the R.R.S.P.’s.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]       Accordingly, the cross-appeal is dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  As success was divided, we make no order for costs.</font></pre></td>
