</font></strong></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    Mr. Tandon was an investor in a limited partnership which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchased a condominium project as a tax shelter. Mr. Tandon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained a loan from the plaintiff  Canada Trustco in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finance his purchase of  his limited partnership interest.  He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had executed (through an agent) a promissory note to Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trustco and had provided post-dated cheques.  He had also taken</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the tax deductions to which he was entitled as a limited partner.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    Through an error Canada Trustco maintained Mr. Tandon's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">name on a list of borrowers who had not actually been approved</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for loans and therefore his limited partnership interest had not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been converted from the blanket mortgage on the entire</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominium project to an individual mortgage on his own unit.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Canada Trustco issued notice of power of sale in respect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the blanket mortgage and sent that notice to a number of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defaulting limited partnership investors as well as to Mr. Tandon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at a time when he was not in default.  After receiving this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notice Mr. Tandon stopped payment on his next post-dated cheque</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and correspondence ensued between Canada Trustco and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor.  Very shortly Canada Trustco realized its error and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">offered to remove Mr. Tandon from the blanket mortgage and give</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him his individual mortgage on his unit upon his bringing his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account into good standing.  However, Mr. Tandon instead chose to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">take the position that Canada Trustco had breached the loan</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement it had with him.  He accepted that breach and elected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to treat the contract as at an end.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The trial judge concluded that Mr. Tandon was entitled to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treat the contract as terminated.  The trial judge further held</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that as the contract was terminated Mr. Tandon was not only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relieved of any further obligation to pay interest on the loan,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he also did not have to repay the principal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    In our view, this conclusion constitutes an error in law.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">We leave aside the issue of whether the fact that after realizing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its error Canada Trust offered to reinstate Mr. Tandon, indicated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Canada Trustco was not in fact repudiating its contract with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    If Canada Trustco's conduct in accelerating the loan of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Tandon when he was not in default was a breach amounting to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repudiation by Canada Trustco, then Mr. Tandon as the borrower</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could accept the breach and treat the contract as terminated by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repaying the principal.  In that way the mortgage security, or in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case, the portion of the blanket mortgage which reflected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Tandon's interest is discharged.  The obligation from which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Tandon is relieved is the obligation to continue to pay</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest or any other fees or costs to Canada Trustco in respect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the loan.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    There may be situations where a lender's actions are such</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that they indicate that the lender is electing to take the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security in full satisfaction of any obligation of the borrower</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to repay the loan.  However, there is nothing in the facts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this case that would indicate such an intention.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    The money was advanced by Canada Trustco so that there was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no breach of that part of the agreement.  It is therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to have that principal money returned.  Had Mr. Tandon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wished, he could have elected to insist on further performance of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the contract, that is to insist that the loan remain outstanding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and that he be entitled to repay it in accordance with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">original terms.  He may have elected to do that had he had a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">favourable interest rate or for other reasons.  In this case he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not elect to do that.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    He purported to elect to treat the loan agreement as at an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">end but he did not do so effectively because he did not tender</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the principal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]   The appeal of the appellant Canada Trustco is therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowed and judgment shall go for the amount of principal plus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest at the rate set out in the promissory note with costs of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial and of the appeal on a solicitor and client basis in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordance with the terms of the note.</font></pre></td>
