    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Baetz.   Lorrie was hospitalized for three days and  subsequently</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negotiations between Lorrie's former counsel and counsel for  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's  insurer, the parties reached a settlement.   As  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his affidavit.  According to that material, Lorrie had suffered a</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">problems  in  the  weeks  following  the  accident,  they  seemed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relatively  minor.  Assessments done in the six months  following</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   Ms. Metcalf remained concerned about her daughter's health.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lorrie  had  headaches, did not sleep through the  night,  seemed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">easily  distracted and had become increasingly clumsy.  With  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">medical and developmental problems, some of which were attributed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the head injury she had suffered in the car accident in 1990.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   At  some  point, Lorrie's mother retained  new  counsel  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">behalf of Lorrie.  In the fall of 1994, that counsel commenced  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new  action  (the  1994  action) claiming  that  the  appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligence had caused injuries to Lorrie resulting in damages  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">some $2.2 million.  Counsel also claimed damages under the Family</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Law  Act,  R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 on behalf of Lorrie's  mother  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sister.   In  her defence, Ms. Baetz pleaded that the  claim  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been  settled by the 1992 judgment leaving Lorrie with  no  cause</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  action against her.  Ms. Baetz also denied any liability for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the accident.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   In  the fall of 1996, counsel brought a motion in the  1994</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action  to set aside the 1992 judgment.1  Although counsel argued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  Scott J. should not have approved the settlement  in  1992,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  affidavits  filed on the motion make it clear  that  medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence  developed  after the 1992 judgment  provided  the  sole</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis  for  setting aside that judgment.  The final paragraph  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel's affidavit filed on the motion summarizes his position:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          There is no doubt in my mind that the present
          medical evidence now clearly establishes that
          the  court approved settlement was not in the
          best  interests  of  either  Lorrie  or   her
          mother.   The  medical tests and  assessments
          which  have been performed since the time  of
          the  court approval have clearly provided new
          evidence  of  the extent and  effect  of  the
          brain  damage sustained by Lorrie  which  was
          not available to Madam Justice Scott.  It  is
          my  opinion  that  the interests  of  justice
          require  that  the judgment of Madam  Justice
          Scott be set aside. ...

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">granted the motion, set aside the 1992 judgment and directed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  1994  action  should proceed.2  In doing  so,  she  did  not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purport to review the correctness of the judgment as of the  date</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it  was  made.  Instead, Leitch J. held that she was  obliged  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consider  the medical evidence developed after the 1992  judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and  decide  whether  in  the light of  that  evidence  the  1992</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment  could  be said to be in the best interests  of  Lorrie.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">She said, at p. 688:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I find it necessary to consider evidence that
          was  not  before the judge who  approved  the
          settlement  in  1992 not  to  show  that  the
          assessment   of   the   previously   existing
          evidence  was  incorrect but  to  allow  this
          court   to   assess  whether  Lorrie's   best
          interests have been met.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  After a careful review of the new medical evidence,  Leitch</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.  concluded  that  as the 1992 judgment had  been  premised  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">medical   information   indicating  that  Lorrie's   injury   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relatively minor and would cause no long-term effects,  it  could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  be  said  to  meet Lorrie's best interests in  the  face  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">medical  evidence  indicating a much  more  serious  injury  with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant long-term effects.  Leitch J. made it clear  that  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">setting aside the 1992 judgment she had considered only the  best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of Lorrie.  In her view, the criteria generally applied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  a  motion to set aside a final judgment did not  apply  on  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion  to  set aside a judgment approving an infant  settlement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">She  specifically  held  that  prejudice  to  the  appellant  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] I think Leitch J. properly characterized her function on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion  to set aside the 1992 judgment.  She was not, and  indeed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not, sit on appeal from the decision of Scott J.  Arguments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  to whether Scott J. should have approved the settlement based</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on  the information placed before her could only be properly made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  way  of a direct appeal from that judgment and no such appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was ever taken.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]  Leitch  J. also properly avoided any consideration  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adequacy  of former counsel's representation of Lorrie in  making</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her  determination that the 1992 judgment should  be  set  aside.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Former counsel is not a party to these proceedings, and it  would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be inappropriate to take anything said by Leitch J. or by me as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">comment on the adequacy of his representation.  If Lorrie  wishes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to take issue with that representation, she can do so in separate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceedings  instituted  against  the  former  counsel  for  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">express purpose.3

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              II.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  If, as Leitch J. held, the best interests of Lorrie is  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only factor to consider in deciding whether to set aside the 1992</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment,  her  decision is unassailable.  The  medical  evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gathered  after the 1992 judgment strongly suggests that  if  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant  is  responsible  for  Lorrie's  injuries,  Lorrie  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significantly  under-compensated  by  the  terms  of   the   1992</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment.   I  cannot agree, however, that the best interests  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Lorrie  govern the decision whether the 1992 judgment  should  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set aside.  In my view, a judgment approving the settlement of  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">minor's  personal injury claim that has been signed, entered  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  appealed  is  final, and must be given the  same  force  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect  as any other final judgment.  A motion to set aside  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment should be tested according to the same criteria used  on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions  to  set  aside  other final judgments.   Applying  those</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criteria,  I  would hold that the 1992 judgment should  not  have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been set aside.

          show  that  the best interests of the  infant
          may not in fact have been carried through  in
          the  way  that the chambers judge thought  he
          was carrying them through.

     1    Under the terms of Rule 59.06(2), the motion should
have been brought in the 1992 proceedings, but it would appear
that nothing turns on this procedural irregularity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2    Justice Leitch also directed that the payment pursuant
to the 1992 judgment should be treated as an advance payment to
Lorrie under the terms of the Insurance Act.  She further
dismissed a motion brought by Ms. Baetz for summary judgment on
the derivative action brought by Lorrie's mother, Carol Metcalf
under the Family Law Act.  Given my disposition of the appeal
from the order setting aside the 1992 judgment, I need not
consider the correctness of either of these orders.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3    In the cross-examination of Ms. Metcalf on her
affidavit, counsel for Lorrie indicated that the former solicitor
had been put on notice of a possible claim against him based on
the 1992 settlement.  That lawsuit is being held in abeyance
pending the result of this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     4    E.g. see the comments of Dickson J. in Andrews v. Grand
&amp; Toy Alberta, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229 at 236.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     5    Section 116 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. 43 provides for periodic payment and review of damages on
consent of the parties and in one other very limited
circumstance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     6     The arguments for and against one time lump sum
payments are set out in Waddams, The Law of Damages (loose leaf
edition) 3.10-3.260;  and in The Report on Compensation for
Personal Injuries and Death, Ontario Law Reform Commission (1987)
chap. 5.  The majority of the Commission did not favour a
periodic payment scheme.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     7    In Tiwana v. Popove (1988), 23 B.C.L.R. (2d) 392
(S.C.), the court reopened the trial after it had delivered its
reasons for judgment, set aside its reasons and allowed the
plaintiff to call further evidence concerning certain medical
evidence which had developed after the trial had ended.  In that
case, however, formal judgment had not been entered when the
plaintiff moved to set aside the reasons and call further
evidence.  A trial judge has a wide discretion to permit the
reopening of a case prior to the entering of judgment:
Castlerigg Investments Inc. v. Lam (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 216 (Gen.
Div.).
     8    Leitch J. was concerned with a judgment approving a
settlement, however, if she is correct in holding that the best
interests of the child are paramount, I see no reason why a
judgment following a trial could not also be set aside if
subsequent events showed that the child had been under-
compensated by the amount awarded at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     9    The parens patriae jurisdiction over minors extends
beyond claims to which minors are a party.  It also protects
others who are under a legal disability:  See Re Eve (1986), 31
D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 13-28 (S.C.C.);  Rule 7.  I refer only to
minors, and only to the exercise of the parens patriae
jurisdiction in the context of proceedings in which a minor is a
party because those are the circumstances which operate in this
case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     10    Steeves v. Fitzsimmons (1975), 11 O.R. (2d) 387 (H.C.)
provides an interesting approach to this problem.  The settlement
approved by the court provided that the minor could apply to vary
the judgment at any time before his seventh birthday.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     11    Tepperman v. Rosenberg (1985), 48 C.P.C. 317 (Ont.
H.C.) is more on point than Makowka.  In that case an infant
plaintiff moved before O'Leary J. to set aside an order of Craig
J. approving a settlement.  The infant relied on evidence that
was not before Craig J.  O'Leary considered the fresh evidence so
that he could decide whether the settlement was in the infant's
best interests.  He held that it was and dismissed the motion.
As the fresh evidence did not affect the result, O'Leary did not
have to decide whether he could have set aside the judgment of
Craig J. solely on the basis that the new evidence suggested that
the child's best interests were not served.  The concluding
paragraphs of his reasons (p. 320) suggest he would have set the
judgment aside if he thought the fresh evidence supported the
conclusion that it was not in the child's best interests.  In my
view, it would have been wrong to do so without first considering
the other relevant factors.</font></pre></td>
