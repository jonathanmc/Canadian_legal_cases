    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    The motions judge was concerned with the genuineness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the issue raised for trial, that is, whether the 1989 mortgage</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was forged as alleged in the proposed statement of defence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    The defendants swore in their affidavits that they did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">execute the 1989 mortgage on which they were sued.  However, they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledge that the monies were advanced in 1987, that a further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$100,000 was advanced in 1989, that they paid monthly payments up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to 1996 and that the balance of the monies remain outstanding.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Their lawyer in 1989, Mr. Carter, swore an affidavit in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which he said that he witnessed their signatures on the 1989</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mortgage.  He declined to be cross-examined on the day set for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his examination because he was alerted that he might be sued.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, the defendants did not later pursue any cross-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">examination prior to the motion for summary judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The plaintiff retained a handwriting expert, Ms. Kruger,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who positively identified the signature of Carlo Barranca on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1989 mortgage and who tentatively identified the signatures of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Joseph Barranca and Salvatore Romeo.  The expert asked for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further handwriting samples from these two defendants but they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    The motions judge incorrectly stated in his reasons that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the expert had concluded that both Carlo Barranca and Salvatore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Romeo signed the mortgage.  This was an error in respect of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Salvatore Romeo.  However, it is clear that had the motions judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properly found that the expert had only a tentative opinion about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Salvatore Romeo's signature, he would have drawn an adverse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inference against him from the refusal to provide further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">handwriting samples, as he did with Joseph Barranca.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    We see no error in the conclusion of the motions judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the issue raised for trial, that is, the forgery issue, was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not a genuine issue on the evidence, and that it was incumbent on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendants in the circumstances to bring forward further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence to satisfy the court that the forgery issue raised was a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">genuine one.
