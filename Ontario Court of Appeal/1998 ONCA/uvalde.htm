    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The fresh evidence will not be admitted. Most of it is
irrelevant to the issues raised on the appeal and the only
relevant part cannot pass the due diligence standard.
Furthermore, the proposed evidence was not tendered in a timely
fashion in this court.
[2]  We will assume that the interpretation of the agreement of
purchase and sale and the effect of the amendments to that
agreement are not res judicata. We can see nothing in the
language of paragraphs 4 or 6 of the agreement which would cause
us to conclude that the agreement of purchase and sale did not
constitute a sale within the meaning of s. 22 of the Mortgages
Act.
[3]  The appellant's contention that the April 3rd agreement was
of no effect as the respondent had not corrected its response to
the appellant's s. 22 request cannot be sustained. Justice Farley
ruled that the sale based on the April 3rd agreement could
proceed despite what he found to be an incorrect response to the
request. Leave to appeal Justice Farley's decision was refused
and, in our view, the appellant cannot now attempt to relitigate
that issue in these proceedings.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
