    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is a motion by the plaintiff to quash as interlocutory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an appeal from the order of Sharpe J. sitting as a motions court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge. Sharpe J. dismissed the motion for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">brought by the defendant under Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The pleadings disclose that the plaintiff V.K. Mason</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Construction Ltd. (&quot;Mason&quot;) entered into a contract with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the CIBC Development</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation (collectively &quot;CIBC&quot;) to renovate the Commerce Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">building. The contract required Mason, as general contractor, to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtain from each of its subcontractors a performance bond naming</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the subcontractor as the &quot;principal&quot;, Mason as the &quot;obligee&quot;, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant Canadian General Insurance Group Limited (&quot;Canadian</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">General&quot;) as the &quot;surety&quot;. CIBC was not a named party to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bond.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  One of the subcontractors, Watts and Henderson (Alberta)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ltd. (&quot;Watts&quot;), defaulted on its contract. Mason arranged for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Watts' work to be performed and was paid or will be paid in full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by CIBC. Mason now sues Canadian General for $1,500,000</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representing the cost of completing Watts' subcontract together</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with Mason's fee attributable to that work.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Canadian General raised a number of substantive defenses in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its pleading, but relied upon only one in its motion for summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment to dismiss Mason's action in its entirety. This defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">asserts that Mason has been paid by CIBC for all amounts that it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is claiming in the action and therefore has not incurred any loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or damage for which Canadian General is liable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The motions judge, in very full reasons, analyzed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">documents involved and the largely undisputed facts in this case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and dismissed the motion. He stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In my view, the contractual
          relationship between CIBC and Mason,
          including the undisputed facts concerning
          industry practice and the specific
          understanding those parties reached
          concerning the bond, constituted Mason as
          trustee for CIBC with regard to Mason's
          rights under the bond.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  He further said:
                    Given the contractual setting
          already described and the purpose of the bond
          within that contractual framework, it seems
          to me to be an inevitable conclusion that
          Canadian General must be taken to have
          impliedly waived any rights it might
          otherwise have by way of subrogation against
          CIBC. Alternatively, I find that it would be
          inequitable to permit Canadian General to
          assert a right of subrogation in the
          circumstances.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The applicable summary judgment rules are:
                    20.01 (3) A defendant may, after
          delivering a statement of defence, move with
          supporting affidavit material or other
          evidence for summary judgment dismissing all
          or part of the claim in the statement of
          claim.
               Y
                    20.04 (2) Where the court is
          satisfied that there is no genuine issue for
          trial with respect to a claim or defence, the
          court shall grant summary judgment
          accordingly.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The parties are in agreement that the only issue on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion is whether the order of Sharpe J. is interlocutory or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">final. If the order is final, this court must hear the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant's appeal pursuant to s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, as amended (&quot;Act&quot;). If it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interlocutory, then under s. 19(1) of the Act, the appeal lies to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Divisional Court with leave of that court.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  It is conceded that the order of Sharpe J., as entered, is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interlocutory in form. It simply dismisses the defendant's motion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for summary judgment. In my view, the order's substance is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restricted to the determination that there is a genuine issue for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial on a material fact or facts. In the language of Hendrickson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Kallio, [1932] O.R. 675 at 678 (C.A.), &quot;the merits of the case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remain to be determined&quot;. The plaintiff's action must proceed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The defendant/appellant points out that, in dismissing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion for summary judgment, the motions court judge made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">numerous findings against the defendant. It claims that these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings, unless successfully challenged on appeal, would be res</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicata or raise issue estoppel at the trial of the main action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I have referred above to two such findings. The first finding,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mason has status to sue Canadian General as trustee of CIBC,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is central to the decision to dismiss the summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion. However, the second finding, regarding the equities of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">granting Canadian General subrogation rights is only one of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of findings made by the motions court judge that were not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">central to the narrow issue before him although it and other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issues were argued in support of the motion for summary judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] As I stated earlier, the sole issue before the motions court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge was whether there was no genuine issue for trial in light</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the defendant's assertion that Mason had suffered no loss or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damage by reason of Watts' default. Canadian General submits that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the application of res judicata or issue estoppel to these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings in the reasons delivered by the motions court judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">converts what is in form an interlocutory order into a final one.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In an unintended emphasis to this point, counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant candidly conceded that if the motions court judge had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed the defendant's motion for summary judgment without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons, the order clearly would be interlocutory.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In my opinion, the difficulty that the parties have in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary judgment appeals stems from a tendency to confuse motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under Rule 20 with those under Rules 21 and 22. Rule 21</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authorizes a motion for the determination of a question of law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosed in a pleading and Rule 22 allows parties to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeding to concur in stating a question of law to the court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It is generally accepted that orders made under Rules 21 and 22</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining questions of law are final: see Wigle v. Allstate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insurance Co. of Canada (1984), 49 O.R. (2d) 101 (C.A.) and Ball</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Donais (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322 (C.A.). In those cases, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">material facts were not in dispute and the determination of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question of law was sufficient therefore to finally determine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entire proceedings, or a substantial part thereof. The orders in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these cases were also final because they ended the proceedings or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a substantial part thereof: see Buck Brothers Ltd. v. Frontenac</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Builders Ltd. (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 97. In the case on appeal, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion brought under Rule 20 was dismissed. The matter must still</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceed to trial at which time the defence considered on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary judgment motion, along with a number of other defences,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will be heard and finally determined.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Appeals from orders dismissing motions for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have, in the past, been heard by our court without analysis of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the order appealed from was final or interlocutory. See,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for example, Bluestone v. Enroute Restaurants Inc. (1994), 18</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">O.R. (3d) 481; and Dunlop Construction Inc. (Receiver or) v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Flavelle Holdings Inc. (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 58. In two other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases, however, this court has addressed this specific issue:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">see Hoffman Products Ltd. v. Karr et al. (1990), 71 O.R. (2d) 734</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Ont. C.A.) and Re: Place Concorde East Limited Partnership v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shelter Corporation of Canada Limited and others,  [1997] OJ.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4909. In both of these cases, this court considered the reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">underlying the order dismissing the motion for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and decided that there was no reason to depart from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conventional view that the decisions under appeal were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interlocutory. In addition, both cases held that res judicata or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue estoppel would not apply to bind a trial judge to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motions court judge's findings. For example, in Hoffman Products,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supra, the court found that &quot;the findings of the learned motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court judge are not binding at trial&quot;. Similar language was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employed in Place Concorde, supra, where the court held that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    The motions judge in his reasons
          said: &quot;In my view, it would be unfair to
          strike the investors' claim of equitable set-
          off at this juncture&quot;. In the context of the
          motions before him, which were for summary
          judgment, we do not regard this as expressing
          a judgment on a question of law which finally
          binds the parties in this proceeding. We
          regard any other statements in his reasons
          respecting the legal issue involved as being
          made in this context.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] When parties argue whether orders of this nature are final</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or interlocutory, they appear to lose sight of the fact that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there is a remedy where the order is interlocutory, although</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">admittedly, it is to another court and requires leave. It was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apparent from the argument in this appeal that the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">real concern was not where to appeal the motions court judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order allowing the action to proceed to trial. Rather, the real</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern was that, unless overturned on appeal, the findings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">underlying this order would be binding on the judge who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ultimately tried the action, either because the findings are res</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicata or raise issue estoppel, or because, in this particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case, they are so detailed and incisive that the trial judge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">even if he or she does not feel obliged in law to follow them,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will show them great deference and adopt them as persuasive. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">latter consideration may be a sound reason for allowing leave to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal, but it is of no concern to this court. As to res judicata</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or issue estoppel in the context of a motion for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that is dismissed, I do not think that the motions court judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons should be taken as anything more than his explanation for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that there is a genuine issue for trial. It is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that there is a genuine issue for trial that is res</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicata.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In assessing the problem whether an order dismissing such a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion for summary judgment is final or interlocutory, I do not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">find much assistance in case law decided prior to January 1,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1985, when Rule 20 came into force. I am particularly mindful of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what the Supreme Court of Canada said in Diamond v. Western</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Realty Co., [1924] 2 D.L.R. 922 at 929 to the effect that a court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may look at the reasons for judgment as distinguished from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">formal judgment itself to ascertain the scope of the decision.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">That case involved an appeal from a referee's report. However, an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">earlier referee's report in the same case had already been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appealed and the judge determining that appeal had made certain</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings. The court found that issue estoppel precluded the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant from raising an issue on the second appeal that had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">already been determined in the appeal from the earlier report.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Supreme Court held that, although the judge's findings in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">initial report were interlocutory in the sense that the reference</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was on-going, res judicata nonetheless applied. However, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal process giving rise to res judicata in that case is clearly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different from that of a motion for summary judgment under Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">20. I believe that the best approach in the present case is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore to look at the legal process that Rule 20 creates and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine if the process is intended to result in final</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determinations regardless of the outcome of the motion for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary judgment.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The leading case in this jurisdiction on summary judgments</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is Irving Ungerman Ltd. v. Galanis (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(C.A.). Morden A.C.J.O., giving the judgment for the court, noted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(at p. 549) that Rule 20 &quot;substantially expanded the potential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for summary judgment beyond that provided in the former Rules of</font></pre>

          the meaning of the term. If the evidence on a
          motion for summary judgment satisfies the
          court that there is no issue of fact which
          requires a trial for its resolution, the
          requirements of the rule have been met. It
          must be clear that a trial is unnecessary.
          The burden is on the moving party to satisfy
          the court that the requirements of the rule
          have been met. Further, it is important to
          keep in mind that the court's function is not
          to resolve an issue of fact but to determine
          whether a genuine issue of fact exists.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recently reviewed by this court in Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Warehouse Inc., [1998] O.J. 3240 (C.A.). While I do not believe</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extensive analysis by Borins J.A. as to the difficulties motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court judges encounter in determining whether the record before</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them discloses a genuine issue for trial, emphasized the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restricted scope of the judicial process created by Rule 20. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">crux of Borins J.A.'s analysis was summarized by him at para.18:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    In my view, the difficulty
          encountered by motions judges arises not so
          much because of any real problem in
          appreciating that the inquiry must focus on a
          genuine issue of material fact, but because
          of uncertainty concerning the role of a
          motions judge and that of a trial judge. Not
          infrequently, it is apparent from their
          reasons for judgment that some motions judges
          have come to regard a motion for summary
          judgment as an adequate substitute for a
          trial. In my view, this is incorrect and does
          not reflect the true purpose of Rule 20. This
          confusion of roles usually arises in the more
          difficult cases in which the parties have
          presented conflicting evidence relevant to a
          material fact.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Borins J.A. underscored this analysis in holding that a motions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court judge should avoid or at least exercise caution, in making</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">findings of credibility, drawing inferences from underlying facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and in weighing evidence.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The notion that an order, dismissing a motion for summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment because there is a genuine issue for trial, can give</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of such a plea. The underlying principle supporting a plea of res</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judicata is that it is desirable that litigation should end and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that it is undesirable that a person should be vexatiously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursued in litigation in regard to a matter that has already been</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gives rise to a plea of res judicata in subsequent proceedings on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the same issue or issues. An order dismissing a motion for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summary judgment, on the other hand, determines only that there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is a genuine issue for trial and the issue or issues have not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been finally resolved. The remedy of appeal from such an order is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restricted by the requirement for leave because the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reflects a failed attempt to reach a final resolution. It is</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal in persuading the Divisional Court that the motions court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge was in error in denying the motion for judgment, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Divisional Court can give such a judgment. That judgment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Divisional Court is clearly final and subject to appeal to this</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, I would quash</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this appeal. However, as the law in this area was somewhat</font></pre>
