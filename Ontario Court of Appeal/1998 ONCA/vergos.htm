</strong>
[1]  In order to succeed in his claim under the policy against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant insurer, the plaintiff bore the onus of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishing the actual cash value of the stolen equipment. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the particular circumstances of this case, there was no other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">head of damages for which the insurer could be held responsible.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge accurately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">summarized the evidence which the plaintiff relied on in support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of his contention that the stolen equipment had a cash value of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$75,000 as of the date of the theft. Taking into account the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature and source of this evidence, the trial judge found himself</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unable to place a cash value on the stolen equipment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, he concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the cash value of the missing equipment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to make that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding and we see no basis for interfering with it. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">particular, we reject the submission of the plaintiff, advanced</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the cross-appeal, that the trial judge misapprehended the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence as it related to this issue and that his finding was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unreasonable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Once it was determined that the actual cash value had not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been established, that should have ended the matter. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff had failed to prove his claim and the action should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge, however, went on to award damages to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff for the lease payments he had made in respect of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stolen insured equipment. On appeal, the parties agreed that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there was no basis in law for such an award and neither sought to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uphold it. We agree.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appeal is allowed, the judgment below is set aside and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its place an order will go dismissing the action. The cross-</font></pre>
