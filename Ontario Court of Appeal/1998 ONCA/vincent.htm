</strong>  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [1]  The appellant was tried and convicted on an indictment

  charging nine counts relating to a number of robberies.  The

  appellant was convicted by a jury of eight of those counts

  and sentenced to three concurrent life sentences along with

  other lesser concurrent sentences.  The appellant appeals

  against conviction and sentence.  For the reasons that

  follow, the conviction appeal is dismissed and the sentence

  appeal is allowed, reducing the total sentence to 3 ten year

  terms, to be served concurrently.

  
  a.)  The Gray Robbery

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [2]  On December 2, 1993, the police observed the appellant,

  Wayne Vincent, and an accomplice, James Biliouras, robbing

  the premises of Vincent Gray. Biliouras had been under

  surveillance by the police in connection with an armed

  robbery investigation. Vincent and Biliouras were both

  arrested while attempting to flee the scene of the robbery.

  

  [3]  The appellant pleaded guilty to three separate counts

  pertaining to the Gray robbery.  The plea did not take place

  before the jury, and the trial judge severed these counts.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [4]  The appellant was subsequently charged with a number of

  other counts pertaining to five other robberies.  The

  appellant was tried and convicted on the following eight

  counts:  robbery and use of firearm with respect to the

  robbery at the home of the Gerstel family;  robbery, use of

  a firearm, having face masked and unlawful confinement with

  respect to the robbery of the Lutz store;  robbery of the

  Tafadjian jewellery store;  and robbery of the offices of

  the Ministry of Transportation.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  b.)  The Gerstel Robbery (Counts 1 and 2)
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [5]  On November 19, 1993, the appellant and an accomplice

  rang the doorbell and entered the home of the Gerstel family

  when one of the Gerstel children answered the door.  Both

  men were armed with handguns and ordered the family to the

  floor at gun point.  Mr. Gerstel was forced to reveal the

  location of his safe and to hand over $5000 in jewellery and

  cash.  Before leaving the home, the appellant pointed his

  gun at the Gerstel's seven-year old boy and asked &quot;[s]hould

  I take that one?&quot;  He also threatened to return.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  c.)  The Lutz Robbery (Counts 3, 4, 5 and 6)
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [6]  On October 5, 1993, the appellant and an accomplice

  entered the business premises of Heinz Lutz by cutting a

  hole in the roof of the store.  They bound Mr. Lutz' hands

  and feet and threatened to harm him and his family unless he

  opened the safe.  A total of $200,000 worth of jewellery was

  stolen from the premises.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  d.)  Count 7
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [7]  On November 20, 1993, four men robbed Tafadjian

  Jewellers stealing a total of $250,000 worth of jewellery.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  e.)  Count 8
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [8]  On November 13, 1993, two men robbed $150,000 worth of

  jewellery from Fortune Fine Jewellers.  The appellant was

  found not guilty on this count.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  f.)  Count 9
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [9]  On December 1, 1993, two men robbed the offices of the

  Ministry of Transportation of $16,000.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [10]    With respect to the Gerstel and Lutz robberies, the

  Crown relied primarily on the eye witness evidence of the

  victims.  On the remaining counts, the Crown relied on the

  evidence provided by the accomplices who were with the

  appellant when he robbed the two jewellery stores and the

  Ministry of Transportation office. In addition, the Crown

  relied on telephone records indicating that there was

  communication via pages and telephone calls between the

  appellant, James Biliouras and Michael Joseph around the

  time of all of the robberies.  After being arrested for the

  Gray robbery, the appellant was questioned by the police and

  provided certain inculpatory statements, revealing knowledge

  of some of the robberies.  During questioning, he identified

  himself as his brother, Brian Mark Vincent.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [11] The appellant raises the following grounds on appeal:
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       1.   Whether the trial judge erred in denying
            the application to sever counts 1-6 from
            counts 7, 8 and 9.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        2.      Whether the trial judge erred in
            failing to instruct the jury not to use
            the evidence as between counts to infer
            propensity of bad character.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        3.      Whether the trial judge erred in
            his charge to the jury by referring to
            prior consistent statements of the
            accomplices that were not in evidence.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.    Whether the trial judge erred in
            failing to give a limiting instruction
            with respect to the prior consistent
            statements.
    </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  
        5.  Whether the trial judge erred in
            admitting facts underlying the
            appellant's criminal record.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        6.  Whether the trial judge erred in failing
            to give a limiting instruction with
            respect to those facts.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        7.  Whether the trial judge erred in
            creating the appearance of an unfair
            trial and a reasonable apprehension of
            bias by intervening in the examination
            of the appellant.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">        8.  Whether the trial judge erred in
            permitting the cross-examination of a
            defence witness on an unproven criminal
            record.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">             9. Whether the trial judge erred in
            imposing a sentence that was manifestly
            unjust having regard to the
            circumstances of the case.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Issues 1 and 2:  Denial of the application to sever the
  counts
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [12]The appellant argues that in denying the application to

  sever the &quot;eye-witness&quot; counts from the &quot;accomplice

  evidence&quot; counts, the jury heard evidence of unrelated

  counts resulting in an overwhelmingly prejudicial effect.

  This prejudice, according to the appellant, was further

  compounded by the trial judge's failure to provided the jury

  with a limiting instruction not to use the evidence of other

  counts as evidence of bad character or propensity.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [13]An order to allow or deny an application for the

  severance of counts involves the exercise of discretion on

  the part of the trial judge. The Supreme Court of Canada in

  R. v. Litchfield (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at p. 113, stated

  that an appellate court should not interfere with this

  exercise of discretion unless the trial judge acted

  unjudicially or the ruling resulted in an injustice. Given

  the nature and the circumstances of the robberies, it cannot

  be said that they were so unrelated that trying the counts

  together resulted in an injustice. It is true that the trial

  judge did not give any specific limiting instructions

  cautioning the jury not to use evidence of one count as

  evidence of bad character or propensity to commit the other

  offences. However, he carefully instructed the jury to

  consider each of the counts separately, not to use the

  evidence of one count to determine conviction or acquittal

  on another, and to convict only where they were satisfied of

  guilt based on the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, on

  each and every count.  Viewed as a whole, therefore, it

  cannot be said that the failure to sever the counts or give

  a limiting instruction amounted to any material prejudice to

  the accused.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Issues 3 and 4: Prior consistent statements and failure to
  give limiting instruction
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [14]The appellant's next issue relates to the &quot;eye-witness&quot;

  evidence robberies pertaining to counts 7 and 9. The

  appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to

  tell the jury that they could not use prior consistent

  statements made by the accomplices to assess the truth of

  those statements, and in erroneously telling the jury that

  the accomplice witnesses had told the police the same

  version of events as the one they gave under oath before the

  jury. There was evidence before the jury that on their

  arrest, the statements of the accomplices had a &quot;common

  theme,&quot; but no evidence as to what those commonalities were.

  Moreover, the trial judge told the jury that none of the

  accomplices had any interest in the outcome, thereby

  bolstering their credibility.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [15]The Crown conceded that the judge erred in the scope of

  his Vetrovec warning: R. v. Vetrovec, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811.

  However, this error pertains to counts 7 and 9 only, and has

  no impact on counts 1 to 6. Viewed as whole, the trial

  judge's instruction was fair. He told the jury that their

  recollection of the evidence was paramount, and made

  references to examples of inconsistencies between prior

  statements by the accomplices and their testimony before the

  jury.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Issues Five and Six: Admission of facts relating the
  appellant's underlying criminal record and failure to give a
  limiting instruction
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [16]In his examination-in-chief, the appellant admitted

  that he was convicted of the Gray robbery and that he had

  pleaded guilty. On cross-examination, the Crown elicited

  further evidence concerning the Gray robbery.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [17]The trial judge's charge on this issue was a proper one

  and clearly explained to the jury how the information was to

  be used:
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       He indicated he entered a plea of guilty in front
       of me and I registered that conviction to armed
       robbery and offensive weapons and having a handgun
       while committing the offence.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       How do you deal with a criminal record? It can
       only be used in judging credibility or
       truthfulness of the accused as a witness. You
       can't use it as evidence that he committed the
       crime with which he is charged. You can't use a
       criminal record to conclude that just because he
       has committed other crimes he is disposed to
       commit further crimes. You can only use the
       criminal record to decide on the credibility of
       the accused. You can't say, well, he's got a
       criminal record, he must be guilty. You can only
       use the criminal record to indicate, is he
       truthful as a witness?
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Issue 7: Interventions by the trial judge
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [18]The trial judge's interventions during the Crown's

  cross-examination of the appellant formed the basis of an

  application for a mistrial by defence counsel on the grounds

  that the interventions compromised the fairness of the

  trial.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [19]While the trial judge's interventions were extensive,

  they did not cross the line into an inappropriately

  adversarial role. With one exception relating to the Gray

  robbery, none of the questions were inappropriate. In our

  view, the conduct did not prejudice the appellant's right to

  the fact or perception of a fair trial.

  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  Issue 8: Crown counsel's improper cross-examination of
  defence witness
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [20]Eyewitnesses testified that their attacker was clean-

  shaven. The appellant called his barber who gave evidence

  that as of the summer before the robberies, the appellant

  had a well-groomed beard. The Crown asked him if he had ever

  been arrested for or convicted of fraud. The barber denied

  it.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [21]The denials were clear. The jury would not have been

  under any misapprehension about the barber's credibility.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [22]The appellant also appeals from sentence on the grounds

  that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly

  unjust. The Crown concedes that the sentence is too high.

  The appellant was convicted on eight of the nine counts and

  sentenced to three concurrent life sentences for the

  Gerstel, Lutz and Gray robberies, in addition to lesser

  concurrent sentences on the other charges.  The appellant

  spent thirteen months in pre-sentence custody.
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
  [23]In sentencing the appellant the trial judge correctly

  observed that life sentences are reserved for the worst

  possible offenders. While we agree that the offences

  committed by the appellant were extremely serious and have

  left a lasting impact on the victims, we cannot agree that

  they warrant a sentence fitting the worst possible offender.

  The trial judge properly identified that the sentence should

  address the principles of denunciation and condemnation,

  however, he omitted to consider the possibility of

  rehabilitation reflected in the report of a psychologist and

  the appellant's strong family support. Given the

  circumstances of the offences and the circumstances of the

  appellant in light of sentences imposed by our courts in

  similar cases, a sentence of life imprisonment is

  demonstrably unfit.


  DISPOSITION
  </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  [24]For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against

  conviction is dismissed. The appeal against sentence,

  however, is allowed, and each life sentence is reduced to

  ten years, to be served concurrently. Leave to appeal

  sentence is granted, and the sentence varied accordingly.  </font></pre></td>
