    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              
[1]  The appellant was convicted of two counts of conspiracy, one

to import cocaine into Canada and the other to traffic in

cocaine. Both conspiracies rest on the same factual foundation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[2]  The theory of the Crown was that the appellant was the major

conspirator in the alleged offences and the case proceeded on

that basis. However, in his address to the jury, defence counsel

for the first time conceded that there were two conspiracies but

that the appellant was not a member of them. At most it could be

said on the evidence that he might be a party to the

conspiracies.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  In the pre-charge discussion, counsel for the appellant

suggested that the Crown might want to rely upon s. 21 of the

Criminal Code and assert, presumably as an alternative, that if

the appellant was not a member of each conspiracy, he had aided

and abetted one or more of the co-conspirators and was

accordingly a party to them. He cited R. v. McNamara et al. (No.

1) (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.) as authority for this

proposition. The trial judge was not disposed to accept this

suggestion and charged the jury on the Crown's theory that there

were two conspiracies and that the appellant was a member of

each.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  The jury deliberated for some time and returned with three

questions, the third being a request for instructions on aiding

and abetting. The trial judge's response in its entirety was as

follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Your third question was with
          respect to aiding and abetting. This is
          termed party to an offence. Members of the
          jury, with respect to aiding and abetting a
          further way in which the accused may become a
          party to the criminal offence, that is, the
          conspiracies in counts 3, 4 and 5, as opposed
          to a participant in the conspiracy is by
          aiding and abetting by virtue of section 21
          of the Criminal Code. He may involve himself
          in the guilt of a conspiracy by his mere
          assist[ance] and encouragement of the design
          although nothing may have been assigned or
          intended to be executed by him personally.
          Therefore, Vucetic could be a participant in
          the conspiracy only if at the time he entered
          into the discussions (e.g.) re supporting
          Sormaz' reliability he knew of and assisted
          the existing conspiracies.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Further if at any time before the
          object of the conspiracy had been attained,
          that is, re count 3, the importing of
          cocaine; count 4, the trafficking in cocaine;
          and count 5, the laundering or proceeds of
          crime, he abetted or encouraged any of the
          conspirators to pursue its object, he would
          become a party to the criminal offence of
          conspiracy. You must look at all the evidence
          and treat each count separately.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Now if you decide Vucetic by his
          acts and declarations assisted or encouraged
          the conspirators with respect to an agreement
          concerning some future matters not within the
          scope of the broad conspiracies in counts 3,
          4 and 5, then he cannot be a party to the
          conspiracy in the present case.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  On appeal, the appellant argued that he could not be party

to a conspiracy: it was a proposition that had no basis in the

criminal law. In the alternative, he argued that the direction on

this issue was inadequate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  Despite the able argument presented by counsel for the

appellant, we are not persuaded that we should, or could, ignore

the clear statement of the law in  R. v. McNamara, albeit as

obiter, that a person may become a party to the criminal offence

of conspiracy (as opposed to a participant in the conspiracy) by

virtue of s. 21 of the Code; R. v. McNamara, supra, at 453.

However, the trial judge's instruction to the jury is inadequate,

a point very fairly conceded by counsel for the Crown.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The Crown's factual position was that the conviction of the

appellant as a party to each conspiracy could be sustained on the

facts of this case, because the introduction of the appellant

into the conspiracies was to facilitate the continuation of the

conspiracies by having the appellant lend his presence to them

and represent in effect that he was the &quot;Big Man&quot; vouching for

the ability of some of his &quot;friends&quot; to perform their part in the

conspiracies. However, in order to find him guilty as an aider

and abettor, the jury would have to be instructed that the

appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his

assistance was intended to assist the conspirators in attaining

their unlawful criminal object. It is common ground between

counsel to this appeal that the trial judge's instruction did not

accomplish this purpose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  The Crown sought to support the conviction by relying upon

the proviso set out in s. 686 (1)(b)(iii) of the Code. Because of

the disposition we propose, it is not appropriate for us to

comment extensively on the facts. Suffice it to say that, based

on the record, we cannot say that a jury properly instructed

would necessarily have found the appellant guilty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  The next live issue is what disposition we should make. The

trial judge in his reasons for sentence finds that the jury

convicted the appellant on the basis of s. 21 of the Code.

Accordingly, the appellant argues that we should set aside the

conviction and since s. 21 is not available to the Crown as a

matter of law, a new trial should not be ordered but a verdict of

not guilty entered. Without looking into the soundness of the

trial judge's finding as to the narrow scope of the jury's

verdict, it is apparent to us that there is evidence to support a

conviction of the appellant, either as a participant or as a

party to the conspiracies. Since we are bound by R. v. McNamara,

the proper course is to order a new trial on the original

indictment for counts three and four.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is allowed, the

convictions are set aside, and a new trial is ordered.</font></pre></td>
