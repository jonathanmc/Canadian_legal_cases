    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  For about twenty years the respondent Wainbee had served as

a distributor of the appellant Vickers' products when on May 4,

1992 Vickers gave notice that it was terminating the Wainbee

distributor contract effective sixty days later.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Wainbee sued for breach of contract and was successful at

trial.  The trial judge found that the contract in effect on

May 4, 1992 ran for a minimum four-year period from its inception

on October 31, 1989 following which it could be terminated by

Vickers but only on the giving of reasonable notice.  The trial

judge determined that reasonable notice in these circumstances

was six months and this is not now disputed.  He found Vickers to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have breached the contract by moving to terminate it within the

minimum four-year period and consequently awarded damages

equivalent to the profits Wainbee would have made from May 4,

1992 to the end of the four-year minimum period and thereafter

for a further six months representing the period of reasonable

notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[3]  The appellant raises two issues on this appeal.  First, it

argues that the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to

the sixty-day termination clause in the contract but rather

construing the contract to provide for a minimum four-year period

terminable thereafter on reasonable notice.  Secondly, it argues

that the trial judge erred in his finding as to damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[4]  On the first issue, we find no error in the conclusion

reached below.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  The trial judge determined that the contract entered into by

the parties on October 31, 1989 encompassed the letter agreement

of that date, the letter from Vickers of September 13, 1989 and,

by reference, the distributor agreement of February 10, 1986.

This contract fundamentally changed the relationship between the

parties.  Its business essence was that Wainbee would phase out

the Vickers products it was then carrying and would take on and

build up a new product line for Vickers.  To do so Wainbee was

required by the contract to produce a marketing and action plan

which it undertook to implement over the next four years.  In

return Vickers agreed to support the distributorship for the

&quot;foreseeable future&quot;.  The representatives of both parties

contemplated a long-term commitment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  Given these surrounding circumstances it was reasonable for

the trial judge to interpret Vickers' contractual commitment to

support the distributorship &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot; as

having a minimum four-year term matching Wainbee's commitment to

take on and build up the new product line over that four-year

period.  This was the future that was foreseeable to the parties

on October 31, 1989.  Thereafter the contract could be terminated

on reasonable notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The trial judge construed this contract to have a four-year

minimum term.  In doing so he was not writing a new term into the

contract.  Rather, he was interpreting it in a way which would

appear to advance the true intent of the parties at the time of

entry into the contract.  See Consolidated Bathurst Export

Limited v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Company, [1981]

S.C.R. 888 at 901.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  In the face of this fundamental provision of the contract,

the sixty-day termination clause presents an obvious

inconsistency.  Its application would be difficult and in that

sense there is an ambiguity which entitled the trial judge to

resort to extrinsic evidence.  See Leitch Gold Mines Ltd. et al.

v. Texas Gulf Sulpher Co. (Incorporated) et al. (1969) 1 O.R. 469

at 524.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  However, whether this is viewed as a circumstance of

ambiguity or irreconcilable terms, the result is the same C the

fundamental agreement as found by the trial judge was that

Wainbee would take on the new product line and commit to a four-

year action plan to do so.  In return Vickers would support the

distributorship for that minimum period.  The four-year minimum

period is the term that prevails.  We would therefore not disturb

the finding below on liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] As to damages, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the

plaintiff's expert, Robert M. Macdonald C.A.  In our view, he did

not err in doing so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] We called on the respondent on only two matters relating to

damages C firstly, whether the trial judge erred in having the

assessment run from May 4, 1992 rather than sixty days thereafter

and, secondly, whether he erred in declining to discount the

damages awarded by an amount representing the savings accruing to

the appellant due to lay-offs following receipt of the notice of

termination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] In our view, the trial judge erred in neither respect.

Given the four-year minimum period, the contract was breached on

May 4, 1992 when notice of termination was improperly sent.  The

assessment of damages properly begins as of that date.  Secondly,

the trial judge found that it was reasonable for Wainbee to

maintain staff with a view to replacing the Vickers product line

as quickly as possible following termination and he accepted the

approach of Mr. Macdonald which treated the cost of

administrative accounting and sales staff as being essentially

fixed expenses not to be discounted.  We would not interfere with

this finding.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.</font></pre></td>
