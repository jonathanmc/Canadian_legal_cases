    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>MOLDAVER J.A.:</b>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]     I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my

colleague Abella J.A. With respect, I cannot agree with her

conclusion.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]     By judgment dated November 4, 1996, the Honourable Mr.

Justice Kent awarded joint custody of Brodie Walsh, then age 3½,

to his parents Deborah and Jeffrey Walsh. Kent J. further ordered

that Brodie reside with his father Jeffrey and that his mother

Deborah have limited rights of access.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]     Deborah Walsh appeals from that decision. She seeks sole

custody of Brodie or, in the alternative, that Brodie be

permitted to reside with her on a full-time, or at least, part-

time basis.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]     Although Ms. Walsh raised numerous grounds of appeal, in

essence, she submitted that the trial judge erred in two

respects:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  he misidentified the principal issue in the case and in
          turn, failed to direct his mind to the relevant
          considerations governing a custody application under
          s. 24(1) and (2) of the Children's Law Reform Act,
          R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 (the &quot;Act&quot;); and
     (b)  he placed undue weight on the expert opinion of Dr.
          Dorosh and in doing so, he effectively abdicated his
          judicial function to that of an expert witness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]     During the course of the trial which lasted eight days, the

trial judge heard from 15 witnesses, including the parties,

several of their friends and relatives, Brodie's doctor and

various daycare teachers and supervisors who had come to know

Brodie and his mother. As well, two expert witnesses were called,

one being Dr. Dorosh, a psychologist appointed by the court under

s. 30 of the Act to prepare a custody and access assessment; the

other Ms. Maggie Hall, a Family Court mediator retained by Ms.

Walsh to critique Dr. Dorosh's assessment.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]     In view of the issues raised by Ms. Walsh, it is unnecessary

to detail the evidence of the various witnesses. Suffice it to

say that in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge categorized

the witnesses and summarized the salient features of their

testimony. Manifestly, he considered and weighed the whole of the

evidence in arriving at his decision.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]     The trial judge's review of the evidence led him to conclude

that Deborah and Jeffrey Walsh were &quot;loving, adequate, capable,

caring parents&quot;, each of whom felt that, &quot;Brodie's best interests

would be met by a sole custody order in her or his own favour.&quot;
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]     With respect to Deborah, as my colleague Abella J.A. points

out in her dissenting reasons, apart from Dr. Dorosh's concerns

about her dependent personality and her ability to provide a

safe, secure and stable home for Brodie, the other independent

witnesses spoke positively about her parenting skills. By the

same token, Jeffrey was also described as a caring and devoted

parent, the only difference being that in his case, no concerns

were raised about his psychological makeup or his ability to

provide Brodie with a stable and secure home environment.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]     The trial judge was called upon to exercise his discretion

in a difficult case involving two loving parents, each of whom

laid claim to being able to best provide for Brodie's upbringing

and care.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]     In resolving the matter as he did, the trial judge

acknowledged that there was much to be said in favour of

maintaining the status quo and allowing Brodie to continue to

reside with Deborah pursuant to the terms of an interim custody

order made some two years prior to trial. Ultimately however,

after considering the whole of the evidence, including that of

Dr. Dorosh, the trial judge concluded that Brodie's best

interests would be served by a joint custody order, with Brodie's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">residence being that of his father.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11]     Ms. Walsh does not attack the reasonableness of that

decision. Accordingly, to succeed on appeal, she bears the onus

of showing that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding

error in his findings of fact or, that he erred in principle in

the exercise of his discretion.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12]     Turning to the first ground of appeal, I am not persuaded

that the trial judge misidentified the principal issue or that he

failed to direct his mind to the relevant considerations

governing a custody application under s. 24(1) and (2) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13]     In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred

specifically to s. 24 of the Act and observed that in any custody

application, a multiplicity of factors must be considered. In

referring to &quot;a multiplicity of factors&quot;, he surely had in mind

the considerations outlined in paragraphs (a) to (g) of s. 24(2)

of the Act. While it is true that the trial judge did not itemize

those factors or engage in a separate analysis of each, he was

under no obligation to do so. As was pointed out by this court in

R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 204, reasons for

judgment should not be read or analyzed as if they were an

instruction to a jury. Rather, they reflect the culmination of

the trial judge's reasoning process and are meant to explain why

he or she arrived at a particular conclusion. They are not to be

read as a verbalization of the entire process engaged in by the

trial judge in reaching a decision.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14]     With respect to s. 24(1) of the Act, the trial judge

recognized that the merits of the application were to be

determined on the basis of the best interests of the child. On no

less than three occasions, he made reference to Brodie's best

interests. Significantly, in determining that Brodie should

reside with his father, the trial judge stated:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          While the comparison of the parents'
          situations is close, I am persuaded that the
          father's situation will, at present, be a
          more psychologically stable environment for
          Brodie. I find it in Brodie's best interests,
          therefore, that his residence be with his
          father. [Emphasis in original.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15]     As my colleague Abella J.A. points out, at one point in his

reasons, the trial judge did describe the principal issue as

being &quot;whether the status quo should be preserved in light of the

expert recommendation for a change.&quot; In her view, that statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reflected a misidentification of the principal issue and

constituted an error of law.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16]     With respect, I do not share my colleague's interpretation

of the impugned remark. Considered in context, it is apparent

that the trial judge was merely defining the pivotal issue as he

perceived it to be, namely -- would it be in Brodie's interests

to preserve the status quo in light of Dr. Dorosh's

recommendation that his best interests would be served by a

change in custody from mother to father? When one considers that

on balance, there was little to pick or choose as between the

parents, far from misidentifying the central issue, the trial

judge put his finger on the critical question. Ultimately, he

concluded that Brodie's best interests would be served by a joint

custody order, with Brodie's residence being that of his father.

That is precisely the issue that he was required to determine

under s. 24 of the Act. Accordingly, the first ground of appeal

fails.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17]     With respect to the second ground of appeal, I am not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
satisfied that the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the

expert opinion of Dr. Dorosh or that he abdicated his judicial

function to the opinion of an expert witness.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18]     Dr. Dorosh was a central witness in the case. With the

consent of the parties, in his capacity as a qualified

psychologist, he was appointed by the court under s. 30 of the

Act to prepare a custody and access assessment. In addition to

preparing an extensive report, Dr. Dorosh testified at trial.


[19]     Before completing his report, Dr. Dorosh communicated at

length with Deborah and Jeffrey Walsh. In total, he spent 19.5

hours with Deborah, her common-law spouse and mother and 17 hours

with Jeffrey and his parents. In the end, it was his

recommendation that Jeffrey be granted sole custody of Brodie and

that Deborah be given liberal access rights.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20]     In concluding that Dr. Dorosh's recommendation should be

given significant consideration, the trial judge had the benefit

not only of his report but his testimony at trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21]     Dr. Dorosh was vigorously cross-examined in an effort to

show that his report was biased, sexist, unfair and unbalanced.

The effects of cross-examination were not lost upon the trial

judge. As his reasons indicate, the trial judge was very much

alive to the shortcomings in Dr. Dorosh's report and he was

critical of certain aspects of it. He refused, however, to accept

that the report was biased or sexist:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The evidence supports a finding that Deb
          is a psychological parent of Brodie. Dr.
          Dorosh in his testimony expressed the opinion
          that both mother and father are psychological
          parents of Brodie because of the time that
          Brodie has been able to spend with both. It
          is very difficult to accept, however, the
          contention that moving Brodie from one parent
          to another will be anything other than
          disruptive.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I am unable to accept the argument that
          the Dorosh report is both biased and sexist.
          The criticism of his report for not clearly
          addressing the effect upon Brodie of a change
          in custody, or not specifically addressing
          who was the psychological parent with the
          stronger emotional connection and bond, is
          valid. In addition, I am also prepared to
          accept that Dr. Dorosh may have placed undue
          influence on Deb's suicide attempt in her
          late teens. In responding to the criticism
          Dr. Dorosh took the position that each parent
          was equal in terms of being a psychological
          parent. When asked about the effect of a
          change in custody or residence he responded
          that Brodie had moved back and forth
          frequently for access with what he understood
          had been a fair amount of ease. He felt that
          a change could be handled.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               A further criticism of the Dorosh Report
          is the lack of emphasis on the self-help
          steps taken by Jeff immediately at the time
          of separation. No court condones self-help
          steps, such as Jeff took, but they are
          understandable in the emotionally charged
          context in which they normally occur and
          apparently occurred in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22]     In my view, the trial judge's critical analysis of the

report and his refusal to follow Dr. Dorosh's ultimate

recommendation puts to rest any notion that he abdicated his

judicial function to that of an expert witness. On the contrary,

the trial judge's decision reflects his own assessment of what he

considered to be in Brodie's best interests.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]     With respect to the submission that he placed undue weight

on Dr. Dorosh's opinion, the trial judge was uniquely positioned

to assess the doctor's credibility and the reliability of his

opinion. As I have already noted, the trial judge was keenly

aware of the shortcomings of Dr. Dorosh's report and he addressed

them in his reasons. At the end of the day, however, after

considering Dr. Dorosh's report and his testimony in the context

of the whole of the evidence, the trial judge chose to give

significant weight to his recommendation that Brodie's best

interests would be served by allowing him to reside with his

father.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24]     It is not the function of this court to review the record

and retry the case or second guess findings of fact available on

the evidence. Manifestly, we are not permitted to simply

substitute our opinion for that of the trial judge on the

ultimate issues of custody and access. With respect, that is

precisely what Ms. Walsh seeks to achieve on this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[25]     In sum, Ms. Walsh has failed to demonstrate that the trial

judge committed a palpable and overriding error in his findings

of fact and that he erred in principle in the exercise of his

discretion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[26]     Accordingly, I see no basis for disturbing the trial judge's

order granting joint custody of Brodie to his parents, with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Brodie's residence being that of his father. I am, however,

troubled by the limited access rights afforded to Ms. Walsh. In

my view, those rights should be enhanced to enable Ms. Walsh to

spend more time with Brodie. If the parties cannot agree, Ms.

Walsh may apply for an order varying the terms of access.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27]     In the result, I would dismiss the appeal. Under the

circumstances, I would make no order as to costs.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29]     Neither party provided the court with any information about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the child's well-being over the past two years. This is highly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regrettable, creating a factual vacuum about the care the child</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has been receiving over the past two years. This leaves the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no alternative but to assess the situation as it was two years</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ago when the trial judge reached his decision.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30]     The child, Brodie Walsh, had lived with both parents until</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they separated when he was 16 months old. The mother had been the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">primary caregiver. A previous two-week separation had occurred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when the child was seven weeks old, during which time the child</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stayed with his mother. The imminence of a separation, plus the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">father's suspicions of the mother's involvement with a co-worker</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(denied by the mother), led the father to remove the child from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the family home without notice to his wife. Only by getting a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court order six days after the abduction, was the mother able to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">home with him for 1 1/2 years. By the time of the trial, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother had had interim custody for over 2 years.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32]     With the exception of Dr. Dorosh, the evidence at trial from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the child's doctors, daycare teachers, and assessors was highly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">positive about the care the child was receiving from his mother.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There was not a single independent witness in regular contact</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mother's behaviour prior to the birth of the child when she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">28, and paid almost no attention to the parenting she was giving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the child. The behaviour with which Dr. Dorosh appears to have</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significance, on the other hand, was attached to the father's</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review of Dr. Dorosh's testimony confirms his pre-judgment and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the impropriety of his conclusions. He preferred the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conventionality of the paternal grandparents' home where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">father currently lives, to the mother's single-parent home, a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">type of home he referred to as &quot;deficient.&quot; Those personal views</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were, however, irrelevant to his task. His task was to assess the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respective parenting abilities of the child's mother and father</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to determine which parent, not which grandparent, was best for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the child. It was not to be a custodial choice between the mother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the father's mother.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40]     There was no evidence that the mother's personal conduct was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in any way interfering with her parenting (Talsky v. Talsky,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1976] 2 S.C.R. 292). On the contrary, the evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overwhelmingly showed that nothing in her private life</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disqualified her from continuing to act in the child's best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests, as she clearly had for 3 1/2 years. Dr. Dorosh's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">report pronounced her former private life unacceptable and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">predicted a future risk to the child. Although he pronounced the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">father's former private life also troubling, he nonetheless found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it acceptable because he would be living with his parents. These</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">premises are too parochial to form the basis of a reliable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">report, let alone one which is determinative.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41]     In accepting Dr. Dorosh's speculative recommendation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial judge essentially chose the child's paternal grandmother</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">over the mother. The traditional marriage of the father's parents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as opposed to the father's yet-to-be-demonstrated parenting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ability, appeared to find more favour with Kent J. than the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unblemished care the child had been receiving from the mother.  I</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">certainly understand that grandparental support can be a positive</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factor in a child's life, but I am at a loss to understand how it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">can be used to deny custody to a good parent.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     The trial judge concluded that:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... a change can be made here in accordance
          with the recommendation of Dr. Dorosh. I am
          satisfied that although there may be some
          temporary disruption in Brodie's life, he can
          move through that disruption to a new
          stability. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The test is not whether a disruptive change can be made, but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether it should be made on the grounds that it is no longer in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the child's best interests to remain where he is - and has been -</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all his life.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42]     Since undue reliance was placed on the expert's report and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since that report placed undue reliance on extraneous and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant factors, I would allow the appeal without costs, order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the parents have joint custody, but direct that the child</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continue to live with his mother with liberal access to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">father.
