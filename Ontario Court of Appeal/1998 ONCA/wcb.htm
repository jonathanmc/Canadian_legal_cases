order directing the Workers' Compensation Board (the &quot;WCB&quot;) to

release certain records pursuant to a request made under the

Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O.

provisions of the Act:</font></pre>

          or labour relations information, supplied in
          confidence implicitly or explicitly, where

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               23.  An exemption from disclosure of a
          record under sections 13, 15, 17, 18, 20 and

          interest in the disclosure of the record
          clearly outweighs the purpose of the
          exemption.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[5]  The facts have been fully stated in the reasons of the

Divisional Court (23 O.R. (3d) 31).  A brief summary of the

relevant facts is sufficient for the purpose of this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[6]  A consultant (the &quot;requester&quot;) requested extensive

information from the WCB with respect to employers having the

highest penalty ratings based on their accident experiences.  The

WCB denied access to the information and the refusal was appealed

to the Commissioner.  As a result of mediation (s. 51), the

request was narrowed down to the  fifty most penalized firms

participating in five programs operated by the WCB which were

designed to reduce industrial accident rates and severity.  The

records for the five programs (the &quot;records&quot;) are essentially the

same in that they list the names and addresses of the top fifty

employers participating in each program in descending order

according to the amount of penalty surcharge.  The only

difference is that records 1, 2 and 3 contain the actual amounts

of surcharge while records 4 and 5 do not.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]  The Commissioner's Notice of Inquiry (s.52(1)) raised the

issues of the application of the exemptions claimed by the WCB

under ss. 17 (1) and (2) and the application of the public

interest override provision in s. 23 of the Act.  In response the

Commissioner received written representations from the WCB, and

numerous employers and employers' associations.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[8]  The Commissioner concluded that the statutory exemptions in

the Act did not apply and ordered  the release of the

information.  An application for judicial review was granted by

the Divisional Court and the order of the Commissioner was

quashed on the basis that it was patently unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[9]  The threshold and most important issue in this case is the

appropriate standard of review which is to be applied to the

Commissioner's decision when he is interpreting his enabling

statute.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[10] The Divisional Court has consistently held that the

Commissioner's decisions on questions within his jurisdiction are

entitled to a high degree of curial deference; in some cases, the

Divisional Court applied the standard of review of patent

unreasonableness.  See generally: Right to Life Assn. of Toronto

and Area v. Toronto District Health Council (1991), 86 D.L.R.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[11] In the present case, the Divisional Court did not conduct an

analysis of the appropriate standard of review, although it used

deferential language characteristic of the patently unreasonable

test.  The issue of the appropriate standard of review must be

determined on the basis of the recent decisions of the Supreme

Court of Canada in Pezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of

Brokers), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 557 and Canada (Director of

Investigation and Research, Competition Act) v. Southam Inc.,

[1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, where the Court recognized a third standard

situated between correctness and patent unreasonableness.  Both

Pezim and Southam involved statutory appeals concerning questions

of statutory interpretation by specialized tribunals.  However,

the application of those decisions is not limited to those

situations as Iacobucci J., speaking for a unanimous court in

both cases, in considering the standard of review, spoke

generally of the principles of judicial review.  (It would not be

logical to speak of a privative clause if the standard of review

were only intended to apply to statutory appeals.)  Moreover, the

authories Iacobucci J. relied on are not limited to statutory

appeals.  It is not necessary for the purpose of this appeal to

review the facts of those two decisions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[12] In Pezim, Iacobucci J. stated at pp. 589-91:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          B. Principles of Judicial Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               From the outset, it is important to set
          forth certain principles of judicial review.
          There exist various standards of review with
          respect to the myriad of administrative
          agencies that exist in our country.  The
          central question in ascertaining the standard
          of review is to determine the legislative
          intent in conferring jurisdiction on the
          administrative tribunal.  In answering this
          question, the courts have looked at various
          factors.  Included in the analysis is an
          examination of the tribunal's role or
          function.  Also crucial is whether or not the
          agency's decisions are protected by a
          privative clause.  Finally, of fundamental
          importance, is whether or not the question
          goes to the jurisdiction of the tribunal
          involved.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Having regard to the large number of
          factors relevant in determining the
          applicable standard of review, the courts
          have developed a spectrum that ranges from
          the standard of reasonableness to that of
          correctness.  Courts have also enunciated a
          principle of deference that applies not just
          to the facts as found by the tribunal, but
          also to the legal questions before the
          tribunal in the light of its role and
          expertise.  At the reasonableness end of the
          spectrum, where deference is at its highest,
          are those cases where a tribunal protected by
          a true privative clause, is deciding a matter
          within its jurisdiction and where there is no
          statutory right of appeal.  See Canadian
          Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New
          Brunswick Liquor Corp., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227;
          U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault, [1988] 2
          S.C.R. 1048, at p. 1089 (Bibeault), and
          Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission d'appel en
          matiPre de lJsions professionnelles), [1993]
          2 S.C.R. 756.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               At the correctness end of the spectrum,
          where deference in terms of legal questions
          is at its lowest, are those cases where the
          issues concern the interpretation of a
          provision limiting the tribunal's
          jurisdiction (jurisdictional error) or where
          there is a statutory right of appeal which
          allows the reviewing court to substitute its
          opinion for that of the tribunal and where
          the tribunal has no greater expertise than
          the court on the issue in question, as for
          example in the area of human rights.  See for
          example Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ontario
          (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R.
          321; Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop,
          [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554, and University of
          British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
          353.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In Pezim, Iacobucci J. concluded that the proper standard of

review fell between the two extremes (p.591).  However he added

at p. 598:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In summary, having regard to the nature of
          the securities industry, the Commission's
          specialization of duties and policy
          development role as well as the nature of the
          problem before the court, considerable
          deference is warranted in the present case
          notwithstanding the fact that there is a
          statutory right of appeal and there is no
          privative clause.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] In Southam, Iacobucci J. again addressed the need for a

third standard.  At p. 765, he said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               In Pezim v. British Columbia
          (Superintendent of Brokers), [1994] 2 S.C.R.
          557, a decision which, like this one,
          concerned a decision of an expert tribunal
          that was subject to a statutory right of
          appeal, the Court declared that the standard
          of review is a function of many factors.
          Depending on how the factors play out in a
          particular instance, the standard may fall
          somewhere between correctness, at the more
          exacting end of the spectrum, and patently
          unreasonable, at the more deferential end.
          See pp. 589-90.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">And at pp. 776-77:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I conclude that the third standard
          should be whether the decision of the
          Tribunal is unreasonable.  This test is to be
          distinguished from the most deferential
          standard of review, which requires courts to
          consider whether a tribunal's decision is
          patently unreasonable.  An unreasonable
          decision is one that, in the main, is not
          supported by any reasons that can stand up to
          a somewhat probing examination.  Accordingly,
          a court reviewing a conclusion on the
          reasonableness standard must look to see
          whether any reasons support it.  The defect,
          if there is one, could presumably be in the
          evidentiary foundation itself or in the
          logical process by which conclusions are
          sought to be drawn from it.  An example of
          the former kind of defect would be an
          assumption that had no basis in the evidence,
          or that was contrary to the overwhelming
          weight of the evidence.  An example of the
          latter kind of defect would be a
          contradiction in the premises or an invalid
          inference.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The difference between &quot;unreasonable&quot;
          and &quot;patently unreasonable&quot; lies in the
          immediacy or obviousness of the defect.  If
          the defect is apparent on the face of the
          tribunal's reasons, then the tribunal's
          decision is patently unreasonable.  But if it
          takes some significant searching or testing
          to find the defect, then the decision is
          unreasonable but not patently unreasonable.
          As Cory J. observed in Canada (Attorney
          General) v. Public Service Alliance of
          Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941, at p. 963, &quot;[i]n
          the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
          'patently', an adverb, is defined as 'openly,
          evidently, clearly'&quot;.  This is not to say, of
          course, that judges reviewing a decision on
          the standard of patent unreasonableness may
          not examine the record.  If the decision
          under review is sufficiently difficult, then
          perhaps a great deal of reading and thinking
          will be required before the judge will be
          able to grasp the dimensions of the problem.
          See National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada
          (Import Tribunal), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at
          p. 1370, per Gonthier J.; see also Toronto
          (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F.,
          District 15, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487, at
          para. 47, per Cory J.  But once the lines of
          the problem have come into focus, if the
          decision is patently unreasonable, then the
          unreasonableness will be evident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">And further at 778-79:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The standard of reasonableness
          simpliciter is also closely akin to the
          standard that this Court has said should be
          applied in reviewing findings of fact by
          trial judges.  In Stein v. &quot;Kathy K&quot; (The
          Ship), [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, at p. 806,
          Ritchie J. described the standard in the
          following terms:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               ... the accepted approach of a court of
               appeal is to test the findings [of fact]
               made at trial on the basis of whether or
               not they were clearly wrong rather than
               whether they accorded with that court's
               view of the balance of probability.
               [Emphasis is Iacobucci J.'s.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Even as a matter of semantics, the
          closeness of the &quot;clearly wrong&quot; test to the
          standard of reasonableness simpliciter is
          obvious.  It is true that many things are
          wrong that are not unreasonable; but when
          &quot;clearly&quot; is added to &quot;wrong&quot;, the meaning is
          brought much nearer to that of
          &quot;unreasonable&quot;.  Consequently, the clearly
          wrong test represents a striking out from the
          correctness test in the direction of
          deference.  But the clearly wrong test does
          not go so far as the standard of patent
          unreasonableness.  For if many things are
          wrong that are not unreasonable, then many
          things are clearly wrong that are not
          patently unreasonable (on the assumption that
          &quot;clearly&quot; and &quot;patently&quot; are close synonyms).
          It follows, then, that the clearly wrong
          test, like the standard of reasonableness
          simpliciter, falls on the continuum between
          correctness and the standard of patent
          unreasonableness.  Because the clearly wrong
          test is familiar to Canadian judges, it may
          serve as a guide to them in applying the
          standard of reasonableness simpliciter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
In that case, Iacobucci J. applied the standard of reasonableness

simpliciter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] It is in light of these directions that the appropriate

standard of deference must be considered in the present case.  To

perform the necessary &quot;pragmatic and functional&quot; analysis there

must be a balancing of the factors for and against the two

extremes of correctness, which warrants the least degree of

deference, and patent unreasonableness, which demands the highest

degree of deference.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] On the limited deference side of the coin, there is no

privative or finality clause to assist in determining the

legislature's intention.  In addition, the practice of the

Commissioner (as was done in this case) is to request and review

written submissions, without affidavits or sworn evidence.  (A

forty-day hearing involving fifty witnesses and a review and

evaluation of the evidence was an important consideration in the

balancing act in Southam.)   In these circumstances, the role of

the tribunal with respect to fact finding and weighing of

evidence is reduced.  In addition, the Commissioner does not

exercise a policy-making function: his function is to apply the

statutory provisions to the material before him (see Pezim at

p. 596).  These factors indicate that the decision of the

Commissioner was not intended to be final and as such attracts

less deference.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[16] On the greater deference side of the coin, there are factors

that point in the direction of deference.  There is no statutory

right of appeal.  The purpose of the Act is to provide access to

information under the control of government institutions, in

accordance with the principles that information should be

available to the public, that necessary exemptions should be

limited and specific, and that decisions on disclosure of

government information should be reviewed independently from

government.  The Commissioner, an officer of the legislature, is

required to administer the Act and to provide independent review

of government decisions on access to information.  He is also

required to determine if any of the statutory exemptions apply.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] In United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America

Local 579 v. Bradco Construction Limited, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 316 at

p. 335, Sopinka J. emphasized that &quot;the expertise of the tribunal

is of the utmost importance in determining the intention of the

legislator with respect to the degree of deference to be shown to

a tribunal's decision in the absence of a full privative clause&quot;.

In John Doe v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner),

Campbell J,. speaking for the majority of the Divisional Court,

commented on the expertise of the Commissioner.  At pp. 782-83,

he stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Accordingly, the commissioner is
          required to develop and apply expertise in
          the management of many kinds of government
          information, thereby acquiring a unique range
          of expertise not shared by the courts.  The
          wide range of the commissioner's mandate is
          beyond areas typically associated with the
          court's expertise.  To paraphrase the
          language used by Dickson C.J.C., as he then
          was, in New Brunswick Liquor Corp. v.
          Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local
          963, supra, the commission is a specialized
          agency which administers a comprehensive
          statute regulating the release and retention
          of government information.  In the
          administration of that regime, the
          commissioner is called upon not only to find
          facts and decide questions of law, but also
          to exercise an understanding of the body of
          specialized expertise that is beginning to
          develop around systems for access to
          government information and the protection of
          personal data.  The statute calls for a
          delicate balance between the need to provide
          access to government records and the right to
          the protection of personal privacy.
          Sensitivity and expertise on the part of the
          commissioner is all the more required if the
          twin purposes of the legislation are to be
          met.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The commission has issued over 500
          orders  in the five years since its creation
          [now 2,000], resulting in an expertise
          acquired on a daily basis in the management
          of government information.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Considering all these factors, it is my view that the

present case falls between the two extremes of &quot;correctness&quot; and

&quot;patent unreasonableness&quot;.  It calls for a standard more

deferential than correctness but less deferential than patent

unreasonableness.  This is the third standard articulated by

Iacobucci J. in Pezim and Southam: reasonabless simpliciter,

which still results in considerable deference being given to the

tribunal's decision.  Unlike Walmsley v. A.G. Ont. (1997), 34

O.R. (3d) 611 (Ont. C.A.), this case concerns sections of the Act

which are not jurisdiction limiting.  Sections 17(1) and (2)

apply to documents that otherwise come within the scope of the

legislation and which but for these exemptions would be

disclosable.  In determining whether these documents come within

these exemptions the Commissioner is applying his expertise in

balancing the need for access and the right to protection of

privacy.  While this might otherwise suggest that maximum

deference apply to his findings, there is no privative clause

protecting those findings.  Moreover, the procedure used by the

Commissioner lacks the validation provided by examination and

cross-examination under oath.  Finally, the Commissioner's task

of interpreting and applying the exemptions is simply statutory

interpretation which does not require policy-making from the

decision maker.  These factors have led me to conclude that the

somewhat less deferential standard of simple reasonableness is

appropriate in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD TO S. 17(1)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] The relevant portions of s. 17(1) are repeated here for

convenience:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               17.C(1)  A head shall refuse to disclose
          a record that reveals a trade secret or
          scientific, technical, commercial, financial
          or labour relations information, supplied in
          confidence implicitly or explicitly, where
          the disclosure could reasonably be expected
          to,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  prejudice significantly the competitive
               position or interfere significantly with
               the contractual or other negotiations of
               a person, group of persons, or
               organization;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (c)  result in undue loss or gain to any

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ....</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Did the Commissioner act unreasonably when he concluded that

the exemptions in s. 17(1) of the Act did not apply and ordered

the WCB to release the records related to the five workplace

health and safety programs?  In my view, he did not act

unreasonably.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] The circumstances of this case are most unusual.  After the

request for information, the requester did not make any

submissions to the Commissioner, and did not appear before the

Divisional Court or before this court.    The request only

involves 1990 information, which is probably no longer relevant.

The absence of the requester in the early stage of the

application may suggest that he was not serious about his

application.  The requester's absence may explain why there was

no material supporting the release of the records.  However, that

does not mean that the uncontradicted evidence opposing the

release of the records had to be accepted.  The Commissioner was

still required to decide whether or not the exemptions applied.

The legislature intended that fact finding and the weighing of

the contents of the written submissions be dealt with by the

Commissioner.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[22] The Commissioner stated (the Divisional Court agreed and the

test was not attacked during this appeal) that in order to

determine if the exemptions in ss. 17(1)(a) and (c) of the Act

applied, the following three-part test had to be satisfied:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1) the record must reveal information that
          is a trade secret or scientific, technical,
          commercial, financial or labour relations
          information; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2) the information must have been supplied
          to the Board in confidence, either implicitly
          or explicitly; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3) the prospect of disclosure must give rise
          to a reasonable expectation that one of the
          types of injuries specified in subsections
          17(1)(a) and/or (c) will occur.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Failure to satisfy the requirements of any part of this test will

render the s. 17(1) claim for exemption invalid.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] The Commissioner found that records 1, 2 and 3 contained

financial information that satisfied Part 1 of the test.

However, with respect to records 3 and 4, he found that as they

contained only the names and addresses of employers, they did not

satisfy the first part of the test.  With respect to Part 2, the

Commissioner found that the records did not meet the test for

exemption on the basis of confidentiality because the surcharge

amounts were not &quot;supplied&quot; to the WCB but rather were calculated

by the WCB.  He further found that, as the names and addresses of

the listed employers were required by the legislation, they could

not be said to have been supplied in confidence.  Lastly, with

respect to Part 3, the Commissioner stated that, in light of his

conclusions on Parts 1 and 2, he did not need to decide whether

this part of the test had been satisfied.  However, he went on to

conclude that, in any event, the test had not been met because

&quot;they have failed to bridge the evidentiary gap necessary to

establish that disclosure of the records at issue in these

appeals would reveal this type of information&quot;.   Thus, he

concluded that there was only speculation about possible harm and

the third part of the exemption test had not been met.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[24] The Divisional Court found that the Commissioner's decision

was patently unreasonable.  It concluded that the Commissioner

patently erred with respect to Part 1 of the test.  As the

records were arranged in descending order with respect to amounts

of surcharge imposed on the listed employers, they disclosed

information of the type referred to in Part 1 of the test.  The

Divisional Court also concluded that the Commissioner had

patently erred with respect to Part 2 of the test because the

registration forms were headed with the words &quot;all information is

strictly confidential&quot; and the records came within Part 2 of the

test.  As to Part 3, once again, the Divisional Court found that

the Commissioner had patently erred because he applied too

stringent a test, i.e. a test requiring &quot;detailed and convincing&quot;

evidence.  The Divisional Court noted that the onus was on the

WCB to show reasonable expectation of harm.  It concluded that,

in any event, the evidence of harm was overwhelming.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[25] Was the decision of the Commissioner unreasonable?  The

decision need not be correct as long as it was not unreasonable.

At the outset, it is essential to recall the meaning of the word

&quot;unreasonable&quot; in order to determine the appropriate degree of

deference.   In Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service

Alliance of Canada, supra Cory J., in the context of discussing

the meaning of &quot;patent unreasonableness&quot;, provided a definition

of the word &quot;unreasonable&quot;.  At p. 963, he stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          &quot;Unreasonable&quot; is defined as &quot;[n]ot having
          the faculty of reason; irrational. ... Not
          acting in accordance with reason or good
          sense&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Hence, to conclude that a decision is unreasonable the court must

find that it is irrational or not in accordance with reason.  It

need not find that the decision is clearly irrational or patently

unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[26] With respect to Part 1 of the test for exemption, the

Commissioner adopted a meaning of the terms which is consistent

with his previous orders, previous court decisions and dictionary

meanings.  His interpretation cannot be said to be unreasonable.

With respect to Part 2, the records themselves do not reveal any

information supplied by the employers on the various forms

provided to the WCB.  The records had been generated by the WCB

based on data supplied by the employers.  The Commissioner acted

reasonably and in accordance with the language of the statute in

determining that disclosure of the records would not reveal

information supplied in confidence to the WCB by the employers.

Lastly, as to Part 3,  the use of the words &quot;detailed and

convincing&quot; do not modify the interpretation of the exemption or

change the standard of proof.  These words simply describe the

quality and cogency of the evidence required to satisfy the onus

of establishing reasonable expectation of harm.  Similar

expressions have been used by the Supreme Court of Canada to

describe the quality of evidence required to satisfy the burden

of proof in civil cases.  If the evidence lacks detail and is

unconvincing, it fails to satisfy the onus and the information

would have to be disclosed.  It was the Commissioner's function

to weigh the material.  Again, it cannot be said that the

Commissioner acted unreasonably.  Nor was it unreasonable for him

to conclude that the submissions amounted, at most, to

speculation of possible harm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[27] The Commissioner was dealing with the provisions of s. 17 of

the Act, provisions that he deals with on a regular basis.  The

reasons of the Commissioner are detailed, reasoned and logical.

The Divisional Court disagreed with the decision of the

Commissioner.  Deferential language was used but not applied.  In

my opinion, the Divisional Court substituted its own view of the

interpretation and application of the statute and of the evidence

before the Commissioner and thus applied the wrong standard of

review.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[28] Since the Commissioner found that no exemption from

disclosure had been established, he did not consider that it was

necessary to deal with the public interest override in s. 23 of

the Act.  I see no obligation, in these circumstances, that

required the Commissioner to deal with s. 23.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
SECTION 17(2) OF THE ACT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[29] The Commissioner also found that the records were not exempt

under s. 17 (2) of the Act.  Section 17(2) is repeated here for

convenience:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2) A head shall refuse to disclose a record
          that reveals information that was obtained on
          a tax return or gathered for the purpose of
          determining tax liability or collecting a
          tax.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[30] On this issue, the Divisional Court stated that the &quot;badges

of taxation were present&quot;; however, it deferred to the

Commissioner and did not interfere with his decision on this

issue &quot;based on the Massey-Ferguson decision&quot; [Massey-Ferguson

Industries Ltd. v. Saskatchewan, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 413].   The WCB

cross-appeals this part of the decision of the Divisional Court.

The intervener, the Attorney General, takes no position with

respect to the cross-appeal.  The other interveners support the

position of the WCB.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[31] The primary issue is whether or not the WCB assessments or

levies are a &quot;tax&quot;.  In my view, the Commissioner reached a

reasonable conclusion in determining that the assessments are not

a tax.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[32] There are three cases which are directly relevant to the

cross-appeal.  They are: Workmen's Compensation Board v. C.P.R.

Co. (1919), 48 D.L.R. 218 (P.C.), Royal Bank v. Workmans'

Compensation Bd. of N.S., [1936] 4 D.L.R. 9 (S.C.C.) and Massey-

Ferguson, supra.  Broadly speaking, the first two cases are said

to stand for the proposition that levies or assessments are a

&quot;tax&quot;, whereas the last case comes to the opposite conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[33] In C.P.R., the Privy Council dealt with the question whether

the payment of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act

of British Columbia was ultra vires of the province.  Lord

Viscount Haldane stated at p. 221:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Nor can it be successfully contended that the
          Province had not a general power to impose
          direct taxation in this form on the
          respondents if for Provincial purposes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
Viscount Haldane did not explain why workers' compensation

assessments were taxes.  He did not specifically conclude that

the assessments were taxes, he merely referred to them as such.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[34] In Royal Bank, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the

issue of priorities under the provisions of the Bank Act, R.S.C.

1927, c. 12, s. 88, between an assessment due under the Workmen's

Compensation Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 129, s. 79 and a bank's

instrument.  The issue whether the asssessment amounted to a

&quot;tax&quot; was not argued.  The majority accepted the appellant's

admission that a workers' compensation assessment was a tax and

added that it had no doubt that it was a tax.  In a concurring

judgment, it was assumed, without deciding, that the workers'

compensation assessment was a tax.  Once again, there was no

legal analysis as to why the assessment should be characterized

as a tax.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[35] The Supreme Court of Canada in Massey-Ferguson dealt with

levies, under the Saskatchewan Agricultural Implement Act, 1968

(Sask.), c. 1, s. 6F, imposed on the sale of farm implements to

provide compensation to farmers for losses suffered.  Laskin

C.J.C., speaking for the court, described the compensation scheme

as follows (p. 430):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is the Board which assesses under s. 6F in
          order to create a fund which will satisfy
          existing and anticipated compensation awards
          and Board expenses for investigating and
          hearing claims.  The assessment upon the
          distributors is annual and is upon &quot;such
          percentage of their gross sales or other
          rates ...&quot; as the Board considers sufficient
          for the above-mentioned purposes.  Under s.
          6G, distributors may be classified and
          different rates may be assessed for any class
          or classes of them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In its factum (para. 3), the WCB described its compensation

scheme in these words:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Assessments are based directly on payroll.
          The WCB issued a Notice of Assessment based
          on the information supplied on that
          statement.   The WCB could increase an
          employer's assessment based on experience
          rating, payroll adjustments, industry
          classification changes and merit/demerit
          rating systems.  Any adjustments (surcharges
          or rebates) are also based on payroll
          information provided by the employer.  An
          employer's assessment could be adjusted on
          the basis of the employer's accident record.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
The similarities between workers' compensation assessments and

the Saskatchewan compensation scheme are substantial: the similar

policies of the Agricultural Implements Act and the WCB to relate

the assessments to compensation awards and to administrative

expenses; both schemes are designed to provide a limited form of

insurance; neither scheme involves the consolidated revenue fund;

and both schemes are intended to compensate a defined group.

While the five incentive programs established by the WCB in the

present case add an element to the scheme that is not present in

Massey-Ferguson, it does not change the fact that the two schemes

are essentially indistinguishable for the purpose of determining

the nature of the assessments.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[36] In Massey-Ferguson, Laskin C.J.C. concluded with respect to

the farm implements compensation fund as follows (at pp.432-33):</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I am not persuaded that the assessments
          to create and maintain a compensation fund
          should be characterized as taxes within
          s. 92(2) of the British North America Act.
          The levies, as monetary exactions, are
          liquidating premiums to satisfy farmers'
          claims under s. 6D and the policy of the Act
          is to relate the assessments to the
          compensation awards and to administrative
          expenses.  They are designed to support a
          limited form of insurance for the benefit of
          farmers who purchase agricultural implements,
          related to their use of such implements.
          There is here no collection of money to go
          into a consolidated revenue fund which is
          then chargeable with satisfying awards of
          compensation.  Although the scheme is a
          public one, created under a public statute,
          its beneficiaries and obligors are
          circumscribed by the particular activity or
          enterprise in which they are engaged.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          . . .</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Although the levy here is intended to meet
          administrative expenses of the Board, its
          chief purpose is, as I have already said, to
          create a limited insurance fund.  The
          distributors who are subject to the levy are
          under an additional cost of doing business in
          Saskatchewan, but this does not mean that
          they are being taxed in a constitutional
          sense.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[37] When this strong conclusion is compared to the less direct

pronouncements in the other two decisions there can be no doubt

that Massey-Ferguson, a more recent pronouncement of the Court,

is the most authoritative on the question whether an assessment

towards a compensation fund constitutes a tax.   Laskin C.J.C.'s

conclusion is direct and forceful compared to the less direct

assertions made in the other two cases.  Laskin C.J.C. referred

to both C.P.R. and Royal Bank and did not expressly overrule

them.  However, in light of the similarities between the two

schemes and the strong conclusion in Massey-Ferguson, I conclude

that Laskin C.J.C.'s conclusion is to be preferred.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[38] The WCB also relies on the decision of this court in Ontario

Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation v. Ottawa (City) (1998),

38 O.R. (3d) 224.  The charges in that case were not collected

for the purpose of maintaining a compensation fund to support a

form of insurance as in Massey-Ferguson and the present case.

It does not advance the WCB argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[39] While there may be difficulties in determining the meaning

of s. 17(2) of the Act and the intention of the legislature, it

is not necessary to address those issues in view of my conclusion

that the WCB assessments are not a tax.  Section 17(2) clearly

does not apply to this case.  In these circumstances it is not

necessary to consider whether or not a different standard of

review would apply to the decision of the Commissioner on this

issue.  The decision would survive even on a correctness review.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In conclusion, I would allow the appeal, set aside the

judgment of the Divisional Court and restore the order of the

Commissioner.  The cross-appeal is dismissed.   The Commissioner

has not asked for costs and I would make no order as to costs.
