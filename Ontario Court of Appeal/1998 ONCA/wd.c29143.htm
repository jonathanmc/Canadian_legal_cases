    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The policy considerations and legal principles which inform
the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Jobidon
(1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 454 and this court's decision in R. v.
Welch (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 216 have no application to the case
at hand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In Welch, Griffiths J.A. stated at p. 238 that, &quot;the message
delivered by the majority in Jobidon is that the victim cannot
consent to the infliction of bodily harm upon himself or herself,
as defined by s. 267(2) of the Code, unless the accused is acting
in the course of a generally approved social purpose when
inflicting the harm.&quot; Griffiths J.A. went on to observe at p. 239
that -- &quot;[A]lthough the law must recognize individual freedom and
autonomy, when the activity in question involves pursuing sexual
gratification by deliberately inflicting pain upon another that
gives rise to bodily harm, the personal interest of the
individuals involved must yield to the more compelling societal
interests which are challenged by such behaviour.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In Welch, the court was concerned with sado-masochistic
sexual activity involving the deliberate infliction of pain and
injury, conduct which the court described as being &quot;inherently
degrading and dehumanizing.&quot; The same cannot be said about the
sexual conduct engaged in by the appellant. There is no
suggestion in the evidence that the appellant deliberately
inflicted injury or pain to the complainant. Moreover, it cannot
be said that anal intercourse is inherently degrading and
dehumanizing or that it constitutes socially unacceptable
conduct, particularly in view of s. 159(2) of the Criminal Code
which excepts from criminal liability anal intercourse between
consenting adults in private.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  It follows, in our view, that the trial judge erred in
concluding that the resulting bodily harm to the complainant
rendered irrelevant the presence or absence of consent on her
part. Given the trial judge's finding that the Crown had failed
to prove lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt, in the
particular circumstances of this case, the conviction cannot
stand.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside and an acquittal is entered.</font></pre></td>
