    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">BY THE COURT:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  After a five-day trial before Crane J., E. W. was convicted
of four counts of sexual intercourse with a female person under
14, contrary to the former sections 138 and 146(1) of the
Criminal Code. E. W. committed the sexual offences between 1970
and 1974 when he was between 17 and 22 years old, on his two half-
sisters who were 7 to 11 and 9 to 13 years old at the time. On
April 25, 1997, the trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of
21 months. He imposed only the statutory conditions and one
additional condition that E. W. pay $1,000 to each of the
complainants for counselling. E. W. appeals his convictions and
the Crown appeals the sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  For the reasons that follow we dismiss the conviction
appeal, allow the Crown's sentence appeal and vary the sentence
to one of five years imprisonment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Conviction Appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant E. W. raises two main issues on his conviction
appeal. First, he submits that the trial judge erred in refusing
a stay or in failing to order a new trial because of the late
disclosure of two written statements made by CAS workers. Second,
he submits that the verdict was unreasonable or in the
alternative that the trial judge misapprehended material
evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On the first ground of appeal, we find no error in the trial
judge's ruling refusing a stay. Defence counsel at trial did not
renew his O'Connor application or ask to recall the complainant
for further cross-examination or even seek an adjournment of the
trial. The statements made by the CAS workers — disclosed during
the cross-examination of a police officer on the third day of the
trial — did not contain any statement by either of the two
complainants. Indeed, the CAS workers' statements were very
limited in scope. And no evidence was led about how the CAS kept
records in the 1970s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In these circumstances, the statements by themselves are of
little assistance on whether sexual abuse occurred. Moreover,
trial counsel could not suggest how he was prejudiced in his
cross-examination by not having the CAS workers' statements
before the trial. He cross-examined the complainant thoroughly
about her disclosure to the CAS worker. A stay for non-disclosure
is to be granted only in the &quot;clearest of cases.&quot; This non-
disclosure does not meet the clearest of cases standard. This
ground of appeal therefore fails.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On the second ground of appeal, in our view the convictions
are not unreasonable. The complainants' testimony amply supported
the verdicts. Moreover, we are not persuaded that the trial judge
materially misapprehended the evidence. He addressed the
credibility and reliability of the complainants' testimony and
accepted their evidence. He dealt, at least in a general way,
with the inconsistencies in their evidence, which were urged as a
basis for reversal. Although he did not advert expressly to E.
W.'s opportunity to commit the sexual assaults, there was
considerable evidence at trial to support a finding that he did
have the opportunity. This ground of appeal also fails and the
conviction appeal is therefore dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Sentence Appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We agree with the Crown that a conditional sentence was
manifestly unfit. These were horrible crimes in which E. W.
engaged in repeated acts of sexual intercourse with his two half-
sisters, while he was entrusted by his mother to baby-sit them.
These acts of intercourse took place over a four-year period when
the two complainants were young girls. The victim impact
statements eloquently attest to the enormous damage, both
physical and psychological, suffered by these two women because
of E. W.'s acts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In our view these offences called for a very substantial
penitentiary term. We accept the Crown's submission that a fit
sentence is five years. In imposing this sentence we have taken
into account the following mitigating considerations: E. W. spent
50 days in pre-trial custody, for which the trial judge gave him
three months credit; apart from these offences E. W. does not
have a criminal record; since these offences occurred he has made
efforts to rehabilitate himself; he has maintained steady
employment and generally has led a good life. But for these
mitigating considerations, an even longer penitentiary term would
have been warranted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  For clarity, the sentence of five years runs from April 25,
1997, the date of sentencing by the trial judge, and is imposed
on the understanding that E. W. will be given credit for the 19
months of the conditional sentence that he has already served.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Leave to appeal sentence is allowed and the sentence is
varied to one of five years imprisonment.
