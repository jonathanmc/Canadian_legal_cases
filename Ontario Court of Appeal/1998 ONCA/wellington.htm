    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>FINLAYSON J.A.:</b>
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Mildred Isabel Wallace and Laurence Cazaly appeal the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of Speyer J. of the Ontario Court (General Division)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wherein he issued a declaration that the Wellington Condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Corporation No. 70 (&quot;condominium corporation&quot;) has the legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">authority to designate three parking spaces on the west side of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the manor house in the Manor Park development as visitor parking,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to be used exclusively by visitors to the condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">development.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Manor Park is a luxury condominium development that includes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a large manor house surrounded by ten acres of land. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">developer converted the manor house into three condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apartments, units 13, 14 and 15. Unit 14 is owned by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants, who purchased it in October of 1994. Twelve other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">units consist of stand-alone housing units and surround the manor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">house. All units, including number 14, have two covered parking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">spaces. In addition, those occupying units 1 to 12 can park cars</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in their driveways. Units 13 to 15 do not have separate driveways</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but there is a drive that permits cars to pull up along the west</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">side of the manor house, and there is room for three cars to park</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there. The aforesaid drive, including the three parking spaces,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is part of the common elements available to all unit holders. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dispute in this case involves these three parking spaces.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellants state that when they purchased their unit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they were told by the agent of the developer that they could use</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two of the three parking spaces for their own use in addition to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the two spaces that came with unit 14. Their offer of purchase</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was amended to interleaf a note that they were not to be charged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for this privilege. It is important to note that the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have never asserted that they were promised the exclusive right</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to park in these two spaces, merely that they, in company with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all unit holders, could use the spaces from time to time if they</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were available.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Apparently, the appellants have used the two spaces for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overnight parking and, at one time at least, had four cars</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parked, two in their assigned parking area and two in the common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">element. This caused some tension with the other unit holders,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">who felt that the spaces were reserved for visitor parking and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should be available to their guests, delivery persons and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">maintenance workers.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There is some dispute between the parties as to when, if</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ever, these three parking spots were properly designated as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;visitor parking&quot;. In November of 1995 one sign was erected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">showing this designation and two further signs were posted in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">March of 1996.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Analysis



</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appellants have portrayed this dispute as being a matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between them and the rest of the unit holders. They claim that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equities favour their position over the unit holders situate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outside the manor house. They submit that those unit holders can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">park four vehicles by utilizing their driveways whereas the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants are restricted to their two covered parking spaces.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, the fact that units 1 to 12 have separate driveways and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those who purchased the units in the manor house do not, is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument for permitting the owners of units 13 to 15 to encroach</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the common elements for additional parking. As to the claim of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unequal treatment, it is important to remember that the applicant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in these proceedings and the respondent in this appeal is the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominium corporation, acting on the instruction of its Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Directors with respect to a problem relating to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">designation of part of the common area as visitor parking. It</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeks a declaration binding all unit holders, not just the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants. The application was intended to resolve a problem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that has been discussed and voted on in at least one general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">meeting of the unit owners.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The declaration of the condominium corporation defines</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">visitor parking as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Each space in the common elements</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          to be used as visitors' parking shall be used</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          only by visitors and guests of the unit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          owners for the purpose of parking thereon one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          vehicle and shall be individually so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          designated by means of clearly visible signs,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          and such spaces shall not be assigned, leased</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          or sold to any unit owner or otherwise.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The rules of the condominium corporation provide that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Residents shall not be permitted to park</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          their vehicles in visitor parking under any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          circumstances.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The appellants acknowledge that the declaration and rule had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been passed prior to their purchase of their condominium unit,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but rely upon the fact that &quot;clearly visible signs&quot; had not been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">erected designating the three parking spaces as visitor parking.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, the three parking spaces remained part of the common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elements and the appellants were entitled to use them in common</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with all unit holders for temporary parking. Despite the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggestion that they were in fact parking two cars outside the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">front door on a semi-permanent basis, their counsel stressed in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court that they wanted access to the common area for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">temporary parking as a matter of convenience only because their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unit's two covered parking spaces were not as accessible.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] However, whatever the motivation of the appellants, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">despite any assurances by the developer's agent as to the status</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this portion of the common area at the time of purchase, in my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion there is nothing to prevent the condominium corporation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from later designating the subject property as reserved for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">visitor parking at any time. If it has not been done now it can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be done with particularity in the future.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellants argue that, apart from their reliance upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the assurance of the developer's agent that they could park on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the common elements, they also rely on s. 29 of the Condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-26. They claim that the condominium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation cannot designate the parking spaces as visitor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parking without demonstrating that the designation is reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the meaning of that section. Section 29(1) provides that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Board of Directors may make rules respecting the use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common elements &quot;to promote the safety, security or welfare of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the owners and of the property or for the purpose of preventing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">common elements&quot;. Section 29(2) provides that the &quot;rules shall be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable and consistent with this Act, the declaration and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by-laws&quot;. I do not think there is anything unreasonable about the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">visitor parking rule, or in its application to the three spaces</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in question in this case. Indeed, I agree with Speyer J.'s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">finding that it would be unreasonable to allow the appellants to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupy two of three visitor parking spaces in a 15-unit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">development. In addition, it is clear that the visitor parking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rule complies with the Condominium Act, as well as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominium corporation's declaration and by-laws. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's suggestion that a rule such as this cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">implemented without demonstrating that the implementation is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable may have some legitimacy in theory, but it has no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application to the facts of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Finally, I reject the appellants' further argument that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condominium corporation is estopped from now designating the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">spaces in question as visitor parking because of the aforesaid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representations. I can find no case here for equitable estoppel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The representation that the common area in question had not been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">designated as visitor parking when the appellant bought the unit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was true. There was no undertaking that they would never be so</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">designated.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
