    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The bankrupt (Ronald Whaling) had two RRSP accounts at the
CIBC. The first was opened in April 1991 and the second in July
1991. The first RRSP was to mature in August 1993 and the second
in July 1993. The CIBC was the depository of those accounts for
the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th
Supp.).

               outstanding loans at maturity

               penalties relating to the

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In November 1992, the bankrupt made an assignment in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$14,000.00. In December 1992, the trustee wrote to the CIBC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">taking the position that the RRSPs vested in the trustee upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy. The trustee asked the bank to deregister the RRSPs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and remit the proceeds to the trustee for distribution to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditors. CIBC refused to turn the funds over to the trustee and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">took the position that the acknowledgement of May 1992 entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it to set off the amount in the RRSP accounts against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankrupt's indebtedness. The bank also filed a claim in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy alleging debts of about $235,241.00 and acknowledging</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security by way of a mortgage valued at about $100,000.00. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no reference to the RRSPs in the bank's claim.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trustee did not respond to the bank's position for some</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Deputy Registrar of bankruptcy granted the order stating:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my view, the Income Tax Act of Canada
          provides that an RRSP plan shall not contain
          a right of set-off and, accordingly, the
          monies can not be held as security for these
          loans.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The bank appealed the Deputy Registrar's order to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario Court (General Division). In December 1997, Crane J.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no intention to collapse the RRSP&quot; and further that they intended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to provide &quot;unlawful security&quot; for the loan. Crane J. relied on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the provisions of the Income Tax Act in coming to this second</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion. I will refer to those provisions below.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant parts of s. 146 of the Income Tax Act. Berman borrowed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$5,500.00 from Astra Trust to fund an RRSP. The RRSP was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered and contained a provision that it could not be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assigned. When Berman borrowed the money he executed an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledgement and direction in these terms:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the event of my default under the payment
          terms of the loan, my contribution to the
          Plan shall be redeemed and the proceeds
          applied firstly against my indebtedness to
          the Trust Company.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I hereby authorize and direct the Astra Trust
          Company to directly credit my account at the

          the proceeds of any redemption from the plan
          upon receipt of a signed request for
          redemption. I understand that any amount
          withdrawn under this arrangement will be
          included in my taxable income for the year
          and will create an income tax liability at my
          marginal rate of tax. [p. 80]

          the amount of the liability from or set it

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">somewhat different from the acknowledgement signed by this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankrupt. In Berman, the acknowledgement refers specifically to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">acknowledgement contains no direct reference to tax consequences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I do not, however, regard the failure to refer to tax</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and depository so as to create a charge in favour of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">depository on the funds in the RRSPs. The acknowledgement signed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the Whalings expressly recognizes the debtor/creditor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship between the bankrupt and the CIBC. Paragraph 3</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provides that if the loans are not repaid as promised, the bank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may require cancellation of the RRSPs and access those funds to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repay the loan. Paragraph 3 further provides that if the loan is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">outstanding upon maturity (July/August 1993), the bank is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled to use the funds in the RRSPs to pay down any</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in paragraph 5:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A plan is deregistered when it is so amended
          that it no longer satisfies the requirements
          of subsection 146(2) and (3) for
          registration.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The same bulletin explains the tax consequences after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deregistration. It does not suggest that the amendment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan has further consequences save in one situation which is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">irrelevant here (s. 146(13.1)).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The respondent relies on two cases which support its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contention that a transaction which changes a plan so that it no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">longer complies with s. 146(2) is invalid and cannot create a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charge over or security in the proceeds of the plan. In Bank of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nova Scotia v. Phenix (1989), 9 P.P.S.A.C. 95 (Sask. C.A.), the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank claimed that a general assignment of book debts executed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the debtor in its favour gave the bank a secured interest claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the funds in the RRSP in priority to any claim the trustee in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy had to the funds.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The court held on the facts that the bank had never intended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to take security in the RRSPs. Indeed, the bank had specifically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused to accept the RRSPs as security when Phenix had offered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them as security in the course of an attempted refinancing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Sherstobitoff J.A. went on, however, to consider the impact of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the provisions of the Income Tax Act referred to above. He said,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at p. 98:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The effect of these provisions is clear: The
          R.R.S.P. cannot be pledged as security for a
          loan, and if it is so pledged, the plan is
          deemed to be deregistered and the owner
          subject to payment of income tax on the
          proceeds thereof.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In light of the evidence that the bank
          refused to recognize the R.R.S.P. as suitable
          collateral for a loan, its communication of
          that information to Phenix, and its status as
          depositary for the plan, the parties cannot
          be said to have intended, when the assignment
          was executed, that it should cover the
          R.R.S.P. This conclusion is reinforced by the
          evidence that the bank not only did not
          deregister the plan after the execution of
          the assignment but continued to accept
          further deposits. Furthermore, the assignment
          executed was a printed form supplied by the
          bank. It should not be interpreted to intend
          an illegal result: a pledge of an R.R.S.P. as
          security for money owing when that is
          prohibited by s. 146. Otherwise, the bank
          must be taken to claim the right to act
          routinely in contravention of the section.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          If the parties did intend that the assignment
          cover the R.R.S.P., they acted in violation
          of s. 146. To that extent, the assignment
          would have been illegal and therefore
          unenforceable. [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] I agree with Justice Sherstobitoff's observation that once</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the RRSP was pledged as security, it ceased to be a registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retirement savings plan within the meaning of the Income Tax Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and certain tax consequences arose. I cannot, however, agree that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.146(2) &quot;prohibits&quot; the pledging of an RRSP as security. Nor do</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">I accept that a transaction which involves the pledging of an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RRSP as security is rendered &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;unenforceable&quot; by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 146.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Section 146 does not specify that changes to a registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retirement savings plan are per se unlawful. To the contrary, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepts that changes can be made in registered retirement savings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plans and attaches certain consequences to changes which take the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan outside of s. 146. I also find nothing in s. 146(2) which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specifies that changes that result in the deregistration of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered retirement savings plan must be made in a certain way</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or according to a particular procedure. Finally, s. 146 does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">place any obligation on the depository of a plan with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">changes made in the plan by the beneficiary. Section 146 refers</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only to the effect of certain changes on the status of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered retirement savings plan and the tax consequences to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the beneficiary of the deregistration of a registered retirement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">savings plan. In my opinion, nothing in s. 146 speaks to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enforceability of security acquired in a transaction which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">results in the automatic deregistration of a registered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retirement savings plan pursuant to s. 146(12) or s. 146(13).

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The second authority relied on by the respondent is Re</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Leavitt (1994), 32 C.B.R. (3d) 85 (B.C.S.C.), aff'd. (1997), 50</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.B.R. (3d) 97 (B.C.C.A.). The facts of Leavitt are very close to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the facts of this case. Scarth J. held, relying on Re Berman,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supra and McMahon v. Canada Permanent Trustco, supra, that but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for s. 146 of the Income Tax Act, the lender/depository (Canada</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Trust) had the right to set off the funds in the RRSP against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debts owed to it by the bankrupt (p. 94). This conclusion accords</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with my analysis of those same cases.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Scarth J. then went on to consider s. 146(2)(c.3) of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Income Tax Act. After referring to the Bank of Nova Scotia v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Phenix, supra, he observed, at p. 95:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... what the Income Tax Act forbids is any
          right of offset as regards the funds in the
          plan in connection with any debt owing to the
          trust company irrespective of whether the
          right is given by agreement or arises by
          operation of law.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] With respect, I do not think s. 146(2)(c.3) forbids the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">beneficiary from using his RRSP as security if he or she chooses</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to do so. Rather, it dictates that if the beneficiary chooses to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pledge the funds in the plan as security, the plan ceases to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">registered retirement savings plan.3

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Mr. Grace, for the CIBC, in his well-developed argument,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">urged the court to follow Re Caisse (1993), 25 C.B.R. (3d) 218</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(Que. S.C.). In Re Caisse, Mercure J. concluded that s. 146(2)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not absolutely prohibit the assignment of an RRSP as security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for a debt. Rather, it left the beneficiary free to assign the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plan but imposed consequences on that course of conduct. Mercure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. further held that the Act did not provide for any specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">statutory formalities which had to be followed to effect the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change in the plan or the deregistration of the plan following a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">change.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] As is no doubt evident from my earlier observations, I agree</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with Mercure J. Not only do I find nothing in the language of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">146 which would lead me to hold that any security agreement which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">causes the deregistration of a retirement savings plan is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;invalid&quot;, I see no policy reason for so holding. Mr. Whaling</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wanted to be able to borrow money from the bank. He was prepared</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to give the bank certain rights over his RRSPs in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establish and maintain his ability to borrow from the bank. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">chose to provide the security so he could borrow from the bank.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Presumably, the ability to borrow was more important to him at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that time than the tax benefits of an RRSP. While I can</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">understand why a beneficiary of an RRSP should lose the tax</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits if he chooses to use an RRSP as security, I cannot see</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">how the policies underlying RRSPs are furthered by declaring that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security invalid and effectively penalizing the lender.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an order declaring the CIBC right of set off in respect of the</font></pre>
