</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted by a jury of attempted murder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and sentenced to 9 years in the penitentiary. An alternate charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of aggravated assault was stayed. The appellant appeals</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conviction and sentence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The conviction appeal turns on the applicability of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">curative proviso as the Crown concedes that the trial judge made</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two errors in law in his instructions to the jury.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant is unrepresented. When the appeal was argued,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown acknowledged the errors in the charge. The court could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not determine whether the curative proviso should be applied</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">without a full transcript of the trial. The Crown obtained that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transcript and provided further written submissions. The court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was also assisted by extensive written submissions prepared on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">behalf of the appellant by the Correctional Law Project of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">faculty of law at Queen's University. Unfortunately, and through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no fault of any of the parties involved, obtaining the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transcripts and additional submissions delayed the determination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of this appeal by some 13 months.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The complainant and the appellant were both in their early</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">twenties. They had known each other for about six years. There</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was no evidence of any ongoing animosity between them. On the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">night of the stabbing, they happened to meet in a bar where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant worked. He was not working that night. When the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant saw the appellant speaking to his aunts, he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approached the appellant and told him not to &quot;hit on&quot; them as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they were married women. He also asked the appellant to pay him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for certain collect telephone calls which the appellant had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">charged to the complainant's number. The discussion became</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argumentative and, on one version of events, led to some pushing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and shoving. The complainant testified that he did not want to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fight in the bar because he was afraid that he would lose his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">job.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  According to the complainant, he returned to the dance floor</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a short time after he spoke to the appellant. He felt someone cut</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his neck from behind. He turned, saw the appellant, kicked out at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him and chased him across part of the dance floor and up a short</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flight of stairs to the elevated area of the bar. The complainant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">caught up to the appellant at the top of stairs. They struggled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as they moved along the elevated area toward another longer</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flight of stairs. Blows were exchanged. The complainant suddenly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">felt very weak and saw blood gushing from his neck. He eventually</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made his way up the second flight of stairs and to the manager's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">office where he collapsed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The complainant was rushed to the hospital and emergency</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">surgery was performed. He had a 10 cm long slash across his neck.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">His jugular vein had been severed. Obviously, his injury was very</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">serious.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  There were three issues raised at trial:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">‚    was it the appellant who stabbed the complainant?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">‚    did the appellant act in self-defence?
‚    did the appellant have the intent necessary to commit an
attempted murder?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The jury clearly decided the first issue against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant. There was ample evidence to support that conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and neither of the errors in the charge to the jury could have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affected that finding. I proceed on the basis that it was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant who slashed the complainant's throat.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The availability of self-defence depended in part on where</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stabbing occurred. If the complainant was stabbed from behind</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the appellant on the dance floor, then there was no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidentiary basis for self-defence. If, however, the jury was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">satisfied that the stabbing took place on the dance floor and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that it occurred, or could have occurred, when the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant and the appellant were struggling on the elevated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">area of the bar, then self-defence was a live issue.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The other witnesses who observed the altercation gave</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conflicting accounts of what happened. Support could be found in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different parts of their testimony for the contention that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stabbing occurred on the dance floor, or for the contention that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it occurred at the top of the stairs on the elevated part of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bar. Michael Ward, a friend of the complainant, testified that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">saw the appellant come up behind the complainant on the dance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floor and make a slashing motion across the complainant's neck.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">He then saw the appellant put a bloodied knife into his pocket</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">immediately before he was chased up the stairs by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Christos Bezas saw the altercation on the dance floor, but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not see the appellant make a slashing motion across the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant's neck. He saw the complainant chase the appellant up</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stairs to the elevated area, catch him and hit him 2 to 4</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">times. Mr. Bezas then saw the complainant grab his neck and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appear to be in shock.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Kenneth Busby also saw the altercation at the top of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stairs. He saw the complainant pushing the appellant backward</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the rail as they moved along the elevated area. Mr. Busby</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">testified that, as the appellant was being pushed at close</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quarters by the complainant, he struck the complainant with an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">awkward backhand blow in the area of the head. The appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeared to have something in his hand when he hit the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant. Mr. Busby indicated that the struggle continued and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moved along the elevated area towards the second longer flight of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stairs. The complainant then realized he was bleeding profusely.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The complainant's blood was found on the dance floor very</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">near the short flight of stairs leading to the elevated area, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the elevated area. Some of the bloodstains were in droplet</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form. There was evidence that patrons of the bar had moved from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the elevated area to the dance floor after the stabbing had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occurred. There was also medical evidence concerning the blood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flow which might be expected from an injury like that suffered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the complainant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] There was no expert evidence to assist the jury in deciding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what inferences, if any, could reasonably be drawn from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature and location of the bloodstains.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The appellant did not testify.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Charge to the Jury
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The trial judge told the jury that &quot;self-defence may be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raised in this case depending on how you view the facts.&quot; He went</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on to tell the jury that self-defence was only available if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury could &quot;find as a fact&quot; that the complainant was stabbed when</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he and the appellant were struggling on the elevated area of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bar after the complainant had chased the appellant from the dance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The Crown acknowledges that this instruction improperly put</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an onus on the appellant to convince the jury that the stabbing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had occurred on the elevated area of the bar. The jury should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been told that self-defence was a live issue unless the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown satisfied them that the appellant had stabbed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant on the dance floor before the complainant pursued the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant up the stairs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The second error committed by the trial judge occurred in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his instructions on the evidentiary value of the after-the-fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. There was evidence that the appellant fled the scene</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and evidence that he lied to two persons concerning the events of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that evening. The trial judge told the jury that evidence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">flight and evidence of false statements:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... may be considered and weighed by you in
          connection with all of the other evidence in
          this case in deciding the guilt or innocence
          of the accused.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The trial judge did not place any limitation on the use the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury could make of the after-the-fact conduct evidence. He should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have told the jury that the evidence was relevant to the question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of identity and to the issue of self-defence, but that it had no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevance to the other issues in the case. The jury should have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been told that if they were satisfied that the appellant was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">perpetrator of the assault and did not act in self-defence, his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after-the-fact conduct could not assist in determining whether he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was guilty of attempted murder as opposed to aggravated assault.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The trial judge should have told the jury that the after-the-fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct could not be considered in deciding whether the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intended to kill the complainant. The trial judge's failure to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">give these limiting instructions amounts to an error in law: R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Marinaro (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 74, per Dubin C.J.O. in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dissent at p. 82, rev'd (for reasons of Dubin C.J.O.), [1996] 1</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">S.C.R. 462.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Curative Proviso (s. 686(1)(b)(iii))
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Having found errors in law, the onus shifts to the Crown to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demonstrate that those errors caused no substantial wrong or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">miscarriage of justice. To meet that onus, the Crown must show</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been different had the error not been made: R. v. Bevan,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1993] 2 S.C.R. 599.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The Crown's no substantial wrong argument as it applies to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the self-defence misdirection requires a more detailed review of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the evidence, including the photographs and sketches tendered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown. A trail of the complainant's blood was found beginning</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the bottom of the stairs leading from the dance floor to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">elevated drinking area and ending up in the manager's office on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the next floor. The complainant's blood was found in six places</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the dance floor. All six were within about 7 inches of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stairs leading to the elevated area. Four of the six blood stains</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">were in droplet form. The other two stains appeared smeared. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant's blood was found in droplet form in three places on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the elevated area at or near the top of the stairs. The elevated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">area is about 2 feet above the dance floor and there are three</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">steps in the stairs leading from the dance floor to the elevated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">area. There was no direct evidence of the distances between any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the bloodstains. Based on the photographs, it would appear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that all nine bloodstains were within about five to eight feet of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">each other.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The Crown submits that the complainant's blood on the dance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floor, particularly the blood in droplet form, establishes that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was bleeding when he was chasing the appellant and before he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">caught him at the top of the stairs. This, says the Crown,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clearly establishes that the appellant stabbed the complainant on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dance floor The defence claims that the complainant's blood</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found on the dance floor could have been tracked there by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">patrons of the bar after the stabbing occurred. The defence also</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submits that the blood droplets found at the bottom of the stairs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are arguably only a few feet from where the appellant and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant struggled at the top of the stairs. The defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contends that the location of the those blood droplets is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">necessarily inconsistent with the complainant having been stabbed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the top of the short flight of stairs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The vascular surgeon who treated the complainant was asked</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">about the expected blood flow when a major vein is severed. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   If one considers arteries which are high-
          pressure blood vessels versus veins which are
          low-pressure blood vessels, it stands to
          reason that if you cut an artery and it
          remains open it can bleed much more profusely
          and much more impressively. A vein has a
          tendency to bleed and then collapse. If it's
          a major vein, like the jugular vein, it can
          continue to bleed. If you're dealing with an
          injury which has a lot of soft tissue
          overlying a vein, blood can accumulate within
          a pool underneath that soft tissue, and when
          it reaches a pressure sufficient to extrude
          the blood, the blood leaves the body. That's
          as best as I can describe it in terms of
          mechanism and amount of bleeding.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The doctor could not say whether the complainant bled immediately
upon being stabbed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In cross-examination, the doctor was asked about the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">difference between bleeding from an artery and bleeding from a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vein. He said that when an artery was cut the blood tended to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;spurt out&quot;, whereas when a vein was cut the blood tended to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;ooze out.&quot; He went on, however, to testify:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Mr. Fesiuk's injury was a laceration in
          the front of the jugular vein, and because it
          was not a huge hole, it was a smaller hole,
          it is not unlike putting your thumb on garden
          hose. If you make the hole smaller at the
          same pressure it will spurt more, so his vein
          was spurting actually at the time, even
          though it was a vein. [Emphasis added.]

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The doctor was not asked how far the blood might spurt and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he was not asked specifically about any of the bloodstains found</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on the dance floor or on the elevated area at the top of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stairs.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] My review of the evidence, including the photographs and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diagrams, suggests that the evidence is more consistent with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Crown's position than with the appellant's position. To the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">untrained eye, at least four of the bloodstains on the dance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floor appear to have been produced by blood dropping directly on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the floor as opposed to being tracked onto the floor by patrons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the bar. However, absent expert evidence explaining the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significance of the location and appearance of the bloodstains</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and, in light of the possibility that the complainant's blood may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have spurted some distance when he started to bleed, I cannot say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the physical evidence renders the appellant's position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">untenable.  I cannot say that any reasonable trier of fact would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have concluded that the complainant was stabbed on the dance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">floor. A reasonable jury, considering the physical evidence and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the conflicting testimony, could well be uncertain as to whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the stabbing occurred on the dance floor or on the elevated area</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">at the top of the stairs. If a jury was left with that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uncertainty, they had to consider self-defence. The trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instruction foreclosed that consideration. The curative proviso</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot be applied as the Crown has not convinced me that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result would necessarily have been the same had the jury not been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misdirected as to the availability of self-defence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] My conclusion that the misdirection as the availability of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">self-defence constitutes reversible error necessitates the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">quashing of the appellant's conviction. I will, however, address</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Crown's contention that the non-direction as to the limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidentiary value of the after-the-fact conduct was harmless</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">error.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] The Crown submits that the appellant's intention to kill was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;obvious given the nature of the wound and the total absence of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">any explanation.&quot; This submission assumes that the stabbing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occurred on the dance floor before the physical altercation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the complainant and the appellant on the elevated area of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the bar. If the stabbing occurred on the dance floor, the Crown's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument that the appellant must have intended to kill the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant is a compelling one, although I am not certain that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is the only reasonable inference available. A reasonable jury,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properly instructed, may have inferred some lesser intention,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such as an intention to cause serious bodily harm knowing death</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was likely to ensue. Proof of any intention short of an actual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intention to kill will not suffice to prove a charge of attempted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">murder: R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] In any event, for the reasons set out above, I do not think</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the application of the curative proviso can be approached on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the basis that the complainant must have been stabbed on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dance floor. Once it is acknowledged that a reasonable jury could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have been uncertain as to where the stabbing occurred, then the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature of the wound is that the appellant intended to kill the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant loses all force. If, for example, the jury could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclude the possibility that the wound was inflicted when the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant struck out awkwardly at the complainant as the two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grappled and the complainant pushed the appellant backwards</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against a wall, as described by Mr. Busby, then it would be open</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to infer some intent other than an intent to kill the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complainant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] On the evidence adduced in this case, the non-direction as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the limited use of evidence of after-the-fact conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constituted misdirection and reversible error.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] I would quash the conviction. I would also set aside the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditional stay on the charge of aggravated assault and order a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">new trial on both counts.
