    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  We are not persuaded that the trial judge made any palpable
or overriding error when he concluded that the motive for the
dismissal was to relieve the defendant of a potential obligation
to pay to the plaintiff a $250,000 commission. It is not
essential to the effect of this conclusion that the amount be
$250,000. It could be concluded on the evidence that there was a
potential that the plaintiff could have earned a substantial
commission with respect to the D.N.D. contract.

[2]  The judge's conclusion is, in part, supported by the
complete absence of any evidence on behalf of the defendant with
respect to the reason for the termination of the plaintiff's
employment. In the context of the fax message from Toronto the
same day as the dismissal reducing the amount of the tender and
the submission of the lower tender to D.N.D. the next day, it was
open to the trial judge to conclude that the potential commission
was a factor in the decision to dismiss. Accordingly, there was a
foundation for the award of punitive damages.

[3]  With respect to the cross-appeal, we are not persuaded that
the trial judge erred in his discretion with respect to the
amount of punitive damages.

[4]  While we are inclined to the view that the notice period
relating to the compensatory damages was high, it is not so high
as to justify our interference.

[5]  The majority of the court are of the view that the $3,500
paid to the plaintiff with respect to work done before her
termination is not deductible from the damages awarded. Morden
A.C.J.O. is of the view that it should be deducted by reason of
its duplication in the award of compensatory damages.</font></pre>
