    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>BY THE COURT:</b></font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Following his trial by judge and jury, the appellant was
convicted on one count of gross indecency and three counts of
obtaining, for consideration, the sexual services of a person
under the age of eighteen years. He was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment for six months concurrent on each count. He appeals
against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant raises three grounds In his appeal against
conviction. He argues that the trial judge erred in failing:
     1.   to declare a mistrial;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   to exclude the evidence of one of the complainants as
          secondary evidence obtained in breach of his Charter
          rights; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3.   to charge the jury on the relevance of consent to the
          charge of gross indecency.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.   Failure to declare a mistrial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing
to declare a mistrial when a prejudicial article was published in
the newspaper at the conclusion of the first day of trial.
Instead of declaring a mistrial, the trial judge admonished the
jury in no uncertain terms that the newspaper article contained
false information that had nothing to do with the case to be
tried and that they were to disregard it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In our view, it was within the trial judge’s discretion to
respond to the situation in the manner in which he did. An
appellate court ought not to interfere with this exercise of
discretion lightly. We have not been persuaded that the trial
judge’s admonition was insufficient to overcome the potential
prejudice to the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2.   Exclusion of testimony</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  We do not agree with the appellant’s contention that the
trial judge refused to embark on a full inquiry on this issue.
The transcript reveals that both Crown and defence counsel at
trial agreed to proceed on the assumption that the search was
illegal and then argue the admissibility of the secondary
evidence on that basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge, on the evidence
before him, to conclude that the strength of the relationship
between the Charter breach and the complainant’s testimony was
insufficient to trigger the application of s.24(2) of the
Charter. While it was conceded by the Crown that the witness
would not have been discovered without the illegal search at the
appellant’s residence and the seizure of the journal, that fact
alone is not sufficient to trigger s.24(2).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.   Charge on gross indecency</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  We are satisfied on reading the charge as a whole that the
trial judge adequately charged the jury as to the relevance of
consent as one relevant factor in the determination of whether
the alleged conduct constituted gross indecency. This was made
particularly clear in the trial judge’s review of the theory of
the defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">4.   Sentence appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  We are of the view that the trial judge erred in stating
that a conditional sentence could only be imposed for this type
of offence in “very exceptional” circumstances of “extreme age or
illness”. In our view, a conditional sentence was an appropriate
disposition in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
against sentence is allowed, the sentence is set aside and, in
its place, there is substituted a conditional sentence for the
balance of the original term on the statutory terms.
