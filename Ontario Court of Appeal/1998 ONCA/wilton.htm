</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The trial judge found that the defendant was negligent in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his diagnosis, treatment and care of Mr. Wilton. In particular,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he found that the defendant had failed to take the appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">patient history, that he had failed to do another ECG, that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">failed to give an appropriate diagnosis and that he failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">give appropriate discharge advice. The defendant has not appealed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these findings of negligence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge next addressed the issue of causation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Applying the principles in Lawson v. Laferriere (1991), 78 D.L.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(4th) 609 (S.C.C.) he concluded that it was not reasonable to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presume a causal link between the defendant’s negligence and Mr.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Wilton’s death because there was “a demonstration or indication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the contrary.”  He found that Mr. Wilton’s rare condition of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">90% stenosis in the left main artery with left ventricular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hypertrophy was of such a serious nature that his death was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inevitable. He found that there was nothing that the defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did or failed to do that was in any way the cause of Mr. Wilton’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">death.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In reaching these conclusions he made four critical findings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of fact. First, it was probable that further ECG’s and serial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">enzyme tests after admission to the hospital would not have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant in diagnosing unstable angina. Second, the only way</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of determining the existence of the 90% stenosis in the left main</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">artery which would have led to the essential by-pass surgery</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be by way of angiogram and this would not have occurred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">until after the fatal episode on October 12th.  Third, the most</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">probable scenario if Mr. Wilton had been admitted to the hospital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on October 10th would have been that the normal tests would not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have resulted in a diagnosis of unstable angina or any diagnosis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which would have resulted in Mr. Wilton remaining in hospital</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after October 11th or at the latest on the morning of October</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">12th. Finally, he accepted the evidence of Drs. Roth and James</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that in 1987 Mr. Wilton probably would not have been given</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">aspirin but even if he had it would not have been given in time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to make a difference. Mr. Wilton would have died in any event.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge carefully considered the conflicting expert</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence with respect to each of these matters. He was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significantly influenced by the critical nature of Mr. Wilton’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition and the fact that a 90% stenosis of the left main</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">artery meant that even a small thrombosis would be fatal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  This is an appeal that turns solely on the findings of fact</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made by the trial judge who had the advantage of hearing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">witnesses and weighing their evidence over the course of a six</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">day trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  While there was conflicting evidence on many of the matters</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on which the trial judge made the findings of fact, we are of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view that he had sufficient evidence upon which to do so. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effect of those findings when taken together is that even if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant had not been negligent and Mr. Wilton had been properly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diagnosed and treated, his condition was of such a serious nature</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that he would have died in any event.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The appeal is therefore dismissed. In the circumstances</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there will be no order as to costs. We do not have to deal with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the cross-appeal relating to the mortality issue. Counsel for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent advised that he was abandoning the cross-appeal with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to the cost order made below. We wish to thank both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">counsel for their very clear and able submissions.</font></pre></td>
