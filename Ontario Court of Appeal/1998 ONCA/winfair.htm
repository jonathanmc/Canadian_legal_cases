    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            agreement in September 1995?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">       (3)  If the Board did repudiate the agreement, was the</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1.     The Ratification Issue
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    In this court the appellant did not seriously contest the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion judge's finding that the Board had ratified the agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by its conduct. Section 39(2) of the Act does not prescribe any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">form of ratification. Although the Board did not ratify the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licence agreement by a formal resolution, we agree with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">motion judge that the Board did ratify the agreement by its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct, that is by paying the amount due under the agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">during the first 12 months of the agreement's existence. Indeed,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Board paid the amounts owing under the agreement until 1995</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">when it sought to renegotiate the payment terms. It is now too</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">late for Winfair to complain about the lack of formal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ratification.



2.     The Repudiation Issue



[3]    In September 1995, Simcoe's Board, both through its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor and through its property manager, sought to renegotiate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what it considered were now onerous terms of the licence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement. In correspondence, the Board indicated to Winfair that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it no longer considered itself bound by the original agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Winfair, in turn, accepted what it considered to be either the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board's repudiation of the licence agreement or the Board's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assertion that it would no longer be bound by the 1984 terms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Winfair submits that having taken this position, the Board and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore Simcoe itself, can no longer resile from it. Winfair</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">makes this submission although it did not change its own position</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">because of the Board's correspondence, and although it knew full</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">well that the Board's professed termination of the licence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement was strongly opposed by many unit owners.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The motion judge concluded that the Board's correspondence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not amount to a repudiation of the licence agreement. In her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">view, &quot;It is clear that Simcoe intended to maintain the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship. Simcoe simply sought to change the terms of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">licence agreement to reduce its outlay of expenses for the use of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Facility.&quot; The appellant has not persuaded us that the motion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge's conclusion was unreasonable. We think that her conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is supportable, not only because of the correspondence itself,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">but because of the surrounding circumstances, which included</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Winfair's knowledge and the absence of any prejudice suffered by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    However, even if the motion judge was wrong on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">repudiation issue, the appellant must still contend with s.38 of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Condominium Act, to which we now turn.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.     Section 38 of the Condominium Act

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    The motion judge did not deal with s.38. But we agree with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent that s.38 is fatal to Winfair's case, even if the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Simcoe Board intended to repudiate the licence agreement. Section</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">38(1) provides:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">            38.(1)        The corporation may by a
            vote of owners who own 80 per cent of
            the units make any substantial addition,
            alteration or improvement to or
            renovation of other common elements or
            may make any substantial change in the
            assets of the corporation, and the
            corporation may by a vote of the owners
            make any other addition, alteration or
            improvement to or renovation of the
            common elements or may make any other
            change in the assets of the corporation.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[7]    The appellant concedes that the licence agreement is an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">asset of Simcoe and that the termination of the agreement would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be a &quot;substantial change in the assets of the corporation&quot; under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s.38(1) of the Act. Thus, terminating the licence agreement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required an affirmative vote by owners owning 80% of the units.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Although a vote was apparently held, the 80% majority was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">achieved. Absent an 80% vote, any repudiation of the agreement by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Board was ineffective.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    Winfair cannot avoid the application of s.38 by invoking</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the &quot;indoor management rule&quot;, and by relying on the Board's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">apparent authority. As this court's judgment in Carleton</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Condominium Corporation No.279 v. Rochon (1987), 44 R.P.R. 228</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">demonstrates, the indoor management rule, applicable to ordinary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporations, has no application to a condominium corporation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Because the requirements of s.38 were not met, Winfair could not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succeed on its application.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
