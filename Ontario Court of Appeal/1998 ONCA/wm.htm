    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   These  two young offenders were convicted of  two  separate
robberies.  One  of the appellants, M.W., was also  convicted  of
being  in  possession of a handgun in connection with the  second
robbery.
[2]  The Crown fairly concedes that on the first robbery the
trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the victim, and that
on the second robbery he misapprehended the evidence of  Kwako J.
We are of the view that in both instances the trial judge’s
misapprehension of the evidence tainted the convictions.
[3]  In addition, however, on the first robbery we find no
credible evidence to support a conviction of M.W. for robbery. As
for K.I., the  Crown does not rely on Kwako J.’s previous
statement but submits that the conviction is supportable by
relying on Kwako J.’s trial testimony. In theory this submission
has some merit. In viewing Kwako J.’s evidence as a whole,
however, we are sufficiently concerned about its reliability that
we think a conviction resting on it would be unsafe.
[4]  On the second robbery, there is no evidence to support a
conviction against K.I.. Only the witness Small identified him
and Small did not witness the robbery. Mr. Shaw, the victim of
the second robbery, did pick out M.W. from a photo line-up, but
he also picked out one person who had no involvement and he
failed to pick out two persons who were involved. At trial, when
asked to identify M.W., he conceded that he was not sure. In
these circumstances, we are of the view that the victim Shaw’s
identification of M.W. was not sufficiently reliable to support
the convictions on counts three and four.
[5]  For these reasons we conclude that the convictions are
unreasonable and therefore cannot stand. Accordingly, the appeals
are allowed, the convictions on counts 1, 3 and 4 are set aside
and in their place acquittals are entered.</font></pre></td>
