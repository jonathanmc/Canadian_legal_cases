    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant Jones appeals from the decision of Borkovitch

J. dated May 8, 1996 dismissing Jones' third party negligence

claim against the third parties Olga Sigurdson and Alec Murray</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Real Estate Co. Ltd.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Jones signed an agreement to purchase a property for 1.2

million which was worth $675,000. Jones failed to close the

transaction and the vendor sued. Jones settled this action for

$100,000 plus release of the deposit. Jones then proceeded with a

third party action against his real estate agent and her

employer. Jones submitted that the agent negligently failed to

tell him that the property was not fairly worth the amount of 1.2

million.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge held: &quot;The defendant (Jones) failed to

establish that the third party real estate agent and her employer

were negligent and that their negligence caused his losses.&quot;

Jones submits that this finding related only to his failure to

close the transaction and was not a finding regarding any

reliance by Jones at the time he signed the agreement of purchase

and sale. Jones says the trial judge focussed on the motive for

Jones not closing the sale and failed to consider the allegations

of negligence at the time the agreement of purchase and sale was

signed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  At the outset of his judgment, the trial judge correctly

listed the legal issues in dispute. They were: a) whether the

agent was negligent in her advice concerning the market value of

the property before the agreement of purchase and sale was

signed; b) the subdivision potential of the property; c) the

waiver of the condition in the agreement relating to the sale of

the property. The trial judge then outlined the respective

positions of the parties. It was the position of Jones that it

was not necessary for the court to make findings of credibility

to determine the case because of admissions made by the third

party Sigurdson. It was the position of the third parties that

even if there was a finding of negligence on the part of the

third parties, such negligence played no part in the defendant's

decision to enter into the agreement or to waive the condition in

respect of the property. The third parties also took the position

that Jones was looking to them, &quot;for compensation toward his own

negligence or foolhardiness.&quot; The trial judge agreed with the

third parties that credibility was vital and noted that the onus

was on Jones to prove his case. He also agreed that Jones was

&quot;attempting to place blame on others for his own folly.&quot; This

comment clearly indicated that the trial judge had in mind the

entire transaction when he found that the third parties were not

negligent and that Jones did not rely on the third parties in

connection with the whole transaction. Indeed, it is immediately

after this, that the trial judge stated that the defendant had

failed to establish that the third parties were negligent and

that their negligence caused his losses. The trial judge did

consider the allegation of negligence at the time the agreement

of purchase and sale was signed and he rejected Jones' position.

It was open to the trial judge to come to the conclusion that he

did in relation to the issues including the issue of whether

Jones relied on Sigurdson's opinion as to the value of the

property. Jones was a sophisticated experienced businessman.</font></pre>
