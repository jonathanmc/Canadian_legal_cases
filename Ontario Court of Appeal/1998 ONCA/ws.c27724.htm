    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction by a court composed of
a judge and jury of three counts of indecent assault.  He also
appeals his sentence of nine months' imprisonment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The offences were alleged to have occurred approximately
between twenty and thirty years ago and to have been committed
against the appellant's two daughters.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The appellant pursued three grounds of appeal before this
court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his
charge to the jury on the issue of similar fact evidence.  The
position of the trial judge on this issue is not clear but in the
result, neither the Crown nor the defence obtained a favourable
instruction and no objection was raised by counsel.  As a result,
in our view, no prejudice resulted to the appellant and if there
was an error, it was to the appellant's benefit as the evidence
was clearly admissible as similar fact evidence and the Crown
would have been entitled to a much stronger instruction on the
inculpatory nature of the evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  A second ground of appeal is raised with respect to improper
comments by Crown counsel.  Crown counsel's remarks related to
the failure of the defence to ask certain questions, not calling
witnesses, and the Crown's own failure to call the appellant's
wife.  While some comments would have been better left unsaid, we
are of the view that in the context of this case, there was no
prejudice to the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The third ground of appeal is directed to the trial judge's
failure to adequately present the theory of the defence.  This
was, in effect, a one-day trial and testimony was heard from only
four witnesses, two of which were not cross-examined.  The theory
of the defence was an outright denial and the appellant did not
testify.  We see no merit in this ground of appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The appeal against conviction is dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The final issue is with respect to the imposition of a
conditional sentence.  We think that this is one of those rare
cases when a conditional sentence is the appropriate disposition
in a sexual assault case.  The appellant is sixty-eight years old
and has had serious medical problems.  His wife is seventy-five
years of age and greatly dependent upon him.  The appellant is
clearly not a danger to the community.  In the unique
circumstances of this case, leave to appeal is granted and the
sentence is varied to a conditional sentence on the statutory
terms together with these additional terms:

a)   The appellant is not to leave his primary residence except
     for the purpose of:
     1.   obtaining basic food, hygiene, and medical products;
     2.   transporting I.B.W. to religious services, to medical
          appointments, or to obtain basic food, hygiene, and
          medical products;
     3.   attending counselling as required by the conditional
          sentence supervisor;
     4.   obtaining medical treatment for himself.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">b)   The appellant is not to be in the company of anyone under
     the age of fourteen except in the company of an adult.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">c)   The appellant is to notify the conditional sentence
     supervisor of any change of address within twenty-four hours
     of such change.</font></pre></td>
