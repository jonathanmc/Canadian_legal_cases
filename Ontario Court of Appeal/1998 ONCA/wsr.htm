[1]  The appellant was convicted of one count of sexual touching
a young person,  J.R., who was in a relationship of dependency to
him and of a second count of touching for a sexual purpose with
another young person, P.C., to whom he was in a position of trust
and authority. Both convictions were for offences contrary to s.
153 of the Criminal Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We can find no error in law in the trial judge's reasons for
judgment with respect to the conviction for sexual touching of
the complainant J.R. Leave to appeal is accordingly refused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  However, with respect to the conviction for sexual touching
of P.C., there is no evidence from which the trial judge could
conclude that the appellant was in a position of trust or
authority towards P.C. This complainant arrived unannounced at
the appellant's home after being thrown out of his own by his
parent. He knew the appellant's sexual proclivities from the
complainant J.R. The trial judge appeared to think that the
complainant P.C. was embraced by the relationship between the
appellant and the complainant J.R. This was an error in law. The
burden was on the Crown to prove a separate and distinct
disentitling relationship between the appellant and P.C. before
it could rely upon the provisions of s. 153 of the Criminal Code.
The appeal respecting this count is allowed and the conviction is
quashed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  With respect to sentence, the appellant was sentenced to
four months imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently.
Having regard to the fact that one of the convictions has been
quashed and the fact that the appellant has served 24 days of his
sentence, it is our view that an appropriate sentence would be
that the appellant be sentenced to time served. There is no need
for a probationary order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
is allowed and the sentence is varied to time served and the
probation order is removed.</font></pre></td>
