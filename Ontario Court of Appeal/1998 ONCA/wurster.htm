    </center></div><pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant employer raised four issues on its appeal.

The first issue concerned the trial judge’s finding that the

respondent was fired on September 17, 1991.  The other three

issues concerned the quantum of the respondent’s

compensation under his contract of employment if he was

fired on September 17, 1991.  Thus, the respondent’s

entitlement to any damages and in the alternative the

quantum of his damage entitlement, are in issue.  The

controlling issue is whether the respondent was fired on

September 17th.  We will therefore consider it first.


    1.  Was the respondent fired on September 17, 1991?


[2]  There was conflicting evidence on this issue.  We

acknowledge that the trial judge did not refer to some of

the evidence material to the question whether the appellant

fired the respondent on September 17, 1991.  However, trial

judges do not have to refer to all of the evidence in

reasons for judgment. In the circumstances, we are not

persuaded that the trial judge clearly erred, or made some

palpable and overriding error, when he dealt with this

factual issue.  We would not give effect to this ground of

appeal.


    2.  The respondent’s entitlement to damages for mental distress.


[3]  The trial judge granted the respondent damages for mental

distress based upon the cumulative effect of the appellant’s

conduct in respect of the respondent on July 17, 1991 and

September 17, 1991.  He assessed damages for mental distress

at $15,000.  The appellant does not take issue with the

assessment, however, it does take issue with the

respondent’s entitlement to damages for mental distress.


[4]  It is now established that in a wrongful dismissal case, an

employee is not entitled to damages for mental distress

unless the employer has committed an independent actionable

wrong.  See Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of British

Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 and Wallace v. United Grain

Growers Limited, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701.


[5]  The trial judge, relying on cases decided before Vorvis and

Wallace, did not consider whether the appellant’s conduct in

its relevant dealings with the respondent constituted an

independent actionable wrong. Although counsel for the

appellant submitted to the trial judge that the respondent’s

entitlement to mental distress damages should be determined

in light of Vorvis, the trial judge did not refer to Vorvis

in his reasons, or refer to the appellant’s conduct in the

context of whether it did, or did not, constitute an

independent actionable wrong.  In our view, the evidence

does not support a conclusion that the appellant’s conduct

constituted an independent actionable wrong.  There is

therefore merit in this ground of appeal.


    3.  The quantification of the payment to which the respondent
        was entitled on termination.


[6]  The appellant raised this issue in the context of its

submission that since the one year (renewable) contract of

employment expired on June 30, 1992, the trial judge erred

in concluding that the respondent was entitled to be paid

six months’ “remuneration”, measured from March 9, 1992,

when the respondent was no longer on short term disability,

to September 9, 1992.  The appellant contends that the trial

judge erred in extending the six month compensation period

to September 9, 1992, since the employment contract, if not

renewed, ended on June 30, 1992.


[7]  Having accepted the trial judge’s finding that the

respondent was fired without cause on September 17, 1991,

the appellant’s obligations to the respondent are found in

the termination provisions of the written employment

contract.  Paragraph 3(1)(e) of the contract addresses

termination without cause.  It provides:

    3.   Termination. (1)  The employment of the Employee
    hereunder may be terminated in the following manner in the
    following circumstances:
    ...

    (e)  at any time by the Employer, upon giving the Employee
    payment equivalent to six months remuneration (including the
    benefits described in this Agreement.)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The respondent was fired without cause. Paragraph 3(1)(e) of

the contract provides that upon termination the respondent

was entitled to “payment equivalent to six months

remuneration.”  As we interpret paragraph 3(1)(e), the

respondent, having been fired on September 17, 1991, was

entitled to the equivalent of 6 months’ remuneration at that

time.  Because of the contractual language, it did not

matter whether the respondent obtained other employment, or

received short term disability payments in the six months

following September 17, 1991.  Our conclusion in this regard

is based upon the provisions of the contract of employment.

In result, we do not have to decide the issue whether

disability benefits paid to a terminated employee through a

short-term disability policy should be deducted from damages

for wrongful dismissal, where part of the short-term

disability policy premium has been paid by the employee.

See Sylvester v. British Columbia, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 315.

   4. Should overtime have been included in the calculation of
   the payment to which the respondent is entitled?

[9]  The appellant contends that there was no evidence that the

respondent would have worked overtime in the relevant six

month period and that the trial judge erred in including

overtime in the calculation of the compensation to which the

respondent was entitled when he was fired on September 17,

1991


[10]  Paragraph 3(1)(e) of the employment agreement entitles the

respondent to payment equivalent to six months’

remuneration. We think the trial judge was correct in

including overtime in his calculation of the respondent’s

remuneration.  He was also correct in looking to the

respondent’s overtime-related work history to quantify the

overtime component of the respondent’s remuneration.

Whether he would have worked overtime in the six months

following September 17, 1991 is of no particular consequence

having regard to the language of the employment contract.

We see no merit in this ground of appeal.


CONCLUSION

[11]  We see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s

calculations with respect to the respondent’s remuneration.

In the end, including overtime, the trial judge found that

the plaintiff’s weekly “remuneration” was $1,157.46.

Multiplying that figure by 26 to reflect six months’

remuneration yields $30,093.96.  In addition, the respondent

is entitled to credits for vacation pay and the insurance

part of the benefits package. Both items were addressed, but

not quantified by the trial judge.  Both are part of the

respondent’s remuneration.


[12]  On the trial judge’s approach the respondent was entitled to

$25,040.25, exclusive of pre-judgment interest.  That amount

included $15,000 for mental distress.  On our approach the

respondent is not entitled to damages for mental distress,

but is entitled to damages under the contract that are

higher than the trial judge’s assessment since, in our view,

the respondent’s entitlement to 6 months’ remuneration

should not be reduced in amounts earned by the respondent

after his termination. Because there was no cross-appeal,

and since the appeal is from the trial judgment, not the

trial judge’s reasons for judgment, we would limit the

respondent’s compensation to $25,040.25.  See Semelhago v.

Paramadevan, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 415.  The respondent is, of

course, entitled to pre-judgment interest.  We see no reason

to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion on that

issue.


[13] Although the appellant has been successful on the mental

distress issue, it has gained no ground, in that the overall

amount to which the respondent is entitled in accordance

with these reasons has not been reduced.  We would,

therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.  The judgment

should, however, be varied in accordance with this

endorsement.  Paragraph 1 of the judgment is therefore

changed to refer to the respondent’s gross entitlement of

$28,617.05, but not its constituent parts.

[14]  We see no reason to interfere with the costs order at trial

(party and party costs to April 30, 1996 and solicitor and

client costs thereafter), since the bottom line of the

plaintiff’s judgment has remained intact.</font></pre></td>
