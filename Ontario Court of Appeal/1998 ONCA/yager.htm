    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted of second degree murder. He
testified that he was not the killer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant led expert evidence suggesting that certain
blood stains found on the appellant were inconsistent with the
appellant having inflicted the fatal blows. The appellant also
relied on that expert evidence to support his position that had
he been the killer there would have been significantly more blood
on his clothing than in fact was found.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Crown had led &quot;blood splatter&quot; evidence as part of its
case. That evidence was arguably inconsistent with the evidence
of the defence expert.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The expert evidence was relevant to a crucial issue in the
case, the identity of the killer. The defence expert evidence was
potentially exculpatory and, apart from the appellant's own
evidence, was perhaps the most significant evidence in his
favour. The substance of that evidence was not such that its
significance on the issue of identity would have been obvious to
the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  There was no mention of expert evidence in the trial judge's
charge. The jury was not told how to assess expert evidence, the
relevance of the expert evidence to the issue of identity was not
explained, and the substance of the expert evidence was not
reviewed with the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The failure to provide any instruction to the jury in
respect of the expert evidence constituted reversible non-
direction. The appeal must be allowed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  This case was heard as a prisoner appeal at one of the
Kingston sittings of the court. The court was greatly assisted by
written submissions prepared on the appellant's behalf by
students from the Queen's Law School Correctional Law Program.
The appellant also had the assistance during argument of Mr.
Richard Litkowski. Mr. Litkowski and a number of other counsel
have volunteered their services at sittings of this court in
Kingston. They serve as duty counsel and provide whatever
assistance they can to the prisoners in the presentation of their
appeals. This program was recently established by the court under
the direction of Justice Rosenberg. Mr. Litkowski's submissions,
the written submissions provided by the Correctional Law Program
and the Crown's submissions enabled the court to address the
merits of this appeal on the limited record available to it. This
case clearly proves the value of both the Correctional Law
Program and the duty counsel system.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed and a new
trial ordered on the charge of second degree murder.</font></pre></td>
