    <pre>INTRODUCTION

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of Rivard  J.
dated  January 30, 1998 involve the interpretation of a  contract
in  the  context  of a purchase and sale of commercial  property.
The  principal  issue in the litigation is whether  the  specific
remedy  of  rescission, provided in the contract  for  breach  of
warranties,  is  the only remedy available to the  purchaser,  or
whether  this remedy can be supplemented by an additional  remedy
drawn   from   tort  law,  specifically  damages  for  fraudulent
misrepresentation.</pre>
    <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND

(1)  The Parties and the Agreement
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  respondent,  Fea Investments  Ltd.  (&#147;Fea&#148;),  owned  a
residential complex consisting of 83 rental units at  6210  Yonge
Street  from 1964 to 1993.  The principals of Fea were  Mrs.  Dru
Micucci  and her two sisters.  For most of the thirty years  Mrs.
Micucci  looked  after  the  management  of  the  complex.   Mrs.
Micucci&#146;s  son,  Randy,  assisted her  in  some  aspects  of  the
management  of  the  complex.  For reasons of  ill  health,  Mrs.
Micucci did not testify at the trial of the action; Randy was the
only witness for Fea.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]   In  1992  Fea decided to sell the property  at  6210  Yonge
Street.  It entered into negotiations with the appellant, 1018429
Ontario Inc. (&#147;101 Inc.&#148;).  The principal of this company was Mr.
Rizwan  Rana.  He was the only witness called by the  company  at
the trial.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The parties concluded an Agreement of Purchase and Sale  on
October 4, 1992.  The transaction closed on March 25, 1993.   The
purchase price was $2,620,000.  Fea made several warranties about
the state of the property it was selling to 101.  Two of them are
at the heart of this appeal:
</pre>
    <pre>                    8.   VENDOR&#146;S WARRANTIES</pre>
    <pre>               8.1       The Vendor warrants and represents and it is a
               condition of the Purchaser&#146;s obligations to complete the purchase
               of the subject property as follows:&#133;
               (h)  that there is no litigation pending
               or  threatened with respect to the  real
               property  or occupancy thereof   by  any
               tenant; &#133;
               (k)  that the list of tenancies attached
               hereto is a true and accurate list as at
               May 31, 1992; interest has been paid  to
               existing  tenants to December 31,  1991;
               interest on prepaid rents to the date of
               closing   will   be   allowed   to   the
               purchaser;  and that all rent  increases
               since  May  31, 1992 were in  accordance
               with the rent review legislation.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The  contract also contained a provision dealing  with  the
consequences of any breaches of these and the other warranties in
the contract:
          8.4  If any of the foregoing warranties is not true and correct
               at the time of the closing, and the Purchaser will not waive such
               warranty, the transaction shall be null and void and the deposit
               money returned to the Purchaser with accrued interest thereon.
               The Purchaser shall have no remedy with respect to any breach of
               any warranty or any misrepresentation other than rescission. All
               warranties and representations set out in paragraphs 8.1(h) and
               8.1(k) which shall survive closing for a period of one year; and
               the representation and warranty contained in paragraph 8.1(e)
               which shall survive closing indefinitely.1

</pre>
    <pre>(2)     The litigation
</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Shortly after the transaction closed on March 25, 1993, Mr.
Rana,  the principal of the new owner, became aware that many  of
the  tenants in the complex had concerns about the level of their
rents.   In  February 1992 the tenants, and Fea as landlord,  had
received  notices from the Ministry of Housing that  their  rents
might  be  too high.  By the spring of 1993, many of the  tenants
had begun to take steps to have their rents reviewed.  On January
14,  1994 the Rent Registrar, acting pursuant to the Rent Control
Act,  1992, S.O. 1992, c. 11, brought a claim with respect to  40
of  the  units in the complex.  On November 29, 1994 Rent Officer
Stanwick  made  an  order which rolled back the  rents  in  those
units.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]   As a result of Rent Officer Stanwick&#146;s decision and its own
dealings  with some other tenants, 101 Inc. was of the view  that
Fea  had  misled  it  about the state of the rent  roll  for  the
property  when the parties negotiated and concluded the agreement
of  purchase and sale.  In particular, 101 Inc. felt that Fea had
breached  the  warranties in paragraphs 8.1(h)  and  (k)  of  the
agreement respecting pending litigation and the accuracy  of  the
rent list.  101 Inc. was faced with the hurdle of the &#147;rescission
as  only  remedy&#148;  wording of paragraph  8.4  of  the  agreement.
However, its interpretation of this provision was that it did not
apply  beyond closing on March 25, 1993; moreover, 101 Inc.  took
the  position that the provision could not exclude a  tort  claim
grounded    in    fraudulent   misrepresentation   and    deceit.
Accordingly, 101 Inc. launched an action against Fea in which  it
sought damages, not rescission of the contract.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The action was heard before Rivard J. on January 26, 27 and
28,  1998.  During the trial the parties reached an agreement  on
the question of damages; they agreed that if 101 Inc.&#146;s claim was
successful Fea should pay 101 Inc. damages of $150,000.
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   On  January 30, 1998  Rivard J. delivered an oral decision.
He  found that Fea had breached the warranties in both paragraphs
8.1(h)  and  (k) of the agreement.  He then held  that  the  only
remedy available under the contract was rescission.  As expressed
in his reasons, at p. 14:
               In  my  view, section  8.4  of  the
               Agreement of  Purchase and Sale  is
               clear    and    unambiguous.     It
               specifically   states   that    the
               purchaser shall have no remedy with
               respect  to  any  breach   of   any
               warranty  or any misrepresentation,
               other than rescission.
               </pre>
    <pre>               I   therefore  conclude  that   the
               plaintiff   is  not   entitled   to
               recover damages as a result of  the
               warranty breaches I have discussed.

</pre>
    <pre>[10]  However,  Rivard  J.  went on to hold  that  Fea&#146;s  conduct
amounted  to  the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation  and  that
this  conduct was not covered by the remedy limiting language  in
paragraph 8.4.  He said, at pp. 15-16:
               </pre>
    <pre>           In  my view, the defendants were, in the
           very  least, reckless in the  statements
           made  to the plaintiff.  The defendant&#146;s
           conduct      constitutes      fraudulent
           misrepresentation and deceit.
           </pre>
    <pre>           Section   8.4   of  the   Agreement   of
           Purchase    and   Sale    affords    the
           defendants  a defence  with  respect  to
           the plaintiff&#146;s claim for damages as  it
           relates  to  the  breach of  warranties,
           however,   it  is  my  view   that   the
           plaintiff&#146;s  remedy is  not  limited  to
           rescission  in  the event of  fraudulent
           misrepresentation. Although Section  8.4
           speaks   of  any  misrepresentation,   I
           cannot  accept that a party would  agree
           to  limit  its  claim for  relief  where
           there        is       a       fraudulent
           misrepresentation.
           </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
           </pre>
    <pre>           I  therefore conclude that there will be
           judgment  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff
           against  the defendant for  the  sum  of
           $150,000.

</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The appellant, Fea, appeals from Rivard J.&#146;s findings  that
it  breached the warranties in paragraphs 8.1(h) and (k)  of  the
agreement and that it engaged in conduct amounting to the tort of
fraudulent misrepresentation.  Fea also appeals from Rivard  J.&#146;s
holding  that paragraph 8.4 of the agreement did not preclude  an
award of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation.

</pre>
    <pre>[12]  The respondent, 101 Inc., cross-appeals against Rivard J.&#146;s
decision  that  paragraph  8.4  of  the  agreement  covered   all
warranties,  not just those that related to pre-closing  matters.
The  effect  of  101 Inc.&#146;s interpretation of paragraph  8.4,  if
accepted,  would  be to provide a second legal basis  for  Rivard
J.&#146;s award of $150,000 in damages to 101 Inc.</pre>
    <pre>B.   LEGAL ISSUES
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The legal issues to be addressed on this appeal are:
     Appeal Issues</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Was  the trial judge correct in concluding that Fea breached
     the warranty in paragraph 8.1(h) of the Agreement of Purchase and
     Sale?
(2)  Was  the trial judge correct in concluding that Fea breached
     the warranty in paragraph 8.1(k) of the Agreement of Purchase and
     Sale?
(3)  Was   the  trial  judge  correct  in  concluding  that   Fea
     fraudulently misrepresented the rental income in the apartment
     complex?
(4)  Was the trial judge correct in concluding that rescission
     was not the only remedy available to 101 Inc. and in concluding
     that an award of damages was permissible?
     Cross-Appeal Issues
(5)  Was  the  trial judge correct in concluding that the  remedy
     limiting language of paragraph 8.4 of the Agreement of Purchase
     and Sale applied to breaches of the warranties in paragraphs
     8.1(h) and (k)?</pre>
    <pre>[14] I will address these issues in turn.

C.        ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     Appeal Issues</pre>
    <pre>(1)   The &#145;no litigation pending&#146; warranty &#150; paragraph 8.1(h)  of
the agreement

</pre>
    <pre>[15]  For ease of reference, I set out again paragraph 8.1(h)  of
the agreement of purchase and sale:
          8.1  The Vendor warrants and represents and it is a condition of
             the Purchaser&#146;s obligations to complete the purchase of the
             subject property as follows: &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (h)  that there is no litigation pending or threatened with
             respect to the real property or occupancy thereof by any tenant;
          </pre>
    <pre>By virtue of paragraph 8.4, this warranty survived closing for  a
period of one year.

</pre>
    <pre>[16] The trial judge&#146;s analysis and conclusion on this issue  are
found in his reasons, at p. 13:
          I am satisfied that under Section 8.1(h)
          there  was, in fact, litigation  pending
          or   threatened  with  respect  to   the
          property.    Tab  22  of  Exhibit   1(b)
          confirms   that  Catherine  Strathy,   a
          tenant  at apartment 607 in the  subject
          premises,  had,  by  March  9th,   1993,
          applied to the Ministry of Housing for a
          proper  determination of  the  rent  for
          that unit.  I do not accept that because
          her  claim was settled by the defendants
          subsequent to closing, it can not now be
          said  that  this does not  constitute  a
          pending or threatened litigation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I   add  that  three  additional  tenant
          complaints  were  made to  the  Ministry
          within one year of closing.  Pursuant to
          Section 8.4 of the Agreement of Purchase
          and   Sale,   Section  8.1(h)   survives
          closing for a period of one year.  As  a
          result, there was substantial litigation
          pending or threatened as contemplated by
          Section  8.1(h), resulting in breach  of
          that warranty.

</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Fea submits that the trial judge&#146;s reasoning and conclusion
cannot  be supported for two reasons &#150; first, the litigation  was
not  &#145;substantial&#146;; second, it did not arise within one  year  of
the closing of the transaction.

</pre>
    <pre>[18]  Fea is clearly wrong in both of these submissions.  Whether
there  was &#145;substantial&#146; litigation is irrelevant.  The  warranty
clause requires the vendor to warrant that there is no litigation
pending or threatened.  Moreover, the trial judge was correct  in
his use of the adjective &#145;substantial&#146; to describe the litigation
respecting  the complex.  In addition to the four claims  brought
by  individual  tenants,  by early 1994 the  Rent  Registrar  had
initiated a claim in relation to 40 units.  In a complex of  only
83  units, it is clear that a great deal of litigation had arisen
before the expiry of the warranty period.

</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Fea&#146;s submission that the litigation had not arisen  before
the  warranty period ended is, I confess, inexplicable.   In  its
factum Fea says this:
</pre>
    <pre>          17.  Specifically, with reference to the warranty in paragraph
             8.1(h) &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>           (a)  The Respondent acknowledged that the litigation of which he
               complained was the Application by the Registrar in January, 1994
               which resulted in the rental roll back.  This application was
               made more than one year following the closing of the transaction,
               and there is no dispute that the Appellant had no prior notice or
               indication that such proceeding would be instituted.

</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  factual  assertion  in the  second  sentence  of  this
paragraph is simply incorrect.  The transaction closed  on  March
25, 1993.  The Rent Registrar commenced litigation on January 10,
1994.   This  is,  obviously, a period of  less  than  one  year.
Hence,  Fea  breached the warranty within the period contemplated
by the agreement of purchase and sale.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The  &#145;true and accurate list&#146; of tenancies issue &#150; Paragraph
     8.1(k) of the Agreement
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  Paragraph  8.1(k) of the Agreement  of  Purchase  and  Sale
provides, in relevant parts:</pre>
    <pre>        8.1  The Vendor warrants and represents and it is a condition of
           the Purchaser&#146;s obligations to complete the purchase of the
           subject property as follows: &#133;
      </pre>
    <pre>        (k)  that the list of tenancies attached hereto is a true and
           accurate list as at May 31, 1992; &#133;  and that all rent increases
           since May 31, 1992 were in accordance with the rent review
           legislation.

</pre>
    <pre>[22] The trial judge&#146;s analysis and conclusion on this issue  are
found in his reasons, at pp. 13-14:
          Dealing  with  the warranty  in  Section
          8.1(k) of the agreement of purchase  and
          sale,   I  am  satisfied  the  list   of
          tenancies  was not true and accurate  as
          at  May  31,  1992.  True  and  accurate
          necessarily includes lawful.  The  rents
          listed  were not lawful, and,  as  such,
          the list of tenancies attached was not a
          true and accurate list.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I   am  also  satisfied  that  the  rent
          increases since May 21st, 1992 were  not
          in   accordance  with  the  rent  review
          legislation.   The rent increases  since
          May  21st,  1992 were based on  unlawful
          rents.   It  cannot  be  said  that  the
          increases  were in accordance  with  the
          rent   review   legislation   when   the
          increases were based on unlawful rents.

</pre>
    <pre>[23] Fea submits that the accuracy of rents should not be equated
with their legality.  Fea acknowledges that the list of tenancies
it  provided  to  101 Inc. included unlawful rents;  however,  it
asserts that this should not detract from the fact that its  list
was  a true and accurate account of the rents it was charging  to
its tenants.

</pre>
    <pre>[24]   This  submission  is  inconsistent  with  clear  authority
equating accuracy with legality of rents.  In 669283 Ontario Ltd.
v.  Reilly, [1996] O.J. 273 (Gen. Div.), at para. 130, Herold  J.
said:
</pre>
    <pre>          In  order  to give business efficacy  to
          the  contract,  it being  known  to  all
          concerned that the income stream was  of
          prime  concern to the purchasers, it  is
          necessary to imply and I do imply,  that
          the  vendors were representing that  the
          rents  as  disclosed were  legal  rents.
          This in fact was not so.</pre>
    <pre>This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in a short  per
curiam  endorsement: see 669283 Ontario Ltd.  v.  Reilly,  [1998]
O.J. 2780.

</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Similarly, in Congiusti  v. Guriel (1987),  43  R.P.R.  262
(Ont. Dist. Ct.), at 268, Gotlib D.C.J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Furthermore  an  express  representation
          made  by  a  vendor to a purchaser  that
          rents receivable amount to a certain sum
          includes an implied representation  that
          the  said rents are properly charged  in
          accordance  with governing  legislation.
          In   fact  the  rents  stated  were  not
          charged in accordance with the governing
          legislation.

</pre>
    <pre>[26]  Gotlib  D.C.J.&#146;s decision was appealed to this  court:  see
Congiusti v. Guriel (1989) 4 R.P.R. (2d) 161 (Ont. C.A.). at 162,
where Zuber J.A. stated:
</pre>
    <pre>          The  learned trial judge held  that  the
          statements respecting the rents  charged
          on  each  apartment contained the  plain
          implication that the rents were lawfully
          charged.  I agree with this conclusion.
          </pre>
    <pre>See also: Hasham v. Kingston (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 514 (Div. Ct.).


</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Fea  invites  the  court  to  distinguish  these  cases  by
narrowing their application.  It expresses its argument in  these
terms in its factum:</pre>
    <pre>          38.  It is respectfully submitted that the authorities which
              suggest an implied warranty as to the legality of rents are based
              upon factual situations where either the purchaser was
              unsophisticated or the access to available information to confirm
              the legality of the rental schedule was not readily available.
              Neither of these circumstances exist herein.

</pre>
    <pre>[28] I do not agree with this submission.  In my view, it amounts
to  an assertion that a vendor cannot lie about unlawful rents to
an  unsophisticated purchaser, but can do so to a  purchaser  who
might  have  the opportunity to uncover the lie.  The law  should
not  permit such a line to be drawn.  It is the vendor who agrees
to  certain warranties with respect to the property it desires to
sell.   In a commercial property context, the income stream  from
rental units is crucial to the financial calculations and offer a
purchaser makes.  It does not set too high a standard to say that
in  this  context  a representation that rents disclosed  to  the
purchaser are &#145;true and accurate&#146; means that they are the  actual
rents  at the time and that they are also legal rents.  In short,
an owner/landlord should not be able to hide from a purchaser the
fact  that  it  is  charging and receiving unlawful  rents.   The
purchaser is entitled to know this crucial fact.  Accordingly,  I
agree  with the trial judge&#146;s assertion that &#147;[t]rue and accurate
necessarily includes lawful.&#148;

</pre>
    <pre>[29]  I  also  agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion  that  Fea
breached  the  component  of  the warranty  in  paragraph  8.1(k)
providing  &#147;that all rent increases since May 31,  1992  were  in
accordance  with  the  rent  review  legislation&#148;.   Fee  asserts
otherwise;  it  says  that all of its rent increases  after  1986
complied with the statutory guidelines.  This submission  ignores
the  fact  that in 1978 Fea&#146;s rents were unlawful.   Accordingly,
annual rent increases in accordance with the statutory guidelines
after  1986  served only to compound the illegality  because  the
increases built on a foundation of unlawful rents.  In short,  by
1992  and  1993 the rents charged by Fea on many of its units  at
the complex were more unlawful than they were in 1978.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  The Tort of Fraudulent Misrepresentation

</pre>
    <pre>[30]  The  trial judge held that the information Fea provided  to
101 Inc. after the rents increased in the 83 units at the complex
constituted fraudulent misrepresentation.  Professor  Waddams  in
The Law of Contract, 4th ed. (1999), at p. 299, states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          A   fraudulent  misrepresentation  is  a
          statement known to be false or made  not
          caring  whether it is true or false.   A
          person  induced to enter into a contract
          by  such a statement is entitled,  prima
          facie,  to  damages for  fraud&#133;  and  to
          rescission.
</pre>
    <pre>In  this passage Professor Waddams sets out the two components of
fraudulent  misrepresentation -  a false statement, whether  made
knowingly  or  recklessly,  and reliance  on  the  truth  of  the
statement by the person to whom it is made.

</pre>
    <pre>[31]  The  trial  judge  made  clear  factual  findings  on  both
components  of  the tort.  He found that Fea  was  &#147;in  the  very
least,   reckless  in  the  statements  made  to  the  plaintiff&#148;
(Reasons, at p. 15).  He also found that 101 Inc. relied on Fea&#146;s
statements about the rents.  He said, at p. 16:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am satisfied that Mr. Rana, on behalf
          of  the  plaintiff, was a  well-educated
          man,   well   versed  in  rent   control
          legislation.  In spite of this, I accept
          that he relied on the representations of
          the  defendant.   He did  make  his  own
          inquiries and calculations with  respect
          to  the  lawfulness of the rent, but  he
          was  unaware at the time he  signed  the
          agreement  of purchase and sale  and  at
          the  time of closing that the rents were
          illegal.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  do  not accept that he knew the rents
          were   unlawful   and   permitted    the
          transaction to close on that basis.

</pre>
    <pre>[32]  In my view, there is no doubt that Fea knew or was reckless
about  the  fact  that  the  rents it charged  its  tenants  were
unlawful,  and knew that it was not disclosing this fact  to  101
Inc.   Fea  did not provide 101 Inc. with either the 1978  orders
concerning  its  rents or, importantly, with  the  February  1992
notices  it,  along with all its tenants, received which  clearly
indicated that many of the rents it charged its tenants  appeared
to be unlawful.

</pre>
    <pre>[33]  Fea&#146;s more serious challenge to the trial judge&#146;s  decision
on   the  issue  of  fraudulent  misrepresentation  concerns  his
conclusion that 101 Inc. relied on Fea&#146;s misrepresentation.   Fea
asserts that there was strong evidence at the trial that 101 Inc.
knew before the transaction closed on March 25, 1993 that some of
the  tenants were paying unlawful rents, and that 101 Inc.  chose
to  close  anyway because it thought that either it was  unlikely
the tenants would challenge their rents or it was a good deal for
101 Inc. in spite of some uncertainty about the rent rolls.

</pre>
    <pre>[34]  The trial judge&#146;s conclusion that 101 Inc. relied on  Fea&#146;s
statements  is a finding of fact.  Fea acknowledges  that  it  is
very  difficult to challenge a factual finding of a trial  judge.
The  acknowledgement is a proper one; the jurisprudence  in  this
domain  enunciates a clear rule of deference by appellate  courts
to the findings of fact of trial judges.

</pre>
    <pre>[35]  In  Stein  v. Kathy K (The), [1976] 2 S.C.R.  802  at  808,
Ritchie J. reviewed a number of authorities and stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          These authorities are not to be taken as
          meaning  that the findings of fact  made
          at  trial are immutable, but rather that
          they  are  not to be reversed unless  it
          can  be  established  that  the  learned
          trial  judge  made  some  palpable   and
          overriding  error  which  affected   his
          assessment of the facts.

</pre>
    <pre>[36]  More recently, this court had an opportunity to review  the
case  law  since the decision in Stein v. Kathy K (The).   In  Re
Equity  Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) (1997),
35  O.R.  (3d)  321  (C.A.), at 333, Laskin J.A.  summarized  the
standard of appellate review in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Deference to a trial judge&#146;s findings of
          fact is a well-established principle  of
          appellate  review.  An  appellate  court
          should  not  interfere  with  the  trial
          judge&#146;s  findings  of fact,  unless  the
          trial  judge  has made a  &#147;palpable  and
          overriding error&#148; or a &#147;manifest  error&#148;
          or  a  &#147;clear  error&#148;. As  Iacobucci  J.
          observed   in   Canada   (Director    of
          Investigation and Research)  v.  Southam
          Inc.,  [1997]  1  S.C.R.  748,  &#133;  these
          phrases  amount to review on a  standard
          of unreasonableness.

</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Laskin  J.A. then went on to consider what kinds  of  error
justify intervention by an</pre>
    <pre>appellate court.  He reasoned, at p. 336:
          </pre>
    <pre>          An appellate court may interfere with  a
          finding  of fact if the trial  judge  or
          motion         judge        disregarded,
          misapprehended, or failed to  appreciate
          relevant  evidence, made a  finding  not
          reasonably supported by the evidence, or
          drew an unreasonable inference from  the
          evidence.

</pre>
    <pre>[38]  Fea  asserts  that the trial judge did  disregard  relevant
evidence  that established that 101 Inc. knew about,  or  in  law
should  be  deemed  to have known about, the unlawful  rents  and
chose to close the transaction in any event. Fea&#146;s assertion  has
two  branches &#150; first, that 101 Inc.,  through Mr. Rana, actually
knew  about the unlawful rents; second, that 101 Inc.&#146;s solicitor
knew about the rents and this knowledge should be imputed to  101
Inc.

</pre>
    <pre>[39]  Dealing  with the first branch of Fea&#146;s  argument  on  this
point,  Fea  contends  that Mr. Rana acknowledged  receiving  the
February  1992 notices that the Ministry of Housing sent  to  Fea
and  its tenants.  He even admitted in his testimony that he  had
looked  at the first two notices, relating to units 101  and  102
and that it was a &#147;mistake&#148; not to review the other notices prior
to  the closing date.  It is true that these two notices provided
the  reader  with sufficient information to raise the possibility
that  the  rents  for  the  two units were  (slightly)  unlawful.
However, the notice also contained this message:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  tenant and the landlord have ninety
          days  to  apply to change the registered
          rent  or  any  of the other  information
          registered  by  the  landlord  for   the
          unit.   If  an application is  made,  it
          must  be  made before the deadline  date
          of May 14, 1992.
</pre>
    <pre>Accordingly, in March 1993 when the transaction was closing,  Mr.
Rana  would have no concerns about any future challenges  to  the
rents in units 101 and 102.</pre>
    <pre>[40] Fea also relies on a handwritten notation on the notice  for
unit 607:
          -    Legal Rent till the end of August/1993 is $400.48
          -    From September 1/93, the legal rent is $420.10
                  R.R.
                  March 20, 1993

</pre>
    <pre>Mr.  Rana acknowledged that he wrote this notation on the notice.
However,  he  testified that the date is wrong  &#150;  he  must  have
written the notation on May 20.

</pre>
    <pre>[41] The difference in date is important.  The transaction closed
on March 23.  If Mr. Rana wrote the above notation on March 20 it
would  undercut his testimony that he did not look at any notices
other  than those for units 101 and 102.  Moreover, the  contents
of his notation would seem to indicate that he was quite alive to
the issue of legal rents before the transaction closed.

</pre>
    <pre>[42]  The  trial judge did not deal with this evidentiary  point.
In my view, on the record before him, its resolution would not be
easy.

</pre>
    <pre>[43]  In support of Fea&#146;s position is the fact that Randy Micucci
testified  that  he  sent  material  he  was  storing,  including
material  relating to unit 607, to Mr. Rana on  April  26,  1993.
One  of the documents he forwarded was the notice with Mr. Rana&#146;s
handwritten  notation.  This would render impossible  Mr.  Rana&#146;s
explanation that &#147;March 20/1993&#148; was a slip; he actually made the
notation  on May 20.  Mr. Micucci&#146;s testimony is supported  by  a
fax cover sheet dated April 26.

</pre>
    <pre>[44]  In  support of 101 Inc.&#146;s position, there is nothing  other
than  Mr. Micucci&#146;s testimony to conclusively link the fax  cover
sheet dated April 26 to the notice with respect to unit 607.  Mr.
Micucci  simply showed up on the last day of the trial  with  the
fax  cover  sheet, but without the material forwarded  under  the
sheet.  Moreover, there are similar handwritten notations on  the
notices  for six other units.  Five of those notices  are  dated;
the dates are: unit 201 &#150; May 15, unit 302-May 15, unit 412 &#150; May
4,  unit  601 &#150; May 15, and unit 707 &#150; May 3.  The dates  support
Mr.  Rana&#146;s  testimony that he became aware of tenant  complaints
about their rents only after the transaction had closed.

</pre>
    <pre>[45]  Because the evidence about the notation on a single  notice
(in  an  83 unit complex) is equivocal, I am not prepared to  say
that the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that 101 Inc. relied in fact on
Fea&#146;s   statements  about  rents  constituted  a  &#145;palpable   and
overriding  error&#146;  (Stein v. Kathy K  )  or  was  &#145;unreasonable&#146;
(Equity Waste Management ).
</pre>
    <pre>[46]  Turning  to  the second branch of Fea&#146;s  argument  on  this
point, Fea asserts that by February 1992 101 Inc.&#146;s solicitor had
received  all  of the notices from the Ministry.  Fea&#146;s  argument
flowing  from  this  receipt is set out in its  factum  in  these
terms:</pre>
    <pre>          42.  Furthermore, apart from the question of the actual knowledge
             of the Respondent through Mr. Rana regarding the excess or
             unlawful rents as set forth in the February 1992 Notices, such
             notices were in the possession of the Respondent&#146;s solicitor,
             approximately two months prior to the closing date.  It is
             submitted that in these circumstances the law is clear that the
             knowledge of the solicitor is properly imputed to his client, the
             Respondent herein.
        


</pre>
    <pre>[47]   In  my  view,  there  is  a  crucial  omission  from  this
submission.   Fea  does  not,  and could  not,  assert  that  the
Ministry notices provided 101 Inc.&#146;s solicitor with actual notice
of   unlawful  rents.   In  fact,  the  notices  give  only  base
information  from  which the reader could calculate  whether  the
rents  were lawful.  Fea&#146;s argument amounts to an assertion  that
knowledge  should  first be imputed to 101 Inc.&#146;s  solicitor  and
then imputed a second time to the client, 101 Inc.

</pre>
    <pre>[48] For these reasons, my conclusion is that the trial judge was
correct  to  hold  that  Fea committed  the  tort  of  fraudulent
misrepresentation.

</pre>
    <pre>(4)  Remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation</pre>
    <pre>[49]  Fea  contends  that the trial judge was wrong  in  awarding
damages  for  Fea&#146;s fraudulent misrepresentation.  It  relies  on
what  it  submits  are the clear words of paragraph  8.4  of  the
agreement:
          8.4 &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  purchaser shall have no remedy with
          respect to any breach of warranty or any
          misrepresentation other than rescission.</pre>
    <pre>Fea  contends that &#145;any misrepresentation&#146; includes a  fraudulent
misrepresentation.

</pre>
    <pre>[50]  The leading contracts scholars and case authorities do  not
support  this  proposition.  Professor Waddams,  in  The  Law  of
Contracts, supra, at p. 307, states:</pre>
    <pre>          A  fraudulent misrepresentation  permits
          the party deceived to avoid the contract
          and to sue in tort for damages based  on
          the   plaintiff&#146;s   out-of-pocket   loss
          including consequential damages but  not
          expectation or loss of bargain damages.

</pre>
    <pre>[51]  Professor Fridman, in The Law of Contract, 3rd ed.  (1994),
at p. 294, states:
</pre>
    <pre>          A  fraudulent misrepresentation  is  one
          which is made with knowledge that it  is
          untrue  and with the intent to  deceive.
          It  may  even constitute a term  of  the
          contract.   Whether it does  or  not  is
          immaterial,  since fraud gives  rise  to
          effects  in the law of contract and  the
          law  of tort.  A contract resulting from
          a  fraudulent misrepresentation  may  be
          avoided by the victim of the fraud.   In
          such  instances the apparent consent  by
          the  innocent party to the contract  and
          its   terms,  is  not  a  real  consent.
          Whether or not the effect of such  fraud
          is  to  induce  a mistake  (which  might
          render  the contract void), the  consent
          of  the innocent party may be revoked at
          his option.

</pre>
    <pre>[52]  The  case  law  in  Ontario echoes Professors  Waddams  and
Fridman.   A  case  quite similar to this  appeal  is  Hasham  v.
Kingston,  supra.  In Hasham, the plaintiff relied on a statement
of rental income in deciding to purchase property.   There was  a
disclaimer clause in the agreement of purchase and sale excluding
liability  for  all  representations outside  the  terms  of  the
contract.  The trial judge held that the disclaimer clause  could
not   apply   because  the  misrepresentation  about  rents   was
fraudulent.  The Divisional Court affirmed his decision.   Weiler
J. stated, at p. 524:</pre>
    <pre>          The  appellant, relying  on  Hayward  v.
          Mellick,   supra,   submits   that   any
          liability   for   misrepresentation   is
          precluded  by the disclaimer  clause  in
          the   agreement  of  purchase  and  sale
          excluding     liability     for      all
          representations outside the terms of the
          contract.   This  was a case  where  the
          vendor of a farm, honestly believing  it
          to  be true, informed the purchaser that
          the  farm had 65 workable acres when  in
          fact   the   farm  included  only   51.7
          workable  acres.   Faced  with  such   a
          clause  and in the absence of fraudulent
          misrepresentation,  the  purchaser   may
          have  no  rights: Richview  Construction
          Co.  v. Raspa (1975), 11 O.R. (2d)  377,
          66  D.L.R.  (3d) 193 (C.A.), at  p.  387
          O.R.  p.  203  D.L.R.   The trial  judge
          found  that  this  case,  like  Poirier,
          supra,    was    one    of    fraudulent
          misrepresentation and it was proper  for
          him  to  distinguish  Hayward v. Mellick
          on  this basis.  The appellant cited  no
          authority  for his proposition  that  if
          the  negligent misrepresentation amounts
          to  a  fraudulent misrepresentation  but
          fraud  is not specifically pleaded,  the
          defendant should be entitled to  succeed
          in escaping liability and I am not aware
          of  any  such  authority.  [Emphasis  in
          original]

</pre>
    <pre>[53]  In  a separate concurring judgment, Steele J. said,  at  p.
525:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  damages were claimed as the  result
          of an illegal act, as well as negligence
          on the part of the plaintiffs.  Once the
          trial     judge    found    that     the
          representation  about  the   rents   was
          fraudulent, the disclaimer clause  could
          not apply.</pre>
    <pre>See also: 669283 Ontario Ltd. v. Reilly, supra.

</pre>
    <pre>[54]  Based  on  these  authorities, my conclusion  is  that  the
disclaimer  wording  in paragraph 8.4 of the agreement  does  not
immunize Fea from an award of damages for committing the tort  of
fraudulent misrepresentation.</pre>
    <pre>Cross-Appeal Issue</pre>
    <pre>(5)  The interpretation of Paragraph 8.4 of the Agreement</pre>
    <pre>[55]  Strictly speaking, in light of the result that  flows  from
the  resolution of the appeal issues, it is not necessary to deal
with  the  single  issue raised by 101 Inc. in its  cross-appeal.
However, for the sake of completeness I will address it.

</pre>
    <pre>[56]  101  Inc.  contends  that the trial  judge  erred  when  he
concluded  that,  notwithstanding a breach of the  warranties  in
paragraphs 8.1(h) and (k) of the agreement, the purchaser had  no
remedy in contract law other than rescission.  In support of this
position,  101 Inc. makes two arguments &#150; first, the  wording  of
paragraph 8.4 does not limit 101 Inc. after closing to rescission
for  breach  of  any warranties; second, limiting the  remedy  to
rescission after closing is an &#147;inefficacious commercial  result&#148;
because  &#147;to unwind the entire contract&#148; would be difficult  once
101  Inc. had taken steps to repair and manage the complex for  a
period of time.  In my view, both arguments fail.

</pre>
    <pre>[57] With respect to the first argument, although it is true that
paragraph 8.4 commences with the wording &#147;if any of the foregoing
warranties  is not true and correct at the time of closing&#148;,  the
paragraph  concludes  by extending the warranties  in  paragraphs
8.1(h)  and (k) for a period of one year.  In other words,  there
is   explicit  language  in  the  agreement  extending  the  very
warranties in issue in this litigation beyond the closing date.

</pre>
    <pre>[58]  With  respect  to  the  second  argument,  the  essence  of
rescission is to &#147;unwind the contract&#148;.  If 101 Inc. was  worried
that rescission would be an &#147;inefficacious commercial result&#148;  it
could have bargained about it before signing the contract.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[59] The appeal is dismissed.  The cross-appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[60]  Success is not really divided.  The dismissal of the cross-
appeal is irrelevant to the practical result which flows from the
resolution  of  the  appeal.   Accordingly,  the  respondent   is
entitled to its costs of the appeal.

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1 In the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, the section numbers in
the final sentence of the provision are actually 9.1(h), 9.1(k)
and 9.1(e).  The parties agree that this was a mistake.
Accordingly, I have used the correct numbering, namely 8.1(h),
8.1(k) and 8.1(e).  Incidentally, the warranty in paragraph
8.1(e) relates to urea formaldehyde foam insulation; it is not
relevant to the appeal.</pre></td>
