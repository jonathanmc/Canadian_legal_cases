</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Kozak J. dated February 27, 1998,
made at Thunder Bay, Ontario.
</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  City  appeals from a determination  by  Kozak  J.  now
reported at (1998) 45 M.P.L.R. (2d) 208 (Ont. Gen. Div.) that the
respondent is not liable to payment of interest and penalties  on
the amount of the reduction of its appealed tax assessment.
[2]  The facts are not in dispute and are recited by the motions
judge as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The applicant is the owner of property in the City of
          Thunder Bay, which is referred to as Pool 6. It can be noted that
          this is a significant piece of waterfront property which was
          formerly owned by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Since its acquisition of the property in
          1994,  the  applicant has paid  no  municipal
          taxes    whatsoever   to    the    respondent
          corporation  for the years 1994,  1995,  1996
          and  1997. Instead, the applicant pursued tax
          assessment  appeals  which  resulted   in   a
          reduction of the taxes assessed, by a  factor
          of  six, by an order of the Ontario Municipal
          Board.
          </pre>
    <pre>               As a result of the revised assessment of
          taxes  by  the Ontario Municipal  Board,  and
          there being no further appeals pending by the
          respondent,  the  clerk  of  the   respondent
          revised  the  rolls  with  respect   to   the
          principal amount of taxes assessed,  but  did
          not  amend  the amount claimed on account  of
          penalties  and  interest,  and  continued  to
          calculate  interest and penalties based  upon
          the unreduced assessment amounts.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 There   is  no  dispute  between   the
          applicant and the respondent with respect  to
          the  principal amount of taxes  properly  due
          and   owing   for  the  relevant  period   of
          assessment.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  its calculation of the cancellation
          fee,  the  respondent  utilized  the  revised
          assessment  as  determined by the  Assessment
          Review   Board,  and  the  Ontario  Municipal
          Board,  but applied the interest and  penalty
          provisions  to  the unrevised  assessment  of
          taxes  and,  in  so  doing,  arrived   at   a
          cancellation   fee   of   $667,050.63.    The
          applicant,  in  applying  the  interest   and
          penalty  provisions to the revised assessment
          of  taxes, calculates the cancellation fee to
          be $445,141.31.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  essence of the City&#146;s position is that it is empowered
and  required  to  impose a penalty and interest  on  unpaid  tax
assessments  and  that  if  a ratepayer  wishes  to  avoid  their
imposition pending an appeal, the taxes can be paid and  will  be
refunded later if the assessment is reduced.
[4]  The City relies upon Zaiden Group Ltd. v. London (City)
(1990), 47 M.P.L.R. 1 (Ont. C.A.); appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada dismissed (1991), 3 S.C.R. 593, as establishing that the
Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1991, c. A.31 and related statutes provide
a complete code, excluding any concepts of fairness or other
equitable considerations. The statutory regime includes s.399(3)
of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45 authorizing a by-law to
exact a penalty for non-payment of taxes of 1¼% per month for the
year of the assessment. (The city passed such a by-law.)
Subsections 419(1)-(2) of that Act require the imposition of
interest on due and unpaid taxes. Those subsections read:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    419. (1) Despite any special Act, but subject to
          subsection (2), the treasurer, collector or county treasurer, as
          the case may be, shall add to the amount of all taxes due and
          unpaid interest at the rate of one-half of 1 per cent per month
          for each month or fraction thereof from the 31st day of December
          in the year in which the taxes were levied until the taxes are
          paid, provided that the council by by-law may increase such rate
          to a rate not exceeding 1¼ per cent per month.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (2) Despite  subsection (1) or any
          special   Act,  the  council   of   a   local
          municipality may, by by-law, require that the
          treasurer, collector or county treasurer,  as
          the  case  may be, add to the amount  of  all
          taxes  due  and unpaid interest at such  rate
          not  exceeding 15 per cent per annum  as  the
          council  determines, from  the  31st  day  of
          December in the year in which the taxes  were
          levied until the taxes are paid.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   It is the City&#146;s position that there are no provisions  for
repayment  of  the  penalty  or  interest  and  that  this  is  a
legislative  design to prevent defaulters from casting  a  burden
upon the remaining ratepayers who comply with their obligations.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Zaiden  makes  it clear that where, as  here,  there  is  a
complete  statutory  code the common law and  equity  should  not
intrude to correct perceived unfairness. That is not to say  that
the  context  and  the factual circumstances  against  which  the
statutes  are overlaid is irrelevant in aid of interpretation  of
the language used by the legislature.
[7]  Every municipality has an interest in collecting taxes when
due in order to meet its budgeted expenditures. It is sensible
that they impose penalties and interest charges on overdue taxes
to offset necessary borrowing charges. Municipalities that are
sensitive to ratepayer concerns will pass by-laws requiring
interest to be paid on overpayments. From a ratepayer&#146;s point of
view, it may be good business judgment to delay payment of taxes
and accept the penalty and interest charges or, alternatively, to
pay the taxes, pursue an appeal, and then, where permitted,
recover interest on the overpayment. These are the interfacing
considerations in most situations.
[8]  The situation before the court in this instance is out of
the ordinary. A formerly operating grain facility was being
demolished with the prospect of a new use for the land. The owner
sought a markedly reduced assessment and there was no requirement
that the assessed taxes be paid as a prerequisite to an appeal.
If the assessed taxes were paid when due, any overpayment would
be refunded at the current rates of Canada Savings Bonds
according to the municipality&#146;s by-law. In the result of the
appeal proceeding, such an overpayment would have been five-
sixths of the amount paid. Thus, a very substantial sum would
have had to be deposited in advance at a modest prospective
return. Given the choice not to pay, the penalty charge in the
first year was 1¼%  per month, and thereafter the interest charge
was at the same rate, not compounded.
[9]  The City says that it is entitled to 15% per annum on the
original assessment even though it was reduced on appeal to one-
sixth of the original amount. That is an effective charge of 90%
on the eventual assessment. What if, in other circumstances, the
ratepayer was held on appeal to be non-assessable?
[10] With these considerations in mind, I turn to analyze the
language of the statutes to determine the legislative intent.
[11] The initial step is the imposition of a penalty and interest
and the requirement that these be added to the roll. Section 419
of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45 in its entirety reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    419. &#150; Despite any special Act, but subject to
          subsection (2), the treasurer, collector or county treasurer, as
          the case may be, shall add to the amount of all taxes due and
          unpaid interest at the rate of one-half of 1 per cent per month
          for each month or fraction thereof from the 31st day of December
          in the year in which the taxes were levied until the taxes are
          paid, provided that the council by by-law may increase such rate
          to a rate not exceeding 1¼ per cent per month.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (2)  Despite subsection (1) or any
          special   Act,  the  council   of   a   local
          municipality may, by by-law, require that the
          treasurer,  as the case may be,  add  to  the
          amount  of all taxes due and unpaid  interest
          at  such  rate not exceeding 15 per cent  per
          annum  as  the council determines,  from  the
          31st day of December in the year in which the
          taxes were levied until the taxes are paid.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (3)   No  interest  or  percentage
          added to taxes shall be compounded.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (4)  Interest and percentages added
          to taxes form part of such taxes and shall be
          collected as taxes.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  &#147;Percentages&#148;  are penalties.1  The significance  of  these
provisions  to  our  present concern is  that  from  the  outset,
interest and penalties form part of the taxes and are payable  as
taxes.  If  adjustments are later made it must be to a composite,
now called &#147;taxes&#148;.
[13] Following a successful appeal, s.37(6) of the Assessment
Act, R.S.O. 1991, c. A.31 takes effect. It reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    37(6)  No assessment shall be increased, reduced or
          otherwise altered until all complaints, appeals or proceedings
          concerning the assessment have been finally determined and
          disposed of, and where the result of the final determination and
          disposition of the complaints, appeals or proceedings increases,
          reduces or otherwise alters the assessment, the taxes levied and
          payable with respect to the assessment shall be adjusted
          accordingly and any overpayment resulting from the adjustment
          shall be refunded by the municipality. [My Emphasis.]</pre>
    <pre>[14] The &#147;taxes levied and payable&#148; are, by force of s.419(4)  of
the  Municipal  Act,  the combination of the taxes,  penalty  and
interest.  These, in aggregate, &#147;shall be adjusted  accordingly.&#148;
Plain words leading to a clear result. If the ratepayer has  paid
taxes  on  time,  they  are  refunded;  if  paid  somewhat  late,
including  penalty and interest charges, the excess of all  items
is  refunded; if not paid, then the roll is adjusted  as  to  all
items.
[15] Certainly the municipality relies upon the assessment to
meet its commitments. However, taxes paid and reduced on appeal
must be refunded or, if not paid, cannot be collected, and thus,
distort the budget. I can see no logical basis to support a
differentiation between the excessive assessment on the one hand
and the interest and penalty on that excess, on the other. Both
affect the municipal finances but by force of s.419(4) of the
Municipal Act they sensibly walk hand-in-hand.
[16] In my view this is not in any respect a strained reading of
the legislation, or even one that implements a bias in favour of
the taxpayer. And it leads to a sensible legislative intention
that a taxpayer should not be held to account for more than its
legal obligations. If those obligations turn out on appeal to be
the original assessment, the ratepayer who has not paid the taxes
when due will pay heavily for taking that risk, as is indicated
by the dollar figures in this proceeding.
[17] I would therefore dismiss the City&#146;s appeal with costs.</pre>

    <pre>                                         &#147;I  agree,  M.  Moldaver
J.A.&#148;

</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A. (Dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[18] The hearing before Kozak J. resulted from The Corporation of
the City of Thunder Bay (&#147;the City&#148;) commencing proceedings under
the Municipal Tax Sales Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.60 for the sale  of
land   owned  by  the  respondent  1037618  Ontario  Inc.   (&#147;the
respondent&#148;)  for arrears of the payment of real property  taxes.
The  proceedings  were  commenced by the registration  of  a  tax
arrears  certificate against the title to the  respondent&#146;s  land
under s.3(1) of the Act. The tax arrears certificate provided, as
required by s.3(2), that the land would be sold by public sale if
the cancellation price, as defined in s.1(1), was not paid within
one year from the date of the registration of the certificate.
[19] The parties were in disagreement with respect to the amount
of the cancellation price. The respondent, which had not paid
municipal taxes since it purchased the land on October 10, 1993,
took the position that the statutory interest and penalties owing
in respect to the tax arrears should be calculated on the basis
of the reduced assessed value of the land as ordered by the
Ontario Municipal Board (&#147;the OMB&#148;). Although the City agreed
with the respondent that the tax arrears component of the
cancellation price should be calculated on the basis of the
reduced assessed value of the land, it took the position that the
interest and penalty components of the cancellation price were to
be calculated on the basis of the taxes levied and unpaid
pursuant to the original assessed value of the land.
[20] To resolve this impasse, the respondent commenced an
application under s.6(2) of the Act to determine the amount of
the cancellation price. Kozak J. accepted the respondent&#146;s
position. The City has appealed from that result. As I agree with
the City&#146;s position, I would allow the appeal and order that in
calculating the cancellation price, interest and penalties are to
be calculated on the basis of taxes levied and unpaid pursuant to
the original assessed value of the land.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[21] As Carthy J.A. has stated, the facts are not in dispute.  As
they  are  contained in his reasons, there is no need  to  repeat
them.
[22] However, it is helpful to add the following. On January 23,
1997, the OMB released its order significantly reducing the
assessed value of the respondent&#146;s lands. The City registered its
tax arrears certificate on February 14, 1997. The City calculated
the cancellation price to be $667,050.63 as of December 9, 1997.
As of that date, the respondent had not paid any amount for
municipal taxes, whether based on the original, or the reduced,
assessed value of land. Nor had it paid any amount for interest
and penalties owing in respect to its failure to pay its real
property taxes when due, which had been calculated by the City
pursuant to the statutory scheme which I will describe, and added
to the unpaid taxes.

</pre>
    <pre>REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</pre>
    <pre>[23]  After  referring to s.37(6) of the Assessment  Act,  R.S.O.
1990, c.A.31 and s.390 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45,
the   motions  judge  recognized  that  unpaid  taxes  can  cause
financial  problems for municipalities as they are  dependant  on
the  payment of taxes to finance the operations they are required
to carry out. He continued:
          </pre>
    <pre>            On the other hand, a requirement that a property owner be
          called upon to pay on a due date, a grossly overvalued assessment
          and then, in default, to have to pay a penalty and interest upon
          such an assessment, could cause severe financial hardship, if not
          the possibility of financial ruin, especially if the municipality
          does not see fit to pass a bylaw to pay interest on overpayments.
          (See Zaidan Group Ltd. v. Corporation of the City of London
          (1991) 50 OR. (3d) 384 S.C.C.)  There is the potential for
          financial abuse at both ends.
          </pre>
    <pre>                There is no need for this Court in  the
          circumstances of this case to make a specific
          determination  as to whether the  legislation
          and  bylaws  constitute a complete  statutory
          code,  which may exempt principles of  equity
          and  the  common law. However, it  should  be
          noted that the general rule of interpretation
          requires  that a taxing statute  be  strictly
          construed, and unless the statute clearly and
          unambiguously intends to do so, it should not
          be construed so as to make any alterations in
          the common law. In such cases where questions
          of   interpretation   arise,   there   is   a
          likelihood  that  they will  be  resolved  in
          favour of the taxpayer.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 Both   the  Assessment  Act  and   the
          Municipal  Act are silent on the  subject  of
          interest.  As  well,  this  Court   was   not
          provided  with  any case that falls  squarely
          along  side  the case at bar.  The  issue  of
          refunds on interest for overpayments made  by
          a  taxpayer, did arise in Zaidan where it was
          held that in the absence of a bylaw requiring
          a  municipality to do so, it is not obligated
          to make a payment with respect to interest on
          a refund for overpayment&#133;..
          </pre>
    <pre>               In Zaidan, the plaintiff sought interest
          on  the  overpayment from the City of London.
          In the case at bar, the applicant did not pay
          any  money  up front and waited for  a  final
          resolution at the O.M.B., which resulted in a
          substantial revision of the assessment.  When
          the  O.M.B.  held the unrevised  or  original
          assessment  to  be too high, and  reduced  it
          accordingly,  then  it follows,  pursuant  to
          Section 37(6) of the Assessment Act and s.390
          of  the  Municipal Act, that  the  amount  on
          which the City could legally collect interest
          was  also  reduced.  To  allow  the  City  to
          collect  interest  on  the  original   amount
          would, in effect, entitle them to monies over
          which they did not acquire a legal interest.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 In   conclusion,  I  cannot  find  any
          statutory authority that allows the  City  of
          Thunder Bay to collect interest and penalties
          on  the unrevised amount. The Court in Zaidan
          supra distinguished between legal and illegal
          collections.    Judicial   intervention    is
          premised   on   illegal   or   ultra    vires
          collections of this nature.
          </pre>
    <pre>                It  is  therefore the finding  of  this
          Court that the respondent has not established
          a  valid  legal  claim  to  the  interest  or
          penalties based on the unrevised figure,  and
          accordingly, it is hereby declared  that  the
          proper calculation of the cancellation fee is
          to be arrived at by applying the interest and
          penalty  provisions  to  the  revised  taxes,
          which  the  parties  agree  was  the  sum  of
          $449,342.64. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[24]  What I understand from the reasons of the motions judge  is
that  he  interpreted s.37(6) of the Assessment Act and s.390  of
the  Municipal  Act to mean that in calculating the  cancellation
price  for  the  purpose of s.6 of the Municipal Tax  Sales  Act,
interest and penalties are to be calculated on the basis  of  the
reduced  assessed value of the land. He found that  to  calculate
interest on the basis of the original assessed value of the  land
would entitle the City to interest on taxes &#147;over which they  did
not acquire a legal interest&#148;. Although the motions judge did not
make  a similar finding with respect to penalties, he went on  to
hold  that  he  was unable to find any statutory  authority  that
allows the City to collect interest and penalties on the original
assessed value of the land.</pre>
    <pre>THE LEGISLATION AS A STATUTORY CODE</pre>
    <pre>[25]  In considering the relevant legislation, the starting point
is  the  decision of this court in Zaidan Group  Ltd.  v.  London
(City)  (1990),  71 O.R. (2d) 65, which applied the  decision  of
this  court  in  Windsor Roman Catholic Separate  School  Bd.  v.
Windsor  (City)  (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 241,  leave  to  appeal  to
S.C.C.  refused (1988), 30 O.A.C. 160. An appeal  in  Zaidan  was
dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada: [1991] 3 S.C.R. 593. In
Zaidan, the taxpayer had paid its municipal taxes, the amount  of
which  was reduced by its successful appeal of the assessment  of
its  lands. It received a refund from the City of London  of  the
amount  of the taxes it had overpaid. As there was no legislation
that  required  London to pay interest to  the  taxpayer  on  the
amount  of  taxes it overpaid, it sought to recover  interest  in
reliance on the doctrine of unjust enrichment.
[26] This court found that the taxpayer could not recover
interest. In rejecting recovery of interest on the basis of
unjust enrichment, the court stated at p.69:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The common thread of unfairness recognized by the common law
          breaks when a legislative body acts within its jurisdiction and
          stipulates, as here, that the municipality shall levy assessed
          amounts, the taxpayers shall pay those amounts, the municipality
          may use the money it has collected, and must refund it if
          adjusted downward on appeal, with interest if it has passed a by-
          law. The statute could equally have said that a taxpayer must pay
          the assessed amounts without any recourse by way of complaint.
          The unfairness of such a statute would be universally denounced
          but, if it were constitutionally competent to the legislature,
          the common law would have nothing to say on the subject. There is
          no question of a gap being left in the legislation for the common
          law to fill. The taxes are a statutory creation and the
          conditions surrounding their payment and repayment must be in the
          statutes associated with their creation. The common law cannot
          characterize competent legislation as unjust, and it would be
          doing so if it imposed an additional duty to pay interest on a
          statutory duty to levy and to refund a specific amount of money.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Austin J., [in dissenting reasons in the
          Divisional Court: (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 438 at
          442-44] relying upon this court&#146;s decision in
          Windsor Roman Catholic Separate School  Board
          v.  Windsor (City) (1988), 64 O.R. (2d)  241,
          49   D.L.R.   (4th)  576,  37  M.P.L.R.   70,
          characterized    the    relevant    statutory
          provisions as a complete statutory code which
          excludes the common law. I am saying much the
          same  thing  but putting it in terms  of  the
          ambit  of  the principle of unjust enrichment
          so  as  to identify a clear distinction  from
          the  reasoning in the Air Canada  case  where
          the   province   had   reached   beyond   its
          jurisdiction and had no statutory  protection
          against   the   allegation   of   unfairness.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[27]  In  dismissing the taxpayer&#146;s appeal, the  following  brief
reasons were given by the Supreme Court at 594:
          </pre>
    <pre>            THE COURT &#150; We are all of the view that this appeal must be
          dismissed. The appellant&#146;s claim to interest on an overpayment of
          tax based on the doctrine of unjust enrichment is not available
          in this case in the light of s.6(1) of the Municipal Interest and
          Discount Rates Act, 1982, S.O. 1982, c.44. This section
          authorizes a municipality to pass a by-law for the payment of
          interest and also gives a municipality a discretion to do so. In
          this case, the City of London did not pass such a by-law.
          Accordingly, the claim for unjust enrichment fails and the appeal
          is dismissed with costs.</pre>
    <pre>See  also  Lafarge  Canada  Inc. v.  Calgary  (City)  (1988),  40
M.P.L.R.  242 (Alta. Q.B.); Hensrud v. Regina (City) (1994),  115
D.L.R. (4th) 69 (Sask. Q.B.), aff&#146;d (1994), 121 D.L.R. (4th)  188
(Sask. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[28]  In my view, in this appeal the relevant provisions  of  the
Municipal  Act,  the Assessment Act, the Municipal  Interest  and
Discount Rates Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.58, the Municipal Tax  Sales
Act, the City&#146;s interim and final tax levy by-laws and the City&#146;s
penalty,  interest  and overpayment by-laws  provide  a  complete
statutory  code  governing the assessment of real  property,  the
levying of municipal taxes, the payment of taxes by the dates  on
which  they are due, and penalties and interest payable on  taxes
unpaid  when  due,  as  well  as  the  payment  of  interest   on
overpayments of taxes consequent to a successful appeal resulting
in  a  reduction of the assessed value of the land in respect  to
which  the tax was levied. I find nothing in the statutory  code,
express  or implied, which requires the City, in calculating  the
cancellation price for the purposes of a tax sale, to recalculate
unpaid interest and penalties based on the reduced assessed value
of the respondent&#146;s land.
[29] The Assessment Act is complementary to the Municipal Act for
the purposes of municipal taxation. Section 3 of the Assessment
Act provides that all real property in Ontario is subject to
assessment and taxation, subject to certain exemptions. Part XXII
of the Municipal Act in general, and s.362 in particular, as well
as s.37(3) of the Assessment Act, provide that municipal taxes
shall be levied upon the assessment for real property made under
the Assessment Act. (Although significant amendments were made to
Part XXII by S.O. 1997, c.5, they do not affect the issues raised
by this appeal. All references to the Municipal Act, therefore,
are to the Act prior to its 1997 amendment.)  The Assessment Act
contains all the provisions applicable to complaints and appeals
from assessments. As well, Part XXII of the Municipal Act
contains a number of remedies available to a municipality to
enable it to collect taxes, as does the Municipal Tax Sales Act.
The subject of this appeal is real property taxes, which
represents only one of several types of taxes which a
municipality is empowered to impose. However, it is significant
that municipalities derive the major portions of their revenue
from real property taxes.
[30] In addition to the general provisions of the Assessment Act
and the Municipal Act, the following statutory provisions,
together with the City&#146;s by-laws, form the statutory code which
applies to the issues raised by this appeal.
[31] The Municipal Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               390. If alterations are made in the assessment role, in
          accordance with the Assessment Act, after the collector&#146;s roll or
          rolls for the municipality for the year for which such assessment
          has been made have been prepared, the clerk of the municipality
          shall alter or amend the collector&#146;s roll or rolls to correspond
          with such alterations, and insert the proper rates therefor, and
          the rates or taxes shall be collectable in accordance with such
          corrected rolls in the same manner and with the like remedies as
          if they had been in the rolls when first prepared and certified
          by the clerk of the municipality. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                391. The collector, upon receiving  his
          or  her  roll, shall proceed to  collect  the
          taxes therein mentioned.
          </pre>
    <pre>                399.(1)   In local municipalities,  the
          council may by by-law require the payment  of
          taxes,     including    local     improvement
          assessments,  sewer rents and rates,  and  of
          other rents or rates payable as taxes, to  be
          made  into  the  office of the  treasurer  or
          collector  by  any day or days  to  be  named
          therein, in bulk or by instalments,  and  may
          provide that on the punctual payment  of  any
          instalment  the  time  for  payment  of   the
          remaining instalment or instalments shall  be
          extended to a day or days to be name, or  may
          provide  that  in default of payment  of  any
          instalment  by  the  day  named  for  payment
          thereof,   the   subsequent   instalment   or
          instalments  shall forthwith become  payable.

          </pre>
    <pre>                (3)  The council may by by-law impose a
          percentage  charge  as  a  penalty  for  non-
          payment  of  taxes or any class or instalment
          thereof  not  exceeding 1 ¼ per cent  on  the
          first day of default and on the first day  of
          each   calendar  month  thereafter  in  which
          default continues, but not after the  end  of
          the  year  in  which  the taxes  are  levied.

    <pre>               (5)  The council may by by-law authorize
          the  treasurer or collector to receive in any
          year  payments on account of taxes  for  that
          year  in advance of the day that may be fixed
          by  by-law  for the payment of any instalment
          of such taxes and,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  to allow a discount on any taxes so
               paid in advance at a rate not exceeding 12
               per cent per annum and may allow interest at
               a rate not exceeding 12 per cent per annum on
               account of taxes so paid in advance for any
               portion of the period for which no discount
               is allowed; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  to allow interest on taxes paid  in
               advance  of the day fixed by by-law  for
               the  payment of any instalment  of  such
               taxes  at  a rate not exceeding  12  per
               cent per annum,
          </pre>
    <pre>               even if the taxes for such year have not
          been  levied  or  that  the  assessment  roll
          on  which  such  taxes are to  be  fixed  and
          levied    has    not   been    revised    and
          certified  by  the  Assessment  Review  Board
          when   any  such  advance  payment  is  made,
          and    a    by-law    passed    under    this
          subsection  remains  in force  from  year  to
          year until it is repealed or amended.
          </pre>

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (9)  The council of any municipality may
          by  by-law  authorize the treasurer  and  the
          collector  of  taxes to accept  part  payment
          from time to time on account of any taxes due
          and  to give a receipt for such part payment,
          provided  that  acceptance of any  such  part
          payment does not affect the collection of any
          percentage  charge  imposed  and  collectable
          under  subsection  (3)  in  respect  of  non-
          payment of any taxes or any class of taxes or
          of any instalment thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (10)   Where  the  treasurer  or   the
          collector  of taxes receives part payment  on
          account of taxes due for any year, he or  she
          shall  credit  such  part  payment  first  on
          account   of   the  interest  and  percentage
          charges,  if  any, added to such taxes,  and,
          where  such taxes are required to be paid  by
          instalments  under  a  by-law  passed   under
          subsection (1), the remainder of such payment
          shall   be   credited   first   against   the
          instalment first due and secondly against the
          instalment  next due, and so  on,  until  the
          whole  of  the remainder of the  payment  has
          been credited against such taxes.
          </pre>
    <pre>                419. (1)  Despite any special Act,  but
          subject  to  subsection (2),  the  treasurer,
          collector  or county treasurer, as  the  case
          may  be, shall add to the amount of all taxes
          due  and unpaid interest at the rate of  one-
          half  of 1 per cent per month for each  month
          or  fraction  thereof from the  31st  day  of
          December in the year in which the taxes  were
          levied  until  the taxes are  paid,  provided
          that  the council by by-law may increase such
          rate to a rate not exceeding 1 ¼ per cent per
          month. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                (2)   Despite  subsection  (1)  or  any
          special   Act,  the  council   of   a   local
          municipality may, by by-law, require that the
          treasurer, collector or county treasurer,  as
          the  case  may be, add to the amount  of  all
          taxes  due  and unpaid interest at such  rate
          not  exceeding 15 per cent per annum  as  the
          council  determines, from  the  31st  day  of
          December in the year in which the taxes  were
          levied until the taxes are paid.
          </pre>
    <pre>                (3)  No interest or percentage added to
          taxes shall be compounded.
          </pre>
    <pre>                (4)  Interest and percentages added  to
          taxes  form part of such taxes and  shall  be

    <pre>            37.(3)  In every municipality the rate of taxation for each
          year shall be fixed and levied on the assessment taken in the
          preceding year according to the last revised assessment roll
          thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>                (6)   No assessment shall be increased,

          complaints, appeals or proceedings concerning
          the  assessment have been finally  determined
          and  disposed of, and where the result of the
          final  determination and disposition  of  the
          complaints, appeals or proceedings increases,
          reduces  or  otherwise alters the assessment,
          the taxes levied and payable with respect  to
          the  assessment shall be adjusted accordingly
          and   any  overpayment  resulting  from   the

          different rates may be paid for different successive periods from
          the day the overpayments were made or such other day as may be

    <pre>                &#147;cancellation  price&#148; means  an  amount
          equal  to  all the tax arrears owing  at  any
          time  in  respect of land together  with  all
          current  real property taxes owing,  interest
          and  penalties  thereon  and  all  reasonable
          costs incurred by the municipality, after the
          treasurer becomes entitled to register a  tax
          arrears  certificate  under  section  3,   in
          proceeding under this Act or in contemplation
          of  proceeding  under this Act  and,  without
          restricting the generality of the  foregoing,
          may include,

          </pre>
    <pre>                &#147;tax  arrears&#148; means any real  property
          taxes    placed   on   or    added    to    a
          collector&#146;s  roll  that  remain   unpaid   on
          the   1st   day  of  January  in   the   year
          following  that  in which  they  were  placed

          d&#146;impôts&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>[35]  As  it was empowered to do by ss.376(2) and 399(1)  of  the
Municipal Act, the City passed interim and final tax levy by-laws
for  the years in issue. A common feature of the by-laws required
that the &#147;tax levied shall be paid&#148; by a stipulated date.
[36] Pursuant to s.399(3) of the Municipal Act, the City passed a
by-law imposing a penalty on all overdue taxes amounting to 1 ¼%
of the amount of overdue taxes on the first day of default, and
on the first day of each calendar month thereafter in which
default continues. &#147;Overdue taxes&#148; is defined as &#147;those taxes
that have been levied in any year and have not been paid on or
before the day payment is due&#148;.
[37] Both s.399(3) of the Municipal Act and the by-law provide
that penalties apply only to the year in which the taxes are
levied. Thereafter, pursuant to s.419 of the Act, interest is
added to all taxes due and unpaid. As it was empowered to do by
s.419(1), the City passed a by-law for the relevant years
increasing the statutory interest rate on all tax arrears to 1 ¼%
per month for each month, or fraction thereof, until the taxes
are paid. &#147;Tax arrears&#148; is defined as &#147;taxes which are due and
unpaid after December 31st of the year in which they were
levied&#148;.
[38] Section 11 of By-law 74-1994 provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.  Nothing in this By-law shall exempt the person failing
          to pay the said taxes or any instalment thereof as hereinbefore
          provided from all of the provisions of the Municipal Act
          regarding the collection of taxes in arrears and nothing herein
          shall be deemed to restrict any powers of the Collector to
          collect the said taxes or any instalment or portion thereof in
          arrears. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>A  similar provision is contained in by-laws passed in 1995, 1996
and 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[39]  Finally, pursuant to s.6(1) of the Municipal  Interest  and
Discount  Rates Act, the City passed a by-law providing  that  it
would  pay interest to persons to whom overpayments are  refunded
under  s.37(6) of the Assessment Act &#147;calculated from the  actual
payment of the final tax instalment for the applicable year&#133;until
the overpayment is refunded&#148;. Absent such by-law, the City has no
obligation  to pay interest on the refund of any overpayment,  as
decided  in  Zaidan.  The  by-law  is  clearly  premised  on  the
taxpayer&#146;s  statutory obligation to pay taxes when they  are  due
and owing.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[40]  In  my  view,  the decision of this  court  in  Zaidan,  as
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, is determinative of  the
issues  raised  by this appeal. The focus of this appeal  is  the
proper  method  of  calculation of  the  cancellation  price,  as
defined  in  s.1(1) of the Municipal Tax Sales  Act.  The  proper
calculation  is  essential so that the respondent  may  pay  that
amount  to  preclude the sale of its lands by the City consequent
to  its  failure to pay real property taxes levied on  its  lands
when  due,  together  with interest and penalties  added  to  the
unpaid taxes, for a period of four years. As I will explain,  the
statutory code which is set out above, does not, for the  purpose
of  calculating  the cancellation price, relieve  the  respondent
from  the  payment of interest and penalties added  to  the  real
property  taxes which it did not pay throughout the  period  that
the  assessment was under appeal. Accordingly, the tax  base  for
the  computation  of the interest and penalty components  of  the
cancellation  price is the original assessment.  While  this  may
seem unfair, as Zaidan holds, it is not for the court to alter  a
statutory code that is the creation of the legislature.
[41] As the proceedings which resulted in this appeal had their
genesis in the respondent&#146;s failure to pay realty taxes when they
were due and payable resulting in the City initiating tax sale
proceedings, it is helpful to review some general principles
relating to a taxpayer&#146;s statutory obligation to pay realty taxes
when due and the ultimate remedy available to a municipality to
collect unpaid taxes.
[42] The obligation of a taxpayer to pay municipal taxes on the
date on which they are due arises from the provisions of the
Municipal Act and the by-laws passed by the City. This has been
recognized by many courts, the passage quoted earlier from Zaidan
being illustrative. The filing of an appeal of the assessment of
his or her property by a taxpayer does not relieve the taxpayer
of the statutory duty to pay realty taxes when due. Neither the
Municipal Act, nor the Assessment Act, contain any provision
which suspends the payment of taxes during the appeal process,
nor any provision which precludes a municipality from taking
proceedings to collect tax arrears during this period. Such
provisions would seriously deprive a municipality of the funds
required to conduct its business. To require a taxpayer to pay
taxes when due is the result of a statutory scheme imposed on
both the taxpayer and the municipality by the legislature. The
province is obliged to assess the taxpayer&#146;s real property and,
subject to the right which each has to appeal the assessment, the
municipality and the taxpayer are bound to accept the assessment:
cf. Lafarge, supra, at 249-50.
[43] The purposes of assessment have been described by K. G.
Crawford, Canadian Municipal Government, (1954) at 261:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The process of assessing serves two major purposes:  it
          determines what objects or properties in the municipality are
          liable to taxation, and thereby the total tax base upon which the
          tax rate is to be levied to raise the taxes required for the
          year, and at the same time it determines the share of the total
          tax burden which each taxpayer will be required to bear.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  practice, the term &#147;assessment&#148; has
          several   connotations.  In  one   sense   an
          assessment is the equivalent of a  tax  or  a
          levy.  From the individual&#146;s point  of  view,
          municipally,  it  means  the  valuation   for
          taxation  purposes placed  upon  the  taxable
          object,  while  from  the  viewpoint   of   a
          council, it means the total of the values for
          taxation purposes of all the taxable units in
          the municipality.
          </pre>
    <pre>                To the citizen, the important factor of
          the  assessment  is  its equity.  It  matters
          little  ultimately to the individual  whether
          his  property is assessed at too high or  too
          low  a  figure,  as related to actual  value,
          provided  his  assessment  is  equitable   as
          related  to the assessments of all the  other
          properties, for, from his point of view,  the
          assessment merely determines his share of the
          total  tax burden. If all are assessed at  50
          per cent of value, his share is not different
          than if all are assessed at 100 per cent.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  As  I explained previously, when the assessment upon  which
municipal  taxes  are  to  be levied  has  been  determined,  the
municipal  council  fixes  the  rate  of  taxation  annually  and
provides  for the terms of payment, such as the date of  payment,
and provisions, if any, for instalment payments and discounts for
early  payment,  as  well  as interest  and  penalties  for  late
payment, and appropriate by-laws are passed. It then becomes  the
responsibility of the municipality to collect the taxes.
[45] As I will deal with them subsequently, a brief reference is
helpful to the assessment roll and the collector&#146;s roll. The
assessment roll is prepared under the Assessment Act, and its
final version forms the foundation for the taxes imposed by a
municipality. Thus, after the last revised assessment roll is
delivered to the clerk of a municipality it is transformed into
the collector&#146;s roll upon the passing of the relevant by-laws,
and is the authority of the tax collector under the Municipal Act
to use the compulsory machinery of the Act to collect the taxes.
Section 387(1) contains the direction to municipal clerks in
respect to the preparation of a collector&#146;s roll. A helpful
discussion of the relationship between the assessment roll and
the collector&#146;s is found in Re Bayack (1929), 64 O.L.R. 14 (C.A.)
in which Masten J.A. stated at 20-21:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;down to the time when the roll is delivered by the assessor
          to the clerk there is no completed assessment. Up to that moment
          the assessor is engaged in making his roll. Prior to its delivery
          to the clerk he has power to make alterations in his tentative
          assessment, and in the entries which he has made in his roll&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                When he has delivered the verified roll
          to  the clerk, the function and powers of the
          assessor cease. Then and then only is there a
          completed assessment.</pre>
    <pre>For   a  general  discussion  of  the  assessment  roll  and  the
collector&#146;s  roll,  see  H.  E.  Manning,  Assessment  &amp;  Rating:
Municipal Taxation in Canada, 4th ed. (1962), at 113 et seq.  and
383 et seq., respectively.</pre>
    <pre>[46] Under the Municipal Act, various inducements and devices are
provided to encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes. Taxpayers may
be  permitted to pay taxes by instalments (s.399(1)) and  may  be
allowed  discounts for taxes paid in advance (s.399(5)).  On  the
other  hand,  a percentage, or penalty, may be imposed  for  non-
payment of taxes (s.399(3)) and interest shall be added to  taxes
due   and   unpaid  (s.419(1)).  Under  s.419(4),  interest   and
percentages added to taxes form part of such taxes and  shall  be
collected as taxes. The Act provides a number of remedies for the
collection of unpaid taxes. These include an action under  s.383,
from  a  tenant  under s.384 and by distress upon the  goods  and
chattels  of  the  landowner under ss.400 and 420.  In  addition,
under  s.411  tax  arrears form a charge on the land,  and  s.382
creates a tax lien.
[47] In respect to the collection of tax arrears it is important
to have regard to s.412 of the Act which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               412. The treasurer of every municipality shall collect the
          arrears of taxes outstanding after the return of the collector&#146;s
          roll and may receive part payment of taxes returned to the
          treasurer as in arrears upon any land for any year and shall
          credit such payment first on account of the interest and
          percentage charges, if any, added to such taxes and shall credit
          the remainder of such payment against that part of the taxes that
          has been in arrears for the greatest period of time but no such
          payment shall be received after a tax arrears certificate has
          been registered under the Municipal Tax Sales Act. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>In  my  view, this indicates the intention of the legislature  to
regard  interest and percentages as distinct, or  discrete,  from
taxes,  notwithstanding  that  under  s.419(4)  they  are  to  be
collected  as  taxes.  In this regard, it is  to  be  noted  that
pursuant  to s.419(1) and s.399(3), the relevant by-laws  provide
that  interest and percentages, respectively, continue  to  apply
until the taxes are paid.</pre>
    <pre>[48]  In  Canadian  Municipal Government, at pp.319-20,  Crawford
provides  a discussion of the purpose of penalties which,  in  my
view, is relevant to this appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>            The imposition of penalties is a source of irritation and
          complaint on the part of taxpayers, in many cases because the
          purpose of the penalty is not appreciated. Most delinquent
          taxpayers regard the penalty as a punishment rather than a means
          of effecting equitable treatment among all the taxpayers.
          Municipalities have to borrow money to finance their operations
          in the interim between the start of the fiscal year and the time
          when taxes become due, which involves costs for the taxpayers as
          a whole. When the taxes are paid they are used to pay off the
          loans previously incurred but to the extent that the taxes of any
          individual are not paid on the due date that amount is not
          available to reduce the loans. It is inequitable that those who
          pay their taxes on the due date should have to pay also for the
          cost of financing those who do not or who cannot pay on time. The
          penalties encourage the payment of taxes and they also make the
          delinquent taxpayer bear the cost of financing the loans required
          as a result of his delinquency.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Citizens  frequently  complain  of  the
          rigidity of enforcement of penalties but  any
          leeway   allowed   in  the   enforcement   of
          penalties in individual cases defeats the aim
          of  equality  of treatment, and although  the
          individual benefitted by a special  extension
          of  time  for  payment of his  taxes  may  be
          satisfied, a question is raised in  his  mind
          as  to  whether or not others may be  getting
          the  same  or  even greater concessions.  One
          important   factor  in  satisfying  citizens,
          particularly  in matters of taxation,  is  to
          convince  them  that  there  is  uniform  and
          equitable treatment for all under established
          rules. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[49]  The  ultimate  remedy  for the collection  of  unpaid  real
property taxes is the tax sale, which is the real focus  of  this
appeal. In Bay Colony Ltd. v. Wasaga Beach (Town) (1997), 33 O.R.
(3d) 637 at 639 this court stated that &#147;[t]he purpose of tax sale
statutes is to see that municipalities are able to collect  taxes
to  assure  that  the  tax  burden is  distributed  fairly  among
municipal  taxpayers&#148;. For the manner in  which  a  tax  sale  is
conducted,  see Perry Township Tax Sale No. 92-1 (Re) (1993),  14
O.R. (3d) 45 at 50 (Gen. Div.).
[50] I come now to the proper calculation of the cancellation
price for the purposes of the Municipal Tax Sales Act. In my
view, the starting point is the definitions of &#147;cancellation
price&#148; and &#147;tax arrears&#148; contained in s.1(1) of the Act. For
convenience, I reproduce the relevant portion of the definitions:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#147;cancellation price&#148; means an amount equal to all the tax
          arrears owing at any time in respect of land together with all
          current real property taxes owing, interest and penalties thereon
          and all reasonable costs incurred by the municipality, after the
          treasurer becomes entitled to register a tax arrears certificate
          under section 3, in proceeding under this Act or in contemplation
          of proceeding under this Act or in contemplation of proceeding
          under this Act and, without restricting the generality of the
          foregoing, may include&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                &#147;tax  arrears&#148; means any real  property
          taxes  placed  on or added to  a  collector&#146;s
          roll  that  remain unpaid on the 1st  day  of
          January  in the year following that in  which
          they  were  placed on or added to  the  roll;
          (&#147;arriérés d&#146;impôts). [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>It  is  significant  to note that &#147;tax arrears&#148;  do  not  include
interest and penalties statutorily imposed on taxes not paid when
due and payable. However, a component of the &#147;cancellation price&#148;
includes interest and penalties on tax arrears.</pre>
    <pre>[51]  It  can  be seen from its definition that the  cancellation
price contains four components:
          </pre>
    <pre>            (1)     all tax arrears (as defined by the Act) owing at any
          time,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  all current taxes owing,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (3)   interest  and  penalties  on  tax
          arrears and current taxes owing, and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (4)   all reasonable costs incurred  by
          the municipality.</pre>
    <pre>In  my  opinion, it is significant that in defining  cancellation
price  the  legislature has treated taxes, interest and penalties
as  discrete  components, thereby reflecting the  scheme  of  the
Municipal Act which similarly treats them as discrete items.</pre>
    <pre>[52] In paragraph [6], I have set out the relevant portion of the
reasons  of  Kozak J. I am unable to agree with him that  it  was
unnecessary  to  determine whether the  legislation  and  by-laws
constitute   a   complete  statutory  code  which   governs   the
calculation  of  the  cancellation price.  In  my  view,  it  was
necessary for him to make the determination. Nor do I agree  with
him that the Assessment Act and the Municipal Act &#147;are silent  on
the subject of interest&#148;. Certainly the Municipal Act is not, nor
are  the  Municipal Tax Sales Act and the Municipal Interest  and
Discount Rates Act. As well, for reasons which I will develop,  I
do not agree the combination of s.37(6) of the Assessment Act and
s.390  of  the  Municipal Act render illegal  the  collection  of
interest on the amount of unpaid taxes consequent to the original
assessed  value of the respondent&#146;s land. I further do not  agree
that  there  is no statutory authority which allows the  City  to
collect  interest and penalties based on the taxes  unpaid  while
the  appeal process was pending and that the attempt of the  City
to collect them was &#147;illegal or ultra vires&#148;. In my view, neither
s.37(6)  of  the Assessment Act, nor s.390 of the Municipal  Act,
affect  the  definition of &#147;cancellation price&#148; in the  Municipal
Tax  Sales  Act.  Kozak  J. did not consider  the  definition  of
cancellation price.
[53] As well, I cannot agree with the conclusion of the motions
judge that to &#147;allow the City to collect interest on the original
amount [of taxes unpaid] would, in effect, entitle them to monies
over which they did not acquire a legal interest&#148;. The fact is
that the respondent paid no taxes. However, as the taxes were
made due and payable on specific dates by the governing statutory
code, the City acquired a &#147;legal interest&#148; in the taxes when they
were due. From those dates the City would have been in a position
to use the taxes for municipal purposes, or to invest them. As I
have noted, where there is a shortfall in anticipated tax
revenue, a municipality may be forced to borrow money to carry
out its programs. The position of Kozak J. ignores the other side
of the coin. As the respondent failed to pay its taxes, it
continued to have the use of monies to which the City was
statutorily entitled.
[54] I am also, with respect, unable to agree with the approach
taken by Carthy J.A. As I will explain, it is my opinion that
s.419(4) of the Municipal Act does not expand the meaning of
&#147;taxes levied and payable&#148; in s.37(6) of the Assessment Act to
include penalties and interest due on unpaid taxes. As well, it
is my view that s.37(6) of the Assessment Act has no application
to the circumstances of this appeal as the respondent failed to
pay its taxes when due, with the result that it was not entitled
to a refund of any overpayment resulting from the reduction of
the assessment by the OMB.
[55] In my view, central to the resolution of the appeal is the
interplay of ss.37(3) and (6) of the Assessment Act, s.6(1) of
the Municipal Interest and Discount Rates Act, ss.390 and
419(1)(4) of the Municipal Act and the definitions of
&#147;cancellation price&#148; and &#147;tax arrears&#148; in s.1(1) of the Municipal
Tax Sales Act.
[56] Section 37 of the Assessment Act is concerned with the last
revised assessment roll. Subsection 37(6) is directed to the levy
of taxes and addresses the outcome of an assessment appeal, by an
owner or the municipality, which results in the reduction or
increase of an assessment. As such, it serves three purposes. The
first is the alteration of the assessment roll to conform with
the result of an appeal. The second is to adjust &#147;the taxes
levied and payable&#148; in accordance with the alteration of the
assessment roll. The third is to require a municipality to refund
any overpayment of taxes resulting from the alteration of the
assessment and, as such, clearly contemplates that a taxpayer
will have paid its taxes when due and payable. Indeed, further to
what I have said earlier, there would be no need to provide for
the refund of overpaid taxes if the statutory scheme did not
require that taxes be paid when due.
[57] It is also important to recognize what s.37(6) does not
concern. It is not concerned with, nor does it speak to, the
refund of interest or penalties which may have been paid on taxes
in arrears:  cf. Toronto College Street v. City of Toronto
(1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 742 (High Ct.). Nor does it affect the
definition of &#147;cancellation price&#148; in the Municipal Tax Sales
Act.
[58] Section 390 of the Municipal Act is directory and is
complementary, inter alia, to s.37(6) of the Assessment Act. It
has application when there has been an alteration of the
assessment roll under the Assessment Act and directs the
municipal clerk to make a corresponding alteration to the
collector&#146;s roll. Section 37(6) of the Assessment Act is but one
of several sections in that Act which provide for the alteration
of the assessment roll. Section 390 of the Municipal Act goes on
to provide that consequent to the altered collector&#146;s role,
&#147;taxes shall be collectable in accordance with such corrected
rolls in the same manner and with the like remedies as if they
had been in the [collector&#146;s] rolls when first prepared&#148;. While
this may mean that insofar as unpaid taxes are concerned the
amount, for collection purposes, is reduced to conform with the
alteration to the collector&#146;s roll, s.390 does not speak to
interest or penalties in respect to unpaid taxes.
[59] Section 419(1) of the Municipal Act, which mandates that a
municipality shall add interest to the amount of all taxes due
and unpaid, must be considered together with ss. 399(1) and (3)
which provide for the imposition of a penalty for the non-payment
of taxes.
[60] This brings me to consider s.419(4) and its relationship to
s.37(6) of the Assessment Act. Section 419(4) states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Interest and percentages added to taxes form part of such
          taxes and shall be collected as taxes.</pre>
    <pre>I  read  s.419(4) as providing a municipality with the  power  to
collect  unpaid  interest and penalties. By adding  interest  and
penalties  to  taxes, a municipality is provided  with  the  same
remedies  contained in the Municipal Act for  the  collection  of
unpaid interest and penalties as are provided by the Act for  the
collection  of unpaid taxes. In my view, this is the  purpose  of
s.419(4).  Without  s.419(4), there is no provision  in  the  Act
which provides a remedy for the collection of unpaid interest and
penalties:  cf. Pipestone v. Hunter (1916), 28 D.L.R.  776  (Man.
K.B.).  This  is in contrast with the definition of &#147;cancellation
price&#148;  in  s.1(1)  of  the Municipal Tax  Sales  Act.  That  Act
provides  expressly  for the collection of  unpaid  interest  and
penalties  through the mechanism of a tax sale. See, also,  s.412
of  the  Municipal Act which draws a distinction between interest
and  percentages,  and  taxes, by  making  provision  for  how  a
municipality is required to allocate monies collected for arrears
of taxes.</pre>
    <pre>[61] As such, s.419(4) of the Municipal Act has no application to
the  adjustment  of  &#147;the taxes levied and  payable&#148;  within  the
meaning of s.37(6) of the Assessment Act. Similarly, interest and
penalties  do  not  form part of &#147;the rate of taxation&#133;fixed  and
levied  on  the assessment&#148; within the meaning of s.37(3).  These
subsections  must  be read together. The fact that  interest  and
penalties  form  part of municipal taxes under  s.419(4)  of  the
Municipal Act does not make interest and penalties &#147;taxes  levied
and  payable&#148; for the purposes of s.37(6) of the Assessment  Act.
It  follows,  in  my  view, that s.419(4)  cannot  serve  as  the
foundation  for the calculation of the cancellation  price  under
the Municipal Tax Sales Act.
[62] Section 6(1) of the Municipal Interest and Discount Rate Act
is also complementary to s.37(6) of the Assessment Act. It speaks
to interest payable to a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund of
overpaid taxes as provided by s.37(6). This makes perfectly good
sense. It provides fair treatment of a taxpayer who has been
successful in appealing his or her assessment and who has, as the
legislation requires, paid real property taxes based on the
original assessment. This was the focus of Zaidan.
[63] However, it is noteworthy that s.6(1) does not provide for a
refund of &#147;overpaid&#148; interest or penalties. Its purpose is to
compensate a taxpayer for the lost use of funds resulting from
the payment of taxes which have been reduced. Indeed, no
provision is found in the statutory code for the refund of
interest or penalties which a taxpayer may have paid through the
collection mechanism of the legislation in circumstances where
the tax on which they were calculated was in arrears, but is
later reduced. This can be contrasted with legislation, such as
s.23(2) of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-
11, as amended by S.C. 1991, c.24, s.7(2), which provides for the
remission of any tax or penalty paid where the collection of tax
or its enforcement was unreasonable or unjust.  In my view, the
absence of such provision makes commercial and fiscal sense. As I
have discussed, municipalities are dependent on the payment of
taxes to carry out their responsibilities to taxpayers, and
others, and the statutory scheme obliges taxpayers to pay taxes
when due, or suffer the consequences. Had the legislature
intended to permit taxpayers, pending the result of an assessment
appeal, to avoid their statutory obligation to pay taxes free
from the sanctions of interest and penalties &#150; not to mention tax
sales &#150; it would have said so.
[64] To this I would add that s.37(6) of the Assessment Act can
have no application to the circumstances of this appeal as it is
premised on the statutory obligation of a taxpayer to pay taxes
when due and payable. The respondent paid absolutely no taxes
during the appeal period. For this reason, as well, s.37(6)
cannot serve as the foundation for the calculation of the
cancellation price. I am satisfied that the respondent knew
exactly what it was doing when it elected to pay no taxes. It
knew it was required to pay taxes when due, or suffer the
consequences. Furthermore, it failed to pay the accumulated
interest and penalties. It now seeks to receive a bonus for
flouting the law by being relieved of its statutory obligation to
pay the full amount of the interest and penalties lawfully added
to its tax bill.
[65] Furthermore, the explicit statutory authority to refund tax
overpayments and to permit municipalities to pass by-laws for the
payment of interest on overpayments indicates that the
legislature has considered whether, in the calculation of the
cancellation price, the amount of unpaid interest and penalties
is to be based on the original assessment, or the reduced
assessment, and that it has determined that they are to be
calculated on the basis of the original assessment. The position
which the respondent submits should govern the calculation cannot
be inferred or implied in the absence of explicit statutory
authority. As this court stated in Windsor Roman Catholic
Separate School Bd. v. Windsor (City) (1988), 37 M.P.L.R. 70 at
80, it &#147;would require the clearest possible direction in the
statutes&#148; to justify the position taken by the respondent.
[66] In my view, the following comments of Austin J.A., on behalf
of this court in Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph of Cornwall
v. Ontario (Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region 1) (1998),
168 D.L.R. (4th) 148 at 152, which considered issues similar to
those in Zaidan, apply to this appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The taxpayer&#146;s real complaint here is with the process of
          the Assessment Act which requires the taxpayer to pay the amount
          assessed, whether or not the assessment is under appeal. The
          process also requires the taxpayer to wait until all appeals are
          complete before any refund is payable. Section 37(6). The process
          requires the taxpayer to pay in advance whether he or she is
          right or wrong. To avoid what the taxpayer sees as an injustice,
          the process could be changed so as to require either no payment
          or payment of only the amount both sides agree to be appropriate,
          pending resolution of the dispute. While the individual taxpayer
          would undoubtedly regard such a change as rendering the process
          fairer, it takes little imagination to foresee the accounting
          chaos which might take place in such an event.</pre>
    <pre>[67]  The  following  observation  of  Major  J.  in  Zeitel   v.
Ellscheid, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 142 at 152, in which the Supreme Court
considered  the  Municipal Sales Tax Act, also  applies  to  this
appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Recognition of the proper roles of the legislature and the
          judiciary requires that the courts give effect to the plain
          meaning of the words of a duly enacted statute. It is beyond the
          power of a court to interfere in a carefully crafted legislative
          scheme merely because it does not approve of the result produced
          by a statute in a particular case. See, e.g., Elmer A. Driedger,
          Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p.86.

</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[68] The statutory code that applies to the circumstances of this
appeal requires the payment of real property taxes when due,  and
provides  for  reimbursement by the City of  the  overpayment  of
taxes, with interest, should the taxpayer successfully appeal the
assessment  of  its  lands.  This is  the  protection  which  the
statutory code provides when a taxpayer successfully appeals  the
assessed value of its property on which real property taxes  have
been levied and paid.
[69] As for interest and penalties imposed by the statutory code
for the failure to pay taxes when due, it does not provide for a
rebate of interest and penalties that may have been paid on taxes
overdue and unpaid, nor for the recalculation of unpaid interest
and penalties, when the assessment has been reduced as the result
of a successful appeal. This should not be surprising given the
rationale for the imposition of interest and penalties as a
result of a taxpayer&#146;s failure to comply with its statutory
obligation to pay its taxes when they are due and payable.
[70] It follows, therefore, from the statutory code, in
particular, the clear definition of cancellation price in the
Municipal Tax Sales Act, and the policy underlying the imposition
of interest and penalties on unpaid taxes, that the position of
the appellant must prevail.
[71] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order
of Kozak J., and order that the proper amount of the cancellation
price to be paid by the respondent is $667,050.63. The appellant
will have its costs of the application and the appeal.
