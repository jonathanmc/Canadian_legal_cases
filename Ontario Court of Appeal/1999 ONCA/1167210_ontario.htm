    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice P. A. Grossi dated
August 12, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is from a judgment of Grossi J. granted on an
application to determine the rights of the parties under an
Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Grossi J. declared the appellant
purchaser in breach of the agreement, the agreement terminated
and the deposit forfeited.  Costs were ordered against the
appellant and against its director, Martin Schmerz, personally.
[2]  The appellant argues firstly that the applications judge
misapprehended the evidence and failed to consider relevant
evidence in the determination of the application. Most of the
issues raised at the hearing and on appeal relate to the vendor&#146;s
obligation to produce documentation pursuant to the terms of the
agreement. The applications judge found that &#147;the documentation
issue is an effort by the purchaser to obfuscate the matter&#148;. In
our view, this finding is supported by the evidence. It was not
incumbent upon the applications judge to review in his reasons
all of the evidence that was before him. We see no basis to
conclude that he misapprehended the evidence or failed to
consider relevant evidence as contended. The applications judge&#146;s
conclusions on the documentation issue and on other relevant
issues are supported by the evidence and we see no reason to
interfere.
[3]  The appellant argues further that, given the number of
contested issues of fact and credibility, it was incumbent on the
applications judge to direct a trial of the issues rather than
determining the matter on an application. We are not persuaded
that the summary procedure of an application was unsuitable in
this case. The motions judge had all relevant material before him
and we do not see how a trial would further assist in the
resolution of the issues between the parties.
[4]  Finally, with respect to costs, we see no basis in the
evidence to justify an award of costs against the director and
officer of the appellant corporation. The applications judge gave
no reasons for this exceptional order. The appeal is allowed only
in this respect and the words &#147;and Martin Schmerz personally&#148; in
paragraph 5 of the judgment are deleted. The appeal is otherwise
dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
