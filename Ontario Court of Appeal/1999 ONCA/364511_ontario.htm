    <pre>On appeal from Webber J. dated February 9, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                                
BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The defendants appeal from a judgment at trial permitting
the plaintiff to recover its deposit on a conditional lease
transaction which failed.
[2]  The plaintiff (tenant) and Darena Holdings Limited
(landlord) entered into an agreement whereby the tenant would
occupy the landlord&#146;s arena to carry on a bingo business.
[3]  The agreement required the tenant to &#147;use its reasonable
commercial efforts to satisfy&#148; the condition that it receive &#147;all
necessary approvals and licences from the [city and province] to
legally operate a Bingo Hall&#148;.
[4]  We do not accept the landlord&#146;s argument that in order to
comply with the terms of the offer to lease the tenant was
required not only to apply to the city and to the province but to
pursue those applications to the granting or refusal of approval
by those bodies.  Nor do we find it necessary or useful to define
&#147;reasonable commercial efforts&#148; in terms of &#147;good faith&#148;, &#147;bona
fides&#148; or &#147;best efforts&#148;.
[5]  We agree with the trial judge that the tenant &#147;could not
deliberately prevent the occurrence of the condition&#148; nor could
it &#147;take advantage of its own wrongful act&#148;.  We do not agree
that &#147;this standard of reasonable commercial efforts would allow
[the tenant] if it had a doubt from the efforts made that no
approval would be granted, to be free to conclude its efforts&#148;
and on that basis to withdraw from the transaction.  A simple
doubt would not suffice; uncertainty that made it commercially
unreasonable to proceed was required.
[6]  The offer to lease provided that the tenant had 60 days
within which to get the necessary approvals.  At its option, the
landlord could extend that period by an additional 60 days.  It
was common ground that those time limitations were more or less
ignored and that both landlord and tenant were prepared to
proceed had the approvals become available later.  The evidence
supports the trial judge&#146;s findings that the tenant continued its
efforts beyond the 120 days.
[7]  The evidence also supports the tenant&#146;s conclusion that
municipal approval was not going to be forthcoming.  Mr. John
Johnstone&#146;s testimony, in particular, was to the effect that the
local residents were opposed, the local councillor was opposed
and the licencing department was not in favour.  In his words,
&#147;we were dead&#148;.  According to Mr. Johnstone, the landlord&#146;s agent
agreed that &#147;it did not look good&#148;.  The tenant asked for the
agent&#146;s assistance but nothing was forthcoming.  No timely
complaint was made by the landlord with regard to &#147;reasonable
commercial efforts&#148;.
[8]  In these circumstances, we see no basis for interfering with
the conclusion of the trial judge that the tenant complied with
the terms of its offer.  The landlord&#146;s appeal is therefore
dismissed with costs.
[9]  Judgement was also given against the defendants First
Professional Management Inc. (&#147;First&#148;) and Stephen-Mitchell
Realty Limited, carrying on business as Whitehorn Mississauga
Properties (&#147;Whitehorn&#148;).  First negotiated the lease as the
landlord&#146;s agent and provided a consultant to assist the tenant
in getting approvals.  Whitehorn was the real estate agency
involved.  The deposit cheque was made payable to it.  That money
was then transferred to the landlord.
[10] The trial judge found that the inclusion of these two
defendants neither complicated nor expanded the issues and that
they were necessary parties.  Accepting those findings, they do
not provide any basis for liability.  No other basis was
suggested.  The appeal with respect to First and Whitehorn must
therefore be allowed, the judgment against them below set aside
and the action dismissed as against them.
[11] No separate submissions were made respecting the costs of
First or Whitehorn at trial or on appeal.  They were not
separately represented.  Accordingly, no order regarding costs is
made with respect to them.
[12] The trial judge awarded the costs of the action to the
tenant on a party and party basis.  The tenant cross-appeals,
arguing that it made settlement offers that brought Rule 49.10
into play.  The tenant&#146;s claim in the action was for a liquidated
amount, namely, the amount of the deposit.  Its first offer of
settlement was for the full amount of the claim plus pre-judgment
interest.  The second offer added a claim for costs.
[13] The landlord counterclaimed for both liquidated and
unliquidated damages.  The liquidated amount was $474,800.38.
The landlord also made offers.  The first was for forfeiture of
the deposit, $50,000 on the counterclaim and interest.  The
second was for forfeiture of the deposit plus costs on a party
and party scale.
[14] After referring to the decision in Data General (Can.) Ltd.
v. Molnar Systems Group Inc. et al (1989), 32 C.P.C. (2d) 33
(H.C.); [1991] 6 O.R. (3d) 409 (C.A.) and Vaughan (Town) v. Alta
Surety Co. [1997] O.J. No. 1353 (C.A.),  the trial judge awarded
only party and party costs.  He gave his reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the case at bar, the major issue was the interpretation
          of the words &#147;reasonable commercial efforts&#148;.  As is apparent
          from my reasons, the interpretation favourable to the plaintiff
          was reached after considered deliberation as to the facts and
          their impact on the words in issue.  The plaintiff knew full well
          what the debate would involve and yet made no offer that could be
          considered a compromise from its full claim.  This stance does
          not reflect the purpose of the rule.  The position of the Court
          of appeal is clear that a departure from the general rule may be
          made especially when the Court has the power to &#147;order
          otherwise&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Leave is granted to the tenant to appeal from the award of
party and party costs at trial but that appeal is dismissed.  In
Data General, supra, Morden A.C.J.O. speaking for the court said
at p.417:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Accordingly, as a matter of justice, there may be a role for
          an element of compromise in liquidated claim cases where the
          defendant has relied upon a defence of substance &#150; one that
          reasonably gave rise to uncertainty on the question of liability,
          thereby making some form of compromise a reasonable proposition.</pre>
    <pre>[16] At p.418, describing the case before him at trial, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The issue raised was complex and difficult &#150; reasonably
          giving rise to uncertainty as to the outcome.  In the particular
          circumstances of this case, which include the fact that Data
          General&#146;s claim included no element of compromise, I think that
          the interests of justice justify a departure from the general
          rule.</pre>
    <pre>[17] In our view, the situation in the instant case reasonably
gave rise to uncertainty as to the outcome, thereby justifying
some element of compromise.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded
that the trial judge erred in exercising his discretion as he
did.
[18] To summarize, the judgment against First and Whitehorn is
set aside and the action dismissed as against them without costs.
The landlord&#146;s appeal to this court is dismissed with costs.
Leave is granted to the tenant to appeal the award of costs below
but that appeal is dismissed, without costs.
[19] This was not an easy case and we are grateful to counsel for
their excellent factums.
