</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a successful appeal by the appellants to this
court, the respondents were ordered to pay the appellants&#146; party-
and-party costs of the appeal.  The assessment of the appellants&#146;
costs took place on February 11, 1999. The appellants initially
sought to recover costs of $74,740.00.  The assessment hearing
lasted for the better part of a day and the officer assessed the
costs at $35,401.77.  The certificate of assessment was not
issued and was held back at the request of the respondents&#146;
counsel. Thereafter, the respondents delivered their notice of
objections and the appellants delivered their objections.  Each
side delivered replies to the objections.  After considering
these submissions the Assessment Hearing Officer further reduced
the costs to $29,412.21.  The appellants appeal that assessment.
The respondents cross-appeal and submit that the costs should be
further reduced.
[2]  The appellants raised three grounds of objection in their
appeal and the respondents raised two grounds of objection in
their cross-appeal.  The test to be followed by an appellate
court in reviewing the decision of an assessment officer is well
settled.  The court is only concerned with questions of
principle, and not mere questions of amount or the manner in
which the officer exercised his discretion, unless the amounts
are so inappropriate or the decision is so unreasonable as to
amount to an error in principle:  Eastwalsh Homes Ltd. v. Anatal
Development Corp. (1995), 80 O.A.C. 141 (C.A.).
[3]  Two of the objections raised by the appellants and both of
the matters raised in the cross-appeal do not raise questions of
principle.  The appellants complain about the hourly rates
allowed by the officer for the two senior counsel who worked on
the appeal.  There is no basis for interfering with the officer&#146;s
decision in this respect.  Similarly, there is no basis for
interfering with the officer&#146;s decision to reduce the hours for
Mr. D&#146;Oliveira.  The officer gave extensive reasons for his
decision in respect of both of these matters.  Those reasons are
fully supported by the record.
[4]  The first ground of the cross-appeal concerns the officer&#146;s
decision to allow 12.5 hours for Mr. Licandro.  The second ground
of the cross-appeal seeks a further reduction of the hours
allowed for Mr. D&#146;Oliveira.  Counsel was unable to point to any
error in principle in the officer&#146;s decision in either respect
and the cross-appeal is dismissed.
[5]  The only matter raised on appeal upon which I required
argument from the respondent was the decision of the officer to
reduce the preparation time allowed for Mr. Licandro.  Mr.
Licandro had initially claimed a total of 172.8 hours.  At the
assessment these were reduced to 57.3 hours.  Following the
objections, these were further reduced to 12.5 hours.  The
officer reduced the hours following objections because, in his
view, Mr. Licandro&#146;s retainment was &#147;a solicitor and client type
of luxury&#148; that was not absolutely necessary and reasonable.  He
held that Mr. Licandro was &#147;asked to draft opinion letters for
the client on the various potential issues for appeal&#148;, which was
not a service in preparation for the appeal.  In the result, the
officer reduced Mr. Licandro&#146;s time to eliminate work that had
not been of assistance in the ultimate resolution of the appeal.
The officer also took into account that Mr. Licandro did not
attend on the appeal.
[6]  In my view, the assessment officer misapprehended the nature
of the work performed by Mr. Licandro and accordingly erred in
principle.  Mr. Licandro&#146;s dockets refer to the preparation of
&#147;opinions&#148;.  However, the actual memoranda prepared by him were
filed at the hearing.  I have reviewed them.  They are clearly
memoranda of law intended to assist in the preparation of the
appeal.  The fact that Mr. Licandro was in another city or that
he did not attend the appeal were not grounds for disallowing the
work he performed to assist in the preparation of the factum and
the hearing of the appeal.  It is apparent from the dockets that
at least some of these opinions were shared with the clients and
to that extent they performed a dual function and the officer was
right not to allow any time for this aspect of the preparation.
[7]  In the circumstances of this case, the officer also erred in
principle in drawing an adverse inference from Mr. Licandro&#146;s
absence from the assessment, at least on the issue of the use of
the opinions/memoranda.  On that issue the important information
came from Mr. D&#146;Oliveira, whose submissions were uncontradicted.
[8]  Mr. D&#146;Oliveira fairly conceded that some of the work
performed by Mr. Licandro, especially the extensive time spent
reviewing the transcripts, did not fall within this category.  I
also accept Ms. Tourgis&#146; submission that there was some
duplication of effort between Mr. D&#146;Oliveira and Mr. Licandro.
[9]  I have reviewed Mr. Licandro&#146;s dockets and Mr. D&#146;Oliveira&#146;s
dockets to confirm the time actually spent by Mr. Licandro in
assisting in the preparation for the appeal.  I would allow the
appeal and increase the hours allowed for Mr. Licandro by 40
hours to 52.5 @ $140.00.  I assume that the parties will be able
to agree on the proper amount of the assessment in light of this
order.  If there are any difficulties I may be spoken to.  In all
other respects the appeal and the cross-appeal are dismissed.
[10] The appellants shall have their costs of the appeal fixed at
$1,500.  There will be no costs of the cross-appeal.  I would not
interfere with the cost award made by the assessment officer for
the costs of the assessment.</pre></td>
