</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice J. C. Kennedy dated
August 6, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre> BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On October 22, 1986 the appellant tenant and the respondent
landlord entered into an agreement to lease which contained the
following provisions:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The term of the lease shall be for a period of ten (10)
          years commencing January 1, 1987, or on the commencement date as
          hereinafter set forth in this lease.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The tenant shall have an additional
          five (5) year term on the same terms and
          conditions as set forth in this lease save
          and except for the rental which is to be
          negotiated between the Landlord and the
          Tenant. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Thereafter, the parties attempted to negotiate the terms of
a formal lease.  These negotiations were unsuccesful because of
the disagreement between them as to whether the final five years
of the fifteen year period constituted an extension of the lease
as the landlord contended or, as the tenant contended, an option
to the tenant to renew if it chose.
[3]  Ultimately the landlord applied for a declaration that the
term of the lease is for a period of fifteen years or, in the
alternative, an order rectifying the agreement of October 22,
1986 to provide that the lease is for a period of fifteen years.
[4]  The finding appealed from is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The term of the lease was for 15 years.  The rent for
          the last five years was to be the subject matter of negotiation,
          but implicit in this agreement was the term that the parties
          would negotiate the rent in good faith and under no circumstances
          would the annual rent in the last five years be less than that in
          the previous year for the fixed portion.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The lease will be rectified
          accordingly.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The tenant appeals on the basis that Kennedy J. erred in
applying the doctrine of rectification to these facts and in
failing to find that the agreement between the parties was
fatally uncertain because an essential term of the lease, namely
the rent beyond the tenth year, was still to be negotiated.  The
latter argument is founded on Ossory Canada Inc. v. Wendy's
Restaurants of Canada Inc. (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 484 (Ont. C.A.).
[6]  In our view, the agreement to lease of October 22, 1986 is
sufficient to dispose of this appeal in favour of the respondent
landlord.
[7]  Paragraph 1 of that agreement, quoted above, is in clear
language.  It sets out that the lease has a term of ten years
followed by an additional five years.  The tenant does not have
an option to renew for these five years.  It has an additional
term of five years.
[8]  Moreover, the agreement does not leave at large the rent for
this five-year additional term.  Paragraph 2 of that agreement
provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The fixed minimum annual rent payable during the term
          of this lease shall be:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The amount of Twenty-Two Dollars
          ($22.00) per square foot of the building to
          be constructed on the premises which said
          square footage shall be based upon
          measurements from the outside walls and which
          said rent shall be on a total net/net/net
          basis so that the lease shall be absolutely
          care-free to the Landlord and in this regard
          the tenant shall pay all liability insurance
          and fire insurance, all heat, all utilities,
          all business taxes, all maintenance and
          repairs, all garbage removal and its share of
          all municipal taxes.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    It is agreed that all such payments
          shall be in equal monthly instalments payable
          in advance on the first of each and every
          month.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The clear meaning of paragraphs 1 and 2 taken together is
that failing successful negotiations to fix a higher rent, the
rent for the additional five years is that set out in
paragraph 2.  Since there have been no such negotiations, the
rent for the final five years is fixed by paragraph 2.
[10] The agreement to lease, therefore, does not fail for
uncertainty.  It sets out the rent for the full fifteen years.
For the last five years the rent is that successfully negotiated
by the parties, failing which it is that fixed by paragraph 2.
[11] Given this conclusion, there is no need to apply the
doctrine of rectification.
[12] In practical terms, we reach the same result as did the
application judge but by following a somewhat different route.
Paragraph 3 of the judgment below is therefore amended to provide
that the term of the lease is for fifteen years and the rent for
the last five years is to be as specified in paragraph 2 of the
agreement of October 22, 1986.  The appeal is otherwise dismissed
with costs.
