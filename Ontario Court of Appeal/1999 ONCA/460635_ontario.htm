    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice W. Somers dated
February 4, 1998</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal from the judgment of Somers J.  allowing
damages to the respondents against the appellants.
[2]  The actions referred to in the style of cause were based on
a lease agreement and the purchase and sale of certain business
assets between 460635 Ontario Inc. (460) and 1002953 Ontario Inc.
(100).  As a result of alleged breaches of the lease and the
transfer of the assets, actions for damages were commenced by
both sides and the actions were consolidated and tried together.
The claims of 460 against 100 and Harry Kioussis were dismissed
and the claims of 100 and Harry Kioussis against 460 and John
Kallinikos were allowed.
[3]  The finding of the trial judge that 460 was liable for
damages to 100 is well founded in the evidence and we agree with
his analysis and conclusion.
[4]  The only real issue on this appeal is with respect to the
finding that the appellant Kallinikos, the sole shareholder and
director of 460, was personally liable for the damages awarded to
the respondents.
[5]  The trial judge&#146;s decision that Kallinikos was equally
liable with his company for the damages awarded to the
respondents was based, essentially, on his finding that the
appellant had wrongfully induced breaches of contract between his
company and 100.  Nowhere in their statement of claim do the
respondents seek damages from Kallinikos, in his personal
capacity, on the basis that he wrongfully induced breaches of
contract by the appellant 460.  (In fact, it is correctly
conceded that the trial judge was in error in finding personal
liability on the basis of inducing breaches of contract.  See
Said v. Butt, [1920] 3 K.B. 497.)  However, the respondents
maintain that there was nevertheless a proper basis for personal
liability although wrongfully labeled by the trial judge as
inducing breach of contract.
[6]  The only paragraphs of the statement of claim of the
respondents that are alleged to be capable of supporting the
respondents&#146; argument for a proper basis for the personal
liability of Kallinikos are the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>     (13) The plaintiffs state and it is a fact that subsequent
     to the completion of the aforementioned agreement of purchase and
     sale the plaintiffs discovered that the defendants had been
     responsible of the aforementioned misrepresentations by the
     defendants, such misrepresentations were either deliberate and/or
     negligent and/or innocent and in addition breached the
     aforementioned agreement of purchase and sale and lease, chattel
     mortgage, and the declarations and undertakings and warranties
     aforementioned the particulars of which are as follows...
     </pre>
    <pre>  (Note: 5 sub-paragraphs follow, in which all acts are stated in terms
  of &#145;the  defendants&#148; and  no  separate  account  of  the  appellant&#146;s 
  activities in his individual capacity is made or singled out).
     </pre>
    <pre>          
     (15) The plaintiffs state and it is a fact that they
     attempted through their solicitors to negotiate a settlement with
     respect to the outstanding differences between them and the
     defendants through the defendant solicitors in February of 1993,
     and notwithstanding the aforementioned right of set off with
     respect to the payment of rent and chattel mortgage payments
     notwithstanding the plaintiffs agreement to provide to their
     solicitors the rent due and owing for February of 1993 in their
     solicitors&#146; trust account pending such negotiations, the
     defendants without any prior notice and without any knowledge or
     consent by the plaintiffs whatsoever retained the  services of
     the bailiff and instructed the said bailiff to attend at 635
     Danforth Avenue on the 15th day of February, 1993 during the
     night time and changed the locks of the said lands and premises
     and retained  in the said lands and premises all of the chattels,
     fixtures, and equipment purchased by the plaintiffs pursuant to
     the aforementioned agreement of purchase and sale together with
     other chattels, fixtures, and equipment that belonged to the
     plaintiffs and prevented the plaintiffs from gaining access to
     the said lands and premises</pre>
    <pre>          
     (17) The plaintiffs state and it is a fact that the
     defendants by their conduct in terminating the aforementioned
     lease as aforementioned have committed a trespass, have derogated
     from the plaintiffs rights with respect the lease, have converted
     to their own use the chattels, fixtures, and equipment belonging
     to the plaintiffs, and in general are in breach of the agreement
     of purchase and sale, and chattel mortgage, and lease, and
     breached their undertakings and warranties and declarations
     aforementioned.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The personal liability of directors, officers and employees
has   recently  been  extensively  reviewed  by  this  court   in
ScotiaMcLeod v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd. (1995), 26 O.R. (3d)  481,
and Agda Systems International Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd, et al. (1999),
43  O.R.  (3d)  101.   In Agda, Carthy J.A. (at  p.112)  accepted
Finlayson  J.A.&#146;s reasoning in ScotiaMcLeod (at p. 491)  that  in
&#147;those cases in which the corporate veil has been pierced  &#133;  the
facts   giving  rise  to  personal  liability  were  specifically
pleaded&#148;.   Carthy  J.A. then concluded (at  p.113)  that  &#147;where
properly  pleaded,  a  claim  may be asserted  for  the  tortious
conduct  of  individuals  where  the  defence  in  Said  v.  Butt
[inducing breach of contract] is not available&#148;.   See also Craik
v.  Aetna  Life  Insurance Co. of Canada, [1996] O.J.  No.  2377,
where  this court affirmed Cummings J.&#146;s decision striking out  a
claim against employees because while the pleadings asserted that
the  corporation acted tortiously, they did not assert  that  the
employees  acted  in  any  personal capacity.   All  these  cases
emphasized the importance of a proper pleading.
[8]  In the present case, it is not clear on the face of the
statement of claim that  Kallinikos was being sued in his
personal capacity.  The allegations are general in nature: they
are against &#147;the defendants&#148; (i.e. 460 and John Kallinikos).  The
pleadings did not allege any negligence against Kallinikos
personally.  Where the pleading asserted that the defendants
acted tortiously, they did not assert that Kallinikos acted in
his personal capacity.  No attempt was made in the pleadings to
single out Kallinikos&#146; activity as an individual.  Pleadings of
such a general nature cannot properly serve as the basis for an
independent claim against Kallinikos in his personal capacity.
In my view, &#145;properly pleaded&#146; as it relates to personal
liability of corporate directors, officers and employees must be
read as &#145;specifically pleaded&#146;, a separate claim must be stated
against the individual in his personal capacity.
[9]  As correctly pointed out by counsel for the appellants, the
parties to a legal suit are entitled to have a resolution of
their differences on the basis of the issues joined in the
pleadings. A finding of liability and resulting damages against a
defendant on a basis that was not pleaded in the statement of
claim cannot stand.   It deprives the defendant of the
opportunity to address that issue in the evidence at trial.  See
Kalkinis (Litigation Guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance Co.
(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.).
[10] Furthermore, it is not clear from a review of counsel&#146;s
opening statement and from the examinations and cross-
examinations of Kallinikos and Kioussis that the respondents were
claiming against Kallinikos in his personal capacity.  I cannot
find any indication in the evidence where Kallinikos seemed to be
defending himself against a claim for personal tortious conduct.
Consequently, I have concluded that Kallinikos&#146; personal
liability was not a live issue at trial.
[11] In my view, the trial judge was in error in finding
Kallinikos personally liable for the damages awarded to the
respondents.
[12] The appeal is allowed in part.  The words &#147;defendants&#148; in
paragraphs 2,3 and 4 of the judgment are varied to read &#147;the
defendant 460635&#148;.  In his reasons, the trial judge had harsh
words for Kallinikos.  He found lack of good faith and dishonesty
on the part of  Kallinikos.  These findings are reasonable on the
basis of the evidence.  In light of this reprehensible conduct
and the divided success on the appeal, I would therefore make no
order with respect to the costs of the appeal.</pre>
