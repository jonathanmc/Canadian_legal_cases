[1]  The issue in this appeal is whether or not a sale by
the Business Development Bank of Canada was an improvident
one and, if so, the measure of damages including mental
distress and anguish caused to William Hutchinson, the
appellant.
[2]  At the heart of this appeal is the submission of the
appellant that the property was advertised with an incorrect
zoning designation, resulting in a less favourable sale
price than would otherwise have been possible.
[3]  The Business Development Bank was the mortgagee in
possession of the property from September 26, 1995 until the
sale date of the property, May 30, 1997.  During that time,
prior to sale of the property, the Business Development Bank
obtained two appraisals, one by J.D. Brighton Appraisals
Limited for $384,000.00, and the second by Appraisers
Network Inc. for $480,000.00.  The lower appraisal had the
correct zoning designation.  As a result of receiving these
appraisals, the bank entered into an MLS listing in October
1995 whereby the property was listed for $484,900.00.
[4]  There were no offers up to June 1996, during which time
the listing price was reduced eventually to $409,900.00.
Having received no offers, the bank then decided to sell the
property by public auction, but since the only offer to
purchase was in the amount of $100,000.00 that offer was
rejected.
[5]  The property was relisted in September 1996 with a
listing price of $389,900.00.  By the time that listing
expired in January 1997 no offer had been received.  The
listing was accordingly extended to April 10, 1997.  In
March 1997, an offer was received from a purchaser for
$250,000.00.  Because the bank considered this amount
unacceptable, negotiations took place with the bank
ultimately accepting an offer for $275,000.00.  Prior to the
closing of the transaction on May 30, 1997, the bank was
required to pay tax and hydro arrears in the amount of
$61,486.26.
[6]  There was no evidence put forward by the appellant as
to what the fair market value of the property was in 1997
when it was sold.  Nor was there any evidence before the
court that the price received would have been different had
the zoning designation on the listing been accurate.
[7]  While it is true that there was a brief reference in
the record to the possibility of some change in the market
value resulting from incorrect zoning information, and while
Mr.
Hutchinson in his argument made reference to the error in
the listing agreement, there was no reliable evidentiary
foundation for the trial judge to conclude that the sale was
improvident as a result of this error.  Indeed, in his
evidence at trial, Mr. Hutchinson did not claim that the
sale price obtained by the Bank was caused by incorrect
zoning information.  It is worth noting that the appraisal
which correctly identified the zoning was almost $100,000.00
lower than the appraisal which incorrectly referred to the
zoning.
[8]  We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion that the bank took every reasonable step to
realize a fair price for this property, and therefore would
not interfere with his conclusion that there was no
liability on the part of the bank to Mr. Hutchinson.
[9]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
