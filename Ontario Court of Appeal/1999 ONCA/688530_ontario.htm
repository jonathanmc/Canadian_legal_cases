    <pre>HEARD:         May 3, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from  the  judgments of Madam Justice  Epstein  dated
December  12, 1994, October 15, 1996, March 18, 1997 and  January
30, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>     The alleged non-disclosure of the landfill problem.
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In so far as the appellants&#146; arguments based on fraudulent
misrepresentation are concerned, there is no basis upon which we
can interfere with the trial judge&#146;s extensive and careful
findings of fact.  On these findings, the landfill constituted a
patent defect in that it was discernible by the exercise of
ordinary vigilance by a purchaser in the position of the
appellants.
[2]  Furthermore, on the findings of fact made by the trial
judge, there was no act of concealment by the respondents in
connection with the sale of the land.
[3]  Finally, on the facts, as found by the trial judge, the
conclusion that the appellants or its agents were aware of the
landfill problem prior to closing is irresistible and would,
standing alone, warrant the rejection of this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the land through the
1984 agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge found that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; To this end, the correspondence of the solicitor for the
          purchasers, including the fact that land transfer tax was only
          paid on 20 acres, assist in my conclusion that the subject of the
          1986 Agreement was ownership of 20 acres and an interest in the
          profits (if any) from the development of the remaining six.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We cannot agree with this interpretation of the transaction
entered into between the appellants and the Pirons.  When all of
the relevant documents are examined, and by that we mean the deed
referable to the 1986 agreement, the 1986 agreement of purchase
and sale, the vendor take back mortgage covering the entirety of
the property and, most importantly, the terms of the Document
General executed by the Pirons, we have no doubt but that the
appellants acquired a property interest in the land referred to
in the 1984 agreement.  The Document General said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               WHEREAS VALERIO PIRON and LIDIA PIRON hereby transfer all
          their rights, title and interest set out in the Notice of
          Agreement of Purchase and Sale, registered on the 4th day of
          June, 1985 as Instrument No. 370367 [the 1984 agreement] to
          688530 ONTARIO LIMITED.
          </pre>
    <pre>               SUBJECT to the right of VALERIO PIRON
          AND LIDIA PIRON to receive the proceeds of
          the Agreement made between VALERIO PIRON AND
          LIDIA PIRON and BURNT HILL DEVELOPMENTS LTD.
          registered on the 4th day of June, 1985 as
          Instrument No. 370367, namely in the sum of
          $325,000.00 less the usual adjustments.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Our view of the nature and effect of the 1984 and 1986
agreements is confirmed by the fact that if the 1986 agreement
had not given the appellants an interest in the entire 26 acres,
that agreement would have been in clear contravention of the
Planning Act.  It is difficult to accept that experienced real
estate lawyers who were clearly alive to this potential problem
would have so structured the transaction.
[7]  It follows from our interpretation of the 1986 agreement
that the purchase price paid by the appellants related to the
entire property interest acquired by them through that agreement.
Therefore, the argument made on the respondents&#146; cross-appeal
with respect to unjust enrichment (an argument raised for the
first time on appeal), must fail.
[8]  When the trial judge declared the 1984 agreement at an end,
a finding with which no one takes issue, it follows, given our
view of the 1986 agreement, that the appellants acquired
ownership of the entire 26 acres.  That ownership was, of course,
subject to the Pirons&#146; vendor take back mortgage over the entire
property.
[9]  With respect to costs at the trial, the appellants raised
the issue of the termination of the 1984 agreement and as it
turns out, should have been successful not only in obtaining a
declaration that the agreement was terminated, but also in
obtaining a declaration that they were the owners of the entire
26 acres subject to the mortgage.  As the appellants should have
been successful on both issues which related to this aspect of
the case, we see no reason to depart from the normal rule that a
successful party is entitled to its costs.  We cannot speculate
as to the practical value to the appellants of an order declaring
them to be owners of the entire 26 acres.  The entire acreage is,
of course, subject to the Pirons&#146; mortgage.  The appellants are
entitled to their costs on the question of whether the 1984
agreement had come to an end and the effect of its termination.
Those costs should be on a party-and-party basis assessable
against the Pirons&#146; and Hillfield as determined on the
assessment.
[10] In the result, the appeal will be allowed in part, the order
of Madam Justice Epstein should be varied to the extent necessary
to reflect these reasons.  We understand that counsel can agree
on the appropriate variation of the order.
[11] As success is divided on the appeal, there shall be no order
as to costs.
