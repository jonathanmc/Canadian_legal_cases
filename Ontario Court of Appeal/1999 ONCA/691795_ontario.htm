    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court dated 
October 3, 1995 (Hartt, Steele and Feldman JJ.)
</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O. and OSBORNE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent, Chapleau Forest Products Limited
(&#147;Chapleau&#148;), entered into two construction contracts with one or
more of the appellants (we will refer to the plaintiff companies
collectively as &#147;the appellants&#148;).  Pursuant to the two
contracts, the appellants were to construct two mills in Northern
Ontario for Chapleau.  The central issue at trial was the scope
of Chapleau&#146;s obligation under the contracts to pay for labour
that the appellant provided under the contracts.
[2]  The trial judge, DiSalle J., found that the contracts
required Chapleau to pay the appellants&#146; actual labour costs, not
their estimated labour costs, as set out in the tender documents.
He, therefore, dismissed the appellants&#146; claim for monies owing
under the contracts, including most significantly their claim for
labour costs based upon the labour rates set out in the tender
documents.  He gave judgment in Chapleau&#146;s favour for $343,714.60
and pre-judgment interest of $184,663.37 on Chapleau&#146;s counter-
claim.  He accepted Chapleau&#146;s contention that its obligation to
pay for labour associated with the two construction contracts was
limited to the appellants&#146; actual labour costs.  It was agreed
that if Chapleau were successful, it was entitled to payment on
its counterclaim for $343,714.60.
[3]  The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in
interpreting the two construction contracts as he did.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Although the appellants identify nine separate issues, we
think that some of those issues are related and collapse into
others with the result that there are three core issues:
     </pre>
    <pre>1. What documents constitute the construction contracts in issue?
2. What were the terms of the construction contracts, particularly
in respect of Chapleau&#146;s obligation to pay the
appellants&#146; labour costs?
3. Were all of the appellants parties to the two construction 
contracts and thus liable to Chapleau on its counterclaim?</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The other issues set out in the appellants&#146; factum are
subsidiary to the above issues and we will consider them when we
address the issues to which we have referred above.</pre>
    <pre>THE EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Herbert Cloutier is the president, a director and the
principal shareholder of the three appellant companies.  In 1988,
James Saunderson, the vice-president of Chapleau and Zoltan
Szucs, an engineer retained by Chapleau, approached Mr. Cloutier
to discuss two Chapleau expansion projects which consisted of a
planermill and a sawmill. The two projects involved the
installation of decking, flooring, structural steel as well as
the installation of equipment, offices and washrooms.
[7]  Cloutier testified that during his first meeting with
Saunderson and Szucs, Szucs asked about contracts on other
projects.  Cloutier explained that his workers were typically
paid hourly rates, plus some room and board.  Szucs responded
that Chapleau was interested in something quite different.  As
Cloutier put it, &#147;he mentioned he was looking for a fixed fee
plus an hourly rate contract.&#148; (121)  The purpose of this
exploratory meeting was to pre-qualify bidders for Chapleau&#146;s
planermill and sawmill projects.
[8]  Cloutier received an invitation to submit a tender on July
8, 1988.  On July 12, 1988, he received the package of tender
documents for the planermill contract from Chapleau. The tender
package included:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)       information to bidders
(b)       letter of understanding
(c)       instruction to bidders
(d)       tender form
(e)       scope of work
(f)       drawing list
(g)       general conditions
(h)       special conditions
(i)       agreement</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Cloutier completed and returned the tender documents to to
Chapleau on July 20, 1988.  He did so with the intention to be
bound by the contract that would be created by Chapleau&#146;s
acceptance of the tender.
[10] Chapleau issued a purchase order to Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop
on August 11, 1988. The purchase order was with respect to the
planermill project.  It referred to Cloutier&#146;s quoted labour
rates and to the $80,000 planermill fixed fee.  It concluded
&#147;Payment: in accordance with contract.&#148;
[11] In the course of preparing the tender, Cloutier prepared an
estimate sheet.  He stated at trial that the purpose of this was
to establish labour rates for the purpose of the tender.  He
said, &#147;[A]fter reviewing the Tender documents, and my
understanding of the discussions with Mr. Szucs, and
investigating the locality of the work, availability of men, I
started to establish rates that I could enter into the documents
where it said &#145;tendered rates&#146;.&#148; (135)  He went on to explain
that this contract was different from others since it was a fixed
fee plus tendered labour rates.  He used his working papers to
separate the lump sum from the labour and other rates he would
charge.
[12] Cloutier testified that the labour rates he listed were
simply &#147;estimated wages&#148; and that &#147;they were guesses at the time
as I had no way to establish the rates.&#148;  He admitted that he
expected that there would be a profit component in his tendered
labour rates.  However, he said that profit would accrue from the
tooling, travelling and amount of overtime worked.  In cross-
examination he agreed that when he listed the tendered labour
rates he understood that the rates were not to include his fixed
profit fee, which for the planermill contract was $80,000.
[13] After submitting the tender documents to Chapleau on July 28
or 29, 1988, Cloutier had another meeting with Saunderson and
Szucs.  He was told at that meeting that he had the planermill
job. Cloutier&#146;s version of what happened at the meeting with
Saunderson and Szucs changed between the time of his examination
for discovery and the trial.  On his examination for discovery he
testified that he had asked Saunderson and Szucs what he should
do in respect of paper work to justify the labour costs.  He said
Saunderson answered, &#147;We do nothing.  We pay you these rates and
not a penny more.&#148; (253)  However, at trial, Cloutier stated that
Szucs indicated that the tender documents, including the form of
agreement, would be set aside and that Chapleau would simply draw
up a purchase order.  He said that Szucs told him, &#147;Forget the
contract and we will give you a P.O.&#148; (253)  When he was pressed
on this and cross-examined on his discovery evidence, he
retreated somewhat and admitted that perhaps, &#147;Those exact words
were not said.&#148;  He did, however, continue to insist that the
purchase order constituted the contract to the exclusion of the
other documents that were part of the tender package.
[14] In the end, his position was that the agreement did not
provide for a cost plus a fixed fee, but rather provided for a
fixed fee and specified rates for labour, tools and equipment.
On the basis of that interpretation it was open to the appellants
to earn a substantial profit on the labour component of the deals
because the appellants paid their workers considerably less than
the labour rates set out in the tender form.  In its
counterclaim, Chapleau sought to recover this excess payment.
[15] Work began on the planermill project on August 15, 1988.
The form of agreement, which was part of the tender documents,
was never signed by either Chapleau or Cloutier.  Over the term
of the planermill project Cloutier submitted invoices for labour
every two weeks based on the rates set out in the tender form and
the hours worked in the invoice period.  Chapleau paid these
invoices as submitted.
[16] In September 1988, well before the planermill project was
finished, Cloutier completed and returned to Chapleau the tender
documents for the sawmill installation contract.  He bid on this
job because he was asked to. He was told that the sawmill project
would be three times the size of the planermill project.
Consistent with that he submitted a tender in which his fixed fee
was $250,000, that is approximately three times the size of the
amount of his planermill project fixed fee.  The sawmill fixed
fee was later increased to $259,000.  Chapleau never issued a
purchase order with respect to the sawmill project.
[17] In March, 1989, Chapleau discovered that Cloutier was paying
his workers significantly less than what Chapleau was paying
Cloutier for labour.  As a result, in May, 1989 Chapleau ceased
to make payments for labour and on June 30, 1989 it requested &#147;a
payroll audit&#148; of both the planermill and sawmill projects.  What
was in question was what the appellants had paid their workers
when compared to what the appellants had invoiced Chapleau for
labour.
[18] In a letter dated July 7, 1989, Cloutier&#146;s solicitors&#146;
stated that Cloutier would co-operate with the requested payroll
audit. Cloutier&#146;s solicitors did not assert that what was
actually paid to Cloutier&#146;s workers was of no significance in
light of what Cloutier later asserted was the agreement with
Chapleau on that issue.
[19] On August 7, 1989, Chapleau&#146;s auditors informed Chapleau
that the appellants&#146; actual labour costs were &#147;considerably less&#148;
than what Chapleau paid for labour  on the two construction
projects.
[20] On August 15, 1989, Chapleau&#146;s solicitors wrote to the
appellants&#146; solicitors and advised that,
          </pre>
    <pre>               The audit indicated that the hourly wages and benefits paid
          to employees were substantially less than the rates stated in the
          planermill installation contract and the sawmill installation
          contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A preliminary investigation based on
          amounts most favourable to your client
          indicates an overpayment of $576,611.84.</pre>
    <pre>[21] On August 21, 1989, Chapleau&#146;s solicitors advised that after
adjustments had been taken into account the overbilling by
Cloutier was $272,378.79.
[22] Cloutier&#146;s solicitors did not respond to the August
correspondence about the over-billing until September 26, 1989.
By that time Cloutier had new solicitors who advised that
Cloutier did not agree with Chapleau&#146;s version of the &#147;terms of
the agreement.&#148;
[23] In September 1989, the Cloutier group of companies filed
claims under the Construction Lien Act in which they claimed the
balance owing under the planermill and sawmill contracts as per
their invoices and payment for the supply of equipment.  In
response to the Construction Lien Act claims, Chapleau counter-
claimed for the excess labour payments it contended that it had
made in response to the appellants&#146; invoices.</pre>
    <pre>The Trial</pre>
    <pre>[24] Cloutier&#146;s evidence is difficult to follow.  In his
examination-in-chief, he took the position that he intended to be
bound by the tender documents and that, in accordance with the
tender package, he was entitled to the profit margin which
accrued from his quoted labour rates and, of course, from the two
fixed fees ($80,000 and $259,000).  In cross-examination,
Cloutier&#146;s position changed somewhat.  He then took the position,
when confronted with the provisions of the Tender Form and the
Agreement, that the purchase order replaced all the tender
documents.  In taking that position, he asserted that there was
no contract, only a purchase order, in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  Because it&#146;s never been your position that you didn&#146;t
          have a contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  It&#146;s been my position since Day One.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  That you didn&#146;t have a contract?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  We have your evidence on the record
          and I&#146;m not going to go over all of that
          again.  You said to the contrary, Mr.
          Cloutier.  You agree with me you said to the
          contrary in this very Court, that is you do
          have a contract?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  We have a purchase order is what I
          said.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And a purchase order, in your view,
          is a contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  It&#146;s a purchase order.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  Is it a contract?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  It&#146;s an order to perform the work at
          whatever it says on the purchase order.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And Chapleau was binding itself to
          pay you money for services that you were
          rendering.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  Yes, sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And you don&#146;t think that&#146;s a
          contract?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  Maybe a form of contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And that you&#146;re asking this Court to
          accept that it should ignore all of the
          details of the contract because they can
          replaced by a purchase order which allows you
          to keep that profit margin of approximately
          90% of your costs.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  There is no contract.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Cloutier accepted that Article III of the agreement
obligated Chapleau to pay the appellants&#146; labour costs.  However,
in addition to his position that the purchase order replaced the
tender documents, he contended that he was not bound by the
agreement because it was not signed.
[26] In the end, Cloutier admitted that on his interpretation of
the planermill and sawmill deals he provided labour at a cost of
$1.4 million and for providing that labour earned a profit of
$1.25 million.
[27] The trial judge held that the tender documents, and the
purchase order in respect of the planermill contract, constituted
the contract.  He specifically rejected the submission and
Cloutier&#146;s evidence that the purchase order replaced the other
contract documentation.  In doing so he noted that no purchase
order was issued with respect to the sawmill project.  He found
that Cloutier&#146;s evidence was evasive and contradictory.
[28] During the trial Cloutier testified about statements made by
Saunderson and Szucs, Chapleau&#146;s vice-president and the engineer
it retained for the two construction projects.  The trial judge
heard all of this evidence subject to Chapleau&#146;s objection.  In
his reasons, he held that this evidence was not admissible as it
was unreliable and self-serving.  He also held that the
statements were inadmissible as parol evidence since the evidence
was intended to vary a contract which the trial judge found was
clear and unambiguous.  The trial judge put it in this way:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that the words in the written contracts are clear and
          unambiguous and that the words, given their plain and ordinary
          meaning, are not susceptible of more than one meaning.  The
          contract clearly provides for the owner to pay the contractor&#146;s
          labour and subsistence costs, as well as a fixed fee representing
          the contractor&#146;s overhead and profit.  The purchase order only
          confirmed the rate of pay for the labour costs as established by
          the contractor in order for the owner to make periodic payments
          for those costs.  The contractor made a profit by paying less to
          the men for their wages and benefits and subsistence costs,
          without telling the owner.  The contractor, Mr. Cloutier, had his
          profit in the fixed fee and wasn&#146;t entitled to more profit.  He
          submitted to an audit and it was found he was overpaid.
          </pre>
    <pre>               This figure has been agreed to at
          $343,714.60 which includes all three of the
          plaintiff&#146;s companies.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Having determined that the plain meaning of the two
agreements entitled the appellants to two fixed fees ($80,000 and
$259,000) and their labour costs, the trial judge gave judgment
in Chapleau&#146;s favour on the counter-claim in the agreed sum of
$347,714.60.</pre>
    <pre>The Divisional Court</pre>
    <pre>[30] Cloutier&#146;s appeal to the Divisional Court was dismissed.1
The Divisional Court accepted that the &#147;bundle of contract
documents&#148; (the tender documents) constituted the contract.  The
majority (Steele and Hartt JJ.) held that even though the
agreement form contained in the tender documents was not signed,
the tender was signed and acted upon and the agreement provided
that in the event of a conflict the terms of the agreement
prevailed. Steele J. concluded that the contract could not be
viewed as ambiguous unless Cloutier&#146;s evidence was believed, and
it was not.  Steele J. found that the contracts were clear that
Cloutier&#146;s entitlement to be paid for labour was limited by the
contracts to his labour costs.  Steele J. also concluded that
even if the trial judge was wrong in holding that Cloutier&#146;s
evidence about statements made by Saunderson and Szucs was
inadmissible as hearsay, the error would not have affected the
result.
[31] In her dissent, Feldman J., in a somewhat qualified way,
accepted that the tender documents constituted the two
agreements.  That is to say she did not accept Cloutier&#146;s
position that the purchase order replaced the tender documents.2
Although she accepted the trial judge&#146;s finding that the tender
documents constituted the agreements, she went on to find that
the intention of the parties was &#147;reflected in the purchase
order.&#148; She concluded that the contract was not clear and
unambiguous in the context of what was meant by the word &#147;costs&#148;
in the Form of Agreement.   Feldman J. did not refer to the
reference to &#147;wages&#148; in the Tender Form which excludes overhead
and profit from labour costs.  The reference to labour &#147;costs&#148; in
the tender form is found in paragraph 10 which provides that
wages and other regulated costs are &#147;exclusive of &#133; contractor
overhead and profit.&#148;
[32] Feldman J. also found that the trial judge erred in ruling
that the statements of Saunderson and Szucs were inadmissible as
hearsay or as evidence that would alter, vary or amend the
written contracts.  She did not comment on the import of this
evidence, all of which came from Cloutier, we assume because of
her conclusion on the interpretation of the contracts.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[33] The intention of the parties must be determined on the basis
of the language they chose to use in their written agreement,
having regard to the purpose of the agreements.  See Friedman,
The Law of Contract in Canada, 3rd ed., (1993) at pp. 467-469;
Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery
Insurance Co. (1980), 112 D.L.R. (3d) 49 S.C.C.
[34] In this case the contract as found by the trial judge and
the Divisional Court consists of the &#147;bundle of documents.&#148;  This
is a finding of fact, as is the finding rejecting Cloutier&#146;s
evidence that the purchase order replaced the agreement set out
in the tender documents.  Thus, we proceed on the basis that the
agreements consisted of the tender documents and that the
purchase order (referable only to the planermill project) did not
represent a new agreement as Cloutier alleged.
[35] The structure of the planermill and sawmill contracts is
similar.  Apart from the purchase order, which as we have said
Chapleau issued only in respect of the planermill contract, there
is no difference in substance between the planermill and sawmill
contractual arrangements.  It is clear that the parties intended
that Chapleau pay and the appellants receive a &#147;fixed fee&#148; for
each contract.  This fee covers overhead and profit on each
project.  The Tender Form sets out under the heading &#147;Schedule
Rates,&#148; labour rates and estimated hours for a superintendent,
general foreman, certified journeyman, helper/apprentice,
labourers and others.  As we have said, these rates were also set
out in the August 11, 1988 purchase order.
[36] One of the tender documents, the &#147;Form of Agreement,&#148;
provided that the contract documents were &#147;complimentary [sic]
and each shall be read in conjunction with the other documents to
explain each other and to make the whole consistent.&#148;  The form
of agreement also provided an order of precedence among the
tender documents.  The executed form of agreement is given
priority over all other tender documents.  The order of
precedence is as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.        Executed form of agreement
2.        Letter of Understanding
3.        Tender is accepted by the owner
4.        Special Conditions
5.        General Conditions
6.        Scope of Work
7.        Specifications
8.        Drawings
9.        Instructions to Bidders
10.       Information to Bidders</pre>
    <pre>[37] The significant provisions of the tender documents are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  Instructions to Bidders
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The Bidder shall ensure that the
          tender is based on and submitted in
          accordance with the terms and conditions
          specified in the Tender Documents.  Tenders

    <pre>               a.   The Owner will pay to the
          Contractor for and in respect of the Work and
          the Performance and observance by the
          Contractor of the provisions of this
          Contract, in lawful money of Canada, the
          Contractor&#146;s labour costs, &#133; [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[38] The trial judge and the Divisional Court found, we think
correctly, that the parties intended to be bound by the Form of
Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that it was not executed.
Thus, in our view, the fact that the Form of Agreement was not
executed in respect of either project, is of no significance.  In
any case, the appellants were required to execute the agreement
and for some reason did not do so.  We do not agree with the
dissenting judge in the Divisional Court that the fact that the
Form of Agreement was not signed provided some evidence of
ambiguity.  Nor do we agree that the word &#147;costs&#148; as found in the
tender documents is ambiguous.
[39] The tender documents provide for costs plus fixed fees.  In
both contracts, the appellants&#146; profit was in the fixed fees.
Cloutier knew going into both projects what the overhead and
profit component  for each of them was.  His profit on the
planermill was $80,000 and his profit on the sawmill project was
$259,000.  Labour was not intended to be a source of profit as is
evident from Article 10 of the Tender Form and Article III of the
Agreement.  This was what was understood by the appellants on the
plain meaning of the language used in the Tender Form and in the
agreement.  We see no ambiguity in the provisions of tender
documents.  Chapleau&#146;s obligation was to pay for labour in terms
of labour &#147;costs&#148;.  To remove any doubt about this the tender
form refers to &#147;wages and other regulated costs&#148; which are
described as  being &#147;exclusive of &#133; contractor overhead and
profit.&#148;  Chapleau&#146;s obligation to the appellants is clear, and
in the circumstances of the business arrangements between the
parties, makes sense. Furthermore, in his evidence, Cloutier
seems to have eventually accepted that the tender documents
entitled the appellants to labour costs only.  It was because of
that that he advanced the theory that the purchase order replaced
the tender documents.
[40] The Divisional Court&#146;s reading of the contract is consistent
with Cloutier&#146;s response to Chapleau&#146;s request for an audit.  The
request for an audit clearly focused on wages &#147;payable by you
[Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop] to your employees.&#148;
[41] When the payroll audit was requested, Cloutier did not take
issue with Chapleau&#146;s entitlement to determine what the
appellants had paid its labour force. Cloutier did not respond to
Chapleau&#146;s solicitor&#146;s correspondence about the overpayment by
asserting the position that he took at trial.  Nor did Cloutier
take the position, with respect to the contracts, on which he now
relies.
[42] When Cloutier discussed the planermill project with
Saunderson and Szucs, he had just completed a project in
Englehart, Ontario.  On that project, consistent with the
agreement with the owner, he charged the owner a flat, stipulated
rate for labour.  Cloutier acknowledged that the labour related
charges included overhead and profit.  Cloutier testified that
Saunderson and Szucs made it clear that the contract he had in
mind (for the planermill) was different.  Cloutier said that he
had not worked on a fixed fee contract before.  On the subject of
what Szucs (Chapleau) wanted, Cloutier testified:
          </pre>
    <pre>               He then had a comment about the Chapleau contract [the
          planermill contract].  He said he was looking for something
          different than what I had just mentioned.  He mentioned he was
          looking for a fixed fee plus hourly rated contract.</pre>
    <pre>[43] On the appellants&#146; interpretation of the contracts, an
interpretation that does not coincide with Cloutier&#146;s position at
trial, the appellants&#146; contract with Chapleau was similar to the
Englehart contract in the sense that both agreements entitled
Cloutier to derive a profit from the labour provided.  On this
approch, Cloutier got it both ways on the planermill and sawmill
deals &#150; like the Engleheart deal, he derived a profit from the
labour he supplied and unlike the Englehart deal he received a
fixed fee on both Chapleau projects.  In our view, such an
arrangement is not consistent with Cloutier&#146;s evidence as it
related to the deal which Saunderson and Szucs put to him.  This
version of the contract makes no business sense.  On this latter
point, Feldman J., in her dissent, recognized the enormity of the
appellants&#146; double profit (the fixed fees and the significant
profit on the labour provided), but she observed that &#147;this is
not an unjust enrichment claim but a contract claim.&#148;  We accept
that, however, the contracts in issue should, in our view, be
considered, not as pieces of paper that appeared from nowhere,
but, in a business or commercial context.  When that is done, the
plain meaning of the two agreements is clear.  Chapleau was
required to pay the appellants&#146; labour &#147;costs,&#148; not the labour
rates referred to in the tender and the purchase order.</pre>
    <pre>The Excluded Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[44] As I have already stated, Cloutier introduced statements
alleged by Saunderson and Szucs that establish that Chapleau
intended to add, vary or contradict the contract.
[45] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in his
evidentiary ruling which excluded Cloutier&#146;s evidence about these
alleged comments.  The trial judge excluded this evidence as
hearsay and also because it was evidence that varied written
contracts which the trial judge concluded were not ambiguous.
Although we agree with the trial judge that the contracts were
not ambiguous, we think the trial judge erred in rejecting
Cloutier&#146;s evidence about the statements.  However, in the
circumstances, the rejection of this evidence could not have
affected the result.
[46] The trial judge permitted Cloutier to testify about all of
his discussions with Saunderson and Szucs.  He did so because he
concluded, in response to an objection from Chapleau&#146;s counsel,
that he should hear the evidence and consider the objection
later.  Thus, all of the evidence in question was heard and, in
the circumstances, it is of no real significance, particularly in
light of the trial judge&#146;s finding that Cloutier was not a
credible witness.  We think the trial judge erred in rejecting
Cloutier&#146;s evidence about statements made by Saunderson and Szucs
because the evidence was hearsay.  Saunderson worked for Chapleau
and Szucs was an engineer retained by Chapleau for the planermill
and sawmill projects. Both spoke for Chapleau.  However, the
trial judge rejected Cloutier&#146;s evidence that Chapleau replaced
the tender documents with the planermill purchase order.  In the
circumstances, the rejection of this evidence, most of which was
inconsequential, could not have affected the result and does not
give rise to a miscarriage of justice. The appellants also read-
in evidence about those conversation from the examination for
discovery of Richard Smith, Chapleau&#146;s vice-president of finance.
In our opinion, there is no substance in this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Chapleau&#146;s Failure to Call Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[47] Cloutier submits that the trial judge ought to have drawn an
adverse inference from Chapleau&#146;s failure to call defence
evidence at trial.  All members of the Divisional Court rejected
this submission.  By the time of trial, Mr. Saunderson had died.
From a practical standpoint only Szucs, the engineer retained by
Chapleau, could have been called to rebut Cloutier&#146;s evidence
about what was said and done at meetings connected with Cloutier
tendering on the two contracts.  As we have observed, the
appellants read into the record extensive parts of Chapleau&#146;s
examination for discovery.   In this way, to a very significant
measure, Cloutier made Chapleau&#146;s case part of the record.  That,
and trial counsel&#146;s conclusion that Cloutier was not a credible
witness made the decision not to call defence evidence eminently
understandable.  The trial judge was not required to draw an
adverse inference from Chapleau&#146;s failure to call evidence, in
the circumstances of this case.</pre>
    <pre>Judgment Against All Defendants by Counterclaim</pre>
    <pre>[48] The appellants submit that judgment on the counterclaim
should not have been issued against all of the corporate
defendants by counterclaim. They contend that the trial judge and
all members of the Divisional Court erred because they did not
recognize that the corporate defendants by counterclaim were
separate entities.  We do not agree with this submission.
Chapleau forwarded its tender documents, the purchase order with
respect to the planermill project and all payments under the
contracts to Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop Limited.  Cloutier signed
the Tender Form under the name of CMS Mechanical. In particular,
invoices submitted by the appellant Northern Hydraulics described
Northern Hydraulics as a division of Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop
Limited. Chapleau received invoices from Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop
Limited or from divisions of that company.  Chapleau made all
payments under the contracts to Cloutier&#146;s Machine Shop Limited.
[49] Furthermore, it is significant that the planermill and
sawmill agreements were pleaded as if they were agreements
between Chapleau and what the Statement of Claim refers to as
&#147;The Cloutier Group.&#148;  It was the &#147;Cloutier Group&#148; that sought
damages under the two contracts.  In the circumstances, we think
that the Divisional Court was correct in rejecting Cloutier&#146;s
submissions on this issue and treating the appellant companies as
a single entity.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[50] For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
    <pre>     &#147;R. McMurtry C.J.O.&#148;         &#147;C.A. Osborne J.A.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>Released:  September 27, 1999</pre>
    <pre>ABELLA J.A. (Dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[51] I agree with Feldman J.&#146;s interpretation of the contract and
her reasons for that interpretation.
[52] The Tender Form states that &#147;payment for the work done will
be made at the tendered prices which shall be compensation in
full for the work done under the terms of the contract.&#148;  It also
contains a section called &#147;Estimate of Total Labour Costs&#148;, which
states, in part, &#147;The Tenderer shall provide a breakdown as per
the table below.  This breakdown constitutes the total labour
costs as it applies to these terms&#148; (emphasis added).  There
follows immediately a section called &#147;Schedule Rates&#148; containing
rates for various categories of employees, which &#147;shall form the
basis of payment for work carried out.&#148;
[53] Clearly, the  Tender Form equates the terms &#147;labour costs&#148;
with the tendered prices.  The term &#147;labour costs&#148; is mentioned
only once in the Form of Agreement.  In Article III, the Owner
agrees to pay &#147;the Contractor&#146;s labour costs.&#148; The reference to a
fixed fee and the requirement that estimates of labour costs
exclude profit, are not sufficient in my view to deprive &#147;labour
costs&#148; of their definition as the tendered rates.  There is in
fact nothing in the Form of Agreement that would lead to the
conclusion that &#147;labour costs&#148; should mean something different in
the Form of Agreement from what it means in the Form of Tender.
[54] The term &#147;actual labour costs&#148; appears nowhere in the
package of documents that has been held to constitute the
contract between the parties.  The language in the package of
documents should be read as written, and in accordance with the
usual commercial expectations and practice in tender processes.
[55] Under this contract, had the labour costs exceeded the
tendered rates, Cloutier as Contractor would not have been able
to claim any additional labour costs.  But neither can Chapleau
as Owner claim the right to claw back the difference between the
actual labour costs and the tendered rates without clear
contractual language.
[56] It was open to Chapleau to negotiate a contract which used
the words &#147;actual labour costs&#148;, but this was not done.  There is
no basis for reading the word &#147;actual&#148; into the contract.
[57] I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders in favour of
Chapleau, and grant judgment in favour of the appellants.
