    <pre>HEARD:   November 12, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of LaForme J. dated December 7, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, LaForme J. was correct in dismissing the claim
of the numbered corporation as set out in its original statement
of claim.  We see no basis of distinction between the present
case and 602533 Ontario Inc. v. Shell Canada Limited (1998),  37
O.R. (3d) 504 (C.A.). Assuming, without deciding, that special
circumstances, equitable principles, estoppel or waiver may save
a claim in these circumstances, notwithstanding the expiration of
a statutory period of limitation, we are not persuaded that the
circumstances in the present case engage such jurisdiction.
[2]  LaForme J. dismissed Berall&#146;s claim on the basis of a number
of findings of fact, particularly with respect to Berall&#146;s
intention.  In our view, it was not open to the motions judge to
make these findings on a motion under rule 21.01(1)(a).  The
pleading on its face disclosed a personal cause of action, and
LaForme J. erred in dismissing Berall&#146;s action.
[3]  We are further of the view that he also erred in dismissing
Berall&#146;s motion to amend his pleading pursuant to Rule 26 on the
basis that the defendants would thereby be deprived of a
limitation defence.  As we see it, the question of the
application of the Limitations Act to the proposed amendments
could not, and cannot, be determined on the basis of the material
before the court. It is a question that is not fully settled in
the law and, further, a question that may require findings of
fact that could not be made on this record: Boutin v. Co-
operators Life Insurance Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 612 (C.A.).
Berall should have been granted leave to amend his statement of
claim, subject to the right of the respondents to allege a
limitations defence in their pleading. Correspondingly, it
remains open to the numbered corporation, if revived, to
institute proceedings asserting similar claims, again subject to
the respondents&#146; right to raise the limitations issue.
[4]  The appeal of the numbered corporation is dismissed.
Berall&#146;s appeal is allowed in conformity with these reasons and
the order of LaForme J. is amended accordingly. Having regard to
the divided success, there will no order as to costs here or
before LaForme J.</pre>
