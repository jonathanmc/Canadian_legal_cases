    <pre>[1]  Although we would analyze this case a little differently
than the trial judge did, we agree with the result which she
reached.

[2]  Her fundamental finding is that the appellant is estopped
from taking the position that because of the forged postponement,
the respondent does not have a valid first mortgage in the
principal amount of $278,846.21.  We agree.

[3]  It may be that the silence of the appellant's principal,
Mr. Leibowitz, from March 1991 to the date of default could be
taken as the appellant's representation to the respondent that
there were no concerns about its first mortgage position.
However, since that silence was based on the advice (albeit
dishonestly given) which Mr. Leibowitz received from his lawyer
(whom he still trusted) that there was no problem, it is
difficult to ascribe a duty to the appellant which would
constitute its principal's silence as a representation.

[4]  Much more importantly, however, from the point of default in
September 1991 the appellant vigorously asserted its position as
second mortgagee, with Royal Trust being properly the first
mortgagee.

[5]  Indeed, on February 25, 1992, about a week before Royal
Trust signed the agreement to sell the property under power of
sale, the appellant was pressing the respondent to do so and
representing that the respondent's first mortgage would be paid
out in full on closing and in priority to the appellant's
mortgage.

[6]  The trial judge found that Royal Trust's inability to
consider a different response to the default, a different
response to the appellant's assertions concerning real estate
commission and fees, and a different response to this lawsuit are
sufficient detrimental reliance to complete the estoppel.

[7]  In our view, this finding was open to her on this record.
It is a conclusion based generally on the evidence.  Moreover, it
is a detrimental reliance which continued until the die was cast
on March 3, 1992.

[8]  Hence, we conclude that since the appellant represented that
the respondent had a valid first mortgage and since the
respondent detrimentally relied on this, the trial judge was
correct in finding that the appellant is estopped from asserting
priority for its mortgage because of the forged postponement.

[9]  The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
