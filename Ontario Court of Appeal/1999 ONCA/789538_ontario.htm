      <pre> Appeal from the judgment of Hawkins J. dated November 21, 1997
</pre>
      <pre>MOLDAVER J.A.:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  By judgment dated November 21, 1997, Hawkins J. ordered
Gambin Associates, G.C. Damiani and G.M. Della Rocca (the
“appellants”) and their co-defendants, 657936 Ontario Limited and
G. DaRe to pay damages to 789538 Ontario Limited (the
“respondent”) in the sum of $825,079.30 inclusive of pre-judgment
interest at a rate of 14%. In addition, the appellants were
ordered to pay the respondent the further sum of $208,916.08
inclusive of pre-judgment interest at the same rate. With respect
to the award of $825,079.30, Hawkins J. ordered that the
appellants and their co-defendants indemnify each other to the
extent of 50%.
[2]  The appellants appeal from that order and raise the
following two grounds of appeal:
          </pre>
      <pre>1.   the trial judge used the wrong method in assessing the
     respondent’s damages and in fixing the pre-judgment interest rate
     at 14%; and
2.   the trial judge erred in finding the appellants and
     their co-defendants jointly and severally liable for the sum of
     $825,079.30 and in apportioning liability, as between them, on an
     equal basis.</pre>
      <pre>BRIEF OVERVIEW OF FACTS</pre>
      <pre>[3]  On September 30, 1988, the respondent purchased a commercial
property located on Rexdale Boulevard in Toronto from 657936
Ontario Limited, the shares of which were owned by G. DaRe and
Philip Batista. The property was an income producing
commercial/industrial site consisting of three existing
buildings, A, B and C. According to the vendor and the vendor’s
real estate agent, the property had the capacity for three
additional buildings, D, E and F, one of which, namely F, had
been pre-rented.
[4]  Collectively, the appellants acted as the respondent’s
solicitor on the transaction. To their knowledge, the respondent
was purchasing the site as an income-producing property with the
intention of further development in accordance with the
representations made by the vendor.
[5]  The action resulting in the order under appeal arises from
the respondent’s inability to develop the property as planned due
to various impediments to title which the vendor knowingly failed
to disclose and which the appellants failed to discover as a
result of their negligence. The impediments to the property at
the time of closing were as follows:

(a)   existing building A was subject to a lease until
      February 28, 1990 (the Firestone Lease) that extended beyond the
      footprint of that building and prevented the development of
      proposed building F;
(b)   an adjoining landowner (Sico) enjoyed a permanent
      easement over a 4,356 square foot area which contained
      approximately 16 parking spaces and which rendered the proposed
      development of building D unfeasible; and
(c)   an existing hydro easement over a portion of the
      property that left the affected property unusable.</pre>
      <pre>[6]  For reasons which need not be detailed, construction of
building F was delayed until March 1989. It was then that the
respondent first learned of the existing Firestone Lease and the
impediment it posed to the construction of building F.
[7]  In October 1989, following successful negotiations with
Firestone, the respondent purchased the Firestone Lease for
$250,000. Some four months later, after an existing sublease had
expired, the respondent was finally in a position to re-commence
construction of building F.
[8]  The respondent pursued the possibility of constructing
buildings D and F simultaneously to take advantage of the
economies of scale and reduce building costs. To that end, it
obtained architectural drawings and building permits for both
buildings and retained a building contractor to cost out the
project. Ultimately, due to the combined effect of financial
constraints and the impediment imposed by the adjoining
landowner’s parking easement, the respondent abandoned its plans
to construct building D. Notably, as regards to the parking
easement, it was the respondent’s position, confirmed by the
vendor’s principal, Mr. DaRe, that if buildings D and F were
erected, there would be insufficient parking spaces to service
the needs of both buildings.</pre>
      <pre>APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF DAMAGES – POSITION OF THE PARTIES AT TRIAL</pre>
      <pre>[9]  In view of  the appellants’ admitted liability for
negligence, the trial judge was only called upon to quantify the
resulting damages to the respondent. Uncertain as to the method
the trial judge would use in assessing the appropriate measure of
damages, the respondent led evidence in support of two possible
scenarios.
[10] The first, known as the “diminution in value” approach,
quantified the damages as the difference between the price paid
by the respondent for the property and its true market value at
the time of purchase having regard to its deficiencies. On that
approach, the respondent estimated its damages at $445,000 plus
compensatory interest and out-of-pocket expenses.
[11] The second approach involved a quantification of the
economic losses suffered by the respondent as a result of the
appellant’s negligence. Factored into this approach were the
following items:

1.  the cost of acquiring the Firestone Lease;
2.  the value of the land encumbered by the parking and hydro easements;
3.  lost income from building F due to delayed construction;
4.  lost income due to the inability to construct building D; and
5.  out-of-pocket expenses.</pre>
      <pre>Using this approach, the respondent estimated its damages at
approximately $600,000 to $900,000 plus interest at the statutory
rate.</pre>
      <pre>[12] The appellants, on the other hand, relied exclusively on the
“economic loss” model and restricted their evidence to a
consideration of the damages flowing from the delayed
construction of building F, including the cost of acquiring the
Firestone Lease net of rental payments received by the respondent
from an existing sub-tenant and the value of the lands encumbered
by the hydro and parking easements. The appellants called no
evidence to contradict the respondent’s estimate of damages using
the “diminution in value” approach; nor did they lead evidence
with respect to the respondent’s estimated losses due to its
inability to construct building D.
[13] In the final analysis, it was the appellants’ position that
the respondent’s damages should be assessed at approximately
$220,000 plus interest at the statutory rate.</pre>
      <pre>METHOD USED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE</pre>
      <pre>[14] The trial judge opted for the “diminution in value” approach
to assess the respondent’s damages. His succinct reasons for
using that method are reproduced below:
          </pre>
      <pre>                    I find the instant case undistinguishable from Tilco v.
          Posesorski (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).
          </pre>
      <pre>                    In Tilco, the defendants bought
          property knowing it was subject to a lease in
          favour of Tilco but ignorant of the fact, due
          to the negligence of their solicitors, that
          the lease had an option for renewal. In an
          action by Tilco for a declaration as to the
          validity of the lease, the defendants joined
          their solicitor “S” as a third party. The
          majority of the court (Doherty and Laskin
          JJ.A.) followed the principles of Messineo v.
          Beale (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 49 (C.A.) which is
          that, when the solicitor is not guilty of
          causing the encumbrance or failing to get rid
          of it, but rather of failing to discover and
          report it to his client, thus denying the
          client the opportunity to avoid the deal or
          bargain down the price, the appropriate
          measure of damages consists of three elements
          namely:
          </pre>
      <pre>               (a)  the difference between the purchase
          price and the fair market value of the
          property with its deficiencies at the time of
          closing,
          </pre>
      <pre>               (b)  the loss of use of funds
          represented by the overpayment, and
          </pre>
      <pre>               (c)  reasonably foreseeable cost and
          expenses.
          </pre>
      <pre>                    In the judgment for the majority in
          Tilco, Doherty J.A. says, at p. 23, after
          citing a number of authorities:
               </pre>
      <pre>                    These cases, however, establish that the
               measure of damages used in Messineo is the
               appropriate one absent some basis in the
               evidence for holding some other means more
               effectively restores the wronged party to the
               position he or she would have been in but for
               the solicitor’s error.
               </pre>
      <pre>                    As predictability in the
               assessment of damages fosters early
               and fair settlement of claims, I
               see great value in promoting that
               certainty. The Messineo approach to
               damages has been widely accepted as
               a proper measure of damages in
               cases like this one and should be
               applied unless the party promoting
               a different approach can
               demonstrate that the alternative
               approach more effectively achieves
               the restitutionary goal underlying
               the law of damages.</pre>
      <pre>[15] As against the appellants, applying the “diminution in
value” approach, the trial judge assessed the respondent’s
damages at $414,000 plus pre-judgment interest in the sum of
$592,897.08 at the commercial rate of 14 per cent. To this, he
added various incidental expenses plus pre-judgment interest at a
rate of 10 per cent for a total award of $1,021,053.20. With
respect to the co-defendants, having concluded that they were not
responsible for the damages occasioned by the parking and hydro
easements, the trial judge assessed damages against them in the
total amount of $825,079.30.
[16] In relation to the award of $825,079.30, the trial judge
found that the appellants and their co-defendants were equally at
fault and he ordered that each indemnify the other to the extent
of 50 per cent.</pre>
      <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
      <pre>Issue 1 – Did the trial judge err in using the “diminution in
value” approach as the proper measure of the respondents’
damages?</pre>
      <pre>[17] In Tilco v. Posesorski (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 1, Doherty J.A.
for the majority held that in cases such as this, where the
solicitor’s negligence lies not in causing the impediment to
title or failing to remove it but in failing to discover and
report it to the client, thereby denying the client the
opportunity to avoid the transaction or reduce the purchase
price, damages should, as a general rule, be assessed in
accordance with the “diminution in value” model. Doherty J.A.
made it clear, however, that the  “diminution in value” approach
need not be followed if there is some basis in the evidence for
holding that a different approach would more effectively restore
the injured party to the position it would have been in but for
the solicitor’s error.
[18] The appellants submit that in this case, the economic loss
model proposed by them was a more effective means of restoring
the respondent to the position it would have been in had they
discharged their duty properly because unlike the “diminution in
value” approach, it represented the true losses suffered by the
respondent after it had mitigated its losses by buying out the
Firestone Lease. Expressed somewhat differently, the appellants
contend that the “diminution in value” approach used by the trial
judge ignores the fact that the respondent mitigated it losses
and resulted in a windfall to the respondent. With respect, I am
unable to give effect to the appellants’ submission.
[19] In my view, no adequate basis has been shown for departing
from the “diminution in value” approach directed by Tilco v.
Posesorski, supra. Without going into detail, suffice it to say
that based on the evidence, I am far from satisfied that the
economic loss model proposed by the appellants accurately
reflected the true losses sustained by the respondent. Indeed, if
anything, the preponderance of evidence would appear to favour
the much more substantial losses proposed by the respondent if
the economic loss model were to be followed.
[20] In the final analysis, far from being a more effective means
of measuring the respondent’s damages, the complexities and
uncertainties surrounding the economic loss approach rendered it
a poor substitute and the trial judge cannot be faulted for using
the “diminution in value” approach. In my view, that approach,
which included fixing pre-judgment interest at compensatory
rates, was the correct one.</pre>
      <pre>Issue 2 – Did the trial judge err in finding the appellants and
their co-defendants jointly and severally liable for the sum of
$825,079.30 and in apportioning liability as between them on a
equal basis?</pre>
      <pre>[21] The appellants submit, correctly in my view, that as between
the two sets of defendants, liability to the respondent for the
sum of $825,079.30 should have been several, not joint.1  The
appellants and their co-defendants were not acting in concert or
in furtherance of a common purpose and the causes of action
against them were separate and distinct. Whereas the appellants’
liability was founded in negligence, the liability of 657938
Ontario Limited and DaRe was founded on misrepresentations about
the state of the property which they knew or ought to have known
to be false and upon which the respondent relied in proceeding
with the transaction. As the appellants point out, had they not
been involved at all, the respondent would nonetheless have been
entitled to damages against the co-defendants in the sum of
$825,079.30.
[22] In these circumstances, I agree with the appellants that the
nature of their liability is secondary and once they make the
respondent whole, they should be entitled to an assignment of the
respondent’s judgment against the co-defendants. (See Reaney et
al. v. National Trust Co. et al. (1964), 1 O.R. (4th) 61 (Ont.
H.C.) and Wilson et al. v. Roswell, [1970] S.C.R. 865.)
Accordingly, an order will go varying paragraphs 1 and 5 of the
judgment in accordance with these reasons.</pre>
      <pre>CROSS-APPEAL</pre>
      <pre>[23] The respondent cross-appeals and raises one ground of
appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred in fixing the rate of
post-judgment interest at 10 per cent instead of 14 per cent.2
[24] In support of its position, the respondent submits that it
is implicit from this court’s decision in Tilco v. Posesorski,
supra, that plaintiffs who have been deprived of the use of funds
as a result of over-payment are entitled to a commercial rate of
interest thereon from the date of the over-payment until such
time as they again have use of the funds. According to the
respondent, no principled distinction can or should be drawn
between pre and post-judgment interest in these circumstances.
The injured party continues to suffer the same lost opportunity
to use the funds until such time as the judgment is satisfied and
post-judgment interest at the statutory rate does not achieve the
restitutionary goal underlying the law of damages.
[25] The trial judge refused to give effect to this argument. His
brief supplementary reasons, released April 5, 1993, are
reproduced below:
          </pre>
      <pre>                    The plaintiff’s argument that post-judgment interest
          should be awarded at the same “commercial” rate (in this case
          14%) as the interest on the diminution in value makes perfect
          sense logically, but the same could be said of all interest
          payable on pecuniary loss. Any rate of interest awarded on
          pecuniary loss at less than a realistic commercial rate is
          imperfect compensation. Nor is there any logical reason why post-
          judgment interest should be different from pre-judgment interest,
          in which case s. 129 of the Courts of Justice Act could have
          simply read “post-judgment interest shall be the same as pre-
          judgment interest unless otherwise ordered”.
          </pre>
      <pre>                    Post-judgment here is to be at the
          statutory rate. [10%]</pre>
      <pre>[26] In the final analysis, I am not persuaded that the trial
judge erred in the exercise of his discretion. Unlike Clairborne
Industries Ltd. v. National Bank of Canada (1989), 59 D.L.R.
(4th) 533 (Ont. C.A.), cited by the respondent, this is not a
case of moneys wrongfully detained or funds fraudulently or
negligently misappropriated. Moreover, as the trial judge
observed, carried to its logical conclusion, the respondent’s
argument would apply in every case involving pecuniary losses. No
authority was cited for such a proposition and I see no basis for
carving out an exception that would effectively fetter the wide
discretion afforded to trial judges under the existing statutory
regime.
[27] Apart from the legal implications of the respondent’s
argument, on a practical level, taking into account the interest
rates at the time of judgment, post-judgment interest at 10 per
cent is a generous rate of return on the moneys due and owing to
the respondent. Accordingly, I would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</pre>
      <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
      <pre>[28] In the result, the appeal is allowed in part with costs
payable to the respondent. The cross-appeal is dismissed with
costs.
