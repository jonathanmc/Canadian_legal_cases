COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>IN THE MATTER OF    An appeal from the Order of Mr. Justice
                    Wright made May 27, 1999 in the Superior Court of
                    Justice in action number 93-CQ-36678</pre>
    <pre>RE:            833809 ONTARIO LIMITED and OSVALDO CATALANO in
               trust (Plaintiffs/Respondents) and LOU PARSONS
               REALTY INC. and MICHAEL P. PARSONS
               (Defendants/Appellants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        AUSTIN, LASKIN AND MACPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Paul Godin, for the appellants</pre>
    <pre>               Stephen Werbowyj, for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Wright J. dated May 27, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants submit that the questions and answers (294 to
298)  during the discovery of Mr. Catalano constituted  a  formal
offer  and acceptance of a settlement and that the motions  judge
erred  in  not  finding  that there is  such  a  settlement.   We
disagree.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s position is belied by its own conduct
immediately after the above noted exchange.  First, Mr. Strung
did not tender the $10,000. He did not do what Mr. Catalano said
needed to be done in his final answer &#147; give it to me now and I
will leave&#148;.  Second, Mr. Strung continued with the discovery.
In fact, he asked Mr. Catalano sixty-five more questions.  This
is inconsistent with the existence of a settlement.  Indeed, the
inference is that Mr. Strung himself did not think there was a
settlement at that junction.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
