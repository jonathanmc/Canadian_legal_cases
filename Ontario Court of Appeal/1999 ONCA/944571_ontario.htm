</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issues in this appeal arise out of an aborted purchase
and sale of vacant real property in the town of Leamington. The
appellant 944755 Ontario Inc. (&#147;Ontario Inc.&#148;) appeals from the
order dismissing its action for damages for breach of an
agreement of purchase and sale. Initially, specific performance
was sought but this remedy was not pursued at trial.  Ontario
Inc. appeals the award to the respondent Matassa of $100 on its
counterclaim. By way of cross-appeal, Matassa asks that the trial
judge&#146;s order granting relief from forfeiture of the deposit of
$25,000 be set aside, and that the deposit be forfeited to
Matassa. Matassa also seeks leave to appeal costs.
[2]  Ontario Inc. submits the trial judge erred in law in
dismissing its claim. In order to succeed, Ontario Inc. had to
show that it was ready, willing and able to close the
transaction. The trial judge found that Ontario Inc. was ready
and willing to close. The trial judge did not make a specific
finding  that Ontario Inc. was &#147;able&#148; to close.  Ontario Inc.
submits that there was ample evidence on the record to allow the
court to infer that it was in fact able to close the transaction
on the basis of the original cash deal. Matassa says that Ontario
Inc. did not demonstrate that it had the ability to pay the
$200,000 required on closing. We have not been persuaded that the
trial judge committed any error by making no finding that Ontario
Inc. was able to close.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Ontario Inc. also submits that, although its tender was
defective, it was not obliged to tender due to the anticipatory
breach of Matassa. Assuming, without deciding, that there was an
anticipatory breach by Matassa, Ontario Inc. had to communicate
its acceptance of Matassa&#146;s repudiation of the contract and its
intention to sue for damages.  Here, Ontario Inc. did no such
thing.  Instead, Ontario Inc.&#146;s decision to tender and to sue for
specific performance are consistent with seeking to have Matassa
perform the contract.  In those circumstances, Ontario Inc. was
required to make a valid tender.  Because Ontario Inc.&#146;s tender
was defective, the trial judge was correct in concluding that
Ontario Inc. breached its contact.  The appeal is dismissed.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Dealing now with the cross-appeal, Matassa submits that it
was not open to the trial judge to grant relief from forfeiture
because the deposit was paid to guarantee performance and not
merely as part payment on account of the purchase price.  The
authorities relied on by Matassa in support of his position deal
with the situation where only one party is at fault. Where, as
here, there is fault on both sides, we do not see any reason to
interfere with the exercise of discretion of the trial judge. Nor
do we see any error with respect to the exercise of his
discretion with respect to costs.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In view of the divided success of the parties, we award no
costs of the appeal or cross-appeal.</pre>
