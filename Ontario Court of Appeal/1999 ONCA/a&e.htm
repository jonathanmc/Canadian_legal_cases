    <pre>On appeal from the order of Farley J. dated July 31, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  A. &amp; E. Capital Funding Inc. (A. &amp; E.) claims that York Fire
&amp; Casualty Insurance Company (York) is entitled to set-off
certain debts owed by York to Maplex General Insurance Company
(Maplex) against a debt owed by Maplex to York.
[2]  Maplex was ordered wound-up on March 21, 1995.  Under s.73
of the Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. W-11, the law of set-off
&#147;as administered by the courts, whether of law or of equity,
applies to all claims on the estate of a company &#133;&#148;.
[3]  York and Maplex were both owned by A. &amp; E. prior to the
winding-up order.  A. &amp; E. has now sold York to Kingsway
Financial Services.  The purchase price depends in part on the
outcome of these proceedings.
[4]  York and Maplex shared operating expenses between January
1994 and March 1995.  There was no formal agreement with respect
to the shared expenses, no doubt because both companies were
owned by the same entity.  Ultimately, in 1997, after lengthy
negotiations, the parties agreed that York owed Maplex
$220,000.00 for its share of the operating expenses during the
relevant time (the shared operating expense debt).
[5]  York and Maplex had also entered into a reinsurance
agreement for the year 1994.  Well after the winding-up order, it
was agreed that under the terms of the reinsurance agreement,
York owed Maplex $257,678.00 (the reinsurance debt).
[6]  In January 1995, the Commissioner of Insurance ordered York
to renew certain Maplex policies.  The premiums on those policies
were paid to Maplex.  Maplex had not remitted some of those
premiums to York at the time of the winding-up.  It was
ultimately determined that Maplex owed York $380,534.00 in
unremitted premiums (the unremitted premium debt).  It is agreed
that Maplex used some of the funds from the premium payments to
pay operating expenses between January and March 1995.  Some part
of those payments included York&#146;s share of the joint operating
expenses.
[7]  It is A. &amp; E.&#146;s position that York&#146;s debts to  Maplex (the
shared operating expense debt and the reinsurance debt) totalling
about $480,000.00 should be set-off against the unremitted
premium debt owed by Maplex to York (about $380,000.00) leaving a
debt owed by York to Maplex of about $100,000.00.  This amount
would be available to the creditors of Maplex.  If set-off is not
available, York owes Maplex about $480,000.00 and that amount
will be available to the creditors. Maplex will still owe York
$380,000.00, but given the financial condition of Maplex, York as
an unsecured creditor will not recover any part of that debt.
[8]  A. &amp; E. claims that the doctrine of legal set-off applies to
the three debts.  The doctrine can only apply to debts that are
ascertainable.  The parties accept that the circumstances in
which an amount is &#147;ascertainable&#148; are accurately stated in
Citibank Canada v. Confederation Life Insurance Co. (1996), 42
C.B.R. (3d) 288 at 300 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), aff&#146;d, (1998), 37
O.R. (3d) 226.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; When the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled can be
          ascertained by calculation, or fixed by any scale of charges or
          other positive data, it is said to be &#147;liquidated&#148; or made clear
          &#133;. But when the amount to be recovered depends upon the
          circumstances of the case and is fixed by opinion or by
          assessment or by what might be judged reasonable, the claim is
          generally unliquidated.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  It is also agreed that the determination as to whether the
debts were ascertainable, must be made as of the date of the
winding-up order (March 21, 1995).
[10] In our opinion, the amounts of the debts owed by York to
Maplex were not ascertainable as of March 1995.  The shared
operating expenses debt was not ascertainable by calculation, or
fixed by any scale or other positive data.  Rather, it fell to be
determined after negotiation by an assessment of York&#146;s
reasonable proportion of the joint expenses.  There was simply no
way of knowing as of March 1995 what York&#146;s obligation for the
joint operating expenses would be.  That debt could not be set-
off against the debt owed by Maplex to York (the unremitted
premium debt).
[11] The reinsurance debt was not ascertainable since all
relevant claims had not been made and settled until well after
the date of the winding-up.
[12] A. &amp; E. also argued that York had a contractual right to set-
off debts between itself and Maplex under Article 21 of its
contract of reinsurance with Maplex.  We agree with Farley J.
that the reinsurance agreement cannot be read in that way.  The
agreement regulated York&#146;s contractual obligation to reinsure
certain risks insured by Maplex and Maple&#146;s obligation to pay
certain premiums to York in return for that reinsurance.
Essentially, York was to pay claims on behalf of Maplex and
Maplex was to pay premiums to York.  In our view, paragraph 3 of
Article 21, the part of the agreement relied on by A. &amp; E., does
not refer to all debts between York and Markel, but rather to
&#147;debits and credits&#148; that may arise under the terms of the
agreement.  These debits and credits arose as a result of the
procedure set out in the agreement for the netting of premiums
due to York for providing the reinsurance against losses payable
by York as the reinsurer. A. &amp; E.&#146;s reliance on paragraph 4 of
Article 21 of the reinsurance contract is misplaced.  The
reference in paragraph 4 to &#147;any other contract&#148; expands the
reach of that paragraph beyond the reinsurance contract.  There
is no such terminology used in paragraph 3 of Article 21, the
provision relied on by A. &amp; E.  The reinsurance contract does not
give York the right to set-off either the shared operating
expenses debt or the reinsurance debt against Maplex&#146;s debt to
York (the unremitted premium debt).
[13] A. &amp; E.&#146;s third and final argument is based on the doctrine
of equitable set-off.  A. &amp; E. submits that because Maplex used
funds from premiums belonging to York to pay operating expenses
from January to March 1995, York should be allowed to set-off a
portion of its operating expense debt attributable to that period
(59 days) against the unremitted premium debt owed to York by
Maplex.  In effect, A. &amp; E. argues that Maplex used York&#146;s money
to pay operating expenses during that 59-day period and should
not be allowed to include the operating expenses for that period
as part of York&#146;s operating expenses debt to Maplex.
[14] There is no evidence quantifying the operating expenses
between January and March 1995 and no evidence of what share of
those expenses was attributable to York.  When the parties agreed
that York&#146;s share of the operating expenses was $222,000.00, they
did not attribute any part of the debt to any particular time
period.  As the parties were sharing operating expenses between
January and March 1995, it seems clear that some part of the
$222,000.00 debt is attributable to that time period.  A. &amp; E.
suggests that the operating expenses for that time period can
reasonably be estimated at 13.6% of the total shared operating
expenses debt.  The time period in issue (59 days) equals 13.6%
of the total time during which York and Maplex shared operating
expenses.
[15] Maplex contends that equitable set-off is only permitted
where the claims arise out of the same transaction or are so
closely connected to each other that it would be manifestly
unjust to allow one party to enforce payment of the claim without
taking the other claim into account.  We accept this description
of equitable set-off.  In our view, the claims are very closely
connected.  It would also be unfair to allow Maplex to claim the
full operating debt when it paid a portion of the those expenses
with money belonging to York.  York should be allowed to set-off
the amount of the shared operating expense debt attributable to
the relevant period ($29,920.00) against the unremitted premium
debt owed to it by Maplex.
[16] The order of Farley J. should be varied to give effect to
the limited set-off described above.</pre>
    <pre>[17] A. &amp; E. has enjoyed some success on this appeal, however,
most of the argument related to the issues on which A. &amp; E. was
unsuccessful.  In the circumstances, we make no order as to costs
on the appeal and would not disturb the costs order made by
Farley J. on the application.
