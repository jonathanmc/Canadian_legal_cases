    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This case turns on the interpretation and application of s.
23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the section dealing
with &quot;Minority Language Educational Rights.&quot;  In particular, the
focus is on s. 23(2), which gives Canadian citizens the right to
have all of their children receive either French or English
language instruction if any of their children has received it.
The issue in this appeal is whether this right extends to a
parent whose first  language is not that of the linguistic
minority population of the province in which that parent lives.

[2]  Susan Abbey is an Ontario parent. Her first language, and
the language in which she received her primary school education,
is English. She pays taxes to the public school board. Her three
children have received practically their entire primary school
education from French as a First Language schools (French
Language Schools). Until September 1996, the local public school
boards had purchased this service for the Abbey children through
a purchase of services arrangement with the separate school
boards.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In 1989, Nicholas Abbey, the oldest child, was the first to
attend a French Language school in Essex County. The Essex Public
Board did not operate a French Language School, so an application
was made to attend the French Language School operated by the
nearest separate school board. Because his mother was English-
speaking, Nicholas was accepted by way of its admissions
committee, established pursuant to s. 289 of the Education Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2. Acceptance by the admissions committee meant
that the French Language School's tuition fees would be paid by
the local public school board.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  When the family moved to London in 1990, the local French
Language School agreed to allow all three Abbey children to
register. The basis for their admission was that since Nicholas
had already received French language education, Susan Abbey had
acquired the right under s. 23(2) of the Charter to have all her
children receive their education in the French language. The
children remained in the French Language School until June 1996
when the family moved to the Town of La Salle in Essex County.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On their return to Essex County, Susan Abbey attempted to
register her three children in a French Language School so they
could continue their education in French. The Essex County Board
of Education still did not provide French First Language
instruction. It did, however, offer a French immersion programme
in an English language elementary school. In a French Language
School, French is the exclusive language at the school for all
purposes, and the school itself is governed by the linguistic
minority group. In French immersion programmes, the principal
language of instruction is usually English, and most non-
classroom activities and social interaction are in English. A
French immersion programme does not constitute a &quot;French language
instructional unit&quot; for the purposes of s. 288 of the Education
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Initially, Ms. Abbey registered her children in the French
immersion elementary school. Within days, her children, who had
received their entire primary education to date in French,
experienced profound difficulty in adapting to the English
language instruction. As a result, in September 1996, purporting
to exercise her rights under s. 23 of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, Ms. Abbey wrote to the Director of Education of the
Essex Public Board requesting that her children be permitted to
attend the French Language School operated by the local Separate
School Board, the Windsor Roman Catholic Separate School Board.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The Director verbally denied Ms. Abbey's request on
September 9, 1996. The Windsor Separate School Board, on the
other hand, acknowledged Ms. Abbey's s. 23 rights in a letter
dated September 13, 1996, and agreed to admit the Abbey children
subject to the Essex Public Board paying their tuition fees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  At a meeting on September 30, 1996, the Essex Public Board
formally refused to enter into an agreement with the Windsor
Separate School Board to purchase French language instruction
from that Board for the Abbey children. It denied Ms. Abbey's
request by a resolution stating:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          That the Board deny the request to pay
          tuition fees to the French First Language
          Program of the Windsor Roman Catholic
          Separate School Board, on behalf of an Essex
          County family, on the basis that the family
          does not qualify for Section 23 Charter
          Rights.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9] This decision was confirmed in a letter dated October 2,
1996.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The Ontario Ministry of Education and Training agreed with
the position taken by Susan Abbey. In its letter dated October 2,
1996 to the Essex Board, the Ministry stated in part:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... it is my understanding that in 1990, both
          Abbey sons (and in 1992, their daughter) were
          admitted to École Alexandra (now École Marie
          Curie), a French-language instructional unit
          of the Board of Education for the City of
          London, on the basis of Charter s. 23, and
          not through an admissions committee.
          Therefore, all three children have been
          educated in a French-language instructional
          unit of the London board, since that time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Based on this fact, and the advice I have
          received from the Ministry of Education and
          Training's legal services, the ministry's
          view is that the Abbey children &quot;have
          received...primary...school instruction in
          French&quot; for years and therefore, under
          Charter s.23(2), they currently &quot;have the
          right to have all [their] children receive
          primary and secondary school instruction in
          the same language.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Despite a request from Ms. Abbey on October 3, 1996 that the
Essex Board reconsider its decision in light of this letter from
the Ministry, the Board decided at a meeting on October 20, not
to change its original decision.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Ms. Abbey then requested permission from the Windsor
Separate School Board that her children attend its French
language school for the 1996-1997 school year. In a letter dated
November 1, 1996, the Separate School Board not only agreed  to
let the Abbey children register at the school, it also agreed to
absorb the tuition fees in the event that Ms. Abbey was
unsuccessful in legal proceedings against the Essex Public Board.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] On November 5, 1996, Ms. Abbey registered her children at
the French Language School operated by the Windsor Separate
School Board.

[14] In February 1997, Ms. Abbey and her three children brought
an application for judicial review of the Essex Public Board's
decision not to defray the tuition costs of the children's
attendance at the French Language School.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The application for judicial review was dismissed by the
Divisional Court on June 10, 1997. It concluded that the rights
set out in s. 23(2) of the Charter did not apply to the Abbey
children because they did not fit the category of persons for
whom s. 23 was intended. The court found that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The purpose of s. 23(2) can only be
          determined in light of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   The overall purpose of s. 23, which is
               to secure linguistic rights to
               linguistic minorities, not to linguistic
               majorities, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   The wording, structure, and headings and
               marginal notes of s. 23 itself.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] In the opinion of the Divisional Court, s. 23(2) is not a
separate right, but is available only to provide continuity of
language instruction to those who qualify under s. 23(1), namely,
citizens whose first language is that of the linguistic minority
population of the province in which they live. In its view, as a
result, the right to continuity of French language education is
available only to linguistic minorities, and s. 23 &quot;does not
provide the anglophone community in Ontario with the right to
have their children educated in French&quot;, whether or not they have
already received their education in the French language. The
Divisional Court also interpreted the marginal note beside s.
23(2) - the &quot;continuity of language instruction&quot; - as
confirmation of the dependence of s. 23(2) rights on those
guaranteed in s. 23(1).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] For the reasons which follow, I cannot, with respect, agree
with this constitutional interpretation.
Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] In view of the interpretation given to s. 23(2) by the
Divisional Court, it is necessary to set out s. 23 of the Charter

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] As stated earlier, the Essex Public Board does not have a
French Language School. Instead, it pays the required tuition
fees to French Language Schools operated by other boards, such as
the Windsor Roman Catholic Separate School Board, for children in
Ontario who are entitled to be educated in the French language.
Access to French Language Schools is restricted to s. 23 rights-
holders and to children like Nicholas Abbey who are admitted
through committees administered pursuant to s. 289 of the
Education Act (now s. 293).

[22] As a Charter provision, and particularly as a remedial
provision which &quot;creates a code which establishes minority
language education rights for the nation&quot;, s. 23 is entitled to a
liberal interpretation:  Re Minority Language Education Rights
(1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.) at pp. 28-29; see also In Reference
Re Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1
S.C.R. 1148 at p. 1176, and Mahé v. Alberta, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 342.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The heading of s. 23 is instructive. It reads &quot;Minority
Language Education Rights&quot;, thereby stressing both language and
education, and reinforcing the inextricable connection between
the two. What s. 23 primarily entrenches is, where numbers
warrant, the right of French or English linguistic minorities to
obtain educational instruction in their own language in order to
facilitate both linguistic fluency and linguistic continuity:
Martel, Official Language Minority Education Rights in Canada:
From Instruction to Management, (Ottawa:  Office of the
Commissioner of Official Languages, 1991) at 16. The purpose of
this right is to protect the linguistic and cultural integrity of
the minority language group in a province. Put simply, it is to
promote linguistic continuity:  Book II (Education) of the Report
of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1968)
at p. 8. In Mahé, Chief Justice Dickson explained this purpose at
p. 362:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The general purpose of s. 23 is clear:  it is
          to preserve and promote the two official
          languages of Canada, and their respective
          cultures, by ensuring that each language
          flourishes, as far as possible, in provinces
          where it is not spoken by the majority of the
          population. The section aims at achieving
          this goal by granting minority language
          educational rights to minority language
          parents throughout Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          And at p. 350:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [Section 23 represents] a linchpin in this
          nation's commitment to the values of
          bilingualism and biculturalism.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Against this background, it is my view that s. 23(1) and (2)
set out separate entitlements which are conceptually related, but
independent from each other. Minority language educational rights
are not merely those of children of citizens whose first language
is that of the English or French linguistic minority population
of the province in which they reside, or who received their
primary school education in that language:  s. 23(1). These
educational rights are also available to all the children of a
Canadian citizen if any of  that citizen's children has received
primary or secondary school instruction in English or French in
Canada. Not only do children who have received - or are receiving
- their education in the language of the linguistic minority have
the right to continue receiving their primary and secondary
school education in that language, their siblings enjoy the same
continuous right.

[25] For purposes of s. 23(2), it does not matter whether this
prior language instruction originated in another province,
another part of a province, or through the kind of admissions
committee contemplated by the Education Act. However it
originated, it is the fact of it having occurred which attracts
the protection of s. 23(2).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The independence of the various rights in s. 23 was
supported by the judgment of this court in  Re:  Minority
Language Educational Rights, where it said at p. 29:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is to be observed that s. 23 of the
          Charter, as it applies to Ontario, accords
          rights to parents to have their children
          receive instruction in French, the minority
          language of the province, if these parents
          come within one of three distinct categories:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)  citizens whose first language learned
          and still understood in French;  [s.
          23(1)(a)]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) citizens who have received their own
          primary school instruction in French in
          Canada, [s. 23(1)(b)] and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iii)     citizens of whom at least one child
          has received or is receiving primary or
          secondary school instruction in French in
          Canada. [s. 23(2)]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It can be seen that in the Charter there is
          no requirement that children, in order to be
          entitled to receive instruction in the French
          language in Ontario, must themselves be
          French speaking.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] It is also helpful to look at s. 23(3) which refers to right-
holders under both s. 23(1) and s.23(2), reinforcing a conclusion
that distinct rights are created under these latter two
provisions:  see also P.W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada
(Toronto:  Carswell, 1997) at pp. 53.26, 53.28.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] I do not quarrel with the observation of the Divisional
Court that &quot;section 23 is designed to secure rights to linguistic
minorities and does not provide the anglophone community in
Ontario with the right to have their children educated in
French.&quot;  Anglophone parents in Ontario do not have a
constitutional right to have their children educated in French as
a matter of choice. Their children cannot be admitted to a French
Language School unless an admissions committee, controlled by
members of the minority group, grants them access:  Michel
Bastarache, André Braën, Didier Emmanuel, Pierre Foucher,
Language Rights in Canada, Michel Bastarache ed. (Montreal:  Les
Editions Yvon Blais Inc. 1989). If, however, one of their
children is admitted to a French Language School, then the rest
of their children do have such a right.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Even though the overriding purpose of s. 23 is the
protection of the language and culture of the linguistic minority
through education, this does not preclude interpreting s. 23(2)
according to its plain meaning, even if this means that rights
accrue to persons who are not members of the linguistic minority.
The more fluency there is in Canada's official languages, the
more opportunity there is for minority language groups to
flourish in the community.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Chief Justice Dickson's acknowledged in Mahé that not all
section 23 right-holders would be members of the minority
language group. Specifically, he noted at p. 379:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the persons who will exercise the measure
          of management and control described above are
          &quot;s. 23 parents&quot; or persons of such parents
          designated as their representatives. I
          appreciate that because of the wording of s.
          23 these parents may not be culturally part
          of the minority language group.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] I also cannot accept the proposition articulated by the
Divisional Court that the marginal note to s. 23(2) - &quot;continuity
of language instruction&quot; - means continuity of those rights
guaranteed by s. 23(1). Such a restrictive interpretation renders
s. 23(2) meaningless, since s. 23(1) implicitly guarantees such
continuity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] In any event, it is difficult to see how a marginal note can
be permitted to trump the plain meaning of a constitutional
section and render the rights it delineates redundant. There is
no doubt that marginal notes are relevant:  Law Society of Upper
Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357 at p. 376. But, they are
not so relevant that they can be interpreted in a way which makes
the section itself irrelevant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The marginal note should not be interpreted using an
interpretative approach different from the one used to interpret
the section itself. As stated earlier, the section is entitled to
a liberal interpretation. Only a narrow, technical construction
of the marginal note argues for making s. 23(2) merely a
continuation of those rights set out in s. 23(1). I prefer to
interpret the marginal note in a way which is explanatory, not
contradictory of the content of the plainly articulated
constitutional right it accompanies.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Nicholas Abbey received his primary school education at a
French Language school. Pursuant to s. 23(2), not only he, but
also his siblings, are therefore entitled to continue their
primary and secondary school education in this manner, and the
Essex Public Board is obliged to purchase these educational
services for the Abbey children.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] For the reasons given the appeal is allowed, the judgment of
the Divisional Court is set aside and an order will go:</font></pre>
      <blockquote>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(a)  declaring that the appellant Susan Abbey is entitled 
by virtue of s. 23 of the Charter to have her children 
receive their primary and second school instruction in the 
French language;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(b)  declaring that the appellants Nicholas Abbey, Joshua 
Abbey and Naomi Abbey, are entitled to receive, and that 
the respondent, Essex County Board of Education is obligated 
to provide to them, French language instruction in accordance 
with the Board’s obligation under the Education Act;  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(c)  quashing the resolution passed by the Board on September 
30, 1996, which denied Susan Abbey’s request that the Board 
pay the tuition fees in respect of her children to attend the 
French as a First Language School, the école Monseigneur Jean 
Noël, operated by the Windsor Separate School Board.</font></pre>
