COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

    <pre>HEARD:         May 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on September 22, 1997, imposed by
Mr. Justice B. Smith, sitting with a jury.

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   We called on the Crown on only one point: whether the trial
judge  erred  because  he  failed to  give  the  jury  a  special
instruction  on evidence of &#147;consciousness of innocence&#148;  similar
to his instruction on evidence of consciousness of guilt. We find
no error and, indeed, we think that this issue was addressed in a
balanced way in the judge&#146;s charge.
[2]  The trial judge fully and fairly referred both to the
evidence pointing to the appellant&#146;s innocence and to the
evidence pointing to his guilt. The inference to be drawn from
the circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant&#146;s innocence
would have been obvious to the jury. On the other hand, the trial
judge wanted to ensure that the jury did not misuse the evidence
of the appellant&#146;s alleged lie. Thus he cautioned them on how
this evidence might be used. In short, if the trial judge treated
the consciousness of guilt evidence differently, it was only
because the jury had to be appropriately cautioned on its use.
[3]  We see no merit in the other two grounds of appeal. The
trial judge made it clear that if the jury accepted McKee&#146;s
evidence or had a reasonable doubt about it, the appellant was
entitled to an acquittal. The opinion given by the trial judge
early in his charge was to assist the jury in isolating for them
the only issue in the case, the identification of the killer. We
note that none of the three issues raised on appeal was the
subject of an objection at trial. The appeal is dismissed.
