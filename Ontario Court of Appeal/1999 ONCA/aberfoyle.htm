    <pre>HEARD:         June 17, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Boland J. dated July 19, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In this action for breach of a construction contract, at the
end  of  the  appellants&#146; argument, we called on the  respondents
with  respect  to  the  issue of damages  only.   Mr.  Malen  has
reviewed the evidence, which the trial judge apparently accepted,
being  the  evidence  of Mr. Yu.  The trial  judge  rejected  the
evidence of the appellants&#146; witnesses, Murphy and Pedersen.
[2]  The issue was really whether or not the evidence of Mr. Yu
was sufficient to support the judgment.  The judge was obviously
aware of the issue that concerned us.  It was the question of the
weight to be given to Mr. Yu&#146;s evidence, which was, in his words,
an estimate and which the trial judge said was, in part, a
&#147;guesstimate&#148;.
[3]  This was the only evidence before the trial judge and she
obviously had to do the best that she could with it.  The
judgment was at the lower end of the range of damages estimated
by Mr. Yu.
[4]    We cannot say that the trial judge should have rejected
all or part of the evidence as a basis upon which damages could
be assessed.
[5]  In the circumstances then, we cannot interfere with the
assessment of the damages and the appeal fails.
