      <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:       JOYCE ABRAMSON and JACK ABRAMSON (Plaintiffs /
          Respondents) and THE CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF OSHAWA
          (Defendant / Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:   FINLAYSON, OSBORNE AND MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:  T.P. Bates, for the appellant
          Robert D. Wood, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>DATE:     February 10, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We think the motions judge was correct in concluding that
the action in negligent misrepresentation was a separate cause of
action and was not governed by the doctrines of estoppel or issue
estoppel.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  With respect to the abuse of process argument, the letter
from the solicitor for the respondent enclosing his consent to
the dismissal of the first action makes clear that the respondent
is not abandoning her claim for damages and proposes to  proceed
with the action in appeal. This argument did not appear to have
been advanced in the court below. In any event, we can see no
merit in the argument on the facts of this case.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
