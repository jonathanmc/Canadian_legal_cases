    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice G. Epstein dated
September 2, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                                </pre>
    <pre>                                  ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Epstein J. who, on a
motion for summary judgment, dismissed the appellants&#146; claim and
granted the respondent banks (&#147;the banks&#148;) judgment on their
counterclaims against certain appellants.

[2]  At the outset, it is important to note the basis on which
this case was argued, both before the motions judge and in this
court.  The individual claims of the plaintiffs/appellants are
not to be considered separately on their respective merits.
Counsel for the appellants made it clear that the case was being
argued on an all or nothing basis: all the claims go to trial or
all of them are dismissed.  This explains some of the language of
the motions judge when she made reference to:

  §    &quot;most of the plaintiffs are sophisticated and highly educated&quot;;
            </pre>
    <pre>  §    &quot;the plaintiffs admitted in most cases&quot;; and
            </pre>
    <pre>  §    &quot;for the most part, there was no direct contact of any sort
       between the Investors and representative of the banks&quot;.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellants are a group of investors in limited
partnerships promoted by the Metfin group of companies.  The
banks provided financing to the appellants for the purpose of
investing in the tax-shelter investments.  The appellants brought
their action to rescind the loan transactions and the banks
counterclaimed for amounts due under certain loans.  The
appellants&#146; action against Metfin was discontinued.

[4]  In conjunction with the loan transactions, the appellants
executed documents including, but not limited to, promissory
notes, directions, powers of attorney, waivers, acknowledgements
and disclosure letters.

[5]  As a result of their investments, some appellants realized
deductions in their taxable income and some received returns on
their investments.  However, when the recession hit, these tax-
driven investments lost a substantial amount of their underlying
values.

[6]  In our view, the evidence led by the appellants in response
to the banks&#146; motion for summary judgment was highly questionable
as it contained many omissions and inaccuracies.  We are also of
the view that all the issues raised by the appellants relating to
misstatement or misapprehension of evidence by the motions judge
have been satisfactorily answered by the respondents.

[7]  The appellants have alleged that:

  §    the transactions were in violation of the Securities Act;
            </pre>
    <pre>  §    there was an agency relationship between Metfin and the banks; and
            </pre>
    <pre>  §    the banks owed a fiduciary obligation to the appellants and
       breached that obligation.</pre>
    <pre>The remaining allegations relating to Metfin not being a properly
constituted entity within the meaning of the Ontario Business
Corporations Act and that the transactions were made in
contravention of the Condominium Act and the Ontario New Home
Warranties Act were abandoned.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The motions judge found that there was no factual evidence
for the argument that there had been a violation of the
Securities Act and that there was in fact compliance with the
Act.  She also found that in any event, it was not established
that the banks had actual knowledge of such failure.

[9]  With respect to the agency argument, the motions judge
concluded that the appellants failed to demonstrate an agency
relationship between the banks and Metfin.  (Indeed, in our view,
the evidence showed that for the purpose of the loan
transactions, the appellants made Metfin their agent.) She also
found that there was no evidence of any misrepresentation upon
which the appellants may have relied in making their decision to
invest.

[10] Finally, with respect to the argument that the banks owed a
fiduciary obligation to the appellants and that the banks
breached that obligation, the motions judge found that a
fiduciary obligation did not exist and she found that the
appellants had failed to advance any evidence to demonstrate
special circumstances to establish such a relationship.

[11] With respect to all three issues, the motions judge
concluded that they raised no genuine issue for trial.

[12] Recognizing that this was a motion for summary judgment, we
are satisfied that the motions judge was entitled to make the
findings of fact that she did.  Her findings and conclusions are
all supported by the evidentiary record before her and we see no
basis to interfere with her decision.

[13] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
