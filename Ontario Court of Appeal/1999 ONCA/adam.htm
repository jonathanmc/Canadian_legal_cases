</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the committal order issued by Mr. Justice L.R.
Morin on October 21, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant is facing criminal charges in the United States
for fraud-related offences.  The United States, pursuant to the
Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-23 (&#147;the Act&#148;) sought his
extradition on those charges.  On October 21, 1997, L. R. Morin J.
(&#147;the extradition judge&#148;) issued a warrant of committal and
directed that the appellant be detained pending the decision of
the Minister of Justice with respect to the surrender of the
appellant to the requesting state.  On March 20, 1998, the
Minister of Justice ordered the surrender of the appellant on all
charges.
[2]  The appellant appeals the committal order.  He also seeks
judicial review of the Minister&#146;s surrender order.
[3]  Two of the grounds of appeal are that the extradition judge
failed to allow the appellant to give evidence at the hearing and
relied on hearsay evidence in reaching his decision.
[4]  At the hearing, the extradition judge refused to allow the
appellant to call evidence.  On reviewing the transcript and the
reasons for judgment, it appears that the extradition judge was
under the mistaken impression that the law prevented him from
hearing from the appellant.  In reaching this conclusion, the
extradition judge noted that if he permitted the appellant to be
called as a witness this could only lead to an expectation that
the evidence be weighed, which is not the proper function of an
extradition judge.
[5]  The purpose of an extradition hearing is to determine whether
there is sufficient evidence to warrant sending the fugitive to
the requesting state so that he may stand trial.  Under s.
18(1)(b) of the Extradition Act, the role of an extradition judge
is to determine whether the evidence produced establishes a prima
facie case that would justify the committal of the fugitive for
trial, if the crime had been committed in Canada.  One should not
rush to the conclusion that evidence from the fugitive could not
bear upon that issue.
[6]  Section 13 of the Act provides that an extradition hearing is
to be conducted &#147;as if the fugitive was brought before a justice
of the peace, charged with an indictable offence committed in
Canada.&#148;  A fugitive in an extradition hearing is afforded the
same protections that he would otherwise be entitled to at a
preliminary inquiry for a charge to be tried in a Canadian court.
See R. v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500.  Under s. 541 of the
Criminal Code, an accused at a preliminary inquiry has the right
to call witnesses.  As an extradition hearing is in the nature of
a preliminary inquiry, it follows that the fugitive should also
have an opportunity to call witnesses.
[7]  The right to give evidence at an extradition hearing was
clearly enunciated by this court in United States of America v.
Smith (1984), 44 O.R. (2d) 705; leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused
4 O.A.C. 239.  There, Houlden J.A., for the court, held that the
fugitive at an extradition hearing can call witnesses.  In
receiving this evidence, an extradition judge is not required to
weigh the testimony or to assess the credibility of the witnesses.
Indeed, that is not the role of an extradition judge.  Rather, his
duty is to determine if the evidence would justify the committal
of the fugitive for trial if the alleged crime had been committed
in Canada.
[8]  Nothing in Philippines (Republic) v. Pacificador (1993), 14
O.R. (3d) 321(C.A.) detracts from what was said in Smith.
Pacificador dealt with whether the Act required the extradition
judge to hear evidence to create a record for another proceeding.
In holding that there was nothing in the Act which required an
extradition judge to hear such evidence, Doherty J.A. stated twice
that his comments did not apply to evidence relevant to whether a
prima facie case for extradition has been established.  In fact,
Doherty J.A. found that s. 13 of the Act requires that the
statutory procedure established for the conduct of preliminary
inquiries should be followed &#147;as nearly as may be&#148; in the conduct
of extradition hearings.  As already noted, that statutory
procedure includes the right to call witnesses.
[9]  An extradition hearing must be conducted in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice.  See United States of
America v. Dynar, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462.  As such, the appellant was
entitled to a fair hearing before the extradition judge.  In our
view, the refusal of the extradition judge to permit the appellant
to call evidence was contrary to the principles of fundamental
justice.
[10] Accordingly, the extradition judge erred in refusing to allow
the appellant to give evidence.
[11] The appellant did not tell this court or the extradition
judge what his evidence might be.  We are only dealing with the
right to speak. If his evidence, as delivered, is contrary to the
principles applicable to a preliminary hearing then rulings and
exclusionary orders may be made.  We cannot conclude that anything
he might say will only serve to contradict and thus invite a
credibility issue.  It may be that his evidence could complement
other evidence and lead to a conclusion that there is no prima
facie case for extradition.  In any event, our reasoning is not
based upon the facts of this case.  It is directed by the simple
principle that the appellant should have been permitted to give
evidence -- relevance and admissibility rulings to follow.
[12] As to the admissibility of hearsay evidence, the cases speak
clearly to the effect that, if admitted, it should be ignored in
reaching a conclusion on extradition.  See United States of
America v. Shaw (1984), 28 Man. R. (2d) 88 (Q.B.).  That being
said, we see no clear indication that the extradition judge relied
on hearsay evidence in reaching his decision, and that is not a
ground for our decision.
[13] Having found a fundamental error in the proceeding below, we
have no choice but to set aside the warrant of committal and
direct a new hearing.
[14] We did not hear argument on the judicial review appeal from
the Minister&#146;s surrender order.  That appeal will be stayed as
moot in light of our determination of the appeal from the decision
of the extradition judge.
[15] We heard argument as to the effect of the superseding
indictment that was only recently drafted as a result of
proceedings in the United States.  That issue is left for
consideration at the new hearing.
[16] Accordingly, the appeal from the extradition judge is
allowed, the decision is set aside and a new hearing is ordered.</pre></td>
