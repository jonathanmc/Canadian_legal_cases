    <pre>HEARD:         November 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Forestell J. dated September 25,
1998.</pre>
    <pre>                                
                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]   In our view, the sentencing judge erred in principle in
relying on the three cases he discussed to show that conditional
sentences in the community where he presides have not achieved
either specific or general deterrence.  This error in principle
permits us to impose what we consider to be a fit sentence.  In
this case, we think a fit sentence is a conditional sentence of
eighteen months.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Several mitigating considerations justify a conditional
sentence.  The drug was marijuana; the appellant cooperated with
the authorities and pleaded guilty; on the evidence, the
appellant was a courier and should be sentenced for that role
alone; the appellant suffers from a permanent neurological and
spinal disorder for which there is no cure and must therefore
live with pain for the rest of his life; he has a psychiatric
problem as well for which he has diligently maintained a course
of treatment with his family doctor; he has made genuine efforts
to upgrade his education by taking a series of courses at George
Brown College; and, finally, he has served approximately six
months in jail and we think it would be unduly harsh to
reincarcerate him.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The trial judge imposed a sentence of two years less a day.
In addition to converting the custodial sentence to a conditional
sentence, we think two years less a day is unreasonably high for
this offence and this offender.  The trial judge gave no reasons
for two years less a day and we think eighteen months, which is
the period asked for by the Crown, is reasonable.
[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted.  The
appeal is allowed and a conditional sentence of eighteen months
is imposed on the conditions agreed to by counsel, which include
a curfew, continuing medical treatment and continuing education.
The probation order shall remain.</pre>
