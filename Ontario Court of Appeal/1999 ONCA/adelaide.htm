    <pre>HEARD:         May 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice G. Gordon Sedgwick
dated July 31, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal from a summary judgment granted by
Sedgwick J. on a mortgage. Counsel for the appellants contends
that the summary conviction judge misapprehended his proper role
and made findings of fact and credibility that ought to have been
left for trial. The motions judge recognized that there was a
conflict in the evidence but held that this conflict did not
relate to material facts.
[2]  We agree with this conclusion. Even if the facts advanced by
the appellants were accepted by a trial judge they would not give
rise to a defence in law. There is consequently no genuine issue
for trial. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
[3]  The respondent seeks leave to cross-appeal the order on
costs awarding it costs on a party-party scale rather than on the
higher scale provided for in the mortgage. The trial judge erred
in his initial finding that there was no contractual provision
for solicitor and client costs. When this error was brought to
his attention, he decided nonetheless to exercise his discretion
and confirmed his award on the lower scale.
[4]  In our view, there is nothing in the record or in the
findings of the motions judge that would justify depriving the
respondent of its contractual right to solicitor and client
costs. Accordingly, the motions judge erred in the exercise of
his discretion. Leave to appeal the costs order is granted. The
cross-appeal is allowed with costs. Paragraph 3 of the judgment
below is amended to provide costs on the higher scale of
solicitor and client.</pre></td>
