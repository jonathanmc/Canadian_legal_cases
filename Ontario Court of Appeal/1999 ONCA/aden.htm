    <pre>[1]  We are all of the opinion this appeal fails and must be
dismissed.
[2]  The trial judge was alive to the issue of credibility and
the problems in the evidence.  He chose to believe the evidence
of the complainant, having had the advantage of seeing her
testify and judging her credibility.  In our view, there is no
basis upon which we can interfere with this conviction.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre>
