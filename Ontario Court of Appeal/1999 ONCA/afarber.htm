</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Lax J. dated September 18, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  trustee  in  bankruptcy  of  Acepharm  Inc.  sought  a
declaration that money held by a law firm pending the outcome  of
litigation  between Acepharm and First Chemical  Management  Inc.
was  &#147;property  of the bankrupt&#148; under s.67(1) of the  Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, B-3. Lax J. found that the money
should  be  paid to the trustee for distribution to creditors  of
the bankrupt, relying in large part upon this court&#146;s judgment in
Tradmor  Investments Ltd. v. Valdi Foods (1987) Inc.  (1995),  33
C.B.R. (3d) 244 (Ont. Gen. Div.), affirmed (1997) 43 C.B.R.  (3d)
135.  First Chemical appeals from this order, taking the position
that the money is &#147;property held by the bankrupt in trust for any
other person&#148; and thus not divisible among creditors pursuant  to
s.67(1) of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  factual background is not in dispute and is summarized
by the motions judge as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The monies in issue were paid to the law firm in the
          course of litigation between Acepharm and the respondents on this
          motion, Charles Elbourne and First Chemical Management Inc.
          (&#147;FCM&#148;). The litigation puts in issue the rights as between
          Acepharm and FCM as to the beneficial ownership of a Mississauga
          property and as to a lease between these parties with Acepharm
          taking the position that it was the equitable owner of the
          property and with FCM alleging that it was a tenant. Although the
          court record of these proceedings is not entirely clear, it would
          appear that after Acepharm commenced its action in March 1995,
          FCM took some steps to terminate Acepharm&#146;s occupation of the
          premises which resulted in Acepharm launching a motion for
          injunction which was heard before Lang J. on July 14 and 17,
          1995. Prior to its disposition, a settlement was reached, the
          terms of which were provided to the court as ordered by Justice
          Lang. The settlement agreement provided that Acepharm retain
          possession of the premises on a without prejudice basis until
          trial and that &#147;rental payments pursuant to the lease&#148;, which are
          acknowledged to be the subject of the litigation, be paid on a
          without prejudice basis into an interest-bearing account
          established in the names of Cassels, Brock &amp; Blackwell and
          Garvey, Ferriss in trust. The monies were in fact paid into an
          account established by Cassels, Brock &amp; Blackwell who were then
          solicitors for Acepharm. Other terms of the settlement related to
          a schedule for the conduct of the litigation, but these were not
          completed. In October 1995 and in January and March 1996, there
          were further interlocutory proceedings. In July 1996, Cassels,
          Brock &amp; Blackwell removed themselves as solicitors of record and
          other solicitors were appointed. Thereafter, there were no
          further proceedings in the action. In November 1996, the lease
          was terminated by the mortgagee and the property was ultimately
          sold under power of sale. In July 1997, a Receiving Order was
          issued as against Acepharm.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The facts in the present case are very similar to those  in
Tradmor. The headnote of that case reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The plaintiff brought an action claiming rent arrears
          due under an offer to lease. On a motion for summary judgment, an
          order was made that the action would proceed on the condition
          that the defendant pay $70,719.63 into court as security for the
          claim. The money was paid into court and, two weeks later, the
          defendant was declared bankrupt. The trustee brought a motion for
          an order paying out to it the money held by the court. The
          plaintiff argued that the order should not be granted as the
          plaintiff was a secured creditor and intended to take the
          necessary steps to proceed with the action.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Carruthers J. reasoned that the payment into court could not
be  treated as creating a security interest under s.70(1) of  the
Act  because  even if the plaintiff obtained a  judgment  in  the
proceedings it would then have to rank with all other  creditors.
It would only have a judgment, but not security.
[5]  Section 70(1) reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    70. (1)  Every receiving order and every assignment
          made in pursuance of this Act takes precedence over all judicial
          or other attachments, garnishment, certificates having the effect
          of judgments, judgments, certificates of judgment, judgments
          operating as hypothecs, executions or other process against the
          property of a bankrupt, except those that have been completely
          executed by payment to the creditor or his agent, and except the
          rights of a secured creditor.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The endorsement of the Court of Appeal in Tradmor reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    ROBINS J.A.: - We agree with the reasoning of
          Carruthers J. and the conclusion reached by him. In our opinion,
          the appellant is not a secured creditor and, accordingly, has no
          claim to the money in court in priority to the claim of the
          Trustee. The order of Matlow J. granting the debtor conditional
          leave to defend the action, in the circumstances of this case,
          did no more than create a fund to abide the outcome of the trial
          and cannot be treated as constituting the appellant a secured
          creditor.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     We  are not prepared to follow the
          decision in Re Ford, [1900] 2 Q.B. 211.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   In Tradmor  the money was paid into court and in this  case
the money was placed in a law firm&#146;s trust account. The practical
consequence  to the litigants was superficially the same,  except
possibly  as  to  the  interest to be  earned.  It  is  therefore
logically  tempting  to  assume that the  legal  consequences  of
bankruptcy would be the same.
[8]  However, s.67(1)(a) of the Act must now be considered. It
reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                       67. (1) The property of a bankrupt divisible among
          his    creditors shall not comprise
              </pre>
    <pre>                       (a)  property held by the bankrupt
                   in trust for any other person,</pre>
    <pre>[9]   It  could not be argued, (and was not argued),  in  Tradmor
that the Accountant of the (now) Superior Court of Justice was  a
trustee. That office is simply a repository which responds not to
terms of a trust but to the rules of court and court orders.
[10] The ingredients of a trust are well established: certainty
of intention, subject-matter, and objects: see Re Allan Realty of
Guelph Limited  (1979), 29 C.B.R. (N.S.) 229 (Ont. S.C.) at 241
et seq.
[11] Here, on the bare terms recited above, the parties&#146;
intention was clear &#150; to place rental payments into a trust
account pending success or failure of the defendant in asserting
that it was the owner rather than the tenant. The payments were
the subject-matter, and the object was the determination of the
litigation and the payment of the funds to the successful party.
[12] The funds were, in every sense, trust funds in the hands of
the law firm. To the extent that they might be considered as held
in trust by the bankrupt, the appellant was a contingent
beneficiary of that trust. If the funds are not &#147;held by the
bankrupt in trust for any other person&#148; then the only property
the Trustee can reach is the bankrupt&#146;s contingent interest. That
can be realized by continuing the litigation to a conclusion: see
s.67(1)(d) of the Act.
[13] In either event, the resolution of this appeal does not
depend upon a finding that the appellant is a secured creditor
and Tradmor has no direct application.
[14] I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of
Lax J., and in its place declare that the funds in question are
not property of the bankrupt divisible amongst its creditors at
this time. Costs here and below are to be paid by the respondent
to the appellant to the extent that they are available from the
estate of the bankrupt.
