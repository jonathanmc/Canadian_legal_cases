      <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Sharpe J. dated March 12, 1999.

</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  This litigation arises out of the purchase by the respondent
Wood  Street  Developments Inc. (“Wood Street”) of  the  Westbury
Hotel in Toronto. The transaction closed on February 15, 1990. On
closing  Wood  Street  gave  the  vendor  a  mortgage  which  was
subsequently assigned to the appellant as mortgagee.
[2]  Title to the property was taken in the name of Wood Street
and Wood Street was the mortgagor. However, Wood Street held the
property as a bare trustee for three beneficiaries, the corporate
respondents in these proceedings. The three beneficial owners
were parties to a partnership agreement which also bound Wood
Street. It provided that Wood Street waived any right of
indemnification it may have from the partners.
[3]  When the mortgage went into defaul t the appellants sued Wood
Street on the mortgage and obtained judgment. When it was unable
to recover on that judgment it commenced these proceedings
claiming the following:</pre>
      <pre>          (a)  that the corporate respondents are liable to
          indemnify Wood Street for the amount of the judgment
          against it;</pre>
      <pre>          (b)  that the waiver of the right to indemnification
          was against public policy and, therefore, void;</pre>
      <pre>          (c)  that the corporate respondents are liable under
          s.20(2) of the  Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M40;</pre>
      <pre>          (d)  fraud and conspiracy.</pre>
      <pre>[4]   The  defendants moved by way of summary judgment to dismiss
the action. Sharpe J. granted the motion finding no genuine issue
for  trial  to  be raised by any of the appellant’s  allegations.
This is the appeal from that judgment.
[5]  Before this Court the appellant’s primary argument was one
not made below. It argued that the relationship between Wood
Street and the corporate respondents could be one of agency as
well as one of trust and, on the basis of agency law, the
appellant could sue the corporate respondents as undisclosed
principals.
[6]  In our view, this argument must fail because of the doctrine
of merger. The appellant has proceeded to judgment against the
agent. It has sought to enforce that judgment. It cannot
afterwards sue the principals whether it knew of their existence
at the time of judgment or not. See Lang Transport Ltd. v. Plus
Factor International Trucking Ltd. (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 1 (Ont.
C.A.); Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edition, Reissue, Vol. I
(2), ¶ 143.
[7]  The appellant’s second argument before this court was that
Sharpe J. went beyond the role asked of him on a summary judgment
motion to weigh conflicting evidence and conduct a paper trial.
[8]  In our view there is no basis for this assertion. The only
evidence tendered on the motion by the appellant was an affidavit
of its expert witness Mr. Buchnall. While his assertion that the
form of this transaction was unusual conflicted with the view of
the respondents’ expert, resolution of this conflict would not
affect the outcome of the litigation. On the issue which does
matter, the legal relationship among the partners and Wood
Street, Mr. Buchnall was not able to come to a conclusion. Hence
his evidence does not raise a conflict which would necessitate a
trial.
[9]  In our view, there are simply no factual conflicts either of
direct evidence or of the reasonable inferences to be drawn
therefrom that would require a trial to resolve. Consequently,
this ground of appeal must fail.
[10] In its factum the appellant also challenges the principal
finding of Sharpe J., namely, that Wood Street was a party to the
partnership agreement thereby depriving itself of the right to
indemnity from the beneficiaries. Sharpe J. found the contrary
contention so weak that it raised no genuine issue for trial. We
agree with his conclusion and his reasons for that conclusion. We
could not improve upon them.
[11] The appellant did not raise before this Court any of the
other issues addressed by Sharpe J. In any event, for the reasons
he gave, we agree with his disposition of them.
[12] In the result the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre>
