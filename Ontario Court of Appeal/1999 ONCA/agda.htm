    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal presents for consideration once again the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">troublesome issue of the liability of officers and directors of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation for acts done in pursuance of a corporate purpose.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The plaintiff, ADGA Systems International Ltd., has claimed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that a competitor, the defendant Valcom Ltd., raided its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees and caused the plaintiff economic damage. The plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also claims against three of its own employees for breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fiduciary duty in acceding to the importunes of Valcom Ltd. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue in controversy on this particular appeal is the claim by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff against the director and two employees of Valcom</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ltd. for their personal involvement in this recruitment program.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Those three defendants brought a motion for summary judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seeking to dismiss the claim against them. The motion was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissed by Mercier J. The Divisional Court then heard an appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from that order, allowed the appeal, and dismissed the claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against those three defendants. The plaintiff now appeals to this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court and seeks to justify proceeding to trial against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">MacPherson, the Director of Valcom Ltd. and Ewing and McKenzie,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">senior employees of Valcom Ltd. The question is whether the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents can be sued for their actions as individuals,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assuming those actions were genuinely directed to the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of their corporate employer. In my view a cause of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action does exist against the respondents and a trial is required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to determine the merits of that action.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Facts
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  For purposes of this appeal, a simple sketch of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">background facts is sufficient. The plaintiff ADGA and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendant Valcom were competitors, and for some years the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff had a substantial contract with Correctional Services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada for technical support and maintenance of security systems</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the federal prisons. In 1991 the contract was coming up for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">renewal and the Department of Supply and Services called for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenders. One of the conditions of the tender was that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tendering party provide the names of 25 senior technicians</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">together with their qualifications, thus assuring that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tendering company would be competent to perform the work required</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the contract. Through its long association with this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract, the plaintiff had 45 such employees. Valcom is alleged</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to have had none. The pleadings and the evidence indicate that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Valcom, through its sole director MacPherson and the two senior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees Ewing and McKenzie, set out to interview the senior</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">representatives of the plaintiff's technical staff to convince</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them of the following: to permit their names to be used on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tendering document; to come to work for Valcom if the tender was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">successful; and to use their efforts to convince the other</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees on the technical staff of the plaintiff to do likewise.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">In the result, all but one of the 45 members of the plaintiff's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">technical staff apparently &quot;signed on&quot; with Valcom. Both</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">companies presented the same staff in their tender offerings, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Valcom was the successful bidder.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  In the statement of claim as amended, and in addition to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages sought against its own employees and Valcom, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff seeks damages against the respondents to this appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for inducing breach of contract, for interference with economic</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests and relations and for inducing breaches of fiduciary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty. Judging from the argument of the appellant, it appears that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the focus of the claim against the respondents is now limited to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">inducing breach of fiduciary duty.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Decisions Below
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On the original motion, Mercier J. commented that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances of this case are very different from those normally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found in cases where the plaintiff seeks to pierce the corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">veil in order to claim liability against employees or directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a company, and concluded that there was more than one triable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue that could not be determined by way of summary judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  A review of the reasons of the Divisional Court [(1997), 105</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">O.A.C. 209] indicates that in allowing the appeal, emphasis was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">placed on the decision of this court in Montreal Trust Co. of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canada v. ScotiaMcLeod Inc. (1995), 129 D.L.R. (4th) 711.1 Since</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the employees of Valcom were not furthering their own interests</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in any respect and were pursuing their duties of employment to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">further the interests of their employer, the Divisional Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relied on ScotiaMcLeod as the basis for concluding that no cause</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of action was revealed which justifies a trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  In its conclusion, the Divisional Court observed (at p.216)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that &quot;[i]n commercial cases such as this, our courts are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carefully examining the trend of simply suing officers, directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and employees in their personal capacities, without really</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">carefully examining the facts or without carefully pleading the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allegations which relate to them personally.&quot;

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Analysis
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  At the outset, my analysis of the pleadings indicates no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">lack of particularity as is often found in similar instances. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings specifically allege that the competitor's employees and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sole director developed the &quot;recruitment&quot; plan, approached the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's employees individually, and were successful in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accomplishing the intended purpose, thereby causing damage to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant. The distinction, if any, between inducing a breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract and inducing a breach of fiduciary duty is not a present</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern on a summary judgment proceeding. If there is to be a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial, that issue can be resolved on the basis of all of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence. The issue that I must deal with is whether, on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assumption that the defendant Valcom committed a tort against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, the sole director and employees of Valcom can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accountable for the same tort as a consequence of their personal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involvement directed to the perceived best interests of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  My first observation is that I recognize the policy concern</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expressed by the Divisional Court, and other General Division</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judges, over the proliferation of claims against officers and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors of corporations in circumstances which give the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appearance of the desire for discovery or leverage in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation process. This is a proper concern because business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot function efficiently if corporate officers and directors</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are inhibited in carrying on a corporate business because of a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fear of being inappropriately swept into lawsuits, or, worse, are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">driven away from involvement in any respect in corporate business</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the potential exposure to ill-founded litigation. That being</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said, it is not appropriate to extend the reasoning of Scotia</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McLeod beyond its intended application by reading it as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protecting all conduct by officers and employees in pursuit of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporate purposes. The common law should not develop on an ad</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">hoc basis to put out fires. When a policy issue arises, here from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">modern business realities, the courts must proceed on a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principled basis to establish a framework for further development</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which recognizes the new realities but preserves the fundamental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose served by that area of law. For this reason I intend to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analyze the development of law in this field from its beginnings.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] That beginning is found in the House of Lords' decision in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co. Ltd., [1895-9] All E.R. 33 (H.L.), which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established that a company, once legally incorporated, must be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treated like any other independent person, with rights and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liabilities appropriate to itself. From time to time, litigants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have sought to lift this &quot;corporate veil&quot;, by seeking to make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principals of the corporation liable for the obligations of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation. However, where, as here, the plaintiff relies upon</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">establishing an independent cause of action against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principals of the company, the corporate veil is not threatened</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the Salomon principle remains intact.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The distinction between an independent cause of action and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">looking through the corporation was confirmed by the subsequent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">case of Said v. Butt, [1920] 3 K.B. 497. This is a King's Bench</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision but has been adopted in Canada and throughout the United</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">States. (See, for instance: Kepic v. Tecumseh Road Builders,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division of Countryside Farms Ltd. (1987), 18 C.C.E.L. 218 (Ont.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.A.) at 222 and Golden v. Anderson (1967), 64 Cal. Rptr. 404 at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">408.)

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In Said v. Butt the plaintiff was engaged in a dispute with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">an opera company which refused to sell him tickets to a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">performance. The plaintiff purchased a ticket through an agent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and when he appeared at the opera the defendant, an employee of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the opera company, recognized him and ejected him. The plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sued the employee for wrongfully procuring the company to break a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract made by the company to sell the plaintiff a ticket.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The court held that there was no contract because the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company would not knowingly have sold a ticket to the plaintiff.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Nevertheless, on the assumption that there was a contract, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court considered the implications to the defendant employee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">McCardie J. stated at p.504:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is well to point out that Sir Alfred Butt
          possessed the widest powers as the chairman
          and sole managing director of the Palace
          Theatre, Ld. He clearly acted within those
          powers when he directed that the plaintiff
          should be refused admission on December 23. I
          am satisfied, also, that he meant to act and
          did act bona fide for the protection of the
          interests of his company. If, therefore, the
          plaintiff, assuming that a contract existed
          between the company and himself, can sue the
          defendant for wrongfully procuring a breach
          of that contract, the gravest and widest
          consequences must ensue.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] After detailing the mischief that would flow from permitting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such claims to be made McCardie J. concluded at p. 506:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I hold that if a servant acting bona
          fide within the scope of his authority
          procures or causes the breach of a contract
          between his employer and a third person, he
          does not thereby become liable to an action
          of tort at the suit of the person whose
          contract has thereby been broken. ... Nothing
          that I have said to-day is, I hope,
          inconsistent with the rule that a director or
          a servant who actually takes part in or
          actually authorizes such torts as assault,
          trespass to property, nuisance, or the like
          may be liable in damages as a joint
          participant in one of such recognized heads
          of tortious wrong.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] For present purposes, I extract the following from McCardie</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.'s reasons. First, this is not an application of Salomon and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Salomon. That case is not mentioned anywhere in the reasons.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Second, it provides an exception to the general rule that persons</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are responsible for their own conduct. That exception has since</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">gained acceptance because it assures that persons who deal with a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limited company and accept the imposition of limited liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">will not have available to them both a claim for breach of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract against a company and a claim for tortious conduct</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the director with damages assessed on a different basis.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The exception also assures that officers and directors, in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">process of carrying on business, are capable of directing that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract of employment be terminated or that a business contract</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not be performed on the assumed basis that the company's best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interest is to pay the damages for failure to perform. By carving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out the exception for these policy reasons, the court has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">emphasized and left intact the general liability of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">individual for personal conduct.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The third point of interest arises from this excerpt from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the reasons at p. 505:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The explanation of the breadth of the
          language used in the decisions probably lies
          in the fact that in every one of the sets of
          circumstances before the Court the person who
          procured the breach of contract was in fact a
          stranger, that is a third person, who stood
          wholly outside the area of the bargain made
          between the two contracting parties. If he is
          in the position of a stranger, he will be
          prima facie liable, even though he may act
          honestly, or without malice, or in the best
          interests of himself; or even if he acts as
          an altruist, seeking only the good of
          another.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The court was there referring to the stranger as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wrongdoer but the same principle might be applied in the converse</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation where the stranger is the victim. This suggestion, was</font></pre>

          involuntary creditors is also useful in this
          area. As commentators have pointed out
          (Halpern, Trebilcock and Turnbull, &quot;An
          Economic Analysis of Limited Liability in
          Corporation Law&quot; (1980), 30 U.T.L.J. 117),
          different types of claimants against the
          corporation have differing abilities to
          benefit from being put on notice with respect
          to the impact of the limited liability
          regime. At one end, creditors like bond
          holders and banks are generally well situated
          to evaluate the risks of default and to
          contract accordingly. These &quot;voluntary&quot;
          creditors can be considered to be capable of
          protecting themselves from the consequences
          of a limited liability regime and the
          practically systematic recourse by banks to
          personal guarantees by the principals of
          small companies attests to that fact.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               At the other end of the spectrum are
          classic involuntary tort creditors
          exemplified by a plaintiff who is injured
          when run down by an employee driving a
          motorcar. These involuntary creditors are
          those who never chose to enter into a course

          corporations, they were immune from
          liability. The court erred in so concluding.
          Plaintiff's action is for an intentional

          directing mind when Krell was both hired and
          fired. However, that alone is not enough to
          find him liable for inducing the breach of
          the Truckers-Krell employment contract. At
          the very least the evidence must establish,
          to a degree of probability, that some
          separate interest from Teperman's standpoint
          was involved. See Ontario Store Fixtures Inc.
          v. Mmmuffins Inc. (1989), 70 O.R. (2d) 42. If
          that were not the case the directing mind of
          any corporate employer would be liable for
          the tort of inducing a breach of contract in
          the event an employee was wrongfully

          McFadden v. 481782 Ont. Ltd. (1984), 47 O.R.
          (2d) 134 (H.C.), the individual defendants
          wrongfully removed money from the company for

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] The Divisional Court placed its prime reliance on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment in ScotiaMcLeod Inc. and in doing so created a much</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">broader canvass for the reasoning of this court than it was, by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its language, intended to fill. That case concerned whether a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasonable cause of action was pleaded against certain individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors of the defendant company. The plaintiff's complaint was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that, as a result of certain filing statements, it had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misled into making investments in the defendant corporation's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">debentures.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] The dismissal of the claim against what I will call a group</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of non-active directors was upheld because the pleading did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allege any negligence against them. The plaintiff sought to hold</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">those directors vicariously liable for the negligence of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation, and no attempt was made in the pleading to single</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out their activities as individuals. This is similar to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">situation in Craik v. Aetna, supra. On the other hand, two of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">directors who had attended and made representations at a due</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">diligence meeting were alleged to have been directly and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">personally involved in the marketing of the debentures and to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have made representations which were relied upon by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs. The action against those active directors was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">permitted to go to trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] An excerpt from the reasoning of Finlayson J.A. in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ScotiaMcLeod Inc. at p.720-21, has been quoted from time to time</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by General Division judges and, here, by the Divisional Court, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">suggesting some limitation on the liability of directors and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">officers who are acting in the course of their duties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               The decided cases in which employees and
          officers of companies have been found
          personally liable for actions ostensibly
          carried out under a corporate name are fact-
          specific. In the absence of findings of
          fraud, deceit, dishonesty or want of
          authority on the part of employees or
          officers, they are also rare. Those cases in
          which the corporate veil has been pierced
          usually involve transactions where the use of
          the corporate structure was a sham from the
          outset or was an afterthought to a deal which
          had gone sour. There is also a considerable
          body of case law wherein injured parties to
          actions for breach of contract have attempted
          to extend liability to the principals of the
          company by pleading that the principals were
          privy to the tort of inducing breach of
          contract between the company and the
          plaintiff: see Ontario Store Fixtures Inc. v.
          Mmmuffins Inc. (1989), 70 O.R. (2d) 42, 16
          A.C.W.S. (3d) 426 (H.J.C.), and the cases
          referred to therein. Additionally there have
          been attempts by injured parties to attach
          liability to the principals of failed
          businesses through insolvency litigation. In
          every case, however, the facts giving rise to
          personal liability were specifically pleaded.
          Absent allegations which fit within the
          categories described above, officers or
          employees of limited companies are protected
          from personal liability unless it can be
          shown that their actions are themselves
          tortious or exhibit a separate identity or
          interest from that of the company so as to
          make the act or conduct complained of their
          own.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] The operative portion of this paragraph is the final</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sentence which confirms that, where properly pleaded, officers or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees can be liable for tortious conduct even when acting in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the course of duty. That this is clearly the intent of what was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being stated is evidenced by the conclusion that the action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should proceed against two defendants against whom negligent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct had been properly pleaded. The reasoning of ScotiaMcLeod</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has been recently applied by this court in decisions which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirm my interpretation.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In Normart Management Limited v. West Hill Redevelopment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Company Limited et al. (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Finlayson J.A. again wrote reasons for this court dealing with an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allegation that individual directors had conspired with their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation to cause injury to a company that had a contractual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relationship with the defendant corporation. At p. 102 Finlayson</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J.A. stated:

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               It is well established that the
          directing minds of corporations cannot be
          held civilly liable for the actions of the
          corporations they control and direct unless
          there is some conduct on the part of those
          directing minds that is either tortious in
          itself or exhibits a separate identity or
          interest from that of the corporations such
          as to make the acts or conduct complained of
          those of the directing minds: see
          ScotiaMcLeod Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd.
          (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 481 at p. 491, 129
          D.L.R. (4th) 711 (C.A.). In the statement of
          claim in appeal, there is no factual
          underpinning to support an allegation that
          the personal defendants were at any time
          acting outside their capacity as directors
          and officers of the corporations of which
          they were the directing minds.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Although not stated in the reasons, the individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defendants were ostensibly entitled to rely upon Said v. Butt</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendant corporation of a contract with the plaintiff</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">corporation. In any event, there is nothing in the reasons to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">detract from my rationale that, where properly pleaded, a claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may be asserted for the tortious conduct of individuals where the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defence in Said v. Butt is not available.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 785 (C.A.) this court dealt with a pleading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the corporate defendant had breached its contract with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiff by failing to obtain appropriate insurance coverage and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the vice-president of the defendant was negligent in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discharging his duties to the plaintiff. Goudge J.A. referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the often quoted excerpt from ScotiaMcLeod and, significantly,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">italicized the words three lines from the end of that quote</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;unless it can be shown that their actions are themselves</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tortious&quot;. Having done so, Goudge J.A. concluded that on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis of the Supreme Court of Canada judgment in London Drugs,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the pleading did support an allegation of breach of duty of care</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against the respondent personally and that this pleading</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justified the case going forward to trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conclusion

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] It is my conclusion that there is no principled basis for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">protecting the director and employees of Valcom from liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for their alleged conduct on the basis that such conduct was in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuance of the interests of the corporation. It may be that for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy reasons the law as to the allocation of responsibility for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tortious conduct should be adjusted to provide some protection to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employees, officers or directors, or all of them, in limited</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">circumstances where, for instance, they are acting in the best</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests of the corporation with parties who have voluntarily</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">chosen to accept the ambit of risk of a limited liability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">company. However, the creation of such a policy should not evolve</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the facts of this case where the alleged conduct was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">intentional and the only relationship between the corporate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties was as competitors. Any such evolution should await facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which are apposite to the policy concerns and should probably be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">articulated as a definitive extension of the defence in Said v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Butt. Such a development would be in the direction indicated by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">La Forest J. in his dissenting reasons in London Drugs and thus</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may have to await further consideration by the Supreme Court. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the meantime the courts can only be scrupulous in weeding out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims that are improperly pleaded or where the evidence does not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">justify an allegation of a personal tort. A principled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">development of jurisprudence is the tradition and the strength of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the common law and must take precedence over incidental attempts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to abuse the law as it develops.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] For these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order of the Divisional Court, and dismiss the original motion</font></pre>
