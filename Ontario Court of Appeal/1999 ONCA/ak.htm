    <pre>On appeal from their convictions by Mr. Justice H. David Logan,
sitting with a jury, on February 24, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A., McMURTRY C.J.O. concurring:</pre>
    <pre>I.   Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following their trial by judge and jury, the appellants were
convicted  of  a  number of sexual offences against  children  in
their  family  and were each sentenced to a term of  five  years'
imprisonment.  They  appeal against their  convictions  and  seek
leave to appeal their sentences.
[2]  The conviction appeal raises two main issues. The first
issue concerns the right of an accused charged with sexual
offences to challenge prospective jurors for cause on the ground
that the juror, by reason of the nature of the offence, is not
indifferent between the Queen and the accused. The second issue
relates to the admissibility of expert evidence called by the
Crown to explain the complainants&#146; delayed disclosure and other
features of the complainants' behaviour. The conviction appeal
also raises other issues regarding the propriety of Crown
counsel&#146;s cross-examination of defence witnesses, the correctness
of the charge to the jury on reasonable doubt and character
evidence and the sufficiency of the competency hearing with
respect to one of the complainants. Leave to appeal the sentence
is sought on the ground that the sentence imposed is excessive
having regard to the personal circumstances of each accused.
[3]  On the first issue, it is my view that the trial judge was
correct in refusing to permit the proposed challenge for cause.
This ground of appeal essentially turns on the question whether
this court&#146;s decision in R. v. Betker (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 421
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
refused February 26, 1998, has been effectively overruled by the
Supreme Court of Canada in the subsequent decision of R. v.
Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).  In my view, it
has not. Although Betker must now be read in the light of the
principles in Williams, it remains authoritative and essentially
disposes of this ground of appeal.
[4]  On the second issue, I am of the view that it was open to
the trial judge to allow the Crown to call expert opinion
evidence on some restricted subject-matters. However, the
prejudicial effect of the expert evidence called by the Crown at
trial far exceeded its probative value and should not have been
admitted. The expert evidence took on such importance at the
trial that it cannot be said that no substantial wrong has been
occasioned by this error. Consequently, on this ground alone,
there must be a new trial.
[5]  In view of my conclusion that there must be a new trial I
will only address the other issues raised on the conviction
appeal to the extent that they may impact on the conduct of the
new trial and I will not deal with the sentence appeal.</pre>
    <pre>II.  The Right to Challenge for Cause
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   The application at trial</pre>
    <pre>[6]   At the commencement of their trial on January 23, 1995, the
appellants  brought  an application to challenge  for  cause  all
prospective  jurors because of the nature of  the  offences.  The
appellants A. K. and N. K. are brothers. They were tried  jointly
with  two  other accused on a 29 count indictment involving  four
complainants.  The  other  two  accused  are  A.K.&#146;s  sons.   The
complainants are granddaughters of A.K. and grandnieces  of  N.K.
The  charges  relate  to sexual abuse alleged  to  have  occurred
between 1978 and 1992 when the complainants were between the ages
of  4 and 12. Following a month long trial, A.K. was convicted of
7  sexual  offences  against  the  four  complainants.  N.K.  was
convicted  of  7 sexual offences against two of the complainants.
The other two accused were acquitted on all counts.
[7]  The appellants alleged before the trial judge that there was
a realistic potential for partiality because of the nature of the
charges themselves. They argued that allegations of sexual abuse,
particularly as against children, give rise to such strong
feelings, opinions and beliefs in the general population that
there is a real risk that some prospective jurors might decide
the case based on their personal views rather than solely on the
evidence and in accordance with the judge&#146;s instructions on the
law.  They argued that the right to challenge for cause should be
recognized in all cases of sexual offences.
[8]  The appellants further argued before the trial judge that
the jury selection process that resulted in a mistrial on May 18,
1994 demonstrated a realistic potential for partiality entitling
them on that basis alone to the statutory right of challenge for
cause. The appellants relied on the following history of the
proceedings in support of this latter argument.
[9]  The appellants first appeared for trial before Logan J. and
a jury on May 10, 1994. No application to challenge for cause was
made at the time and the jury selection commenced. Following
arraignment and plea before the jury panel, and prior to calling
prospective jurors forward, the trial judge vetted the panel for
bias. He briefly described the nature of the allegations, and
advised the members of the panel that, if selected on the jury,
they would be required to arrive at a decision based solely on
the evidence.  He then asked if anyone felt that they were
incapable of setting aside any biases. Eleven members of the
panel came forward and advised the trial judge that they could
not be impartial. The jury selection then proceeded and a jury
was empanelled. The proceedings of May 10, 1994 are not in issue
on this appeal.1
[10] On May 11, 1994 the Crown called its first witness. Upon
entering the courtroom, the witness advised the Crown that one of
the jurors was known to her. Following a voir dire, the juror was
discharged. Given the anticipated length of the trial, all
counsel agreed that a mistrial should be declared and that a new
jury should be selected from the same panel the following Monday.
The trial judge was reluctant to accede to this request as he
anticipated that it could be difficult to select a jury from the
number of members left in the panel. In his view, the trial
should either proceed with 11 jurors or be put over for jury
selection before another panel. However, in light of comments
made by this court  in R. v. Textor (1993), 75 O.A.C. 396, leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused May 26, 1994
that the right of an accused to a jury of 12 should not be
lightly interfered with, the trial judge finally declared a
mistrial.  Based on counsel&#146;s insistence for an early date, the
trial judge adjourned the proceedings to the following Monday, on
May 16, 1994 for jury selection before the same panel.
[11] At the commencement of the day on May 16, 1994, defence
counsel, now anticipating some difficulties in selecting a jury
from the same panel, made an application to challenge for cause
in an attempt to address some of those concerns. Eleven questions
were suggested, including questions on bias. Following
discussions with counsel, the trial judge allowed the application
and approved six of the proposed questions. Because the
appellants are contending that an apprehension of bias was raised
by the answers given to those questions by some members of the
jury panel, it is important to consider the actual questions that
were asked. I therefore reproduce them here.
          </pre>
    <pre>               As the judge will tell you, in  deciding
          whether or not the prosecution has proven the
          charges  against  the  accused, a  juror must
          judge the evidence  of the  witnesses without
          bias, prejudice, or partiality.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Have you ever suffered sexual abuse  or
          sexual   assault,   or  known   closely   any
          individual  who has claimed to have  suffered
          sexual   assault,  sexual  abuse,  or  sexual
          misconduct, such that you would be unable  to
          be  impartial as between the prosecution  and
          the defence in this case?
          </pre>
    <pre>               In spite of the judge&#146;s direction, would
          your ability to judge witnesses without bias,
          prejudice, or partiality be affected  by  the
          fact that the charges involve allegations  of
          sexual  misconduct, sexual assault, or sexual
          abuse of children?
          </pre>
    <pre>               In spite of the judge&#146;s direction, would
          your ability to judge witnesses without bias,
          prejudice, or partiality be affected  by  the
          fact that the charges involve allegations  of
          sexual  misconduct, sexual assault, or sexual
          abuse  by a male, or males, against a female,
          or females?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Did you discuss, or have you heard  the
          reason why a previous juror was discharged?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Do you think a previous challenge of you
          will  cause you to be biased, prejudiced,  or
          partial  towards either the  defence  or  the
          prosecution?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Has  anything that has happened in  the
          process thus far affected your ability to  be
          unbiased,  impartial, or indifferent  between
          the defence or the prosecution?</pre>
    <pre>[12] The jury selection process for the second trial commenced on
May  16,  1994.  Over  the course of three  days,  48  peremptory
challenges  were made; 47 members of the panel were found  to  be
partial  due to their answers to the questions asked  during  the
challenge  for cause process; and nine jurors were  selected.  On
May  18, 1994, the third day of the selection process, the  panel
was exhausted. The trial judge refused to exercise his discretion
under  s.642 to summons other jurors from the community  because,
in  his  view, an additional 100 persons would have to be brought
in  and  this  would cause too much hardship on  members  of  the
community. A second mistrial was therefore declared.
[13] The transcript reveals that many members of the panel were
confused by the questions asked on the challenge. They often
asked that the question be repeated or indicated that they did
not understand it. The answers given to the questions were at
times confusing. The prospective jurors who gave a simple &#147;yes&#148;
to any one or more of the questions were successfully challenged.
Others who were successfully challenged gave answers such as the
following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Well, I have an 11 year old daughter, and I think I would be
          biased.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I think I would be affected emotionally.
          I wouldn&#146;t be able to make a fair decision.
          </pre>
    <pre>                It is difficult for me to&#151;how should  I
          say it, I am having difficulty with this kind
          of   charges,  basically,  because  from   my
          culture that I have, this doesn&#146;t happen that
          often, so I am having difficulty dealing with
          the  facts  as far as what might be presented
          in this case.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Yes,  I  would  be. I have  a  daughter
          myself, and I have certain feelings.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 Yes,  in  all  honesty  we  have  been
          speaking amongst ourselves whether this would
          be  true or not, the accusations, the charges
          have &#150; I just became a father just over three
          months  ago, and if something like this  were
          to  be true, it would come down very hard  on
          me  emotionally.  Hearing the  charges  being
          read bothered me emotionally. I don&#146;t &#150; I did
          not  want to believe that something like this
          could  happen, so &#150; and if it was brought  to
          light that indeed it was true, it takes a lot
          out  of  a person. So as a father, I&#146;d rather
          believe  that  it never happened,  could  not
          happen. Am I making any sense?
          </pre>
    <pre>                I really can&#146;t answer. I don&#146;t know.  I
          don&#146;t  know  how I would be affected  by  the
          information given to me. I do seem to have  a
          pre-judgment  in my mind. I have  seen  these
          gentlemen in the hallway since last week, and
          I  can&#146;t help but feel what I feel. I think I
          would   have  a  difficult  time  trying   to
          separate the facts with my emotions.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 As  a  mother  and  a  grandmother,  I
          wouldn&#146;t  like to swear on that, one  way  or
          the other.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Pertaining  to  the sexual  assault,  I
          would &#150; I would be biased, yeah, I &#150; I am not
          close  with one, but I &#150; it was a friend  who
          was, so I am.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  don&#146;t  know  because  I  have  three
          children  of my own, and I don&#146;t  know  if  I
          could.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  would  find it difficult to  not  be
          biased.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Well,  my wife was abused when she  was
          younger&#133;  I  guess [I would be unable  to  be
          impartial.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                I may have some trouble with that maybe
          because my wife is a school teacher.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  believe myself to be a fair man, but
          in  light of my two daughters, one being  ten
          and  one  being eleven, I must admit  that  I
          have some concern. It&#146;s also my understanding
          that  the evidence is going to be potentially
          graphic  or &#150; as it is probably necessary  to
          do,  and  I must admit I find that  a  little
          upsetting. I&#146;m sorry, that may not be a clear
          answer.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I was sexually assaulted one time, so I
          have a hard time to deal with this.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have a very strong feeling about that.
          .. I&#146;d have great difficulty with it.
          </pre>
    <pre>                That&#146;s  hard to answer.  I  don&#146;t  &#150;  I
          really don&#146;t know. I don&#146;t know what to  say.
          I  feel  very  strongly, and I&#146;m quite  upset
          about these charges, so&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  have five children of my own  so  it
          might. I might find it hard to be objective.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I think I going to be bias because I got
          two  daughters, fourteen years old and  eight
          years old.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I can&#146;t say for sure.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I really can&#146;t answer that, like unless
          I  get  into  &#150; you know, I think I  probably
          would be, yeah.</pre>
    <pre>[14] At the end of the process, the trial judge commented on  the
challenge process as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In retrospect, and it is nice to look at things in retrospect,
          in my view the first three questions were too long. It was
          obvious that some had difficulty grasping the whole question,
          and that is something that would have to be looked at in the
          future by myself.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The next appearance for trial was on January 23, 1995, again
before Logan J.  As stated earlier, defence counsel relied on the
previous aborted selection of the jury as an additional basis  to
challenge  for  cause. It was argued that, in  the  eyes  of  the
accused, there was an apprehension of bias by reason of the  fact
that, over the course of the three-day aborted selection process,
they had repeatedly observed members of a jury panel declare that
they  could not be impartial. The appellants sought leave to  ask
the following question:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     As His Honour will tell you, in deciding whether or
          not the Crown has proven the charges against an accused person,
          a juror must judge the evidence of all witnesses without bias,
          prejudice or partiality; that is the juror must decide the case
          with an open and fair mind. In this case, the complainants are
          related to the accused persons and allege that over a number of
          years, while they were young girls, they were sexually abused by
          the accused men, who are relatives of theirs. Knowing these
          allegations, do you believe that you can set aside any
          preconceived biases, prejudices or partiality that you may hold
          and decide this case with a fair and impartial mind?</pre>
    <pre>[16] In addition to the aborted selection process, the appellants
relied on the following material:

     a)   an unsigned and unsworn affidavit purportedly written by
          professor Neil Vidmar in 1993;
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)   six articles on the subject of challenge for cause written
          by counsel; 2
          </pre>
    <pre>     c)   the transcript from one previous trial in which such  a
          challenge had been permitted; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     d)   reference  in argument to other cases where  a  similar
          challenge was permitted.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  During  the  course of the argument on the  application  at
trial,  defence counsel acknowledged that they could not rely  on
Professor  Vidmar&#146;s  affidavit given the fact  that  it  was  not
authenticated.
[18] The trial judge refused to permit the challenge for cause.
In his view, the material, including the unsigned affidavit by
Professor Neil Vidmar, did not demonstrate the existence of
generalized beliefs or prejudices that shape the daily behaviour
of individuals. He held that the issue was unlike that in R. v.
Parks (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada refused April 28, 1994, where the
application was based on widespread racism. He concluded as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                          Racism is a complex set of ideas which amount to
          an ideology. Historically, it is an organized set of beliefs that
          promotes the superiority of one racial group over another. The
          same principles, as far as I can make out from the information
          filed, do not apply to [this case]&#133; The application is denied.
     </pre>
    <pre>At  the  commencement of the trial, the trial judge again  vetted
the  panel for bias on the basis of the nature of the allegations
as he had done earlier on May 10, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>          
              B.   The issues on appeal</pre>
    <pre>[19]  This ground of appeal raises essentially the same  question
that  was  before this court in R. v. Betker. It  was  argued  in
Betker  that  an accused who is charged with  sexual offences  is
entitled, as of right, to challenge prospective jurors for  cause
because  of  the  nature  of the charges. The  evidentiary  basis
relied  upon  in Betker was very similar to that  filed  in  this
case.  Moldaver  J.A., in writing for the court,  held  that  the
evidence  did  not show a realistic potential for partiality  and
that, consequently, the trial judge had not erred in refusing  to
permit the proposed challenge.
[20] The appellants submit that the rationale in Betker was
effectively overruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in the
subsequent decision of R. v. Williams.  As a result, three
arguments are advanced.3
[21] First, it is argued that, based on the precedential value of
Williams alone and regardless of the material filed in support of
the application for challenge for cause, this court should take
judicial notice of the existence of generic prejudice, arising
from stereotypical attitudes about the nature of the crime itself
and from bias against persons charged with sex abuse.  It is
argued that the existence of this generic prejudice entitles an
accused person to challenge prospective jurors for cause in all
cases involving sexual offences.
[22] Second, it is argued in the alternative that Williams has
effectively overruled this court&#146;s finding in Betker.
Consequently, it is submitted that this court should revisit its
finding in Betker and conclude that the material filed at trial
in this case showed a realistic potential for partiality giving
rise to a right to challenge for cause in all cases involving
sexual offences.
[23] Third, and in the further alternative, it is argued that,
even if Betker remains authoritative, the present case can be
distinguished on the basis of the reasonable apprehension of bias
arising from the aborted jury selection described above.

          C.   Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  right to challenge prospective jurors is  a  statutory
right  set  out  in  the Criminal Code. The  appellants  rely  on
s.638(1)(b):
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.638(1) A prosecutor or an accused is entitled to any number of
          challenges on the ground that
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (b)  a  juror  is not  indifferent
          between the Queen and the accused;</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  right  to challenge jurors on the ground  of  lack  of
indifference  was recently the subject of review by  the  Supreme
Court  of  Canada  in  R.  v. Williams. Williams,  an  aboriginal
person,  was  charged with robbery. At his trial, he  applied  to
question  potential jurors for racial bias under  s.638(1)(b)  of
the  Criminal  Code.  In  support of his  application,  he  filed
materials  that  alleged  widespread  racism  against  aboriginal
people  in  Canadian  society. The  application  was  denied  and
Williams was convicted. His appeal to the British Columbia  Court
of  Appeal was dismissed.  On further appeal to the Supreme Court
of  Canada, the appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered on
the ground that the proposed challenge for cause should have been
permitted.
[26] The appellants contend that Williams has expanded the right
to challenge for cause. In my view, the Supreme Court in Williams
simply reiterated established principles and clarified the law on
the applicable test that must be met by an applicant before the
right to challenge for cause can be exercised.
[27] The Court recognized that &#147;lack of indifference&#148; may be
translated as &#147;partiality&#148; and the term was defined as follows
(at p.488):
          </pre>
    <pre>                          &#147;Lack of indifference&#148; or &#147;partiality&#148;, in turn,
          refers to the possibility that a juror&#146;s knowledge or beliefs may
          affect the way he or she discharges the jury function in a way
          that is improper or unfair to the accused. A juror who is partial
          or &quot;not indifferent&quot; is a juror who is inclined to a certain
          party or a certain conclusion. The synonyms for &#147;partial&#148; in
          Burton&#146;s Legal Thesaurus (2nd ed. 1992), at p.370, illustrate the
          attitudes that may serve to disqualify a juror:
               </pre>
    <pre>                     bigoted&#133; discriminatory, favorably
               disposed, inclined, influenced&#133; interested,
               jaundiced,   narrow-minded,   one-sided,
               partisan,    predisposed,    prejudiced,
               prepossessed, prone, restricted&#133; subjective,
               swayed, unbalanced, unequal, uneven, unfair,
               unjust, unjustified, unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[28]  The  Court reiterated the principles established in  R.  v.
Sheratt (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.). The Court emphasized
that  the  right to challenge for cause is not only  a  statutory
right  conferred upon the prosecutor and the accused. It is  also
an  important means of safeguarding the accused&#146;s right to a fair
trial  by an impartial tribunal guaranteed under s.11(d)  of  the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Because of this Charter
guarantee, the Court stated that (at p.499):
          </pre>
    <pre>                     [t]his means that the accused must be permitted to
          challenge potential jurors where there is a realistic potential
          or possibility that some among the jury pool may harbour
          prejudices that deprive them of their impartiality.</pre>
    <pre>However,  the  Court confirmed that the right  to  challenge  for
cause,  although  neither exceptional nor extraordinary,  is  not
automatic.  An  accused  may  challenge  for  cause   only   upon
establishing  that  there  is  a realistic  potential  for  juror
partiality.  The  Court  distinguished  this  approach  from  the
approach taken in the United States (at p.489)
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The practical problem is how to ascertain when a
          potential juror may be partial or &#147;not indifferent&#148; between the
          Crown and the accused. There are two approaches to this problem.
          The first approach is that prevailing in the United States. On
          this approach, every jury panel is suspect. Every candidate for
          jury duty may be challenged and questioned as to preconceptions
          and prejudices on any sort of trial. As a result, lengthy trials
          of jurors before the trial of the accused are routine.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Canada   has  taken  a  different
          approach.  In  this country,  candidates  for
          jury  duty are presumed to be indifferent  or
          impartial.  Before the Crown or  the  accused
          can  challenge and question them,  they  must
          raise    concerns   which    displace    that
          presumption.  Usually this  is  done  by  the
          party  seeking the challenge calling evidence
          substantiating  the  basis  of  the  concern.
          Alternatively, where the basis of the concern
          is  &#147;notorious&#148; in the sense of being  widely
          known  and accepted, the law of evidence  may
          permit a judge to take judicial notice of it.</pre>
    <pre>The Court stated further at paragraph 52, p.501:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In my view, the rule enunciated by this Court in
          Sheratt, supra, suffices to maintain the right to a fair and
          impartial trial, without adopting the United States model of a
          variant on it. Sheratt starts from the presumption that members
          of the jury pool are capable of serving as impartial jurors. This
          means that there can be no automatic right to challenge for
          cause. In order to establish such a right, the accused must show
          that there is a realistic potential that some members of the jury
          pool may be biased in a way that may impact negatively on the
          accused.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  The Court also reviewed the two ways in which facts can  be
established  in the trial process. The first is by  evidence  and
the second is by judicial notice. The Court gave some guidance on
the application of the doctrine of judicial notice in the context
of  challenges for cause. As the appellants in this case seek  to
invoke  this doctrine, it may be useful to reproduce the comments
made in Williams (at p.502):
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Judicial notice is the acceptance of a fact without
          proof. It applies to two kinds of facts: (1) facts which are so
          notorious as not be [sic] the subject of dispute among
          reasonable persons; and (2) facts that are capable of immediate
          and accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible
          sources of indisputable accuracy: see Sopinka, Lederman and
          Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, at p.976. The existence
          of racial prejudice in the community may be a notorious fact
          within the first branch of the rule. As Sopinka, Lederman and
          Bryant note, at p.977, &#147;[t]he character of a certain place or of
          the community of persons living in a certain locality has been
          judicially noticed&#148;. Widespread racial prejudice, as a
          characteristic of the community, may therefore sometimes be the
          subject of judicial notice. Moreover, once a finding of fact of
          widespread racial prejudice in the community is made on
          evidence, as here, judges in subsequent cases may be able to
          take judicial notice of the fact. &#147;The fact that a certain fact
          or matter has been noted by a judge of the same court in a
          previous matter has precedential value and it is, therefore,
          useful for counsel and the court to examine the case law when
          attempting to determine whether any particular fact can be
          noted&quot;: see Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, supra, at p.977. It is
          also possible that events and documents of indisputable accuracy
          may permit judicial notice to be taken of widespread racism in
          the community under the second branch of the rule. For these
          reasons, it is unlikely that long inquiries into the existence
          of widespread racial prejudice in the community will become a
          regular feature of the criminal trial process. While these
          comments are not necessarily limited to challenges for cause,
          the question whether they are applicable to other phases of the
          criminal trial is not to be decided in the present case.</pre>
    <pre>[30]  As  indicated earlier, it is the appellants&#146; first argument
that  this court, on the basis of Williams, should take  judicial
notice  of  the fact that with respect to certain offences  there
exists a widespread bias in the community giving rise to concerns
about  prospective  jurors&#146;  impartiality.  It  is  argued   that
allegations  of  sexual abuse, particularly as against  children,
give  rise to such strong feelings, opinions and beliefs  in  the
general   population  that  there  is  a  real  risk  that   some
prospective jurors might decide the case based on their  personal
views  rather than solely on the evidence and in accordance  with
the  judge&#146;s instructions on the law. Reliance is placed  on  the
following excerpt from Williams in support of the contention that
an accused is now entitled, as of right, to challenge prospective
jurors  for cause in all cases of sexual assault because  of  the
nature of the charges (at p. 488):
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Generic prejudice, the class of prejudice at issue on
          this appeal, arises from stereotypical attitudes about the
          defendant, victims, witnesses or the nature of the crime itself.
          Bias against a racial or ethnic group or against persons charged
          with sex abuse are examples of generic prejudice. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[31]  I  do not accept the appellants&#146; argument that the  Supreme
Court  in Williams has recognized a right to challenge for  cause
in all cases of sex abuse. Although the above-noted two sentences
do make reference to bias against persons charged with sex abuse,
they  must  not be read out of context. Williams could only  have
the  precedential value contended by the appellants if the  Court
had actually taken judicial notice of the matter.  It did not.
[32] Williams was a case of racial prejudice. The issue of
offence-based challenges for cause was not before the Court in
Williams. Crown counsel confirm in their factum that there was no
evidence, testing or analysis of any expert theories on the
subject of offence-based challenges at any level of the Williams
proceedings. The issue was not even raised in oral argument
before the Supreme Court. The above-noted reference is taken from
one article which itself contains no analysis of the issue. The
excerpt is found in the following paragraph at the beginning of
the Court&#146;s analysis on the issue (at p. 488):
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The predisposed state of mind caught by the term
          &#147;partial&#148; may arise from a variety of sources. Four classes of
          potential juror prejudice have been identified &#150; interest,
          specific, generic and conformity: see Neil Vidmar, &#147;Pretrial
          prejudice in Canada: a comparative perspective on the criminal
          jury&#148; (1996), 79 Jud. 249 at p. 252. Interest prejudice arises
          when jurors may have a direct stake in the trial due to their
          relationship to the defendant, the victim, witnesses or outcome.
          Specific prejudice involves attitudes and beliefs about the
          particular case that may render the juror incapable of deciding
          guilt or innocence with an impartial mind. These attitudes and
          beliefs may arise from personal knowledge of the case, publicity
          through mass media, or public discussion and rumour in the
          community. Generic prejudice, the class of prejudice at issue on
          this appeal, arises from stereotypical attitudes about the
          defendant, victims, witnesses or the nature of the crime itself.
          Bias against a racial or ethnic group or against persons charged
          with sex abuse are examples of generic prejudice. Finally,
          conformity prejudice arises when the case is of significant
          interest to the community causing a juror to perceive that there
          is strong community feeling about a case coupled with an
          expectation as to the outcome. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[33]  I  agree with the Crown&#146;s characterization of  the  remarks
made by the Court on the subject of offence based challenges - at
best,  they are &#147;passing remarks&#148; for the purpose of illustrating
the  main  issue of racial bias. It is correct to  say  that  the
Supreme  Court does not foreclose the nature of the crime  itself
as  a  potential  source  of  partiality.  This  is  not  at  all
surprising since the issue was not raised and there was no record
before  the Supreme Court that would enable it to make a  finding
either  way  on the issue.4  Hence I cannot accept  the  argument
that the Supreme Court intended by those remarks to dispense with
the  need  to  show  a realistic potential of  the  existence  of
partiality  in  all cases of sexual offences. This contention  is
simply  unsupportable when one considers the  record  before  the
Court and the judgment in its entirety.5
[34] In their second argument, the appellants submit that
Williams has overruled Betker, holding that the test enunciated
in that case was too high and that, consequently,  this court, in
considering the evidence in this case, should arrive at a
different conclusion than it did in Betker. The appellants rely
on the following statement in Williams (at p.492):
          </pre>
    <pre>                          It follows that I respectfully disagree with the
          suggestion in R. v. B. (A.) (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 321 at p.343,
          115 C.C.C. (3d) 421 sub. nom. R. v. Betker (C.A.) that a motion
          to challenge for cause must be dismissed if there is &#147;no concrete
          evidence&#148; that any of the prospective jurors &#147;could not set aside
          their biases&#148;. Where widespread racial bias is shown, it may well
          be reasonable for the trial judge to infer that some people will
          have difficulty identifying and eliminating their biases. It is
          therefore reasonable to permit challenges for cause.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In effect, the Supreme Court in Williams recognized that the
impugned  words in Betker may serve to confuse the two phases  of
the  challenge  for  cause  process. Crown  counsel  in  Williams
adopted  a  position  consistent with the  above-noted  words  in
Betker  and  the  Supreme Court rejected  the  Crown&#146;s  position.
Later   in   the  judgment,  the  Supreme  Court  clarified   the
distinction  that should be drawn between the two phases  of  the
process (at pp. 495-6):
          </pre>
    <pre>          Section 638(2) [sic] requires two inquiries and entails two
          different decisions with two different tests. The first stage is
          the inquiry before the judge to determine whether challenges for
          cause should be permitted. The test at this stage is whether
          there is a realistic potential or possibility for partiality.
          The question is whether there is reason to suppose that the jury
          pool may contain people who are prejudiced and whose prejudice
          might not be capable of being set aside on directions from the
          judge. The operative verbs at the first stage are &#147;may&#148; and
          &#147;might&#148;. Since this is a preliminary inquiry which may affect
          the accused&#146;s Charter rights (see below), a reasonably generous
          approach is appropriate.
          </pre>
    <pre>                If  the  judge  permits challenges  for
          cause,   a  second  inquiry  occurs  on   the
          challenge  itself. The defence  may  question
          potential  jurors as to whether they  harbour
          prejudices  against people of  the  accused&#146;s
          race, and if so, whether they are able to set
          those  prejudices aside and act as  impartial
          jurors. The question at this stage is whether
          the candidate in question will be able to act
          impartially.  To  demand, at the  preliminary
          stage of determining whether a challenge  for
          cause  should  be permitted, proof  that  the
          jurors  in the jury pool will not be able  to
          set aside any prejudices they may harbour and
          act  impartially, is to ask the question more
          appropriate for the second stage.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  Crown conflates the two stages  of
          the  process. Instead of asking whether there
          is  a  potential or possibility of partiality
          at  the  stage  of determining the  right  to
          challenge  for cause, it demands  proof  that
          widespread  racism will result in  a  partial
          jury.  The  assumption is  that  absent  such
          evidence,  no challenge for cause  should  be
          permitted.   This  is  not  the   appropriate
          question   at   the  preliminary   stage   of
          determining the right to challenge for cause.
          The  question  at this stage is  not  whether
          anyone  in  the  jury pool will  in  fact  be
          unable   to  set  aside  his  or  her  racial
          prejudices  but whether there is a  realistic
          possibility that this could happen.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Williams makes it clear that there is no need at the  first
stage  of the inquiry to present &#147;concrete evidence&#148; that  jurors
could  not  set aside their biases. Whether or not  a  particular
juror  will be able to set aside his or her biases is a  question
to  be determined at the second stage of the process. However, as
the  above excerpt clearly shows, this does not in any  way  mean
that  there is no need at the first stage of the process to  show
that  a)  there exists a particular prejudice amongst members  of
the  community and b) that the prejudice in question might result
in  some jurors being incapable of setting aside their biases  on
directions  from  the  judge. As recognized  in  both  Parks  and
Williams,  prejudice that may result in partiality  has  both  an
attitudinal  and  a  behavioural component.  And,  as  stated  in
Williams, where widespread racial bias is shown, it may  well  be
reasonable  for  the trial judge to infer that some  people  will
have  difficulty identifying and eliminating their biases,  given
the fact that &#147;[r]acial prejudice and its effects are as invasive
and elusive as they are corrosive&#148; (at p. 492).
[37] In the case at bar, the question is not one of racial
prejudice. It is not sufficient simply to show that members of
the community may have strong feelings, opinions and beliefs
about a certain subject-matter. It must be shown first that those
Sfeelings, opinions and beliefs&#148; are demonstrative of an attitude
that is inconsistent with impartiality and second that there is a
possibility that some jurors might not be able to set aside the
biases that result from this attitude. This court in Betker was
not satisfied that either component of partiality had been shown
and, in my view, Williams does not impact upon the operative
reasoning in Betker.
[38] In Betker, the appellant was convicted of indecent assault,
gross indecency and incest.  The complainant was his daughter. At
the outset of the jury selection process, defence counsel applied
under s.638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to challenge each
prospective juror for cause on the basis that there was a
realistic possibility that one or more of the prospective jurors
would not be impartial between the Crown and the accused, because
of the nature of the charges of sexual assault between father and
daughter.
[39] In support of the application, the appellant in Betker
relied on (a) excerpts from several studies and surveys conducted
in Canada showing that a large percentage of the population, both
male and female, have been the victims of sexual assault and (b)
excerpts from several trial decisions in Ontario where challenges
for cause were permitted in cases of sexual assault together with
articles reviewing and analyzing the results of this process. The
court also considered topical articles by Professors Neil Vidmar
and David Paciocco.
[40] The evidentiary basis relied upon in this case is similar in
kind but appears to be much less extensive than that before the
court in Betker, particularly when no consideration is given to
the unsigned affidavit allegedly written by Professor Vidmar.
Even considering this affidavit, the trial judge concluded that
the appellants had not met the threshold test. I agree with the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion. Just as this court held in Betker, I am
of the view that the evidentiary basis relied upon in this case
does not demonstrate the existence of a realistic potential for
partiality based on the nature of the offences.
[41] The argument made in this case is similar to that made by
counsel for the appellant in Betker.  Counsel rely on the
evidence before the court in support of the contention that
accused persons charged with sexual assault are subject to a form
of juror partiality analogous to the racism discussed in Parks.
This court rejected this contention in Betker and held that the
appellant&#146;s argument was &#147;fundamentally flawed in that it fails
to recognize the principled distinction between a want of
indifference towards the accused and a want of indifference
towards the nature of the crime.&#148; The court held that the racial
prejudice at issue in Parks was conceptually different from
strongly held views about a particular crime (at p. 441):
          </pre>
    <pre>               Racial prejudice is a form of bias directed against a
          particular class of accused by virtue of an identifiable
          immutable characteristic. There is a direct and logical
          connection between the prejudice asserted and the particular
          accused. In contrast, the prejudice asserted by the appellant
          involves negative views about a type of crime and not a type of
          person. In my opinion, there is no direct and logical connection
          that translates views about a particular crime into prejudice
          against a specific accused such that jurors would disregard their
          oath and render a verdict based on something other than the
          evidence and the legal instruction provided by the trial judge.
          </pre>
    <pre>                To  be  more precise, I am of the  view
          that  strong  attitudes  about  a  particular
          crime,   even  when  accompanied  by  intense
          feelings of hostility and resentment  towards
          those  who commit the crime, will rarely,  if
          ever, translate into partiality in respect of
          the accused.
The  court  noted  further that one must  not  confuse  pre-trial
partiality  arising  from the nature of  the  crime  with  strong
feelings  of  resentment and hostility fostered by  the  evidence
tendered to prove the crime. The latter cannot form the basis  of
a  permissible challenge for cause: see R. v. Hubbert,  [1977]  2
S.C.R. 267.
</pre>
    <pre>[42]  The  court  in  Betker further  stated  that  even  if  the
appellant  was correct in his assertion that in cases  of  sexual
assault, it is the nature of the crime itself that gives rise  to
potential partiality and not the evidence led in support  of  it,
it  remained  unconvinced that the threshold test  for  pre-trial
partiality  had  been  met.  The  court  was  of  the  view  that
victimization  statistics provided &#147;little, if any,  support  for
the application&#148; (at p.442):
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is nothing in the material filed to indicate when or how
          the statistics were compiled or what questions, using what
          definitions, were asked. Apart from that, the statistics do not
          indicate a resultant bias against all persons accused of all
          sexual offences, let alone the nature and extent of that bias.
          Moreover, they do not purport to address how experiencing sexual
          assault might affect juror behaviour at the deliberation stage.
          In the end, the statistics do no more than establish the
          prevalence of sexual assault in contemporary Canadian society;
          this, by itself, does not support the inference that there is a
          realistic risk of juror partiality.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  In  my  view, the same conclusion must be reached  in  this
case.   As   indicated  earlier,  the  appellants   submit   that
allegations  of  sexual abuse give rise to such strong  feelings,
opinions  and beliefs in the general population that there  is  a
real  risk  that  some prospective jurors might decide  the  case
based  on their personal views rather than solely on the evidence
and  the  law.  In other words, the appellants argue that certain
attitudes  are present in the general population that  may  cause
jurors to behave contrary to their oath. The material before  the
court  does  not demonstrate the presence of such attitudes  that
may  affect behaviour as contended. The &#147;attitudes&#148; are not  even
described, let alone their possible effect on behaviour.
[44] Further, it is my view that the presence of such &#147;strong
feelings, opinions and beliefs&#148; is not a fact capable of being
judicially noticed. It can hardly be said to be a fact that is
&#147;so notorious as not to be the subject of dispute among
reasonable persons&#148; or one that is &#147;capable of immediate and
accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible sources
of indisputable accuracy&#148; (Williams, as quoted above). The work
of Professor Neil Vidmar is generally cited in support of the
notion of &#147;generic prejudice&#148; in relation to the nature of sexual
offences. Professor Vidmar&#146;s views are not indisputable. They are
very much the subject of debate amongst social scientists.
Consider for example Freedman, Jonathan L. and Doob, Anthony N.,
Vidmar&#146;s Generic Prejudice Article: Misleading Notions, Anecdotal
Statistics, Unwarranted Conclusions. Further, as noted in Betker,
Professor Vidmar himself conceded in his cross-examination in R.
v. Hillis, [1996] O.J. No. 2739 (Gen. Div.) that the notion of
&#147;generic bias&#148; does not have scientific validity (Betker at
p.444):
          </pre>
    <pre>                     &#133; in cross-examination, Professor Vidmar admitted that
          &#147;generic bias&#148; was not a scientific label or a recognized term of
          art within his professional community. He also agreed that the
          American studies to which his affidavit referred did not
          generally consider the effect of this type of bias on
          deliberation behaviour. The only study that did examine such
          behaviour found that pre-deliberation attitudes did not correlate
          significantly with post-deliberation verdicts.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The appellants are quite correct in stating that there is no
need for &#147;scientific&#148; certainty in these matters. However, it  is
not  even  clear  what feelings, opinions and beliefs  are  being
targeted  for judicial notice.  Is it the belief that no children
would lie about being sexually abused and that their testimony is
therefore  reliable? Or, rather, is it the belief  that  children
are  highly susceptible to the influence of adults and that their
testimony should not be relied upon? Are the appellants concerned
about  the opinion some may hold that too many charges  are  laid
without foundation out of concern for &#147;political correctness&#148;? Or
is  the  concern  rather  about opinions  that  sexual  abuse  is
pervasive  and  that a person who is charged is probably  guilty?
Are  the  appellants referring to the feeling that some may  have
that allegations of sexual abuse are easily made and difficult to
defend, or rather the feeling that the criminal trial process  is
stacked unfairly in favour of accused persons?
[46] Even accepting for the purpose of argument that many jurors
may have strong feelings, opinions and beliefs about sexual
offences, I am not at all clear on how one could infer from that
fact that there is a risk that those jurors may discharge the
jury function in a way that is improper or unfair to the accused.
I would think it rather more likely that, given their variance,
the effect of these pre-conceived notions would be diffused
during the course of the jurors&#146; deliberations.
[47] The appellants would perhaps respond to this argument by
saying that it does not matter to which conclusion the pre-
conceived notion would lead. It still amounts to partiality in
the sense that the candidate for jury duty may be inclined to a
particular result and this should be canvassed during the second
stage of the challenge process.
[48] In my view, if this court were to accept the appellants&#146;
argument, it would be tantamount to a wholesale adoption of the
approach in the United States. Every juror would be viewed as
suspect. Every candidate for jury duty could be challenged and
questioned as to preconceptions and prejudices in an effort to
uncover potential partiality.  There would be no rational basis
to limit the adoption of this procedure to trials for sexual
offences. Indeed, why would there not be strong feelings,
opinions and beliefs about murders of children, child
pornography, drug trafficking, abuse of the elderly, convenience
store robberies or break and entries in private homes?
[49] More importantly, the contention that all feelings, opinions
and beliefs that may have a bearing on decision-making amount to
prejudice or partiality is, in my view, ill-conceived. Professors
Freedman and Doob make the point quite well in their article that
this wide approach to partiality or prejudice renders the concept
meaningless:6
          </pre>
    <pre>                    We believe that psychologists and others have quite
          deliberately and correctly reserved the term &quot;prejudice&quot; for
          negative attitudes and beliefs about groups of people. Our
          society considers these beliefs wrong and we condemn them&#133;
          Calling all conceivable sources of bias &#147;prejudice&#148; dilutes the
          significance of real prejudice, and merely confuses the issue. In
          short, the concept of generic prejudice is not useful &#150; it makes
          little sense and is likely to produce confusion. It should not be
          accepted.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[50] Williams clearly reiterates that the Canadian approach is to
presume  that prospective jurors are impartial. That  presumption
does not mean that we, as Canadians, expect jurors to come to the
task without any knowledge and without any life experience. It is
inevitable in any case that each juror will bring his or her  own
feelings,  opinions and beliefs to the deliberations.  This  fact
alone  does  not translate into partiality. Candidates  for  jury
duty   are   not,  under  our  system,  routinely  subjected   to
questioning on those feelings, opinions and beliefs in an attempt
to  uncover some possible source of partiality. Such an  approach
would   constitute  an  unwarranted  invasion  of  their  privacy
interests.  General concerns of the kind raised by the appellants
in  this  case  are  addressed on a case by  case  basis  in  the
evidence,  the  argument,  and the instructions  from  the  trial
judge.  We  trust  that jurors will approach  their  duties  with
impartiality as a result of these trial safeguards. We also trust
that  the  deliberation process itself and  the  requirement  for
unanimity will result in the weaknesses of one juror being offset
by the strengths of another.
[51] The appellants rely mostly on the answers given by the
challenged jurors in this case and on excerpts from several trial
decisions in Ontario where challenges for cause were permitted in
cases of sexual assault, together with articles reviewing and
analyzing the results of this process, in support of their
contention that there is a realistic potential for bias. This
argument cannot succeed. In my view, it is impossible to draw any
meaningful inference from the answers provided by the jurors when
confronted with general questions such as those found in the
aborted jury selection process in this case and in other cases
relied upon.
[52] The answers provided by the candidates for jury duty who
were successfully challenged for cause in this case generally
reveal nothing more than they may find it difficult to hear a
case of this kind. Many state that this is because they have
children of their own or they may know someone who has been
victimized. These answers provide no evidence of partiality
whatsoever. And, unless real hardship is shown that would
interfere with the juror&#146;s ability to hear the case, discomfort
at hearing unpleasant evidence can hardly provide sufficient
ground for dismissal from jury duty. A review of the
jurisprudence reveals that, even in the United States where
jurors are routinely questioned on their feelings, opinions and
beliefs, the mere fact that a potential juror may have strong
feelings or views about an offence or has been the victim or is
closely related to a victim of a similar crime is not sufficient
reason to dismiss him or her.7
[53] Some of the challenged jurors expressed concern that they
may not be able to be impartial given their strong emotions about
sexual abuse of children. Even in those instances  it is my view
that, without more, it is impossible to draw any meaningful
inference from those answers. The prospective candidates were not
provided with any meaningful instruction on the nature of jury
duty and on the meaning of impartiality. So little information
was obtained from the prospective jurors that no reasonable
decision could be made on the issue of partiality. No distinction
was drawn between partiality and general feelings, opinions, and
beliefs that influence all decision-making. The mere fact that a
prospective juror may hold an opinion or have a belief that may
in some way influence him or her in making a decision provides no
ground for rejection.  This was made clear in Parks (at 364):
          </pre>
    <pre>               Partiality cannot be equated with bias&#133; Questions which seek
          to do no more than establish that a potential juror has beliefs,
          opinions or biases which may operate for or against a particular
          party cannot establish partiality. A diversity of views and
          outlooks is part of the genius of the jury system and makes jury
          verdicts a reflection of the shared values of the community.</pre>
    <pre>[54]  I  am  not at all suggesting by the above comments  that  a
detailed probing of jurors&#146; beliefs, opinions or biases should be
embarked upon at the second stage of the challenge process so  as
to provide evidence of partiality. That is indeed the whole point
of  the  requirement  for evidence of a realistic  potential  for
partiality, with both its attitudinal and behavioural components,
at  the  first  stage  of  the  inquiry.  In  this  way,  fishing
expeditions   can  be  avoided.  For  example,  in  cases   where
widespread racial prejudice is demonstrated at the first stage of
the  inquiry, we can take it as a given when embarking  upon  the
second  stage  that  many  people in  the  jury  panel  may  have
prejudices of a kind that renders them partial to the extent that
they might not be able to set them aside. Hence few questions are
required  to  weed out the undesirable candidates.  But  in  this
case,  as stated earlier, the evidence before the court does  not
even  identify  the  attitudes that may lead to  partiality,  let
alone their possible effect on behaviour.
[55] It follows that I see no merit to the appellants&#146; final
argument on this issue that the earlier aborted jury selection
process in this case gave rise to such an apprehension of bias in
the eyes of the appellants that the trial judge should have
allowed a challenge for cause in the interest of the appearance
of fairness. The appearance of fairness must be assessed, not
from the subjective point of view of the accused person, but from
the perspective of an informed person who views the matter
realistically and practically and thinks the matter through. In
my view, an informed person could not reasonably conclude that
what transpired during the aborted selection process had any
effect on the fairness of the trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>         D.   Conclusion on right to challenge for cause</pre>
    <pre>[56] The question whether the evidence has met the threshold test
is  one  for determination by the trial judge. Where the test  is
met,  the  trial  judge  cannot,  in  his  discretion,  deny  the
challenging  party&#146;s  right  to a  fair  trial  by  an  impartial
tribunal. In this case, the appellants have not shown a realistic
potential  for  partiality. Consequently,  the  trial  judge  was
correct in refusing to permit the proposed challenge.


</pre>
    <pre>III. The Expert Evidence</pre>
    <pre>          
               A.   The evidence called at trial
               </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Position of the parties at trial</pre>
    <pre>[57]  At trial, Crown counsel sought to call Mr. Alan Grant Fair,
a  social worker with extensive experience in the field of  child
sexual  abuse,  to  give opinion evidence  on  the  behaviour  of
sexually  abused children. The purpose of calling  this  evidence
was two-fold.
[58]  First, the evidence was intended to show that the
complainants in this case exhibited certain behavioural symptoms
during their childhood that were consistent with their
allegations of sexual abuse. Crown counsel also proposed to call
evidence from the parents of the complainants on various aspects
of the complainants&#146; behaviour during the time that they were
growing up to establish a factual foundation for the proposed
expert opinion. The behaviour in question included matters such
as bed wetting, fighting with peers and depression.
[59] Second, the expert opinion evidence was intended to dispel
certain &#147;myths&#148; about children&#146;s behaviour. The Crown sought to
introduce evidence to explain that certain behaviour exhibited by
the complainants was not unusual for victims of sexual abuse and
was not inconsistent with the truth of their allegations. This
behaviour included delayed disclosure of the abuse, inconsistent
versions of the events, denial that abuse occurred, the inability
to recall peripheral matters and the lack of detection by persons
close to the complainants. It was argued that this evidence was
necessary to counter defence counsel&#146;s attack on the
complainants&#146; credibility.
[60] The defence vigorously challenged the validity of the theory
that sexual abuse could be inferred from &#147;behavioural indicators&#148;
observed in an alleged victim. The defence also disputed that the
alleged &#147;myths&#148; still existed in today&#146;s society given the
numerous changes in the law and the increased public awareness of
issues related to child sexual abuse in the last fifteen years.
The defence further argued that because the behaviour in question
was equally consistent with no abuse having occurred, the
proposed evidence in relation to the &#147;myths&#148; could be of no
assistance to the jury in assessing the complainants&#146;
credibility.
               </pre>
    <pre>               2.    Evidence on the voir dire</pre>
    <pre>[61]  A  voir  dire  was  held to address the  issues  raised  by
counsel.  Mr. Fair was called as a witness on the voir dire.  His
testimony  was  essentially based on a  theory  advanced  by  Dr.
Roland  Summit in 1983 in an article entitled &#147;The  Child  Sexual
Abuse  Accommodation Syndrome.&#148; The theory explains  the  various
stages  that  a  typical victim of sexual abuse  experiences  and
describes  various  behavioural indicators of sexual  abuse.  Mr.
Fair  testified  that his clinical observations  were  consistent
with Dr. Summit&#146;s theory.
[62] In cross-examination, Mr. Fair readily conceded that the
theory underlying the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome
is of no diagnostic value. He was aware that Dr. Summit himself,
in later articles, clarified that his theory was never intended
to be used as a diagnostic tool and that its use for that purpose
by behavioural experts testifying in many courtrooms had been
misleading. Hence it is quite clear from Mr. Fair&#146;s testimony
that there is no scientific basis to draw an inference that a
child has been sexually abused from the fact that the child
exhibits certain behavioural symptoms. While certain behavioural
symptoms may be consistent with sexual abuse having occurred,
there can be many other explanations for these symptoms that have
nothing to do with sexual abuse. Further, the existing research
shows that some sexually abused children exhibit no apparent
behavioural symptoms.
[63] Mr. Fair also agreed that behaviour such as delayed
disclosure, inconsistent versions, denial and the like, although
not unusual for victims of sexual abuse, were not in any way
indicators of truth. Mr. Fair also conceded that there was an
increased public awareness of issues related to child sexual
abuse and that the &#147;myths&#148; identified by Dr. Summit in 1983 may
not be present to the same extent in today&#146;s society. For
example,  members of today&#146;s society may be aware from intense
media coverage of such issues in recent years that many children
who are victims of sexual abuse do not disclose the abuse until
they are adults. Mr. Fair was of the view however that the Child
Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome could still play a valid role
in rebutting suggestions that children&#146;s complaints were not
credible because the complainants displayed certain behaviour.
               </pre>
    <pre>               3.     The trial judge&#146;s ruling</pre>
    <pre>[64] The trial judge was satisfied that Mr. Fair was qualified to
give  expert opinion evidence in the field of child sexual abuse.
He  granted leave to the Crown to call expert opinion evidence to
assist  the  jury in understanding the following aspects  of  the
complainants&#146;   behaviour:  delay  in   disclosing   the   abuse,
inconsistent disclosures, faulty memory about alleged occurrences
of  sexual abuse and peripheral events, repeated involvement with
the alleged abusers and lack of detection by persons close to the
complainants.
[65] However, the trial judge held that no evidence could be
called to show that the complainants in this case exhibited
certain behavioural symptoms during their childhood that were
consistent with their allegations of sexual abuse. He stated as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               At the same time I deny the Crown permission to ask the
          expert questions about any opinions he might have, or opinions
          that any other expert might have from his or their clinical or
          scientific experience about the behavioural indicators, signs or
          symptoms, health, or otherwise, stated to be consistent with the
          child sexual abuse, or which allow conclusions to be drawn from
          the evidence concerning the symptomatology of the complainants in
          this case. I find that in this area, the prejudicial effect from
          such questions outweighs any probative value.</pre>
    <pre>[66] It followed from this ruling that the proposed evidence from
the  parents about the complainants&#146; problem behaviour when  they
were growing up was also inadmissible.
[67] Crown counsel on appeal does not contend that the trial
judge erred in excluding any evidence about behavioural
indicators consistent with sexual abuse. Indeed, given the record
before the court, the correctness of the trial judge&#146;s ruling on
the inadmissibility of that part of the proposed evidence cannot
be disputed.
               </pre>
    <pre>               4.   The argument on appeal</pre>
    <pre>[68]  The  appellants&#146; argument is essentially  two-fold.  First,
they  reiterate the position taken by counsel at trial and  argue
that the trial judge erred in allowing any of the proposed expert
evidence  to be called. It is submitted that the evidence  called
to rebut certain &#147;myths&#148; was of no probative value and should not
have  been  admitted. Second, they argue that, even if the  trial
judge  was  correct  in  admitting part  of  the  expert  opinion
evidence,  the evidence adduced at trial exceeded the permissible
bounds  set  by  the trial judge in his ruling. In  fact,  it  is
submitted  that,  if  not in form certainly in  its  effect,  the
adduced evidence was no different from that which the trial judge
had  expressly ruled to be inadmissible at the conclusion of  the
voir  dire. In light of the fact that the trial judge  had  ruled
this kind of evidence inadmissible because its prejudicial effect
outweighed any probative value, it is argued that there must be a
new trial.
[69] It is my view that, based on the evidence adduced at trial,
it was open to the trial judge to allow, in his discretion,
expert opinion evidence on some restricted subject-matters.
However, I agree with counsel for the appellants that the expert
evidence called at trial far exceeded the scope of admissibility
and that its prejudicial effect necessitates a new trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               B.   The opinion rule</pre>
    <pre>[70]  Before  embarking upon a consideration of the criteria  for
admissibility  of  expert opinion evidence, it  is  important  to
recognize the nature of and reason for the &#147;opinion rule&#148;.
[71] The opinion rule is a general rule of exclusion. Witnesses
testify as to facts. As a general rule, they are not allowed to
give any opinion about those facts. Opinion evidence is generally
inadmissible. Opinion evidence is generally excluded because it
is a fundamental principle of our system of justice that it is up
to the trier of fact to draw inferences from the evidence and to
form his or her opinions on the issues in the case. Hence, as
will be discussed below, it is only when the trier of fact is
unable to form his or her own conclusions without help that an
exception to the opinion rule may be made and expert opinion
evidence admitted. It is the expert&#146;s precise function to provide
the trier of fact with a ready-made inference from the facts
which the judge and jury, due to the nature of the facts, are
unable to formulate themselves: R. v. Abbey (1982), 68 C.C.C.
(2d) 394 at 409.
[72] The line between fact and opinion must therefore be kept
clearly in mind. A witness, who is an expert in a particular
field,  may be called simply to give evidence on the facts he or
she has observed without offering an opinion based on those
facts.  To that extent, and if otherwise admissible, this
evidence is not subject to the opinion rule. This would be the
case, for example, where a treating physician is called to
describe the injuries he or she observed on a patient without
offering any opinion on the matter.  It is only when a witness
purports to give an opinion on certain facts that the opinion
rule comes into play. If, in our example, the treating physician
goes on to say that it is usual or unusual, as the case may be,
to observe this kind of injury in a patient who alleges that
sexual intercourse has taken place, the witness is offering
opinion evidence and the evidence will be subject to the general
rule of exclusion. It will only be admissible if certain
established criteria are met.
[73] Because of this general rule of exclusion, it follows that,
absent a favourable ruling, a party is not allowed to adduce
opinion evidence at trial. In some cases it may be possible to
rule on the admissibility of the proposed evidence on the basis
of counsel&#146;s submissions alone.8 However it may at times prove
necessary to hold a voir dire in order to properly consider all
relevant factors. Where the trial is before a jury and the
question of admissibility cannot be clearly determined in a
summary fashion, it may indeed be prudent to scrutinize the
evidence during the course of a voir dire before admitting it.
While in some cases the ruling can be made early in the
proceedings, in other cases, it may be only later in the trial
that the value of the proposed evidence can be properly assessed.
For example, in this case, it was only after the main Crown
witnesses had testified and the defence strategy became apparent
that the determination of the admissibility of the expert
evidence could properly be made.
[74] The law governing the admissibility of expert opinion
evidence is well established. It depends on the application of
the criteria set out in R. v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402
(S.C.C.):
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1) relevance;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  the  absence  of any  exclusionary rule; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4) a properly qualified expert.</pre>
    <pre>[75]  In  a nutshell, the opinion rule can be stated as  follows:
Opinion  evidence is generally inadmissible unless it  meets  all
four  criteria  set out above. A consideration of the  first  two
criteria,  relevance and necessity requires a  balancing  of  the
probative  value of the proposed evidence against  its  potential
prejudicial  effect.  The Supreme Court  in  Mohan  identifies  a
number  of  factors that should be considered in  this  balancing
process.  The  proposed evidence will only be admissible  if  its
probative  value  exceeds  its  prejudicial  effect.  The   third
criterion involves a consideration of other applicable  rules  of
evidence. Even if the proposed evidence is sufficiently probative
to   warrant   admission,  it  may  be  subject  to  some   other
exclusionary  rule and further inquiry may be required.  Finally,
the  last  criterion  requires that expert  opinion  evidence  be
adduced solely through a properly qualified expert.
[76] The balancing process which lies at the core of the
determination of the admissibility of this kind of evidence is
not unique to expert opinion evidence. It essentially underlies
all our rules of evidence. It is, however, necessarily case-
specific. The probative value of the proposed evidence and its
potential prejudicial effect can only be assessed in the context
of a particular trial. It is therefore important to keep in mind
that the admissibility of expert opinion evidence is not a
question of precedent. Both general and case-specific appellate
pronouncements respecting the admissibility of expert opinion
evidence in similar cases must always be considered in context.
For example, expert opinion evidence on the phenomenon of delayed
disclosure by victims of sexual abuse is by no means admissible
in all cases simply because it has been admitted in some cases
that have withstood appellate review. I agree with the approach
taken by Hill J. in R. v. C. (G.) (1997), 8 C.R. (5th) 21 at 35
(Ont. Gen. Div.) on the proper use of precedents in the
determination of this issue:
          </pre>
    <pre>               To the extent that the record in the voir dire before me
          provides opinion evidence upon matters identical, or nearly
          identical, to expert evidence generically recognized by appellate
          authorities to be the proper subject of expert opinion this
          recommends itself as a factor worthy of consideration in the
          legal determination of admissibility.
          </pre>
    <pre>                           Nevertheless, I must bear in
          mind  that  the state of scientific knowledge
          is fluid. Differing challenges may be mounted
          case-to-case  and the evidentiary  record  of
          each  prosecution constitutes a case-specific
          context   for  the  relevant  inquiries   and
          balancing  of  factors  which  the  court  is
          obliged to undertake.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               1.   Relevance</pre>
    <pre>[77] Relevance is a matter to be decided by the trial judge as  a
question  of  law. It involves the determination of  the  logical
relationship between the proposed evidence and a fact in issue in
the trial. The logical relevance of the evidence is determined by
asking the following questions:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  Does the proposed expert opinion evidence relate
               to a fact in issue in the trial?
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  Is it so related to a fact in issue that it tends
               to prove it?</pre>
    <pre>[78]  If  the answer to both these questions is yes, the  logical
relevance of the evidence has been established. This is the basic
threshold  requirement  for the admissibility  of  any  evidence.
But,  as  we  know  from  many rules  of  evidence,  passing  the
threshold test is not always enough for proposed evidence to gain
admission  at trial. Depending on the nature of the  evidence  or
its potential effect, policy considerations often require further
screening of the evidence before it can be admitted. In the  case
of expert opinion evidence, the courts have recognized the danger
that  it may distort the fact-finding process. The Supreme  Court
in Mohan stated as follows (at p. 411):
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is a danger that expert evidence will be misused and will
          distort the fact-finding process. Dressed up in scientific
          language which the jury does not easily understand and submitted
          through a witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence is
          apt to be accepted by the jury as being virtually infallible and
          as having more weight than it deserves.</pre>
    <pre>[79]  Therefore, although the evidence may be logically  relevant
to  some  issue  in  the case, further inquiry  is  necessary  to
determine &#147;whether its value is worth what it costs.&#148;9  In  other
words, the following question must be asked:</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  Although relevant, is the evidence sufficiently
probative to warrant its admission?</pre>
    <pre>[80] In other words, the evidence, although relevant, will not be
admitted  unless  its probative value outweighs  its  prejudicial
effect.   Both  the  probative value  of  the  evidence  and  its
potential prejudicial effect will depend on a number of  factors.
The  particular inquiries that should be made will depend on  the
particular  facts  of the case. The following  questions  may  be
useful to consider.  The list is by no means exhaustive.
               </pre>
    <pre>      (i)  To what extent is the opinion founded on proven facts?</pre>
    <pre>[81]  Although  the expert is entitled to take into consideration
all  possible  information in forming his  or  her  opinion,  the
weight  to  be given to the opinion will depend on the extent  to
which  the facts upon which the opinion is based are proven:  see
R. v. Abbey.
               </pre>
    <pre>      (ii)  To what extent does the proposed expert opinion evidence
            support the inference sought to be made from it?</pre>
    <pre>[82] In some cases, the expert opinion can be so strong as to  be
determinative  of  an  issue.  One can  think,  for  example,  of
uncontradicted  testimony from a medical expert as  to  cause  of
death.  In  other  cases, the opinion evidence  may  support  the
inference sought to be made but only in a limited way or  it  may
be equally supportive of other inferences and its probative value
will therefore be diminished.
               </pre>
    <pre>      (iii) To what extent is the matter that the proposed evidence
            tends to prove at issue in the proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>[83]  It  has  already been determined earlier that the  evidence
must  relate  to  an issue in the case before  it  can  pass  the
threshold  test of relevance. The question here is how  important
is  this  issue in the case? If it is only of marginal relevance,
it  may  not be worthwhile to receive the expert opinion evidence
and  risk confusing the jury, unnecessarily prolonging the trial,
or causing some other form of prejudice.
               </pre>
    <pre>      (iv) To what extent is the evidence reliable?</pre>
    <pre>[84]  This factor concerns the validity of the theory which forms
the  basis  of  the opinion advanced by the expert. The  evidence
must  meet  a certain threshold of reliability in order  to  have
sufficient  probative value to meet the criterion  of  relevance.
The  reliability  of  the evidence must also be  considered  with
respect to the second criterion of necessity. After all, it could
hardly  be  said  that  the admission of unreliable  evidence  is
necessary  for a proper adjudication to be made by the  trier  of
fact.
[85] The question is particularly important in the case of novel
theories. As indicated in Mohan, any &#147;novel scientific theory or
technique&#148; must be &#147;subjected to special scrutiny to determine
whether it meets a basic threshold of reliability&#148; before it is
admitted.  In some cases, it may be obvious that a novel theory
or technique is sought to be advanced. This was the case for
example when polygraph evidence was sought to be admitted10 or
when DNA evidence was first introduced.11 In other cases, the
theory or the technique sought to be advanced may form part of a
recognized field of expertise such as psychiatry or psychology
and, for that reason, it may be more difficult to readily
recognize that the theory or technique is novel within its field.
It must nonetheless be scrutinized. Mohan itself provides an
example where a psychiatrist&#146;s evidence of psychosexual profiles
was held to be insufficiently reliable or helpful to be admitted
in evidence. The court stated as follows (at p. 423):
          </pre>
    <pre>               The trial judge should consider the opinion of the expert
          and whether the expert is merely expressing a personal opinion or
          whether the behavioural profile which the expert is putting
          forward is in common use as a reliable indicator of membership in
          a distinctive group. Put another way: Has the scientific
          community developed a standard profile for the offender who
          commits this type of crime? An affirmative finding on this basis
          will satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity. Not only
          will the expert evidence tend to prove a fact in issue but it
          will also provide the trier of fact with assistance that is
          needed. Such evidence will have passed the threshold test of
          reliability which will generally ensure that the trier of fact
          does not give it more weight than it deserves.</pre>
    <pre>[86]  The  same principle applies in the field of the behavioural
sciences.   Although  psychology  or  sociology   are   certainly
recognized  fields  of  expertise,  some  theories  advanced   in
courtrooms  in  recent  years within those  fields  are  entirely
novel.  Further,  as indicated earlier, the state  of  scientific
knowledge  is fluid. The fact that a particular theory  may  have
been  accepted in the past does not necessarily end the  inquiry.
This case provides an example where the evidence showed that  the
Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, a theory that has been
accepted  in  certain courts in the past, was not reliable  as  a
diagnostic  tool.  Hence  the basis for Mr.  Fair&#146;s  theory  that
certain of the complainants&#146; behavioural symptoms were consistent
with  sexual  abuse  did  not withstand  scrutiny.  The  proposed
evidence  in this respect was insufficiently reliable to  warrant
admission.
[87] This court&#146;s decision in R. v. McIntosh (1997), 117 C.C.C.
(3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) provides some guidance on the requirement of
scrutinizing the subject-matter of the proposed expert testimony
to determine whether it meets a threshold of reliability. I also
find the following comments by Hill J. in R. v. J. E. T., [1994]
O.J. No. 3067 (Gen. Div.) to be helpful (at para. 75):
          </pre>
    <pre>               Needless to say there is a continuum of reliability in
          matters of science from near certainty in physical sciences to
          the far end of the spectrum inhabited by junk science and opinion
          akin to sorcery or magic. Whether the technique can be
          demonstrably tested, the existence of peer review for the theory
          or technique, the existence of publication, the testing or
          validation employing control and error measurement, and some
          recognition or acceptance in the relevant scientific field all
          contribute to an assessment of the reliability of the opinion and
          hence its capacity to outweigh the prejudicial impact of imposing
          on the jury highly suspect opinion evidence masquerading as
          science: Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 2795-2797
          per Blackmun, J.; Gold, Alan, Expert Evidence &#150;Admissibility
          (1994), 37 C.L.Q. 16 at 21-30.</pre>
    <pre>[88]  A number of other factors can also be relevant in assessing
the  extent  to  which the proposed evidence poses  a  danger  of
overwhelming  the  jury and distorting the fact-finding  process.
For example, it may be useful to make the following inquiries:
               </pre>
    <pre>      (v)  What is the level of complexity of the proposed expert
           evidence? Is it easily understood or is it likely to confuse the
           average juror?
      (vi) To what extent is it controversial? Will it require lengthy
           cross-examination by the other party or the calling of other
	   experts in response?</pre>
    <pre>[89] Of course, the fact that the evidence may be complex or that
experts  may  provide conflicting opinions does  not  necessarily
render the evidence inadmissible. These are simply factors to  be
considered  in assessing whether the value of the evidence  makes
it worth receiving.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          2.       Necessity</pre>
    <pre>[90]  The  proposed  expert opinion evidence  must  not  only  be
relevant  and  worth receiving as discussed  above,  it  must  be
necessary to assist the trier of fact.  If the trier of fact  can
form  his  or her own conclusions on the facts without help,  the
opinion  of  an  expert,  even though  it  may  be  relevant,  is
unnecessary and inadmissible.
[91] As indicated in Mohan, the evidence must be more than just
helpful to meet this criterion. On the other hand, necessity
cannot be judged by too high a standard. The test is formulated
in different ways in Mohan (at p.413):
          </pre>
    <pre>               The evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact
          to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  opinion must be necessary  in  the
          sense  that it provides information which  is
          likely  to  be  outside  the  experience  and
          knowledge of a judge or jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  subject-matter of the inquiry must
          be  such that ordinary people are unlikely to
          form   a   correct  judgment  about  it,   if
          unassisted by persons with special knowledge.</pre>
    <pre>[92]  Therefore,  the following alternative questions  should  be
asked:
               </pre>
    <pre>(a)       Will the proposed expert opinion evidence
enable the trier of fact to appreciate the technicalities of a
matter in issue? or
(b)       Will it provide information which is likely to be
outside the experience of the trier of fact? or
(c)       Is the trier of fact unlikely to form a correct
judgment about a matter in issue if unassisted by the expert
opinion evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[93]  Where  the  subject-matter  of  the  opinion  evidence   is
technical in nature, it is usually easy to meet the criterion  of
necessity. No one would dispute that the trier of fact is  likely
to  need  expert  assistance  in  understanding  the  engineering
principles involved in the construction of a bridge. However,  in
cases  such  as this one, where the proposed opinion evidence  is
about  human  behaviour,  it is much  more  difficult  to  decide
whether  the opinion will provide information which is likely  to
be  outside  the experience of the trier of fact, or whether  the
trier  of  fact is unlikely to form a correct judgment about  the
matter in issue. It is up to the trial judge in each case to make
a  judgment  call on this issue in the context of the  particular
case  and  his or her judgment is entitled to deference. O&#146;Connor
J.A.,  writing  for  this court in R. v. F.  (D.S.)  (1999),  132
C.C.C. (3d) 97, stated as follows (at pp. 115-16):
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is no exact way to draw the line between what is within
          the normal experience of a judge or a jury and what is not. The
          normal experiences of different triers of fact may differ. Over
          time the subject matters that come within the normal experiences
          of judges and juries may change. The normal experiences of those
          in one community may differ from those in other communities. In
          the end, the court in each case will be required to exercise its
          best judgment in deciding whether a particular subject matter is
          or is not within the normal experience of the trier of fact.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It seems to me that in cases being tried
          with  a  jury, the trial judge is in a better
          position than this court to determine whether
          expert  evidence is necessary to  assist  the
          jury   in   evaluating  evidence  or  drawing
          inferences from it. The trial judge  has  the
          advantage  of hearing the evidence in  issue,
          observing   the  jury  and  being   able   to
          appreciate  the  dynamics of  the  particular
          trial. In addition, the trial judge may  also
          be in a better position to determine what may
          come  within  the  normal experience  of  the
          average  juror in the community in which  the
          case is being tried. For those reasons, in my
          view,  this court should show some  deference
          to decisions of trial judges in this area.</pre>
    <pre>[94] In the same way, it is up to the trial judge in each case to
determine whether the trier of fact is unlikely to form a correct
judgment  about  a matter in issue if unassisted  by  the  expert
opinion  evidence.  Care should be taken however not  to  replace
old  stereotypes  with new ones. What is the  &#147;correct&#148;  judgment
about  a  matter in issue can rarely be presumed and will  depend
upon   the   particular  facts  of  each   case.   The   ultimate
determination must be left to the trier of fact.
[95] In cases of sexual abuse such as this one, the proposed
expert evidence often touches upon matters of credibility. This
presents an even more difficult task for the trial judge in the
application of the criterion of necessity. In determining whether
expert opinion is necessary to assist the trier of fact in
arriving at his or her own conclusions, it becomes particularly
important to keep in mind that the credibility of witnesses is a
question that is reserved to the trier of fact. The Supreme
Court, in R. v. Marquard (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 228, held
it to be &#147;a fundamental axiom of our trial process that the
ultimate conclusion as to the credibility or truthfulness of a
particular witness is for the trier of fact, and is not the
proper subject of expert opinion.&#148;
[96] The difficulty lies in the fact that a distinction is drawn
between evidence about credibility, which is inadmissible, and
evidence about a feature of a witness&#146;s behaviour or testimony
that may be admissible even though it will likely have some
bearing on the trier of fact&#146;s ultimate determination of the
question of credibility. For example, evidence tendered to show
that it is not unusual for sexual offence complainants to delay
reporting incidents of abuse may be admissible, if it meets the
admissibility requirements for expert opinion evidence in the
particular case, even though it may have some bearing on the
ultimate determination of the complainant&#146;s credibility. However,
any evidence tendered to show either directly or indirectly that
the complainant is more or less likely to be telling the truth
because she delayed reporting the abuse is not the proper subject-
matter of expert testimony and is inadmissible. It is strictly up
to the trier of fact to determine what effect any delay in
reporting may have on the credibility of the complainant without
any expert assistance on this ultimate issue of credibility.
[97] Finally, it is clear from Mohan that &#147;the need for the
evidence is assessed in light of its potential to distort the
fact-finding process.&#148; There is a concern that the trier of fact
may give the expert testimony more weight than its true
usefulness deserves. Therefore, even if the evidence is necessary
to assist the trier of fact in the sense discussed above, a
further inquiry must be made before it can meet this criterion:
               </pre>
    <pre>(d)      Is the need for the evidence sufficient toovercome its 
potential prejudicial effect?</pre>
    <pre>[98]  The  factors  that should be considered in  this  balancing
process will, of course, vary from case to case. Much of the same
inquiries  discussed above may be useful to make with respect  to
this  criterion.  In particular, the question of  reliability  is
equally  relevant to this criterion.  In addition, the  following
questions  may  be  asked.   Again,  the  list  is  by  no  means
exhaustive.</pre>
    <pre>    (i)  To what extent is other evidence available to
         assist the trier of fact in determining the issue
         in question?</pre>
    <pre>[99]  In  some  cases,  for example, the complainant  herself  or
himself  may  well have provided sufficient explanation  for  the
behaviour   that  is  sought  to  be  explained  through   expert
testimony. The need for expert testimony in such a case would  be
diminished and, given its potential distorting effect, it may not
be  worthwhile receiving. Consider for example, the  decision  of
Hill  J.  in   R. v. C. (G.) (1997), 8 C.R. (5th) 21  (Ont.  Gen.
Div.)  at  41  where  the fact that other evidence  in  the  case
explained the delay in disclosing the incident of abuse served to
tip  the  balance  against the admission of  the  expert  opinion
evidence on the issue of delayed disclosure:
          </pre>
    <pre>           In light of the court&#146;s earlier ruling to admit evidence of the
          course of reporting or disclosure by the complainant, I am
          concerned that the repetition of that evidence before the jury
          within the foundational context for Dr. Berry&#146;s opinion would
          impermissibly tip the balance toward the triers utilizing the
          disclosure evidence itself as evidence that the assault
          occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  effect on the trial process,  were
          the expert evidence to be admitted respecting
          the delayed disclosure by S.S. to her mother,
          would be disproportionate to the value of the
          doctor&#146;s   opinion   to   the   truth-seeking
          objective of the trial.</pre>
    <pre>    (ii) What is the level of complexity of the proposed
	 expert evidence? Is it easily understood or  is
	 it likely toconfuse the average juror?</pre>
    <pre>[100]     The proposed evidence may be simple, easy to understand
and  hence  may present little risk of confusion.  On  the  other
hand, it may introduce difficulties that outweigh its usefulness.
Professor  Paciocco,  in  an article entitled  &quot;The  Evidence  of
Children: Testing the Rules Against What We Know&quot;, (Spring  1996)
21 Queen&#146;s L.J. 345 at 387 observes that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [I]t is ironic that it is undoubtedly easier to evaluate the
          evidence of children than it is to evaluate the evidence of the
          experts who testify in order to help us evaluate the evidence of
          children.</pre>
    <pre>[101]     In my view, there is much merit to this observation. Of
course, in some cases, this result may be inevitable and, in  the
balancing process, the expert opinion evidence may still be worth
receiving. It is important, however, to assess the usefulness  of
the proposed evidence in the context of the whole case.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   3.   The absence of any exclusionary rule</pre>
    <pre>[102]      Expert  opinion  evidence  that  would  otherwise   be
admissible may still be excluded on the basis of another rule  of
evidence.  For example, the evidence may offend the similar  fact
evidence rule and be inadmissible on that basis.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   4.   A properly qualified expert</pre>
    <pre>[103]      As stated in Mohan, &#147;the evidence must be given  by  a
witness  who  is  shown  to  have acquired  special  or  peculiar
knowledge  through study or experience in respect of the  matters
on  which  he  or she undertakes to testify.&#148; This  criterion  is
usually  not  difficult  to  apply.  However,  it  must  not   be
overlooked.  Opinion evidence can only be of  assistance  to  the
extent  that the witness has acquired special knowledge over  the
subject-matter  that the average trier of fact does  not  already
have.  If  the witness&#146;s &#147;special&#148; or &#147;peculiar&#148; knowledge  on  a
subject-matter is minimal, he or she should not be  qualified  as
an expert with respect to that subject.
[104]     As stated earlier, it is only when expert opinion
evidence meets the four criteria that it can be admitted. And, as
the following discussion will demonstrate, if the evidence is to
be admitted, it is crucial that it be confined within the scope
of proper admissibility. In other words, the evidence, as
presented to and left with the trier of fact, must remain
relevant, necessary, otherwise admissible and founded upon
expertise.
          </pre>
    <pre>               C.   Application to this case</pre>
    <pre>[105]     As indicated earlier, the trial judge granted leave  to
the  Crown  to  call expert opinion evidence about the  following
features of the complainants&#146; behaviour: delay in disclosing  the
abuse,  inconsistent  disclosures, faulty  memory  about  alleged
occurrences  of  sexual  abuse  and peripheral  events,  repeated
involvement  with the alleged abusers and lack  of  detection  by
persons  close  to the complainants. The purpose  of  the  expert
testimony was to explain to the jurors that this kind of  conduct
was not unusual for victims of sexual abuse and, consequently, to
alert  them  that  complaints  of  sexual  abuse  should  not  be
discounted simply on the basis of this behaviour.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   1.   Relevance</pre>
    <pre>[106]      As  in many cases of this nature, the issues at  trial
turned  on the credibility of the complainants. Counsel  for  the
appellants   concede  that  the  above-noted  features   of   the
complainants&#146; behaviour formed the basis of the defence&#146;s  attack
on their credibility and, consequently, became relevant issues in
the  trial. It is also conceded that the expert opinion  evidence
stating  that  certain behaviour is not uncommon  in  victims  of
sexual  abuse  related  to those issues. Therefore,  the  logical
relevance of this expert evidence is not disputed.
[107]     It is argued, however, that the expert opinion evidence
is of no probative value because the expert fairly conceded that
the behaviour in question, although not uncommon in victims of
sexual abuse, would similarly not be uncommon in cases where the
complaint was fabricated. It is therefore argued that the expert
evidence about those features of behaviour does not tend to prove
anything and is worthless.
[108]     This argument is based on the fallacy that this
evidence was presented to prove that sexual abuse in fact
occurred. If that were the case, the appellants would be quite
correct in their assertion that the evidence would be of little,
if any, probative value. Indeed that was the case with the
proposed evidence with respect to certain behavioural symptoms
being consistent with sexual abuse. That evidence was rightly
excluded by the trial judge because it was not sufficiently
reliable and its potential prejudicial effect far exceeded any
probative value it could have.
[109]     Rather, the expert opinion evidence that certain
behaviour, such as delayed disclosure of the abuse, is not
unusual in victims of sexual abuse is presented simply to prove
that fact and nothing more. The same applies with respect to the
other features of behaviour. The evidence is not and cannot be
presented to show that the complainant is more likely to have
been abused because she has not disclosed the abuse in a timely
fashion or because she has exhibited some of the other forms of
behaviour. Such proposition would be untenable. It would turn
features such as delayed disclosure, faulty memory, inconsistent
versions and the like into hallmarks of truth.
[110]     The relevance of the evidence here is that it can
provide the trier of fact with a more complete picture. For
example, logic alone could lead the trier of fact to infer from
the absence of timely complaint that no abuse has taken place.
After all, if nothing untoward is happening to the child, it only
makes sense that she makes no complaint. And, that may indeed be
the case. However, what the expert opinion evidence can show is
that there are other possibilities. Mr. Fair&#146;s evidence discloses
that, for several reasons, it is not uncommon for a child victim
of sexual abuse to disclose the abuse sometimes only years after
it has occurred. This evidence can assist by simply alerting the
jury to the fact that more than one inference can be drawn from
the failure to disclose the abuse at the time it occurred.
Therein lies its probative value.
[111]     Much the same analysis applies to one other feature of
the complainants&#146; behaviour identified in this case, the repeated
involvement with the alleged abusers. The defence took the
position in cross-examination of some of the complainants that
their allegations of abuse were not credible because they kept
returning to their abusers although they could have avoided the
situation. Expert opinion evidence showing that, for various
reasons, it is not uncommon for a child victim of sexual abuse to
become repeatedly involved with an abuser can assist in rebutting
this inference and is therefore relevant.
[112]     To a certain extent, the same analysis can also apply
to the lack of detection by persons close to the complainants
since it is somehow linked to the failure to disclose the abuse.
For the purposes of this appeal, I am also prepared to accept
that the logical relevance of the expert opinion evidence on
inconsistent disclosures and faulty memory has also been
established.
[113]     The question remains, once the evidence is found to be
relevant, whether the probative value of the expert opinion
evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.
[114]     First, the probative value of the evidence must be
considered in the context of the whole case. As discussed
earlier, the probative value of the expert evidence in this case
related solely to the fact that certain features of the
complainants&#146; behaviour were not uncommonly seen in victims of
sexual abuse. The features in question were prominent in the
evidence. They raised issues of crucial importance in the case.
The opinion evidence that it was not uncommon for child victims
of sexual abuse not to disclose the abuse in a timely manner and
to remain involved with their abusers and the evidence relating
to the lack of detection of the abuse by persons close to the
complainants was reliable and cogent. In fact, the evidence in
this regard was not really disputed at trial. However, the
cogency, or even the reliability, of the evidence with respect to
inconsistent disclosures and faulty memories in victims of sexual
abuse is not so apparent in the record, and the evidence relating
to these matters is not sufficiently probative to warrant
admission.
[115]     Second, the prejudicial effect of the evidence in the
context of the whole case must be considered. The prejudicial
effect of this evidence was potentially devastating to the
appellants. The outcome of the case was entirely dependent on
findings of credibility. The above-noted features of the
complainants&#146; behaviour were pivotal to the defence. In the
circumstances, there was a real danger that the expert opinion
evidence would serve to hide the weaknesses of the Crown&#146;s case
behind a cloak of scientific reliability and that the trier of
fact would be left with the impression than none of the features
of the complainants&#146; behaviour could detract from their
credibility or, worse still, that these apparent weaknesses were
in fact hallmarks of their truthfulness.
[116]     In my view, it was open to the trial judge, on the
basis of the record before him, to find that the expert evidence
on delayed disclosure, repeated involvement with the alleged
abusers and lack of detection was sufficiently probative to
outweigh its prejudicial effect but only if the potential dangers
of the evidence were guarded against by restricting the scope of
the expert&#146;s testimony and by giving appropriate instructions to
the jury. Given the potential danger of this evidence, it was
crucial that the expert&#146;s evidence be restricted to giving the
simple opinion that, based on his knowledge and experience, these
features were not uncommonly observed in victims of child abuse
and that no suggestion be made that complainants, either
generally or in this case, are any more or less credible because
they have exhibited one or more of these features.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    2.   Necessity</pre>
    <pre>[117]     With respect to the criterion of necessity, it was also
open  to  the trial judge on this record to find that the  expert
evidence  would provide information that is likely to be  outside
the  experience and knowledge of the jury or that the jury  would
be  unlikely  to  form a correct judgment on the relevant  issues
without  assistance. As noted earlier, the decision of the  trial
judge  on  this issue is entitled to deference in this court.  Of
course, the record may well be different on this point (and  with
respect  to other issues) at the new trial and it will be  up  to
the trial judge to make the decision.
[118]     The question that is of equal difficulty is whether the
need for the evidence was sufficient to overcome its prejudicial
effect. Of particular relevance to this question is the fact that
the complainants provided explanations for their behaviour. They
were described by the trial judge during the course of the
discussion with counsel on the voir dire as &#147;intelligent young
females that are, obviously, above average in intelligence.&#148; All
but one were adults. Given the potential prejudicial effect of
the expert opinion evidence, there was a serious question whether
the need for the evidence was sufficient to overcome it. Although
the reasons of the trial judge do not provide assistance on this
point, it is apparent from the transcript that the matter was
specifically raised by counsel and I see no reason to believe
that the trial judge would not have given the question serious
consideration.
[119]     On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that it
was open to the trial judge to conclude that the criterion of
necessity had been met, but again, only on the understanding that
the expert&#146;s evidence would be strictly confined within the scope
of proper admissibility and that appropriate instructions would
be given to the jury to guard against the danger that the
evidence be misused. As I will explain later, it is in failing to
ensure that the evidence remained within the scope of proper
admissibility and in failing to instruct the jury correctly on
the available inferences that reversible error was made.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    3.   The absence of any exclusionary rule</pre>
    <pre>[120]      No issue is raised on this appeal with respect to  the
third criterion. The evidence, if otherwise admissible as opinion
evidence, was not subject to any other exclusionary rule.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   4.   A properly qualified expert</pre>
    <pre>[121]      Finally, it is conceded that Mr. Fair was a  qualified
expert   to   give  evidence  on  the  named  features   of   the
complainants&#146; behaviour, except as it related to memory.  I  have
already  expressed  the view that Mr. Fair&#146;s  testimony  on  this
point was not sufficiently probative to warrant its admission.  I
am also in agreement with the appellants that Mr. Fair was not  a
properly qualified expert on matters related to memory.
[122]     Mr. Fair appears to be otherwise highly qualified in
his field, but, on this point, the evidence is clear that Mr.
Fair is a social worker whose knowledge and experience about
matters related to memory were limited to his study of relevant
articles written by a psychiatrist and to certain observations
made in his clinical practice as a social worker that were
consonant with that psychiatrist&#146;s view. It is not apparent at
all from the record that Mr. Fair was in a position to critically
evaluate the psychiatric opinions contained in the articles.
        
       5.   The inadmissible scope of the evidence called at trial</pre>
    <pre>[123]      As  I  have  indicated earlier, it is  my  view  that,
although  admissible  on certain restricted subject-matters,  the
expert  opinion evidence presented to the jury in this  case  far
exceeded  the scope of admissibility and indeed, if not  in  form
certainly  in its effect, directly contravened the trial  judge&#146;s
ruling.
[124]     Notwithstanding the trial judge&#146;s ruling on the
inadmissibility of &#147;any opinions about behavioural indicators,
signs or symptoms, health, or otherwise, stated to be consistent
with the child sexual abuse&#148;, the expert opinion evidence led by
the Crown at trial was entirely couched in terms of the Child
Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome. In the end result, although
Mr. Fair was never asked directly by Crown counsel whether any
particular behaviour was &#147;consistent with sexual abuse&#148;, I must
agree with counsel for the appellants that the effect of his
testimony was essentially the same as it would have been had he
been permitted to testify on the full scope of the matters
canvassed during the voir dire.  One need only look at the cross-
examination of the expert witness at trial to be satisfied that
the same attack that had been made during the course of the voir
dire with respect to the validity of the theory behind the Child
Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome had to be repeated to counter
the evidence that was advanced during the examination in chief.
Given the clear ruling of the trial judge that this evidence was
not sufficiently probative to be admitted, the jury should never
have been exposed to any of the highly controversial evidence on
this subject-matter. I will attempt to describe some of the ways
in which the evidence went beyond expressing a simple opinion
about the occurrence of the features of behaviour that were in
issue.
[125]     First, the expression &#147;Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation
Syndrome&#148; in and of itself is suggestive that an inference of
sexual abuse can be drawn from certain behaviours. Dr. Summit
himself recognized in later articles the extent to which many
persons were misled by the use of the term &#147;syndrome&#148; and how his
theory had been inappropriately used as a diagnostic tool both in
the field of behavioural sciences and in the courtroom. I don&#146;t
find it necessary for the purpose of this appeal to analyze these
later developments in any detail. The evidence was all before the
court on the voir dire and amply supported the ruling that this
kind of evidence was inadmissible. It is perhaps sufficient for
our purposes to consider one dictionary definition of &#147;syndrome&#148;
to show how the term can be misleading.
[126]     &#147;Syndrome&#148;, in Webster&#146;s Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary, is defined as &#147;a group of signs and symptoms that
occur together and characterize a particular abnormality; a set
of concurrent things (as emotions or actions) that usually form
an identifiable pattern&#148;. Hence, the repeated use of the word
syndrome, in my view was highly prejudicial and in contravention
of the trial judge&#146;s ruling. I am not unmindful that Crown
counsel at trial elicited from Mr. Fair a qualification to the
ordinary meaning of the word &#147;syndrome&#148; at one point during the
examination-in-chief:

          Q.  &#133;.    is    this   Child   Sexual   Abuse
               Accommodation Syndrome, is it  meant  to
               be   used  as  a  tool  to  identify  or
               diagnose children who have been sexually
               abused?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Well,  it  is not meant to be  something
               that  would diagnose child sexual abuse.
               By  that I mean, you can&#146;t use this when
               there is a complaint to determine beyond
               a   reasonable  doubt,  was  this  child
               abused,  or not. What it is, is intended
               to   do  is  to  help  understand   when
               children have been abused, you know, how
               that might come about, and to understand
               that  some of the myths that have gotten
               [in  the  way]  of that  are,  in  fact,
               myths.</pre>
    <pre>[127]     And later:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Did [Dr. Summit later] comment at all on the choice of
               language, in terms of labelling the Child Sexual Abuse
               Accommodation Syndrome?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes, he did.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Can you tell me what he had to say
               about the choice of language?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   He  said that there had been  some
               controversies  in  the  American  courts
               because  he  had called it a &#147;Syndrome&#148;,
               and  he  felt  that he would  have  been
               further   ahead  if  he  called   it   a
               &#147;Pattern&#148;, simply a pattern that he  was
               seeing in children who had been sexually
               abused.</pre>
    <pre>[128]      With  all  due  respect to Mr.  Fair,  these  answers,
particularly when considered in the context of the whole  of  his
testimony  in chief, fall quite short of explaining to  the  jury
the true limitations of the theory, as acknowledged by him during
the course of the voir dire and as clarified by the author of the
theory himself, Dr. Summit. The evidence before the court on  the
voir  dire made it clear that it has been recognized in the field
that  there  is no basis to draw any inference that sexual  abuse
has  occurred from any of the behaviour referred to in Mr. Fair&#146;s
evidence.  On  the  other  hand, Mr.  Fair&#146;s  answers  leave  the
impression  that  while  the  Child  Sexual  Abuse  Accommodation
Syndrome cannot be used to prove abuse beyond a reasonable doubt,
it  can still be used to determine when abuse has occurred. It is
only  through  lengthy  cross-examination that  that  notion  was
dispelled. Given the trial judge&#146;s ruling, the jury should  never
have  been  subjected  to  any of this  difficult  and  confusing
evidence  on the debate over the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation
Syndrome.
[129]     Hence, the evidence was not only difficult and
confusing, it left the impression that  some link had been
scientifically established between the observation of certain
behaviour in a complainant and the incidence of sexual abuse.
This is further evidenced in the description of Dr. Summit&#146;s
theory on the five stages that a child victim of sexual abuse
experiences. During the course of that description, repeated
references were made to the fact that it was a &#147;myth&#148; to
discredit a child&#146;s complaint about sexual abuse because of
delayed disclosure, inconsistent versions, confusion,
recantations and the like. Repeatedly, the jury was told that in
Dr. Summit&#146;s view, to conclude that sexual abuse did not occur on
the basis of these features of behaviour was a &#147;myth&#148;.
[130]     In my view, there is a real danger that this testimony
may have left the jury with the impression, not only that they
should not discredit the complainants&#146; testimony on the basis of
any of these features (a notion which in itself is legally
incorrect), but that there was a scientific basis to conclude
that the presence of these very features that formed the basis of
the defence theory somehow made their testimony more credible.
[131]     The prejudice occasioned by this evidence was
compounded by Crown counsel&#146;s repeated use of hypothetical
questions that paralleled the specific allegations and the
behaviour of the individual complainants in this case. First,
Crown counsel would describe the allegations. The following is
one example taken from the transcript:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Okay. Now, what I would like to do next, Mr. Fair,
               is give you a series of hypothetical factual situations and ask
               you a number of questions about each one.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   I would like you to assume that we
               have a child between the ages of about five
               and  ten,  a female child, is repeatedly
               subjected to various sexual acts, ranging
               from fondling outside of her clothing, to
               fondling underneath her clothing, to having a
               penis   inserted  into  her  mouth,   to
               intercourse.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    I  would  like you to assume  that
               these acts are committed upon her, or she is
               enticed into participating in these acts, by
               various older members of her family, male
               members  of  her family,  including  her
               grandfather, a great uncle, and two uncles.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Finally, I would like you to assume
               that there is no one else in the room, so
               there are no other independent witnesses, if
               I  can  call  them that, to any  of  the
               activities?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.</pre>
    <pre>[132]     Then hypothetical questions were asked with respect  to
certain   features   of  the  behaviour  of  the   &#147;hypothetical&#148;
complainant such as the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    What can you tell us, if anything, about the
               likelihood that this child would speak with someone at the time
               these acts are taking place?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Can  you  offer  any  explanation,
               either    based    on   your    clinical
               experience,  or on the research,  or  on
               Dr.  Summit&#146;s theory, that might explain
               why  this  child  would continue  to  be
               alone in the company of a person who  is
               abusing them?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Would you expect this hypothetical
               child  to  be  able  to  describe   each
               individual  incident with  each  of  her
               abusers with any degree of detail?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Would you expect this hypothetical
               child  to  be able to tell you with  any
               degree of accuracy, or to remember  with
               any  degree  of accuracy, what  she  had
               been doing, either prior to or after the
               abuse?  I  mean, let&#146;s assume  that  the
               abuse occurred at lunchtime&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Might you expect that child to tell
               you   what  they  had  been  doing  that
               morning  where acts of abuse took  place
               over a long period of time?</pre>
    <pre>[133]      Then  Crown  counsel repeated similar  questions  with
respect  to  &#147;another hypothetical child&#148;, &#147;a third  hypothetical
child&#148;  and  &#147;finally  one  more hypothetical  child&#148;  each  time
relating  the  specific  allegations of abuse  and  referring  to
particular features of behaviour of the particular &#147;hypothetical&#148;
child.  Some references to behaviour was highly specific such  as
the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.      Okay, and dealing with that same hypothetical
               child, let&#146;s add to that hypothetical that at about the age of
               nine someone asks her, &#147;Has anyone touched you?&#148; and she
               responds, &#147;No.&#148;&#133;   Have you any explanation for why she might
               deny that touching?</pre>
    <pre>[134]      The  hypothetical  questions  closely  described   the
evidence  of  each complainant. In answer to each  question,  the
expert  confirmed  that the behaviour would not  be  unusual  and
explained why.
[135]     In my view, this whole series of hypothetical questions
and answers far exceeded any legitimate purpose for expert
testimony in this case. The answers given by the expert would
likely be understood by the jury not just as evidence which would
help them understand these features of behaviour generally but as
a further invitation to accept each complainant&#146;s evidence
regardless of their conduct and notwithstanding the weaknesses of
the testimony. It served to effectively mask the weaknesses of
each complainant&#146;s testimony and to cloak it with a semblance of
scientific reliability. Presented in this manner, the evidence
was no longer admissible because its prejudicial effect far
exceeded its probative value. It was obviously calculated to
bolster the credibility of each complainant and as such was not
the proper subject of expert testimony.
[136]     I have already indicated earlier that, in my view, Mr.
Fair was not properly qualified as an expert on memory. Hence his
evidence on &#147;script memory&#148; and &#147;spot memory&#148; and other aspects
of the functioning of the mind was also inadmissible.
[137]     It is important in every case to ensure that the expert
opinion evidence, in both form and substance, remain relevant,
necessary and within the recognized expertise of the witness. In
this case, the expert opinion evidence could be admitted for the
limited purpose of explaining that certain features of behaviour
have been commonly observed in child victims of sexual abuse.
This evidence could have been given in a simple succinct manner.
I note for example this court's reference in R. v. F.(D.S.) to
the expert opinion evidence called in that case regarding certain
behavioural characteristics of women who report living in abusive
relationships:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence before the jury was extremely brief;
          after the description of her qualifications, the examination-in-
          chief covered less than four pages of transcript and the cross-
          examination one page. In answer to the specific questions
          permitted by the ruling of the trial judge, Ms. Sinclair
          expressed the opinions that it was quite typical for persons who
          are battered or abused in a relationship to remain in the
          relationship for a period of time; that it was quite unusual for
          persons who are being abused in intimate relationships to report
          it to outsiders before they are ready to leave the relationship;
          and that it was not unusual for those persons to minimize or
          fabricate what has happened to them if they are reporting an
          injury to a health care person or someone else.</pre>
    <pre>[138]      I  have  not  reviewed the above-noted  transcript  of
evidence  and hence I am not saying that it should be used  as  a
model.  I have noted it, however, for the purpose of illustrating
that this kind of evidence does not have to be lengthy or complex
to  fulfill its purpose. It can and should be confined so  as  to
minimize any danger of distorting the fact-finding process.

    D.   Conclusion on the admissibility of the expert opinion evidence</pre>
    <pre>[139]      In  the  final analysis, the expert  opinion  evidence
presented   to   the  jury  was  almost  entirely  improper   and
inadmissible.  It  also effectively breached  the  trial  judge&#146;s
ruling. No one has suggested that this breach was done other than
unwittingly  by Crown counsel at trial or by the expert  witness.
It  is  perhaps noteworthy that the trial judge did not intervene
nor  did defence counsel object during the course of the expert&#146;s
testimony.  It undoubtedly would have been difficult  for  anyone
present at the trial to assess the full impact of the evidence as
it was presented. There is necessarily an element of hindsight in
appellate review. In this case, a review of the evidence leads me
to  conclude that the admission of the expert opinion evidence as
presented constitutes a reversible error that necessitates a  new
trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          E.       Instruction to the jury</pre>
    <pre>[140]      It is also important to give a careful instruction  to
the  jury  on  the  limited use that can be made  of  the  expert
opinion  evidence. In R. v. F.(D.S.), this court noted  that  the
trial  judge  had  given the following clear instruction  to  the
jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The purpose of such evidence is to assist you in determining
          whether an inference adverse to the credibility of the
          complainant should be drawn based on the evidence of the manner
          and timing and consistency of her disclosure. It may or may not
          assist you in that respect. Your duty is to consider the
          evidence of Ms. Sinclair and weigh it in the balance. You must
          not be overwhelmed or unduly swayed by the credentials of a
          particular witness just because he or she is permitted to give
          expert evidence. While her evidence concerning observed
          behaviours in persons who report abuse in intimate relationships
          may or may not assist you in assessing the credibility of the
          complainant in the manner I have described, I emphasize you must
          not use her evidence and it is not relevant for any other
          purpose. You may not, for example, use her evidence to increase
          or bolster the credibility of the complainant. Aside from
          considering her evidence in relation to the credibility of the
          complainant in the manner which I have described, you may not
          use her evidence for the purpose of assessing the likelihood
          that the events described by [the complainant] occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[141]     It is important to note that this instruction correctly
leaves  it open to the jury to decide whether or not to  draw  an
adverse  inference on the credibility of the complainant  on  the
basis of the described features of her conduct.
[142]     The appellants in this case submit that the following
instruction from the trial judge amounted to a direction that, as
a matter of law, no adverse inference could be drawn from the
absence of a contemporaneous complaint:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Expert evidence may be given by a qualified expert who has
          special skill to better understand matters outside of our normal
          experience. I found that Grant Fair had a special skill, from a
          clinical point of view, and could give opinion evidence in the
          child abuse situation about delayed disclosure, memory about what
          occurred, and events adjacent to occurrences, repeated
          occurrences, and lack of detection by persons close to the
          complainant, such as a parent.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                His  evidence  may be used  by  you  to
          better understand the workings of the mind in
          matters I mentioned, and it is given  to  you
          for   the   purpose  to  prevent   inaccurate
          opinions being formed, what were described as
          &#147;myths&#148;, on what adults might expect children
          to   do  in  certain  situations  when  those
          opinions are not based upon actual fact.</pre>
    <pre>[143]     The trial judge gave other instructions to the jury  on
the subject of expert evidence to which no objection is taken. In
my  view,  it  may have been preferable, in the context  of  this
charge,  not to give the first above-noted excerpt. The reference
to  the  trial judge&#146;s finding that Mr. Fair had a special  skill
was  unnecessary and created a risk that the jury understand that
Mr.  Fair&#146;s evidence has received the stamp of judicial approval.
This impression may have been left with the jury particularly  in
light   of   the   second  excerpted  instruction.    The   later
instruction, in my view, constituted misdirection in so far as it
may  have  suggested to the jury that opinions other  than  those
offered  by  the  expert  would  be  &#147;inaccurate&#148;  or  constitute
&#147;myths&#148;.  Rather, the jury instructions should have clearly  left
it open to the jury to decide whether or not an adverse inference
was  to  be drawn on the credibility of the complainants  on  the
basis  of  the features of conduct that formed the subject-matter
of expert testimony.</pre>
    <pre>IV.  Additional Grounds of Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[144]     In light of the fact that I would order a new trial,  I
do  not find it necessary to deal with the additional grounds  of
appeal  other  than summarily with a view as to what  may  be  of
relevance in the new trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.       Cross-examination of defence witnesses</pre>
    <pre>[145]      The  appellants  submit that the cross-examination  of
defence witnesses as to the derogatory nicknames used within  the
appellants&#146;  family to refer to the police officer in  charge  of
the  investigation and to the prosecutor was improper.  I  agree.
This cross-examination was irrelevant to any of the issues in the
trial and should not have been allowed.
[146]     The appellants further submit that the prejudice from
such questioning was exacerbated by Crown counsel&#146;s address to
the jury wherein she submitted that the use of such derogatory
terms signaled &#147;a distinct lack of respect for the administration
of justice.&#148; It was further compounded by the trial judge&#146;s
instruction to the jury that such disrespect could be used in
assessing the weight to be attached to the evidence of good
character.  I also agree with this submission. The cross-
examination, although improper, may not have been of much
consequence were it not for this direction on the use that could
be made of this wholly irrelevant evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               B.   Charge on character evidence</pre>
    <pre>[147]     In the course of his charge, the trial judge stated  as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          You can use the evidence of good character given on behalf of
          all the accused, to infer that they are not the type of person
          who would commit the offences mentioned in the indictment. The
          evidence of good character is relevant to their credibility as a
          witness. If the evidence is evenly balanced, the character
          evidence may weigh the balance in favour of the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[148]      It is conceded that this instruction improperly stated
the  onus  with respect to character evidence. Again, it  is  not
necessary for the disposition of this appeal to assess the impact
of this error in the context of the charge as a whole.
          </pre>
    <pre>          C.       Charge on reasonable doubt</pre>
    <pre>[149]       The  appellants&#146; argument on the  inadequacy  of  the
charge to the jury as it relates to reasonable doubt is based  on
alleged structural flaws in the presentation of the evidence  and
to repeated directions to the jury that they would have to decide
if   the  &#147;incident  took  place&#148;.  It  is  submitted  that   the
instructions  as structured would encourage the  jury  to  simply
choose the more persuasive of the competing versions.
[150]     The argument in essence relates to the trial judge&#146;s
personal tailoring of the charge to the particular evidence
called at trial. In light of the lesser number of accused and
counts and the success of this appeal on the expert opinion
evidence, the evidence may be substantially different at the new
trial. Hence, it would serve little purpose to deal with this
ground of appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>               D.   Competency hearing for child witness</pre>
    <pre>[151]      The  appellants submit that the trial judge  erred  in
permitting the eleven year old complainant S.K. to give  evidence
under  oath. It is submitted that the trial judge made no  effort
to determine if the witness understood the nature of the oath. It
is  conceded however that the witness was able to communicate the
evidence  and  that she could have been permitted to  testify  on
promising to tell the truth.
[152]     In his assessment of the child&#146;s capacity to testify,
the trial judge ensured that she understood the difference
between telling the truth and telling a lie. When the trial judge
inquired whether the child would tell the truth if asked to do so
she said &#147;Yes&#148;. When asked why she would tell the truth, she
answered &#147;Because you are promising others to tell the truth.&#148;
The witness also said she knew what an oath meant and stated that
it&#146;s when &#147;a guy comes up and he puts a bible, and he says, &#145;Put
your right hand on &#150; promising God, and everyone in this court
when you tell the truth&#146;.&#148; She added that she knew what the bible
was, having learned about it in school.
[153]     Although it may have been preferable if further inquiry
had been made on the witness&#146;s understanding of the solemnity of
the occasion and the importance of telling the truth, I see no
reason to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s exercise of discretion
in permitting the witness to testify under oath. As stated in R.
v. Marquard, at p. 220, &#147;a large measure of deference is to be
accorded to the trial judge&#146;s assessment of a child&#146;s capacity to
testify.&#148; Unless his discretion &#147;is manifestly abused&#148;, it should
not be interfered with.</pre>
    <pre>V.   Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[154]      For  the  reasons set out above,  I  would  allow  the
appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>                              (signed) &quot;Louise Charron J.A.&quot;
                              (signed) &quot;I agree R. McMurtry                               C.J.O.&quot;
</pre>
    <pre>RELEASED:  September 13, 1999</pre>
    <pre>
MOLDAVER J.A. (concurring in the result):</pre>
    <pre>[155]      I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of  my
colleague  Charron  J.A.  and  I  agree  with  her  analysis  and
conclusions  on all but the challenge for cause issue.   On  that
issue,  my  colleague  and I differ in our assessment  of  R.  v.
Williams  (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) and its impact  on
this court&#146;s decision in R. v. Betker (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 421
(leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused February 26, 1998).   With
respect, I do not share her view that following Williams,  Betker
remains  authoritative  on the subject of  challenges  for  cause
based  on  the nature of the crime.  By that, I do  not  mean  to
suggest  that as a result of Williams, applications to  challenge
for  cause  based on the nature of the crime are now destined  to
succeed  in  all cases.  To the contrary, in most instances  they
will not and to that extent, Betker remains authoritative.
[156]     But where, as here, the class of prejudice at issue is
generic, arising at least in part from stereotypical attitudes
and beliefs about the crime of sexual abuse and the parties
involved, the legal principles that led this court in Betker to
deny the legitimacy of all crime-based challenges must be
adjusted to conform with the principles set forth in Williams.
When the correct legal principles are applied to the evidence, I
am satisfied that there is reason to suppose that the jury pool
may contain people who are unable to apply the presumption of
innocence to persons charged with sexual abuse or who are unable
to fairly weigh the evidence of the accused and/or complainant.
In other words, the evidence meets the threshold test for
partiality enunciated in Williams.  It follows, in my opinion,
that the appellants should have been permitted to challenge
prospective jurors for cause and the trial judge erred in
concluding otherwise.

ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     Betker re-evaluated</pre>
    <pre>[157]      Writing  for the court in Betker,  I  found  that  the
evidence led in support of the application to challenge for cause
based  on  the  nature  of  the crimes (indecent  assault,  gross
indecency  and  incest)  did  not meet  the  threshold  test  for
partiality.  In coming to that conclusion, I tested the  evidence
against  legal  principles that have since  been  discredited  in
Williams.   The  impugned principles from Betker  are  summarized
below:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  ection 638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code speaks to a lack of
  indifference between the Crown and the accused, not the Crown and
  the type of offence charged.  The distinction is fundamental to a
  proper understanding of the permissible limits within which
  challenges for cause based on alleged partiality may be brought
  (p. 437);</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Unlike racial prejudice, where there is a direct and logical
  connection between the prejudice asserted and the particular
  accused, no such connection exists that would translate negative
  views about a particular crime into partiality against a
  particular accused (p. 441);</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  To meet the threshold test for partiality, the evidence must
  disclose a realistic possibility that one or more prospective
  jurors would be biased against the accused due to the nature of
  the crime and that such bias would influence a juror in the
  performance of his or her judicial duties (pp. 433, 436 and 442);
  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  A motion to challenge for cause must be dismissed if there
  is no &#147;concrete&#148; evidence that any of the prospective jurors
  could not set aside his or her biases and render a fair and
  impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence and legal
  instruction from the judge (p. 444).
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[158]      In light of Williams, the legal principles that  ought
to have been applied to the evidence are these:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Section 638(1)(b) of the Code is to be construed in a broad
  and purposive fashion.  It is designed to prevent persons who are
  not indifferent between the Crown and the accused from serving on
  the jury.  Section 638(1)(b) is triggered where there is a
  realistic possibility of partiality, regardless of the origin of
  the apprehension of partiality (pp. 490, 499 and 500);</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  A juror who is partial is a juror who is inclined to a
  certain party or a certain conclusion.  The predisposed state of
  mind caught by the term &#147;partial&#148; may arise from a variety of
  sources, including generic prejudice.
  Generic prejudice arises from stereotypical attitudes about
  the defendant, victims, witnesses or the nature of the crime
  itself.  Bias against a racial or ethnic group or against
  persons charged with sexual abuse are examples of generic
  prejudice (p. 488);</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Section 638(1)(b) of the Code requires two inquiries and
  entails two different decisions with two different tests. The
  test at the first stage is whether there is a realistic potential
  or possibility for partiality.  The question is whether there is
  reason to suppose that the jury pool may contain people who are
  prejudiced and whose prejudice might not be capable of being set
  aside on directions from the judge. The question at the second
  stage is whether the candidate in question will be able to act
  impartially (pp. 495-496); and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  It is wrong to suggest that an application to challenge for
  cause must be dismissed if there is no &#147;concrete&#148; evidence that
  any of the prospective jurors could not set aside his or her
  biases.  To ask an accused to present evidence that some jurors
  will be unable to set their prejudices aside is to ask the
  impossible.  In many cases, it can be inferred from the nature of
  the prejudice (widespread racial prejudice being one example)
  that some jurors at least may be influenced by those prejudices
  in their deliberations (pp. 492 and 497).</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[159]      A comparison of the two decisions leads me to conclude
that  the Betker approach to crime-based challenges is flawed  in
two significant respects.
[160]     First, Betker fails to give s. 638(1)(b) the fair,
large and liberal interpretation it deserves.  Properly
construed, the provision is triggered whenever there is a
realistic possibility of partiality, regardless of its origin.
Moreover, given that s. 638(1)(b) is aimed at ensuring a fair
trial, it is to be approached in the spirit suggested by
McLachlin J. at p. 492:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where doubts are raised, the better policy is to err on the
          side of caution and permit prejudices to be examined.  Only then
          can we know with any certainty whether they exist and whether
          they can be set aside or not.  It is better to risk allowing what
          are in fact unnecessary challenges, than to risk prohibiting
          challenges which are necessary. [footnotes omitted.]</pre>
    <pre>[161]      Second,  Betker  conflates  the  two  stages  of   the
challenge  for  cause  process.  Instead of  asking  whether  the
evidence  discloses the existence of a potential for  partiality,
Betker  demands  proof of partiality at the first  stage  of  the
inquiry.   In other words, Betker sets the evidentiary  threshold
for partiality too high.

     Evidence led in support of the application</pre>
    <pre>[162]      Charron J.A. has fairly summarized the evidence relied
upon  by  the  appellants  to show widespread  prejudice  against
persons charged with sexual abuse and there is no need to  repeat
it.  I would, however, make two brief observations.
[163]     First, as my colleague points out, although the trial
judge dismissed the challenge for cause application, he vetted
the jury panel for bias based on the nature of the allegations.
This resulted in no less than 23 prospective jurors being excused
by the trial judge on account of bias.
[164]     Second, Charron J.A. notes that the evidentiary base in
this case is far less extensive than that in Betker, particularly
if the unsworn affidavit of Professor Vidmar is ignored.  Be that
as it may, I do not take this to mean that my colleague would
have come to a different conclusion had the record in this case
been identical to that in Betker.  Rather, as I read her reasons,
it is my colleague&#146;s opinion that taken at its highest, the
evidence falls short of satisfying the threshold test for
partiality delineated in Williams.  That accounts for her
conclusion at paragraph 3 that &#150; &#147;[A]lthough Betker must now be
read in light of the principles in Williams, it remains
authoritative&#133; .&#148;
[165]     Even if I have misconstrued my colleague&#146;s approach to
the evidence, I see no impediment to amplifying the record by
taking judicial notice of the additional material filed in
Betker.   The evidence in question is a matter of public record
and one of the purposes of this appeal is to determine whether
Betker remains authoritative in light of Williams.
[166]     Considering the evidence in its entirety, and, where
appropriate, taking judicial notice of facts that are so
notorious as not to be the subject of dispute among reasonable
persons, the following findings of fact can safely be made:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Studies and surveys conducted in Canada over the past two
  decades reveal that a large percentage of the population, both
  male and female, have been the victims of sexual abuse.  From
  this, it is reasonable to infer that any given jury panel may
  contain victims of sexual abuse, perpetrators and people closely
  associated with them.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The harmful effects of sexual abuse can prove devastating
  not only to those who have been victimized, but those closely
  related to them.  Tragically, many victims remain traumatized and
  psychologically scarred for life.  By the same token, for those
  few individuals who have been wrongfully accused of sexual abuse,
  the effects can also be devastating.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Sexual assault tends to be committed along gender lines.  As
  a rule, it is women and children who are victimized by men.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Women and children have been subjected to systemic
  discrimination reflected in both individual and institutional
  conduct, including the criminal justice system.  As a result of
  widespread media coverage and the earnest and effective efforts
  of lobby groups in the past decade, significant and long overdue
  changes have come about in the criminal justice system.  For
  some, the changes have not gone far enough; for others, too far.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Where challenges for cause have been permitted in cases
  involving allegations of sexual abuse, literally hundreds of
  prospective jurors have been found to be partial by the triers of
  fact.  In those cases where trial judges have refused to permit
  the challenge, choosing instead to vet the panel at large for
  bias, the numbers are equally substantial.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Unlike many crimes, there are a wide variety of
  stereotypical attitudes and beliefs surrounding the crime of
  sexual abuse.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[167]      There is no need to elaborate on these findings  apart
from the last two.
[168]     With respect to the results obtained in prior cases
where challenges for cause have been permitted, at paragraphs 51
and 52 of her reasons, my colleague makes the point that it is
impossible to draw any meaningful inference from the answers
provided by prospective jurors when confronted with general
questions such as those found in the aborted jury selection
process in this case.  In this regard, she observes:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [T]he answers provided by the candidates for jury duty who
          were successfully challenged for cause in this case reveal
          nothing more than they may find it difficult to hear a case of
          this kind.  Many state that this is because they have children of
          their own or they may know someone who has been victimized.  The
          answers provide no evidence of partiality whatsoever.</pre>
    <pre>[169]      With  respect, I am unable to agree with my  colleague
that   the   answers  given  in  previous  cases  by  prospective
candidates found to be partial &#147;provide no evidence of partiality
whatsoever.&#148;  In Betker, I too rejected this body of evidence  as
unhelpful  because it failed to provide &#147;concrete&#148; evidence  that
any  of  the  prospective jurors could not set aside his  or  her
biases and render a fair and impartial verdict based solely  upon
the  evidence and legal instructions from the judge.  As Williams
points  out,  however,  that was too  high  a  test.   Considered
afresh, if nothing else, the responses disclose the existence  of
widespread  bias  against persons charged with sexual  abuse  and
strongly-held attitudes and beliefs capable of impacting  on  the
presumption  of innocence and the ability to judge  the  evidence
fairly.
[170]     Once widespread bias is shown to exist, according to
Williams, &#147;it may well be reasonable for the trial judge to infer
that some people will have difficulty identifying and eliminating
their biases&#148; (p. 492).  Whether the inference is reasonable will
depend upon a number of factors, including the nature and extent
of the bias at issue and the detrimental effects it may have on
an accused&#146;s right to a fair trial.
[171]     Turning next to the existence of stereotypical
attitudes surrounding the crime of sexual abuse, at para. 45 of
her reasons, my colleague points out that there are a variety of
pre-conceived notions surrounding the crime of sexual abuse, some
potentially harmful to an accused, others beneficial.  On the
harmful side of the ledger, she includes the following beliefs:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Children do not lie about being sexually abused;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Sexual abuse is pervasive in our society and persons accused
  of the crime are probably guilty;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The criminal trial process is unfairly stacked in favour of
  accused persons.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[172]      Having identified the divergent beliefs and attitudes,
my  colleague observes that it is not at all clear how one  could
infer that jurors harbouring such beliefs &#147;may discharge the jury
function  in  a  way that is improper or unfair to  an  accused.&#148;
Rather,  she  maintains,  it is &#147;more  likely  that  given  their
variance,  the  effect of these pre-conceived  notions  would  be
diffused during the course of the jurors&#146; deliberations.&#148;
[173]     If my colleague is correct, then surely the same
argument would apply to race-based challenges where one would
also expect to find divergent views amongst prospective jurors.
And yet, that argument has not prevailed.  The reason, I suggest,
is because the issue is not whether prospective jurors may hold
pre-conceived notions about the accused or in this case, the
nature of the crime itself, but whether the notions are so firmly
rooted that they may prove resistant to the usual trial
safeguards.</pre>
    <pre>
     The strain of bias at issue and its potential detrimental effects</pre>
    <pre>[174]     In my opinion, the crime of sexual abuse is capable  of
giving  rise  in  some   people to  a  strain  of  bias  that  is
particularly  virulent  and  potentially  resistant  to  judicial
cleansing.   In  this  respect,  I  am  guided  by  the  thoughts
expressed  by Professor Paciocco in an unpublished paper  titled,
&#147;Challenge  for  Cause  in  Jury Selection  after  R.  v.  Parks:
Practicalities and Limitations&#148; February 11, 1995.
[175]     In his paper, Professor Paciocco identifies two groups
of people &#150; victims and dogmatists &#150; who, in his view, are
capable of harbouring intense and deep-seated biases against
persons charged with sexual abuse that may be immune to the usual
trial safeguards and detrimental to an accused.12

[176]     With respect to victims, he writes:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Undeniably, those who have been victimized by sexual
          offences &#133; carry an incredible trauma.  Surely no evidence is
          needed to establish that.  The loss of self-worth, the feeling of
          helplessness and the need for validation are common themes in law
          reform initiatives and sentencing submissions before the courts.
          One cannot help but believe that these deep scars would, for
          some, prevent them from adjudicating sexual offence violations
          impartially.13 [Emphasis added, footnotes omitted.]</pre>
    <pre>[177]     As for dogmatists, he observes:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is difficult to argue that society is not somehow better
          because of the work of many of these people [support groups and
          lobbyists].  Moreover, it would be unreasonable to urge that no-
          one who characterizes themselves as &#147;feminist&#148; could discharge
          their function as jurors effectively and fairly; indeed,
          speaking generally the perspectives that some feminists bring to
          bear no doubt represent part of the cross-section of society
          that needs to be heard in jury rooms.  Yet, for others,
          commitment gives way to zealotry and dogma.  Just as there are
          sexist myths that have reduced the integrity of womanhood, there
          are sexist myths that would undermine the presumption of
          innocence.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Few  of us would not have seen placards
          held  in  front of courtrooms asserting  that
          &#147;woman  don&#146;t lie, men do.&#148;  Few of us  would
          not  have heard the often used rhetoric  that
          it  is the victim who is placed on trial,  or
          that sexual experience evidence relating to a
          complainant   is  never  relevant   to   what
          happened,  or that the system of  justice  is
          designed    to   protect   men   from    rape
          allegations, or that children never lie about
          sexual abuse.&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  possession  by a juror  of  biases
          relating   to  the  prosecution   of   sexual
          offences  is  exactly the kind of  bias  that
          requires   a  challenge  for  cause.    Parks
          advises  that  the nature and extent  of  the
          bias  must  be  considered.  We are  speaking
          here  of  beliefs more emotional and profound
          than  views on pornography.  We are  speaking
          of  what become for some, attitudes that  are
          ingrained  in  the  subconscious  and   which
          become a basis for self-identification.  Some
          will  even  consider  themselves  to  have  a
          personal  stake in the prosecution  based  on
          gender  empowerment.   Nothing  can  be  more
          resistant  to &#147;judicial cleansing&#148;  than  the
          conviction that the judicial system is biased
          against  women  and children, and  is  unable
          with  its  rules to protect victims or  women
          and children generally.  How much fidelity to
          judicial  discretion can be expected  on  the
          part  of  those  who see the  prosecution  of
          sexual offenders as a battlefront in a gender
          based   war?14   [Emphasis  added,  footnotes
          omitted.]</pre>
    <pre>[178]      It  is  important, I believe,  to  recognize  that  in
advocating  a  right to challenge for cause in  cases  of  sexual
abuse,   Professor   Paciocco  does   not   suggest   that   mere
disapprobation  of  a particular crime is sufficient  to  trigger
s. 638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.  Nor, for that matter, does he
take  the  position  that  all victims of  sexual  abuse  or  all
individuals  who  support change in the criminal  justice  system
must  necessarily be ousted from jury duty.  To the contrary,  he
accepts  that many such individuals will be perfectly capable  of
discharging their jury function in a fair and proper manner.   As
explained, his concerns lie with those individuals who, by virtue
of  the  nature and extent of their biases, may be  incapable  of
setting  their  biases aside and rendering a true  verdict  based
solely  on  the  evidence and legal instruction from  the  judge.
This accords entirely with the views expressed by McLachlin J. at
p.  492  of  Williams,  where, albeit in the  context  of  racial
prejudice, she states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where widespread racial bias is shown, it may well be reasonable
          for the trial judge to infer that some people will have
          difficulty identifying and eliminating their biases.  It is
          therefore reasonable to permit challenges for cause.  This is
          not to suggest that a prospective juror who on a challenge for
          cause admits to harbouring a relevant racial prejudice must
          necessarily be rejected.  It is for the triers on the challenge
          for cause to determine:  (1) whether a particular juror is
          racially prejudiced in a way that could affect his or her
          partiality; and (2) if so, whether the juror is capable of
          setting aside that prejudice.   [Emphasis added.]
         </pre>
    <pre>[179]      My colleague points out at paragraph 52 of her reasons
that  &#147;even  in  the  United States where  jurors  are  routinely
questioned on their feelings, opinions and beliefs, the mere fact
that a potential juror may have strong feelings or views about an
offence or has been the victim or is closely related to a  victim
of  a  similar crime is not sufficient reason to dismiss  him  or
her.&#148;  I do not disagree with the American position.  Indeed,  it
coincides  with the views expressed by McLachlin J. above.   With
respect, however, I do not find the American authorities  helpful
in resolving the issue at hand.
[180]     At issue is whether persons charged with sexual abuse
in Canada should be permitted to do what accused persons in the
United States are entitled to do as of right.  In other words,
does the evidence disclose a realistic potential for partiality?
Professor Paciocco points to the evidence of widespread prejudice
against persons charged with sexual abuse and argues, correctly
in my view, that having regard to the nature and extent of the
prejudice, there is reason to suppose that some members of the
jury pool may be incapable of setting aside their biases on
instructions from the judge.  In other words, the evidence
reaches a level sufficient to displace the presumption of
impartiality, thereby entitling persons charged with sexual abuse
to test the waters.
[181]     Professor Paciocco&#146;s thesis is not new.  Indeed, in
Betker, I considered and rejected it as &#147;speculative&#148; because it
was unsupported by empirical data.  In other words, absent
scientific validation, I was not prepared to acknowledge his
concern that some prospective jurors might have difficulty
setting their biases aside.
[182]     In light of Williams, it is now apparent that I set the
evidentiary bar too high.  The factual underpinnings of Professor
Paciocco&#146;s thesis are well documented, if not notorious.  No
reasonable person would dispute the harmful effects of sexual
abuse, nor the fact that in some instances, victims may remain
psychologically traumatized and scarred for life.  Nor can there
be any doubt that the criminal justice system has been, and in
the eyes of many, continues to be a source of systemic
discrimination against women and children.  Likewise, no
reasonable person would dispute the fact that the crime of sexual
abuse attracts myths and stereotypical attitudes and beliefs.
[183]     The real issue, as I perceive it, is whether the
factual underpinnings are reasonably capable of supporting the
inference that some prospective jurors may harbour the kind of
intense and deep seated biases that could prove resistant to
judicial cleansing and detrimental to an accused.  Admittedly,
the issue is a difficult one and not free from doubt.  On
balance, however, when the evidence is considered as a whole, I
am satisfied that there is a realistic basis for concern about
potential partiality in the jury pool where the crime alleged is
that of sexual abuse.  At very least, the evidence leaves me in a
state of doubt. That being so, I feel bound to heed the
admonition of McLachlin J., referred to above at para. 6, that
&#147;[W]here doubts are raised, the better policy is to err on the
side of caution and permit prejudices to be examined.&#148;
[184]     The type of bias at issue can prove detrimental to an
accused in a number of ways.  For example, it may impact on the
presumption of innocence and incline a juror to believe that an
accused is likely to have committed the crime alleged.
Alternatively, it may incline a juror to reject or put less
weight on the evidence of an accused or predispose a juror to a
complainant, particularly if he or she is a young child.
[185]     Experience has shown that sexual assault trials
generally boil down to the issue of credibility.  Often times,
the word of the complainant stands alone against that of the
accused and the line between guilt and innocence can be very
difficult to draw.  In this context, it is vitally important that
accused persons be permitted to examine prejudices that
unchecked, could determine where the line is drawn.

     The Floodgates Argument</pre>
    <pre>[186]     My colleague makes the point that if effect is given to
the  appellants&#146; argument, this will result in an endless  stream
of challenges for cause.  At para. 48, she observes:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In my view, if this court were to accept the appellants&#146;
          argument, it would be tantamount to a wholesale adoption of the
          approach in the United States.  Every juror would be viewed as
          suspect.  Every candidate for jury duty could be challenged and
          questioned as to preconceptions and prejudices in an effort to
          uncover potential partiality.  There would be no rational basis
          to limit the adoption of this procedure to trials for sexual
          offences.  Indeed, why would there not be strong feelings,
          opinions and beliefs about murders of children, child
          pornography, drug trafficking, abuse of the elderly, convenience
          store robberies or break and entries into private homes?</pre>
    <pre>[187]     I too expressed similar concerns in Betker.  At p. 438,
I wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If strongly held views about a particular crime are allowed to
          become a yardstick against which partiality is measured, then,
          on a principled approach, I fail to see how the crime of sexual
          assault can be meaningfully distinguished from other crimes such
          as murder, robbery, break and enter or drug trafficking, to
          mention but a few.</pre>
    <pre>[188]      When the principles set forth in Williams are  applied
to   crime-based  challenges  for  cause,  I  believe  that   the
&#147;floodgate&#148; argument loses much of its force.  At the  outset  of
these reasons, I observed that challenges for cause based on  the
nature  of  the  crime will rarely succeed.  In this  respect,  I
remain  firmly  of the view that standing alone, strong  feelings
about  a  particular crime and those who commit it will generally
not  suffice  to  meet  the threshold test for  partiality.   But
where,  as  here,  the  type of prejudice at  issue  is  generic,
arising at least in part from stereotypical attitudes and beliefs
about  the  crime  of  sexual  abuse and  the  parties  involved,
different  considerations apply.  In concluding  that  challenges
for  cause should be permitted in cases of sexual abuse,  I  have
taken into account a number of features about the crime that tend
to distinguish it from most other crimes.  These include:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  The prevalence of the crime;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The long-lasting and devastating effects it produces in many
  victims;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The fact that sexual abuse is a gender-based crime;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The fact that the criminal justice system has been a source
  of systemic discrimination against women and children and for
  some, the prosecution of sexual offences is seen as a
  battleground in the war between the sexes;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The existence of stereotypical attitudes about the crime of
  sexual abuse and the parties involved; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The fact that sexual assault trials tend to be emotionally
  charged, particularly in cases of child abuse, where the mere
  allegation can trigger feelings of hostility, resentment and
  disgust in the minds of jurors.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[189]      Combined, these factors lead me to believe that unlike
other  crimes, by its nature, the crime of sexual abuse can  give
rise  to  intense and deep-seated biases that may  be  immune  to
judicial cleansing and highly prejudicial to an accused.

Proposed Format For Challenge For Cause Process</pre>
    <pre>[190]      At  paras.  13  and 53 of her  reasons,  my  colleague
identifies  two deficiencies in the process where challenges  for
cause  have  been  permitted in cases  involving  allegations  of
sexual  abuse  &#150; first, the questions posed are often  confusing;
second, prospective jurors have not been provided with meaningful
instruction  on  the  nature  of jury  duty  or  the  meaning  of
impartiality.
[191]     By and large, I share my colleague&#146;s concerns.  To that
end, I have appended to these reasons a document prepared by
counsel for the respondent at the request of the court, titled,
&#147;Proposed Format For Challenge For Cause Process.&#148;  In my view,
the format correctly outlines the kind of legal instruction trial
judges should provide and the type of question prospective jurors
should be asked.
[192]     Although the format is designed for cases involving
sexual abuse of children, it can be easily adjusted as necessary.
Importantly, the wording used is not meant to be compulsory.  It
is merely a suggested format to guide trial judges and counsel in
future cases.
CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[193]     In the final analysis, I am satisfied that the risk  of
partiality in cases of sexual abuse is very real.  It follows, in
my  opinion, that challenges for cause based on the nature of the
crime should be permitted upon request.
[194]     The appellants should have been permitted to challenge
prospective jurors for cause based on the nature of the crime.
They were deprived of that right and it cannot be said that they
received a fair trial by an impartial jury.  For this reason and
the reasons given by my colleague on the expert evidence issue, I
would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

                                </pre>
    <pre>         PROPOSED FORMAT FOR CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE PROCESS
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
A.   Proposed General Instruction to the Panel to be given by the
     Trial Judge</pre>
    <pre>&#147;We  are  now  going  to  pick a jury through  a  process  called
&#147;challenge for cause&#148;.  Defence counsel will be permitted to  ask
each  prospective juror whose name is called a question  designed
to inquire whether that juror can keep an open mind and follow my
instructions.   The  reason for this process  is  because  it  is
recognized  that in cases of sexual abuse of children  people  in
the  community may hold strong views.  Let me make it clear  that
you   are   not   to  take  from  this  that  it  is  necessarily
inappropriate  to  have  opinions  about  the  sexual  abuse   of
children.   One  would expect that most people would  think  such
conduct  is  wrong.  Rather, the concern is that  notwithstanding
those  opinions you must be able to keep an open mind  and  judge
this  case  fairly and objectively, and only on the evidence  you
hear.  You must be able to presume the innocence of [name of  the
accused] throughout the trial and only set aside that presumption
if  the  Crown  has proved [name of the accused] guilt  beyond  a
reasonable doubt.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;Similarly,  it  is recognized that acting as a juror  can  be  a
challenging  and sometimes difficult responsibility.   You  ought
not  to  assume that just because you expect it will be difficult
that you would necessarily be a poor juror.  This is an important
responsibility  that  we  ask  of our  citizens,  because  it  is
essential to our jury system that citizens be willing to  sit  on
juries.  I know that each of you will consider the question posed
very carefully.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>B.   Proposed Instructions to the Two Triers by the Trial Judge</pre>
    <pre>&#147;You  have heard my preliminary remarks.  Your role is  to  judge
the challenge.  You must decide if the prospective juror will  be
able  to  keep  an open mind and be impartial.   You  may  confer
between  the  two  of  you  and then tell  me  whether,  in  your
unanimous opinion, you think that the juror will be impartial  or
partial.   As I have already indicated, you ought not  to  assume
that  having  an  opinion or belief about  the  sexual  abuse  of
children  necessarily excludes a prospective juror.  The question
is  whether, even with such beliefs, that prospective  juror  can
keep  an  open mind, follow my instructions, and judge  the  case
fairly.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>C.   Proposed Question by Counsel</pre>
    <pre>&#147;As  His/Her  Honour  will tell you,  [name of  the  accused]  is
presumed innocent unless the Crown has proven the charges against
him/her  beyond  a  reasonable doubt.  A  juror  must  judge  the
evidence  of all witnesses without bias, prejudice or partiality,
that  is  the juror must decide this case with an open  and  fair
mind  and render a true verdict based only on the evidence  given
in the trial.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;In  this  case, the prosecution alleges that [name the  accused]
committed a number of sexual offences against children.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;Some people in the community, who have thought about the matter,
have  developed  beliefs or attitudes about the sexual  abuse  of
children.   Other  people  may  hold  no  particular  beliefs  or
attitudes on this subject.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;You  are not being asked to tell us what views you may hold,  if
any, or what personal experiences you may have had.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;However,  assuming that you hold a belief or attitude about  the
sexual abuse of children, would any such belief prevent you  from
giving a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely  on
the evidence and the instructions of the trial judge?&#148;
_______________________________
1 It would appear that this vetting of the panel for bias was
done with the consent of the parties. It should be noted that the
trial in this case was heard before this court&#146;s decision in
Betker where it was held that the trial judge has no authority to
prescreen the prospective jurors in this manner. Where the
alleged ground of partiality is not obvious, resort must be had
to s.638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code and the usual procedure for
challenges for cause must be followed.
2 The following articles were submitted to the trial judge on the
application: Cooper, &quot;The ABC&#146;s of Challenge for Cause&quot; [1994]

Impartiality&quot;, Sexual Offences Law Reporter (Sept. 1994);

Developments in Criminal Law, 11 February 1995); Skurka,

Skurka, &quot;Sex Abuse Cases II&quot;, C.L.A. Education Programme
(November 1994).
3 This appeal was heard together with the appeals in R. v. K.F. and
in R. v. D.P. (released concurrently with this
judgment) in which the accused&#146;s right to challenge for cause in
all cases of sexual assault was also raised. The arguments
presented to the court by counsel in all three cases have been
considered for the purpose of  writing this judgment.
4 The issue, however, was before this court in Betker and while
the court did not completely foreclose the nature of the crime
itself as a potential source of partiality it expressed the view
that &#147;strong attitudes about a particular crime, even when
accompanied by intense feelings of hostility and resentment
towards those who commit the crime, will rarely, if ever,
translate into partiality in respect of the accused.&#148; (at p.441)
5 The motion for leave to appeal the decision in Betker to the
Supreme Court of Canada was filed in September 1997 and refused
on February 26, 1998.  The appeal in Williams was argued on
February 24, 1998.

7 See for example: State v. Marcus, 34 N.W. 2d 178 (Sup. Ct.
Iowa, 1948); Com. v. Myers, 545 A. 2d 309 (Pa. Super. 1988);
State v. Walker, 795 S.W. 2d 522 (Mo. App. 1990); Tenon v. State,
545 So. 2d 382 (Dist. Ct. App. 1989); State v. Bebermeyer, 743
S.W. 2d 516 (Mo. App. 1987); State v. Evans, 701 S.W. 2d 569 (Mo.
App. 1985); U.S. v. Sumler, 1998 U.S. App. Lexis 13714; State v.
House, 456 S.E. 2d 292 (Sup. Ct. N.C. 1995); Nichols v. State,

2d 868 (Sup. Ct. Ga. 1995); State v. Lewis, 452 So. 2d 720 (La.
Ct. App. 4 Cir. 1984); State v. Jones, 584 S.W. 2d 60 (Mo. App.
1993).
8 It ultimately falls upon the trial judge to be the gate-keeper
with respect to this type of evidence. Expert opinion evidence
that does not meet the criteria for admissibility cannot be
admitted regardless of the position of counsel.  See for example
R. v. McIntosh (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A. ) at 391
where this court expressed &#147;astonishment&#148; at the passivity of
Crown counsel with respect to the proposed defence expert
evidence on the issue of eyewitness identification. This court
was critical of the fact that courts are &#147;overly eager to
abdicate their fact-finding responsibilities to &#145;experts&#146; in the
field of the behavioural sciences&#148; without sufficient inquiry
into whether the subject-matter itself admits of expert
testimony.
9 McCormick on Evidence, 3rd ed. (1984), at 544.
10 See R. v. Beland (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 481 where this evidence
was not admitted.
11 See the reference made in R. v. Mohan to the trial judge&#146;s
ruling in R. v. Bourguignon at p. 412.
12    Professor Vidmar does not draw a distinction between victims
and dogmatists and the public at large.  In his view, all members
of  the  public  are suspect and potentially capable  of  holding
attitudes  and beliefs that bear on the presumption of  innocence
when  a  defendant  is  accused of  sexual  abuse.   See  Vidmar,
&#147;Generic  Prejudice  and the Presumption of Guilt  in  Sex  Abuse
Trials&#148; (1997), 21 Law and Human Behaviour 5 at p. 18.
13    I would add that in some cases, the same reasoning may apply
to persons closely associated with victims and persons wrongfully
accused of sexual abuse.
14    The same arguments can be made in respect of extremists on
the other side of the fence.</pre></td>
