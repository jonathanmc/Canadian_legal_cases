COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and TRACIE
               ALBERTS and MALCOLM FORD (Appellants)
                              </pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, AUSTIN AND MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Alan D. Gold, for the appellant Malcolm Ford
               Michael W. Lacy, for the appellant Tracie
               Alberts Erin McKey, for the respondent
               </pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of L. Templeton J., dated
September 11, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                    ENDORSEMENT
                              </pre>
    <pre>                              
[1]  There was ample evidence to support the committal of
the appellant Tracie Alberts and the committal judge made no
error in so doing. In particular he was justified on this
record in finding that it was open to a trier of fact to
infer that the substantial amounts of cash in her purse and
elsewhere in the house were the product of a significant
trafficking operation. </pre>
    <pre>[2]  The evidence against Malcolm Ford is not at that level.
The search resulted in the seizure of a gym bag containing 
twelve bricks of a substance later analysed as Cannabis Resin.
Each brick weighed approximately one kilogram.  This 
appellant&#146;s fingerprints were found on the wrappings 
surrounding six of the bricks and on the inner aluminum
wrapping of one of the bricks.  There was evidence of an
association between him and the appellant Alberts, who lived 
in the premises. She represented herself publicly as Mrs. Ford 
and she ordered furniture for the household in the name of 
Mrs. Ford. She had $39,000 in wrapped bundles of $100 bills 
in her purse. She had separated $2,300 of this money for the 
payment of household furniture that ironically was scheduled to
be delivered the day of the seizure. Accordingly, there is some
evidence that this house, which was the base for this
commercial drug operation, was also the matrimonial home of
the two appellants. Although the appellant was not in the
premises at the time of the search, he had been arrested
that very day and unavailable as a result.

[3]  In the circumstances, we can find no error on the part
of the committal judge in committing either of the
appellants.

[4]  The appeal is dismissed.
