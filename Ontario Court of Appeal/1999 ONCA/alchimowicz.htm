BY THE COURT:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Very early one summer morning in 1992, the appellant, while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">grossly intoxicated, dived from the railing of a dock into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shallow water and was rendered a quadriplegic. He brought an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action in negligence for the damages he sustained against a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">number of individual defendants and the Corporation of the City</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Windsor (&quot;Windsor&quot;). The individual defendants were all co-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">workers or former co-workers of the appellant who had some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">involvement with him during the evening of the tragic accident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Windsor owned and operated Sand Point Beach park where the dock</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was located. After a month long trial on the issue of liability,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge found that the appellant's negligence was the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sole cause of his injuries and dismissed the action.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant appeals against the dismissal of his action,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claiming a 75% contribution against the individual respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and Windsor. It is beyond controversy that the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">actions constituted negligence. At issue on this appeal is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the sole author of his misfortune.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We did not call upon any of the individual respondents to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respond to the appellant's argument on the appeal. In our view,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the trial judge was correct in finding that the evidence did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">support the factual basis of the appellant's argument in support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of liability with respect to any of the individual respondents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  We do not find it necessary to deal with each individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">separately. It is implicit and clear from the trial judge's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons that he found that the appellant's actions were beyond</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the scope of reasonable foreseeability on the part of any of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents. This finding, which is well supported by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence and with which we agree, is sufficient, in and of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">itself, to defeat the appellant's claim against the individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents. In light of the lack of foreseeability of the risk,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it is not necessary for us to determine what duty, if any, may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have arisen from the relationship between any of the respondents</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and the appellant, or what standard of care was expected of them</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the particular circumstances of this case.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The trial judge was also correct in dismissing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's claim against Windsor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  It is common ground between the parties that Windsor, as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occupier, had the duty to make the premises reasonably safe for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its users. The appellant advanced three theories of liability at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trial. He focussed on one of them on the appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  First, the appellant argued at trial that the length of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dock, the buoy lines, the pilons and the railing created an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impression of deep water and constituted an invitation to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prudent or the imprudent to dive from the railing or the dock.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The trial judge rejected this argument. Instead, he found that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">these factors were indicators not to dive. He noted in particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the dock was not located within the swimming area and that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the 37 inch railing which enclosed the dock on three sides was an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obvious indication that this was not a swimming dock. He</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concluded that if this was not a swimming dock, then obviously</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the railing could not be considered a diving platform. His</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion was reinforced by the historical evidence that he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted showing that children up to 15 years of age occasionally</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jumped off the dock, but that no one had been seen diving off the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">railing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The trial judge's findings as they relate to this argument</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are well supported by the evidence. Based on these facts, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agree with his conclusion that the appellant's first theory of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability is not made out.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Second, the appellant argued that if &quot;No Diving&quot; signs had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been prominently erected, the potential danger would have been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disclosed both to the appellant and to the persons who were with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">him who could have alerted him to the danger. The trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also rejected this argument. There were signs erected prohibiting</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the use of the park between midnight and 5:00 a.m.; the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">paid no attention to them. The appellant was told not to go in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the water and not to jump by some of the respondents; he did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">heed the advice.  The trial judge accepted expert evidence that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;No Diving&quot; signs would not benefit a person as intoxicated as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant. The trial judge concluded that he had considerable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doubt on the evidence that a sign would have been effective.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In our view, the trial judge's conclusion on this point is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unassailable on the record before him. It is clear from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant's own evidence that he was familiar with Sand Point</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Beach as he had been swimming there several times before. He had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">also been on the dock in the day time. He was a trained lifeguard</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and was aware of the danger of swimming at night, particularly in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a state of intoxication, and the risk involved in diving without</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first checking the depth of the water. He agreed that he never</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would have dived from the dock had he been sober. It is clear</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that a &quot;No Diving&quot; sign would not have increased the appellant's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">knowledge of the risk he ran.  The danger of diving from the dock</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was also evident to all the individual respondents. There is no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty to warn of a danger which is so obvious and apparent that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">anyone would be aware of it.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Lastly, the appellant argued that Windsor should have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">installed a railing that was not flat on the top so as to make it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">more difficult for someone to stand on it and dive from the dock.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Evidence was adduced that, for example, a round configuration</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would make it &quot;almost impossible&quot; for someone to stand on it,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">thereby reducing the risk of diving. The appellant focussed on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this argument on appeal, arguing that the trial judge failed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deal with this &quot;theory&quot; of liability in his reasons.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] We do not consider this argument as a separate theory of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">liability. Rather, the configuration of the railing was but one</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factor to be considered in all the circumstances. It was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incumbent on the trial judge to deal with every aspect of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence in his reasons. In any event, the trial judge expressly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered the railing in his reasons on the first argument and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rejected any argument that the dock, including the railing,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">constituted an invitation to dive. Hence, there is no basis to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to consider</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this evidence.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] In any event, we see no merit in the appellant's argument</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Windsor was negligent in failing to install a railing that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was not flat. In fulfilling its duty as an occupier, it was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incumbent upon Windsor to guard against every possible accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that might occur. Windsor was only required to exercise care</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against dangers that were sufficiently probable to be included in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the category of contingencies normally to be foreseen: Wade v.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Canadian National Railway Co (1978), 80 D.L.R. 214 (S.C.C.) at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">231. In our view, an adult diving off the dock at night into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">shallow water was not one of these contingencies. To exact a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">standard as suggested by the appellant would effectively make</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Windsor an insurer against all possible risks. The law imposes no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">such duty.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Finally, we are not persuaded on the evidence that a round</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">railing, any more than a &quot;no diving&quot; sign would have been an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">effective deterrent to the appellant.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The consequences of this accident are indeed tragic.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">However, the evidence in support of the trial judge's conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellant is the sole author of his own misfortune is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">overwhelming.  There is no reason for this court to interfere.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not follow the event, other than the possible impecuniosity of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents if requested.</font></pre></td>
