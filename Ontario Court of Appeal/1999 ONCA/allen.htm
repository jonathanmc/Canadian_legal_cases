</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by O&#146;Connell J., with a jury, on
November 23, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of
robbery, one count of using a firearm in the commission of an
indictable offence and one count of being masked with intent to
commit an indictable offence and he received a sentence of six
and one-half years&#146; imprisonment. He appeals against conviction
only.</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was charged with having committed two armed
robberies, one relating to the Academy Tuck Shop, a variety
store, the other to Sky Jewellers, a jewellery store. In the
Academy robbery, it was alleged that the appellant acted with an
accomplice by the name of Christopher Wright. Both men wore
masks. With respect to the jewellery store robbery, a
surveillance video disclosed a man who appeared to be acting
alone, without a mask.
[3]  Christopher Wright was arrested on a number of charges
following these robberies. During his interrogation, he
implicated the appellant in the jewellery store robbery. The
appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with both
robberies and various related offences.
[4]  Although the Crown relied to some extent on eyewitness
evidence, as well as the surveillance video, to prove identity,
the case against the appellant rested primarily on three
inculpatory statements made by him to the police following his
arrest. Two of the statements (the last two) were audio-taped and
it is not disputed that in each, the appellant confessed to his
complicity in the robberies. The first statement also contained a
full confession but unlike the latter two, it was manually
transcribed by one of the investigating officers.
[5]  At trial, the officers testified that the statements
obtained from the appellant were voluntary and that he readily
admitted his participation in the robberies. The appellant, on
the other hand, testified that he took no part in the robberies.
With respect to the statements, he claimed that the police had
concocted the first statement and then physically coerced him
into falsely confessing on tape to the robberies. In the final
analysis, the jury was called upon to resolve the credibility
dispute between the police and the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>     Challenge for Cause</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant is black and he sought to challenge each
prospective juror for cause as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Do you hold any opinions or beliefs about young black men
          and the commission of crime, particularly crimes involving
          robbery and guns, that would prevent you from judging the
          evidence in this case without bias, prejudice or partiality?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge permitted a challenge for cause on the basis
of the appellant&#146;s race but refused to include in the question
the nature and type of crimes with which the appellant had been
charged.
[8]  For reasons which will be developed fully in R. v. Barnes,
file number C26957, heard together with this appeal, we are of
the view that although it would have been open to the trial
judge, in the exercise of his discretion, to permit the proposed
question, he did not err in refusing to do so.</pre>
    <pre>     Hearsay Evidence of Christopher Wright</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In her opening address to the jury, Crown counsel told the
jury that the appellant had been arrested as a result of
information the police had received from one Christopher Wright.
In particular, the jury was informed that: Wright had admitted to
committing the robberies with the appellant; the appellant was
known to him only as &#147;Lover&#146;s Choise&#148; and Wright had identified
the appellant in a photograph shown to him by the police.
[10] Defence counsel objected to this aspect of the Crown
opening. He moved for a mistrial on the ground that Wright was
not going to be called as a witness and any information the
police had received from him was inadmissible hearsay. The trial
judge refused to order a mistrial but he admonished the Crown not
to lead evidence about Wright or the specific information
received from him unless the Crown planned to call Wright as a
witness.
[11] For reasons that are not apparent on the record, even though
Wright was not called as a witness, in Detective Lacey&#146;s
examination-in-chief, the Crown led in detail the very evidence
concerning Wright which the trial judge had forbidden. To make
matters worse, Detective Lacey went further and stated that he
had learned the appellant&#146;s real name from police sources who
knew him as &#147;Lover&#146;s Choise.&#148;
[12] The prejudicial effect of this hearsay evidence was
compounded when the Crown, in-chief, led evidence that upon his
arrest, the appellant was found to be in possession of a cassette
with a label which read &#147;Traffic Jam and Lover&#146;s Choise.&#148;
[13] As might be expected, given the significance the appellant&#146;s
nickname had taken on, the appellant&#146;s mother and a family friend
were called as witnesses by the defence to state that they were
unaware of the appellant being referred to as &#147;Lover&#146;s Choise.&#148;
The appellant then gave evidence and he too denied ever using
that name.
[14] Unbeknownst to him, before the defence opened its case,
Crown counsel had come into possession of invoices from the
appellant&#146;s place of business which identified him as &#147;Lover&#146;s
Choise.&#148;  These invoices, however, were not disclosed to the
defence as they should have been.
[15] In what can only be described as a surprise attack, Crown
counsel confronted the appellant with these invoices and although
he attempted to explain them away, his credibility was no doubt
undermined in the eyes of the jury. Defence counsel brought the
Crown&#146;s failure to disclose to the attention of the trial judge
and requested a mistrial. The trial judge refused to give effect
to this request. He did, however, instruct the jury that the
information which the police had received from Wright was not
evidence and that the jury should disregard it in arriving at a
verdict.
[16] With respect, we are of the view that the limiting
instruction did not overcome the prejudice occasioned to the
appellant by the admission of this evidence. The appellant
submits, correctly in our view, that the information which the
police received from Wright and other police sources concerning
the identity of the appellant and his involvement in the
robberies was inadmissible hearsay and it should not have been
brought to the attention of the jury. Although the respondent
sought to justify the admission of this evidence as part of the
narrative, the prejudicial effect was too great to warrant its
reception on that basis.
[17] The prejudice was compounded by the use made of the invoices
to impeach the appellant&#146;s credibility. Counsel for the
respondent conceded that Crown counsel at trial had an obligation
to disclose the invoices to the defence when they came into her
possession. As it is, the invoices were used in a surprise attack
to impeach the credibility of the appellant and, in our opinion,
the appellant has more than satisfied his onus of establishing
that the non-disclosure may have affected the outcome of the
trial, not to mention the overall fairness of the trial process.</pre>
    <pre>     Conduct of the Trial Judge</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant submits that the trial judge made unwarranted
derogatory remarks about the conduct of defence counsel and that
he also unfairly undermined the defence theory that the police
had engaged in criminal conduct to elicit false confessions from
the appellant, thereby destroying the appearance of a fair trial.
[19] The most egregious of the alleged derogatory remarks
occurred when the trial judge interrupted defence counsel in his
closing address as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Defence Counsel:  You have heard that at Christopher
          Wright&#146;s preliminary hearing Calvin Allen was called as a
          witness, and made an allegation there that Detective Lacey pulled
          this earring out of his ear. They [the police] are pretending
          they don&#146;t know about it even though the allegation was made way
          back then &#150;
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court:  That is a very unfair
          comment. You must cease doing that. The jury
          can draw their own conclusions. Your comments
          are scandalous. It is not supported by the
          evidence. Put forward the evidence to the
          jury and leave your personal, scandalous
          comments out of it. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[20] Counsel for the respondent fairly concedes that the
submission of defence counsel, to which the trial judge took
exception, was founded on the evidence and that the trial judge&#146;s
demeaning remarks were unwarranted.
[21] With respect to comments made by the trial judge that
allegedly undermined the defence theory concerning police
brutality, the appellant cited the following examples from the
charge:
          </pre>
    <pre>               To me, it is not the function of counsel to allege criminal
          activity on the part of witnesses. It is the function of counsel
          to make submissions to you on the evidence, to quote it to you
          accurately, and allow you to decide whether you have a reasonable
          doubt. We are not trying the Hold-up Squad in this case. We are
          not trying their procedures. That is not your function or mine. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               I told you the issue is the identity of
          the robber, not police brutality, not the
          conduct of the Hold-up Squad, not
          conspiracies, nothing else. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Crown referred to the fifty-seven
          minute statement [the first statement] that I
          referred to and the procedures that are
          involved, and I submit to you there is no
          conspiracy in this procedure. The steps taken
          were appropriate. There is no legal
          requirement on the police to video. There is
          other independent kinds of procedures and you
          have it before you. [Emphasis added
          throughout.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[22] Once again, counsel for the respondent concedes that in view
of the evidentiary foundation laid by the defence, the opinions
expressed by the trial judge were inappropriate. In the final
analysis, however, the respondent submits that when the record is
considered as a whole, the conduct of the trial judge did not
destroy the appearance of a fair trial.
[23] Given our conclusion on the second ground of appeal,  it is
unnecessary to finally decide whether this ground of appeal,
standing alone, would have warranted a new trial. Suffice it to
say that the concerns raised by the appellant reinforce our
overall conclusion that the appellant did not receive a fair
trial.</pre>
    <pre>     Adverse Inference Against the Police</pre>
    <pre>[24] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in refusing
to instruct the jury that in assessing the credibility of the
officers responsible for taking the statements from him, they
could draw an adverse inference against the police for failing to
electronically record the first statement.
[25] Based on the record, we believe that it would have been open
to the trial judge to give such an instruction. However, we are
not persuaded that his failure to do so was fatal. What troubles
us more is the manner in which the trial judge instructed the
jury on this issue. In this regard, he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Crown referred to the fifty-seven minute statement [the
          first statement] that I referred to and the procedures that are
          involved, and I submit to you there is no conspiracy in this
          procedure. The steps taken were appropriate. There is no legal
          requirement on the police to video. There is other independent
          kinds of procedures and you have it before you.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[26] By instructing the jury as he did, the trial judge
effectively put his stamp of approval on the method used by the
police to record the first statement. With respect, having regard
to the record, the procedure adopted by the police was at least
open to question and, in our view, it was inappropriate for the
trial judge to endorse their conduct as he did.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[27] In the result, we are of the view that the appellant did not
receive a fair trial. Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set
aside the convictions and order a new trial on those counts for
which the appellant was found guilty.
