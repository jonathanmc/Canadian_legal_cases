    <pre>HEARD:         October 6, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Somers J. dated July 25, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant submits that by following the price protection
plan for more than one year the respondent adopted a course of
conduct that made it inequitable for it to revert to terms of the
written contract.
[2]  In our view, that argument cannot be accepted in the face of
the explicit findings of the trial judge that the appellant was
made aware from the outset that the price protection plan was a
temporary measure only and was not intended to replace the terms
of the written supply agreement.  In our view, it was open to the
trial judge to make those findings which are fatal to the
appellant&#146;s argument.
[3]  With respect to the other ground of appeal, we agree with
the reasons of the trial judge dismissing the claim for inducing
breach of contract.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
