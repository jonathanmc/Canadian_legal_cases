    <pre>On appeal from the order of Sutherland J. dated October 28, 1998</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Attorney General for Ontario appeals from the order of
Sutherland J. declaring s. 37 of the Health Care Consent Act,
S.O. 1996, c. 2, Sch. A (the &#147;Act&#148;) unconstitutional &#147;to the
extent that it fails to provide for notice to Substitute Decision
Makers.&#148;  Dr. Catherine Benes appeals from the order of
Sutherland J. declaring that had the administrative law issues
not been rendered moot by the discharge of the patient A.T.M.,
the matter would have been remitted to the Board for a re-
hearing.  A.M., the substitute decision maker (&#147;S.D.M.&#148;) cross-
appeals and seeks a declaration that s. 37(3) of the Act violates
the rights afforded to incapable persons under s. 7 of the
Charter to the extent that it permits the Consent and Capacity
Board (the &#147;Board&#148;) to override treatment decisions of S.D.M.&#146;s
that are otherwise reasonable and made in good faith.
[2]  For reasons which follow, we would allow the appeals and
dismiss the cross-appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Background Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The incapable person, A.T.M., suffers from schizophrenia.
On October 15, 1996, A.T.M. was admitted to the Clarke Institute
of Psychiatry as an involuntary patient.  Dr. Benes, her treating
physician, found A.T.M. to be incapable of consenting to
treatment.  As a result, A.T.M.&#146;s mother, A.M., became her S.D.M.
pursuant to s. 20 of the Act.
[4]  To treat A.T.M., Dr. Benes recommended that she be given
electro-convulsive therapy (&#147;ECT&#148;) and anti-psychotic medication.
Although A.M. had consented to ECT treatments on behalf of her
daughter in the past, on this occasion she refused to consent to
the proposed treatment.
[5]  Faced with A.M.&#146;s refusal, Dr. Benes applied to the Board
under s. 37 of the Act for a review of A.M.&#146;s decision.  A.M.
received a notice of hearing dated November 6, 1996 and an
amended notice of hearing dated November 7, 1996, informing her
that the Board would hold a hearing to determine whether she had
complied with the principles of substitute decision-making
prescribed by the Act.  The notice informed A.M. that she had the
right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, examine
witnesses and make submissions.
[6]  The hearing was held on November 11, 1996. Dr. Benes and
A.M. appeared in person; A.T.M. did not attend.  At the outset of
the proceedings, the Board explained that the purpose of the
hearing was to determine whether A.T.M. had complied with the
requirements of s. 21 of the Act in refusing to permit the ECT
treatments proposed by Dr. Benes.  The Board also explained the
procedures that would be followed.  At this juncture, there was
no indication from A.M. that she was unfamiliar with the
requirements of s. 21 of the Act.  It was not until the end of
the hearing that she claimed a lack of familiarity with that
provision.
[7]  After a full hearing in which Dr. Benes and A.M. gave
evidence, the Board concluded that A.M. had not complied with the
requirements of s. 21 of the Act and directed her to consent to
the treatment prescribed by Dr. Benes by 5:00 p.m. on November
13, 1996, failing which her right to act as substitute decision-
maker would pass to the next eligible person under s. 20 of the
Act.
[8]  On November 13, 1996, A.M. filed a notice of appeal from the
Board&#146;s decision.  The next day, the Board released written
reasons explaining why, in its opinion, A.M. had failed to comply
with the provisions of s. 21 of the Act.  In short, the Board
found that A.M.&#146;s refusal to consent to the proposed ECT
treatments was motivated by her fear that A.T.M. would be
discharged from the hospital too early if she received the
treatments.  The Board also found that A.M. had been threatened
by her daughter with serious consequences if she consented again
to ECT treatments and that A.T.M. had insufficient insight to
make &#147;apparently capable wishes&#148; even when in remission.  The
Board concluded its reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; pursuant to subsection 37(3) the Board substitutes its
          opinion for that of the substitute decision-maker in that she did
          not properly consider the directions set out in section 21.  In
          the Board&#146;s opinion if the directions had been properly
          considered, the substitute decision-maker would have consented to
          the treatment.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  After obtaining counsel, A.M. filed a supplementary notice
of appeal, dated January 10, 1997.  The notice of appeal raised
various administrative law issues and also included a Notice of
Constitutional Question.  The constitutional issue was framed as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant intends to question the constitutional
          validity and applicability of the scheme under the Health Care
          Consent Act &#133; permitting the making of orders by the Consent and
          Capacity Board requiring a substitute decision-maker to consent
          to the giving of Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT), over the
          refusal of the substitute decision-maker, on the basis that the
          Consent and Capacity Board&#146;s opinion is different from that of
          the substitute decision-maker.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appeal was argued before Sutherland J. on February 27
and 28 and March 4, 1997 and Sutherland J. reserved his decision.
Prior to releasing his judgment, A.T.M. was discharged from the
hospital without receiving ECT treatments.  Sutherland J.
released his final decision on the constitutional question on
October 28, 1998.  On May 28, 1999, he released separate reasons
on the administrative law issues.
[11] With respect to the constitutional issue, Sutherland J.
rejected A.M.&#146;s argument that s. 37(3) contravened s. 7 of the
Charter insofar as it empowered the Board to review and, in
specified circumstances, override a substitute decision-maker&#146;s
treatment decision.  He also rejected the submission that the
Board should apply a &#147;good faith&#148; test when reviewing a
substitute decision-maker&#146;s treatment decision in circumstances
where no prior capable wishes could be established.  Such a test,
he observed, would &#147;fail to screen out the results of rank
stupidity, or carelessness, or well-meant fanaticism or palpable
illusion.&#148;  Sutherland J. also held that the right to appoint an
S.D.M. is a product of the statute, not a constitutional right.
It followed, in his view, that if the patient &#147;has expressed no
prior capable wishes, the legislation could, without
constitutional impropriety, provide that the question of the best
interests of the incapable person be decided in the first
instance by the Board.&#148;
[12] Sutherland J. went on, however, to find a constitutional
deficiency in the Act not referred to by A.M..  In his opinion,
s. 37 of the Act violated the rights afforded to incapable
persons under s. 7 of Charter to the extent that the provision
failed to ensure that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  S.D.M.&#146;s are given actual notice of the &#147;prior capable
          wish&#148; criterion set forth in s. 21(1)1 of the Act when deciding
          whether to give or refuse a treatment on behalf of an incapable
          person; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  S.D.M.&#146;s are made aware of the
          criteria to be applied and the powers of
          review reposed in the Board under s. 37(3) of
          the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[13] According to Sutherland J., the scheme of the Act created a
possibility that some S.D.M.&#146;s might not be aware of the s. 21
obligation to give effect to prior capable wishes of a patient
when making substitute treatment decisions.  This possibility, he
believed, was particularly strong in the case of &quot;family member&quot;
S.D.M.&#146;s.  In Sutherland J.&#146;s view, the principles of fundamental
justice required that S.D.M.&#146;s be informed early in the process
of their rights and duties under s. 21 of the Act, including the
criteria by which their treatment decisions would be judged by
the Board and the powers of the Board on review.  In coming to
this conclusion, he rejected the submission put forward by the
Attorney General that s. 10(1)(b) of the Act places an obligation
on health practitioners to ensure that S.D.M.&#146;s understand the
criteria specified in s. 21 of the Act when giving consent on
behalf of an incapable person.  Instead, he concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the circumstances, although I respect the many aspects of
          benign evolution of substitute decision-making that are embodied
          in the Act and wish to recognize the care, industry and
          intelligence manifested in the writings and public pronouncements
          of the current chairman of the Board, I feel bound to declare
          that the Act&#146;s absence of effective provisions for explaining to
          S.D.M.&#146;s the rights and duties of S.D.M.&#146;s, the criteria that the
          Board will apply to the treatment decisions of an S.D.M. and the
          powers of the Board to override the treatment decision of
          S.D.M.&#146;s means that the Act is unconstitutional in that it
          deprives an incapable person of rights, with respect to prior
          capable wishes, that are protected by s. 7 of the Charter and
          does so otherwise than in accordance with the principles of
          fundamental justice.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Finally, Sutherland J. held that the absence of a provision
requiring actual notice to S.D.M.&#146;s could not be saved by s. 1 of
the Charter.
[15] Having declared s. 37 of the Act unconstitutional,
Sutherland J. went on to defer the declaration of invalidity for
a period of two years on certain terms and conditions.</pre>
    <pre>Appeal by the Attorney General</pre>
    <pre>[16] The Attorney General submits, correctly in our view, that
Sutherland J. erred in declaring s. 37 of the Act
unconstitutional &#147;to the extent that it fails to provide for
notice to Substitute Decision Makers.&#148;  For reasons which will
become apparent, we are satisfied that s. 10(1)(b) of the Act and
ss. 6 and 8 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. S22 (&#147;SPPA&#148;) provide a complete answer to the lack of notice
issue raised by Sutherland J.
[17] In view of this conclusion, we need not finally decide
whether Sutherland J. had the necessary jurisdiction to consider
the constitutional implications arising out of the &#147;absence of
notice&#148; issue.  Suffice it to say that we are inclined to agree
with the Attorney General that he did not have jurisdiction
because the notice issue was not raised in the Notice of
Constitutional Question, nor in the written or oral submissions
presented on A.M.&#146;s behalf. This deficiency may well have
rendered Sutherland J.&#146;s decision void ab initio. (See s. 109 of
the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C43 and Eaton v. Brant
County Board of Education, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 241 at 263-267)
[18] Assuming, however, that Sutherland J. had jurisdiction to
consider the notice issue, counsel for the Attorney General
submits, correctly in our view, that properly construed, s.
10(1)(b) of the Act imposes a statutory obligation on health
practitioners to ensure that S.D.M.&#146;s understand the criteria
specified in s. 21 of the Act when deciding whether consent to a
proposed treatment should be given or refused.  That provision
reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>               10. (1)  A health practitioner who proposes a treatment for
          a person shall not administer the treatment, and shall take
          reasonable steps to ensure that it is not administered, unless,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  he or she is of the opinion that
          the person is incapable with respect to the
          treatment, and the person&#146;s substitute
          decision-maker has given consent on the
          person&#146;s behalf in accordance with this Act.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[19] For reasons which need not be detailed, Sutherland J.
refused to interpret s. 10(1)(b) in the manner suggested by the
Attorney General.  In short, he construed the words &#147;in
accordance with this Act&#148; narrowly and restrictively and found
that they did not impose a statutory obligation on health
practitioners to ensure that S.D.M.&#146;s understand the requirements
of s. 21 of the Act.
[20] With respect, we are of the view that Sutherland J. erred in
his approach to the interpretation of s. 10(1)(b).  In
particular, he incorrectly applied the principles of statutory
interpretation to the words &#147;in accordance with this Act.&#148;
[21] The first of those principles is found in Rizzo v. Rizzo
Shoes Limited (R.E.), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, where, at paragraph 21,
Iacobucci J. adopted the following passage from Driedger&#146;s
Construction of Statutes (2 ed.1983):
          </pre>
    <pre>               Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the
          words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in
          their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme
          of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of
          Parliament.</pre>
    <pre>At paragraph 22 of the same decision, Iacobucci J. went on to state 
that every Act shall receive &#147;such fair, large and liberal construction
and interpretation&#148; as will best attain the objects of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[22] The second governing principle, enunciated in Slaight
Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038 at 1078,
per Lamer J., provides that where legislation is open to more
than one interpretation, it should be construed in a manner
consistent with the Charter.  (See also Canada (Attorney General)
v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 544 at pp. 581-82; Alssco Building
Products Ltd. v. U.F.C.W., Local 1288P, [1999] S.C.J. No. 45 at
p. 9; Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Unit)
(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 158 (S.C.C.)).
[23] When the words &#147;in accordance with this Act&#148; are construed
in a manner consistent with the Charter and afforded the fair,
large and liberal interpretation they deserve to best attain the
objects of the Act, we are satisfied that s. 10(1)(b) does impose
an obligation on health practitioners to ensure that S.D.M.&#146;s
understand the requirements of s. 21 of the Act when deciding
whether consent to a proposed treatment should be given or
refused.  Notably, the respondents take no issue with this
interpretation and concede that it provides a complete answer to
Sutherland J.&#146;s concern that absent actual notice, S.D.M.&#146;s may
make treatment decisions in violation of an incapable person&#146;s s.
7 Charter rights.
[24] Turning next to Sutherland J.&#146;s concern that S.D.M.&#146;s are
not informed at an early stage of the criteria applied by the
Board in reviewing their treatment decisions and the powers of
the Board to override such decisions, we fail to see how the
absence of such information could lead to a violation of an
incapable person&#146;s s. 7 Charter rights.  What is important is
that S.D.M.&#146;s be made aware of the requirements of s. 21 when
deciding whether to give or refuse consent to a proposed
treatment.  As indicated, s. 10(1)(b) of the Act sees to that.
The Board only becomes involved if a health practitioner
concludes that an S.D.M.&#146;s decision does not accord with the
principles in s. 21.  In that event, under s. 6(2) of the SPPA,
S.D.M.&#146;s are entitled to reasonable notice of the hearing,
including notice of its purpose.  Under s. 8 of that Act,
S.D.M.&#146;s are entitled, prior to the hearing,  to be furnished
with reasonable information regarding any allegations of improper
conduct on their part.
[25] No issue is taken with the constitutionality of these SPPA
provisions and, in our view, they ensure that S.D.M.&#146;s are given
ample notice of the relevant issues on review.
[26] Accordingly, we are satisfied that the procedural safeguards
in place are adequate to protect the s. 7 Charter rights of
incapable persons.  It follows that we need not address the
Attorney General&#146;s alternate submission that absence of notice
would not, in any event, result in a violation of an incapable
person&#146;s s. 7 Charter rights.
[27] In the result, the appeal is allowed and s. 37 of the Act is
declared constitutional.  Paragraph 2 of Sutherland J.&#146;s order is
varied accordingly and paragraph 3 is deleted.</pre>
    <pre>Appeal by Dr. Benes</pre>
    <pre>[28] Dr. Benes submits, correctly in our view, that Sutherland J.
erred in holding that had the administrative law issues not been
rendered moot by the discharge of the patient A.T.M., the matter
would have been remitted to the Board for a re-hearing.
[29] It is common ground that once A.T.M. was discharged from the
hospital without receiving ECT treatments, the administrative law
issues were rendered moot.  In the circumstances, having regard
to the principles in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General),
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, Sutherland J. should have refrained from
deciding the administrative law issues.
[30] In any event, based on the record, we are satisfied that the
proceedings before the Board were conducted in accordance with
the principles of natural justice and the Board&#146;s decision was
eminently reasonable.  It follows that there was no basis in fact
or law for ordering a re-hearing before the Board.  Accordingly,
the appeal is allowed and paragraph 4 of Sutherland J.&#146;s order is
deleted.</pre>
    <pre>Cross-Appeal by A.M.</pre>
    <pre>[31] On the cross-appeal, A.M. submits that s.37(3) of the Act
contravenes s.7 of the Charter.  This submission addresses the
appropriate standard for reviewing the decision of an S.D.M. to
give or refuse consent to treatment for an incapable person.
[32] Section 37(3) provides that in determining whether an S.D.M.
complied with s.21, the Board may substitute its opinion for that
of the S.D.M..  Section 21 sets out the principles that an S.D.M.
must apply in giving or refusing consent to treatment.  It
provides for a two-stage test.  In the first stage, if the
incapable person has expressed a prior capable wish, the S.D.M.
must follow that wish.  In the second stage, if the incapable
person has not expressed a prior capable wish, the S.D.M. must
act in the incapable person&#146;s &#147;best interests&#148;.  In deciding what
an incapable person&#146;s best interests are, the S.D.M. must
consider a list of factors set out in s.21(2) of the Act.
[33] The crux of A.M.&#146;s submission is that an S.D.M.&#146;s decision
under s.21 should be entitled to deference from the Board.  A.M.
argues that permitting the Board to substitute its opinion for
that of the S.D.M. on what are an incapable person&#146;s best
interests contravenes the incapable person&#146;s s.7 Charter rights.
A.M. has put its argument for deference on two different
footings.  We find no merit in either.
[34] Before Sutherland J., A.M. argued that as long as an S.D.M.
makes a decision under s.21 in good faith, the S.D.M.&#146;s decision
should be respected by the Board.  Sutherland J. rejected this
argument:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I am not able to accept the submission on
          behalf of the appellant that the appropriate
          test on review of an S.D.M.&#146;s decision, where
          there are no applicable prior capable wishes,
          should be a &#147;good faith&#148; test.  While a good
          faith test is quite appropriate in a
          provision limiting the liability or potential
          liability of an S.D.M. in respect of a
          substitute decision, as provided in s.30 of
          the Act, it is seriously inadequate and
          inappropriate as a test to be applied in
          situations where the substitute decision
          could seriously impair the health of, or risk
          the life of, the incapable person.  A good
          faith test would in many cases tie the hands
          of the independent board.  Moreover, it would
          fail to screen out the results of rank
          stupidity, or carelessness, or well-meant
          fanaticism or palpable illusion.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In this court, A.M. modified her position and argued that
the appropriate standard for reviewing an S.D.M.&#146;s decision was
&#147;good faith and reasonable&#148;.  As long as an S.D.M. makes a
decision under s.21 in good faith and the decision is reasonable,
the Board should not interfere even if it might have come to a
different decision.  A.M. therefore submits that because s.37(3)
does not require the Board to defer to decisions of the S.D.M.
made reasonably and in good faith, it violates s.7 of the
Charter.  We disagree.
[36] Section 37(3) permits the Board to apply a correctness
standard of review of an S.D.M.&#146;s decision.  It allows the Board
to make its own determination of what is in an incapable person&#146;s
best interests when there are no known prior capable wishes.  In
our opinion, permitting the Board to apply a &#147;best interests&#148;
test does not infringe either the liberty or the security
interests of an incapable person.  To put this opinion in
context, we set out s.21 of the Act and briefly discuss how it
operates.  Section 21 states:</pre>
    <pre>             21.    (1)  A person who gives or refuses
          consent to a treatment on an incapable
          person&#146;s behalf shall do so in accordance
          with the following principles:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   If the person knows of a wish applicable to the
               circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable
               and after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall give or
               refuse consent in accordance with the wish.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the
               circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable
               and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to
               comply with the wish, the person shall act in the incapable
               person&#146;s best interests.</pre>
    <pre>          (2)     In deciding what the incapable person&#146;s best interests
          are, the person who gives or refuses consent on his or her behalf
          shall take into consideration,
               </pre>
    <pre>           (a)  the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable
               person held when capable and believes he or she would still act
               on if capable;
               </pre>
    <pre>           (b)  any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to
               the treatment that are not required to be followed under
               paragraph 1 of subsection (1); and
           </pre>
    <pre>           (c)  the following factors:</pre>
    <pre>                1.   Whether the treatment is likely to,
                </pre>
    <pre>                 i.   improve the incapable person&#146;s condition or well-being,
                      </pre>
    <pre>                 ii.  prevent the incapable person&#146;s condition or well-being from
                      deteriorating, or
                      </pre>
    <pre>                 iii. reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the
                      incapable person&#146;s condition or well-being is likely to
                      deteriorate.</pre>
    <pre>                2.   Whether the incapable person&#146;s condition or well-being is
                  likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without the
                  treatment.
                </pre>
    <pre>                3.   Whether the benefit the incapable person is expected to
                  obtain from the treatment outweighs the risk of harm to him or
                  her.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Both A.M. and the Attorney General acknowledge that s.21(1)
protects incapable persons by requiring their prior capable
wishes to be respected both by the S.D.M. and by the Board.
[38] But where an incapable person has not expressed a prior
capable wish, deciding the appropriate treatment is far more
complex.  It is more complex because it is not known whether an
incapable person would have consented to a particular treatment
had that person been capable.  Yet, respect for the dignity and
welfare of an incapable person may require that person to be
treated.
[39] Sections 21 and 37 of the Act respond to this situation by
requiring both the S.D.M. and the Board to apply a &#147;best
interests&#148; test where an incapable person has not expressed a
prior capable wish.  Under s.37, the Board considers the
submissions of the S.D.M., the treating health practitioner, the
incapable person and any other relevant party.  The Board then
decides whether the S.D.M. has applied s.21 properly.  In other
words, the Board, like the S.D.M., applies the criteria in s.21
and decides what is in the best interests of the incapable
person.  The Board can then direct the S.D.M. in accordance with
its decision.  Should the S.D.M. fail to comply with the Board&#146;s
direction, decision making authority passes to the next ranking
S.D.M. under s.20 of the Act.
[40] As the material in the record demonstrates, the best
interests test is widely recognized as the appropriate standard
to be applied by boards, courts and tribunals who must make
health care decisions for those who are unable to consent on
their own.  We find nothing unconstitutional in a best interests
standard.  Indeed, in our opinion, requiring the Board to review
an S.D.M.&#146;s decision on a &#147;good faith and reasonable&#148; standard
would not adequately protect the liberty or security interests of
an incapable person.  We hold this opinion for three main
reasons.
[41] First, A.M.&#146;s main rationale for deference is untenable.
A.M. submits deference is called for because the S.D.M. &#147;stands
in the shoes of the incapable person&#148;, because the S.D.M. was
chosen, explicitly or implicitly, by the incapable person, and
because save for the Public Guardian and Trustee, the S.D.M. of
last resort, each of the categories of S.D.M. includes persons
&#147;close&#148; to the incapable person and thus knowledgeable about the
incapable person&#146;s values, beliefs and previous non-binding
wishes.  We reject this submission.
[42] An S.D.M. does not stand in the shoes of an incapable person
at least on questions of consent to treatment.  The S.D.M. is
important but only as part of a statutory régime which, by its
terms, tries to respect an incapable person&#146;s well-being and
dignity where that person&#146;s consent or refusal to treatment
cannot be established.
[43] Nor is an S.D.M. chosen by the incapable person when
capable, absent a power of attorney for personal care.  The
present case is a good example.  A.M. became the S.D.M. for
A.T.M. by the operation of the statute.  Nothing in the record
suggests that A.T.M. &#147;chose&#148; her mother to be the S.D.M..  A.T.M.
may never have considered the question.
[44] Moreover, although sometimes an S.D.M. will know better than
the Board about an incapable person&#146;s beliefs, values and
previous non-binding wishes, that will not always be so.  Not all
family members are close, and even when they are close, they do
not always know what treatment the incapable person would want.
Even so, the Act respects the values, beliefs and previous non-
binding wishes of the incapable person that are known to the
S.D.M..  The S.D.M., not the treating health care practitioner or
the Board, makes the initial treatment decision.  The Board,
though it may substitute its opinion for that of the S.D.M., must
nonetheless take into account the S.D.M.&#146;s submissions on the
incapable person&#146;s values, beliefs and non-binding wishes because
these criteria are part of the best interest test under s.21(2)
of the Act and the Board must apply s.21(2).
[45] The second reason we think a &#147;good faith and reasonable&#148;
standard is inappropriate turns on the elements of the best
interests test and how a case comes before the Board.  Values,
beliefs and non-binding wishes are not the only elements of the
best interests test.  The likely effect of the proposed treatment
is a key element as well.  The S.D.M. is not likely to have
special knowledge about the possible effects of medical treatment
and thus, as a general rule, must rely on the expertise of the
treating health practitioner.
[46] A case will come before the Board only when the health
practitioner disagrees with the S.D.M.&#146;s application of the best
interests test under s.21(2).  The Board will then have before it
two parties who disagree about the application of s.21: the
S.D.M., who may have better knowledge than the health
practitioner about the incapable person&#146;s values, beliefs and non-
binding wishes; and the health practitioner, who is the expert on
the likely medical outcomes of the proposed treatment.  The
disagreement between the S.D.M. and the health practitioner
potentially creates tension and the Act recognizes this by
providing for a neutral expert board to resolve the disagreement.
Indeed, after hearing submissions from all parties, the Board is
likely better placed than either the S.D.M. or the health
practitioner to decide what is in the incapable person&#146;s best
interests.  Thus, the Board should not be required to accord any
deference to the S.D.M.&#146;s decision.
[47] There is a third main reason why an S.D.M.&#146;s decision should
not attract deference.  The Act does not specify any procedural
guidelines an S.D.M. must follow in making a decision under s.21.
Procedural guidelines might at least give some better assurance
an S.D.M. has properly applied the best interests test.  Decision
making by the S.D.M. under the Act therefore differs from
decision making by the Board.  The Board, whose decisions we have
held in the companion appeal are entitled to deference on appeal,
unlike the S.D.M., not only has the necessary expertise but must
follow procedures that meet the requirements of natural justice.
[48] For all of these reasons, in our view, s.37(3) does not
infringe the liberty or security interests of an incapable person
under s.7 of the Charter.  The Board is entitled to review an
S.D.M.&#146;s assessment of an incapable person&#146;s best interests to
ensure that the S.D.M.&#146;s decision is correct.
[49] Because we conclude that A.T.M.&#146;s liberty and security of
the person have not been infringed, we need not consider either
the principles of fundamental justice or s.1 of the Charter.  The
cross-appeal is dismissed.
