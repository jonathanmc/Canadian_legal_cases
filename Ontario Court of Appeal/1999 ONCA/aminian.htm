    <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of Justice Speyer dated March 13, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  There are two issues raised in this appeal.  The first
relates to the admissibility of the expert evidence of Dr.
Oliver.
[2]  Dr. Oliver was qualified to give opinion evidence regarding
injuries to the genital tract and normal and abnormal injuries to
that area.  She expressed the opinion that the injury to the
complainant&#146;s vaginal tract was consistent with forced
penetration and inconsistent with consensual sex.
[3]  Dr. Oliver also expressed the opinion that the complainant
did not have the mental capacity to understand the mechanics of
sexual intercourse or to understand what the vagina was.  She
based this opinion on her clinical experience in interviews she
had conducted as a member of the sexual assault team at Sick
Children&#146;s Hospital with thousands of young females and also on
her own interaction with the victim.  She agreed that she did not
have expertise in the assessing the intelligence of
developmentally delayed persons.
[4]  The appellant objects that Dr. Oliver was not qualified to
express an opinion in either of these areas and that her
testimony should not have been admitted.  In our view, any
deficiencies in her expertise go to the weight and not the
admissibility of her evidence:  see R. v. Marquard (1992), 85
C.C.C. 193 at 224.  We see no basis to interfere on this ground.
[5]  The second ground of appeal is that the verdict of the trial
judge was unreasonable.  After reviewing the evidence, the trial
judge set out his conclusions as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; I have read with care the American
	  authorities submitted to me by Mr. Kapoor
	  dealing with the degree of mental incapacity
          necessary to vitiate consent and the rights
	  of the mentally infirm to engage in sexual
	  activity.
          </pre>
    <pre>               However, in this particular case, we
          have as vulnerable and immature an adolescent
          as one might imagine.  She was just fifteen
          months past having statutory protection given
          to children relating to consent as provided
          in s. 150.1 of the Criminal Code.  Yet [the
          complainant&#146;s] need for protection was even
          more than that accorded ordinary children of
          tender years.  [The complainant] was ripe for
          being sexually exploited, as indeed she was
          on not one but two occasions with strangers
          at the same picnic.  Moreover, it is obvious
          to everyone that [the complainant] was a
          special needs young person.  There is no
          doubt in my mind that [the complainant] had
          no appreciation of the nature and consequence
          of the sexual intercourse, nor the consensual
          ability to choose with respect to the sexual
          activity.  To put the matter slightly
          differently, [the complainant&#146;s] mental
          incapacity was such that she did not have the
          cognitive or intellectual capacity to
          understand or comprehend the sexual activity
          in question, its implications, and the right
          to choose or not to choose to engage in it.
          The accused preyed on [the complainant&#146;s]
          vulnerability to seek affection.  The
          accused, a mature adult, would immediately
          observe [the complainant&#146;s] striking features
          and obvious mental retardation.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Moreover, the specific act of
          intercourse perpetrated by the accused was
          consistent with a forced and resisted act,
          and not with an act that was consensual.  Dr.
          Oliver, the head of the Adolescent
          Gynaecology Department at Sick Children&#146;s
          Hospital, and an assistant professor of
          gynaecology at the University of Toronto,
          struck me as an exceptionally talented and
          reliable witness.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Oliver characterized the injury to
          [the complainant&#146;s] vagina wall as &#147;serious&#148;
          and &#147;traumatic&#148;, and the type of injury seen
          in a difficult obstetrical delivery using
          forceps.  I accept Dr. Oliver&#146;s opinion that
          the injury was consistent with forced
          penetration and inconsistent with consensual
          intercourse for the reasons I recorded with
          respect to her testimony earlier in these
          reasons.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the result, the accused shall be
          convicted as charged.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In our view, these conclusions were fully supported by the
evidence.  We are not persuaded that this was an unreasonable
verdict.
[7]  The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</pre></td>
