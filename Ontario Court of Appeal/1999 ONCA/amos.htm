    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) &#150;and&#150; SCOTT
               AMOS(Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        LASKIN, FELDMAN and SHARPE JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Leslie Maunder, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Robin Parker, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 19, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Collins J. dated January
28, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   In our view, the trial judge erred in principle in failing
to comply with his obligation under s.723 of the Criminal Code,
especially given that he was considering a penitentiary term
higher than requested by the Crown and that the appellant was
unrepresented.  As a result of the trial judge&#146;s failure to hear
from the appellant, he sentenced him knowing nothing of his
personal circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Even apart from the error in principle, in our view, the
sentence of three years for trafficking one gram of marijuana,
possessing 25 grams for the purpose of trafficking and possessing
proceeds of $272.13 was demonstrably unfit.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Although the appellant has a lengthy record, including
numerous drug convictions, and, although he was on parole when he
committed these offences, the nature of the drug trafficked, the
small amount in question, the effect of the sentence on the
totality of time the appellant must serve and the appellant&#146;s
personal circumstances, which include being afflicted with cystic
fibrosis, warrant a significant reduction in the sentence.  In
our view, a fit sentence is six months.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
sentence appeal is allowed and the sentence is varied
accordingly.</pre>
