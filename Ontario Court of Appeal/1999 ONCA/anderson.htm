</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of A. Campbell, Keenan and Tobias JJ. of
the Divisional Court, dated February 20, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  appeal, by leave from the Divisional Court,  concerns
the  certification  of  a class action in  a  medical  negligence
proceeding under the Class Proceedings Act,  1992, S.O. 1992,  c.6.</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  respondent,  Dr. Wilson, operated  five  clinics  that
provided electroencephalogram tests (EEGs) between 1989 and  1996
in  the  Durham  Region  and in the eastern part of  Metropolitan
Toronto.   The  respondent,  Kyprianou,  was  a  technician   who
administered  EEG tests. The defendants, John Doe and  Jane  Doe,
represent  the  other,  presently unidentified,  workers  in  Dr.
Wilson&#146;s clinics who also administered EEG tests.
[3]  In 1996, a public health inspector identified a possible
link between the defendant&#146;s clinics and an outbreak of hepatitis
B. Public Health Authorities notified over 18,000 patients, by
letter, that they may have been infected and that they should be
tested. At least seventy-five of the patients are known to have
contracted the disease and three became violently ill and were
hospitalized.
[4]  Of those who responded, 75 persons showed symptoms of recent
infection, and approximately 1100 were termed &#147;suspect cases&#148;
because there was evidence of earlier infection with hepatitis B.
Because there are no symptoms in a substantial percentage of
infected persons, these numbers are expected to increase. These
two groups, plus some carriers of hepatitis B, comprise the class
of &#147;infected&#148; patients identified by both Jenkins J. on the
motion for certification and the Divisional Court on appeal. The
patients who received the notification letter and showed no
symptoms after testing comprise the &#147;uninfected&#148; portion of the
class.
[5]  The representative plaintiffs claim in negligence and breach
of contract alleging that they contracted hepatitis B during
performance of EEGs at the clinics operated by Dr. Wilson.
[6]  Robert Anderson, one of the proposed representative
plaintiffs, is 57 years old. He is married with three children
and is not presently employed. Mr. Anderson attended Dr. Wilson&#146;s
Ajax clinic for an EEG on June 29, 1993. Mr. Anderson now carries
the hepatitis B virus. He is expected to remain an infection
carrier for the rest of his life. The other proposed
representative plaintiff, Deborah Fischer, is a 45-year-old bank
manager. She is married with two children. She attended Dr.
Wilson&#146;s North York clinic for an EEG on March 23, 1995. She
contracted hepatitis B. Ms. Fischer became severely ill and twice
neared death. She was hospitalized for about ten days and was off
work for approximately ten weeks.</pre>
    <pre>Procedural History</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The initial certification motion proceeded before Jenkins J.
on  January  13,  1997. In reasons reported at (1996),  7  C.P.C.
(4th)  244 (Ont. Gen. Div.), Jenkins J. certified the plaintiffs&#146;
action as a class proceeding and defined the class to include:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.   All patients of Dr. Wilson any time after January 1, 1990
who contracted hepatitis B after being given an EEG at one of the
clinics, or the estate of those now deceased;
2.   All persons who contracted the disease from an infected
patient (or their estates); [herein called &#147;derivative
claimants&#148;]
3.   All patients any time after January 1, 1990 who did not
contract the disease from the test but who nonetheless were sent
a notice by public health officials to be tested and were tested
(or their estates);
4.   All living parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren,
siblings and spouses of infected patients, cross-infected persons
and uninfected patients (family law claimants).</pre>
    <pre>Jenkins  J.  defined the common issue as &#147;liability and  punitive
and exemplary damages.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[8]   On  appeal to the Divisional Court, Campbell J., in reasons
reported  at  (1998),  37  O.R.  (3d)  235  (Div.  Ct.),   upheld
certification  of  the class but removed from  it  the  group  of
plaintiffs who did not contract hepatitis B but had been informed
of the possibility and were tested. The basis for their claim was
in nervous shock, i.e., the psychological trauma of being told of
the possibility of infection and the resultant uncertainty as  to
their  condition  until  they  received  negative  test  results.
Campbell  J.  stated  that the weight of  Ontario  law  does  not
recognize claims for fear and nervous shock in the absence  of  a
diagnosed psychological or psychiatric illness.
[9]  Further, Campbell J. amended the description of the common
issues in the certification order. Campbell J. redefined the
common issues as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Did the defendants breach the standard of care for infection
          control procedures?
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Did the clinics provide a common source of infection for
          those patients who contracted hepatitis B?
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   Does the evidence of causation, in the absence of evidence
          to the contrary, amount to proof of causation on a balance of
          probabilities?
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   Is this a case for punitive and exemplary damages?</pre>
    <pre>[10]  Thus,  both  courts  concluded  that  a  class  should   be
certified,  the Divisional Court confining the class to  infected
persons, and the Divisional Court selecting a more particularized
statement of the common issues.
[11] The plaintiffs sought, and were granted, leave to appeal the
decision of the Divisional Court. They seek to restore the order
of Jenkins J. The defendants were granted leave to cross-appeal
and seek to have the certification application dismissed in its
entirety.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[12]  This  is  the  first  time this court  has  considered  the
certification of a class action and I am mindful of the deference
which  is  due  to the Superior Court judges who  have  developed
expertise  in this very sophisticated area of practice.  The  Act
provides  for  flexibility and adjustment at all  stages  of  the
proceeding   and   any  intervention  by  this   court   at   the
certification  level should be restricted to matters  of  general
principle.
</pre>
    <pre>     
     1.   Does the statement of claim disclose a cause of action for
          uninfected patients?</pre>
    <pre>[13]  In my view the Divisional Court was wrong to put aside  the
class  of  persons  who received notice from  the  Public  Health
Authorities of the possibility of infection, were tested and  are
unaffected.  The  basis  for their claim  is  in  nervous  shock.
Although the House of Lords1 has decided that emotional suffering
without  psychiatric symptoms does not qualify for  tort  relief,
two  recent  Ontario  Superior Court  judges  have  held  to  the
contrary. In Mason v. Westside Cemeteries Ltd. (1996), 135 D.L.R.
(4th)  361 (Ont. Gen. Div.), Madam Justice Molloy awarded damages
for  nervous shock to a son when a funeral home lost the cremated
remains  of  his  parents&#146; bodies. Similarly, in Vanek  v.  Great
Atlantic  &amp;  Pacific Co. of Canada, [1997] O.J.  No.  3304  (Gen.
Div.),  Cosgrove J. adopted Molloy J.&#146;s reasoning  in  Mason  and
awarded  damages  for  mental distress to a father  who  suffered
chronic  anxiety  after his daughter swallowed some  contaminated
juice.
[14] In Nespolon v. Alford et al. (1998), 161 D.L.R. (4th) 646
(Ont.C.A.) at 660-612 this court, in a majority decision, denied
damages for nervous shock arising out of a motor vehicle
accident, but in doing so Abella J.A. commented as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A number of circumstances have been held by the courts
          to fall within the ambit of risk leading to liability for nervous
          shock. These include whether there was a relationship between the
          tortfeasor and the injured person, whether the injured person was
          acting as a rescuer, and whether the injured person anticipated
          or saw the  accident. None of these circumstances are present
          here.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  issue  then  becomes  whether
          there  are any policy reasons to add  someone
          in  Nespolon&#146;s circumstances to this class of
          persons  entitled  to  recover  damages   for
          nervous  shock. In Hall v. Herbert, [1993]  2
          S.C.R.  159 at p. 203, 101 D.L.R. (4th)  129,
          Cory J. said:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    &#133; even if a duty of care is found to
               exist,  the court will have to determine
               whether, for public policy reasons, that duty
               should be limited in part or in whole.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The   cautionary  words  of  Griffiths
          J.A.   [in   Bechard  v.  Haliburton   Estate
          (1991),  5  O.R.  (3d)  512  (C.A.)   at   p.
          520,]    are    particularly   apposite    in
          deciding   whether  policy  grounds   justify
          Nespolon   recovering   damages   from    the
          three boys:
               </pre>
    <pre>                              The &#147;policy grounds&#148; that have
               concerned the courts in these cases is that
               there should not be unlimited liability to
               persons  who suffer nervous  shock.  The
               perceived danger is that every accident may
               generate  an  ever-widening  circle   of
               plaintiffs including, possibly, the casual
               passerby who witnesses the accident and those
               who come to gaze at the scene later, as well
               as the relatives of all of those to whom the
               details will be recounted.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      In   my   view,  there   are   no
          policy  reasons  to  justify  expanding   the
          category  of  those whose  nervous  shock  is
          compensable,   to  include  a   stranger   in
          Nespolon&#146;s circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Section  5(1)(a) of the Class Proceedings Act states:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The court shall certify a class proceeding on a motion
          under section 2, 3 or 4 if,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the pleadings or the notice of
          application discloses a cause of action;
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Wilson  J.  articulated  the general  test  for  whether  a
pleading  discloses a cause of action in Hunt  v.  T.  &amp;  N.  plc
(1990), 43 C.P.C. (2d) 105 (S.C.C.), at 123:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Thus, the Ontario Court of Appeal has firmly embraced the
          &#147;plain and obvious&#148; test, and has made clear that it too is of
          the view that the test is rooted in the need for courts to ensure
          that their process is not abused. The fact that the case the
          plaintiff wishes to present may involve complex issues of fact
          and law or may raise a novel legal proposition should not prevent
          a plaintiff from proceedings with his action.</pre>
    <pre>Superior Court judges have applied this &#147;plain and obvious&#148;  test
in  the context of class actions:  see, for example, Chippewas of
Sarnia Band v. Canada (A.G.) (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 549 (Gen. Div.)
at 564.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  In  the  present  case it is at  least  arguable  that  the
defendant&#146;s alleged negligence had the foreseeable consequence of
a  general  notice  to  patients that  a  test  was  required  to
determine if they were infected. It was also arguably foreseeable
that some suffering from shock would be occasioned by the notice.
When  the claimants are limited to those who received the  notice
and  family law claimants it can further be argued that there  is
no  ever widening circle of potential liability created in  these
circumstances  and  that there is no policy  concern  to  justify
excluding recovery.
[18] Given the uncertain state of the law on tort relief for
nervous shock, it is not appropriate that the court should reach
a conclusion at this early stage and without a complete factual
foundation. It cannot be said, in this case, that it is plain and
obvious that the claim for the tort of mental distress standing
alone will fail. On the assumption that a legal obligation may
exist, this segment of the class proceeding is ideally suited for
certification. There are many persons with the same complaint,
each of which would typically represent a modest claim that would
not itself justify an independent action. In addition, the nature
of the overall claim lends itself to aggregate treatment because
individual reactions to the notices would likely be similar in
each case &#150; fear of a serious infection and anxiety during the
waiting period for a test result. If evidence from patients to
support such reactions to the notices is necessary, it would
probably suffice to hear from a few typical claimants. The
balance of the evidence as to liability would relate to the
conduct of the clinics, the reaction of the Public Health
Authorities and foreseeability issues.
[19] Thus, in my view, the claim in tort for mental distress for
this group of persons should proceed as the preferable mode of
bringing these claims forward.</pre>
    <pre>          2.   What is the appropriate definition of the common
          issues for uninfected persons who received the notice?</pre>
    <pre>[20] Section 8(1)(e) of the Class Proceedings Act  provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               8. &#150; (1) An order certifying a proceeding as a class
          proceeding shall,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)  set out the common issues for the
          class;</pre>
    <pre>Section 1 of the CPA defines &#147;common issues&#148; as
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)  common but not necessarily identical issues of fact, or
(b)  common but not necessarily identical issues of law that
arise from common but not necessarily identical facts.</pre>
    <pre>[21]  Section  8(2) of the Act contemplates a  subclass  and  the
order  of  Jenkins  J.  includes  both  infected  and  uninfected
patients  in  separate paragraphs describing a  single  class.  I
consider  the  uninfected a subclass of the whole.  The  infected
patients  must  establish  that the clinics  failed  to  meet  an
appropriate standard of care for infection control and that  they
were  infected as a result. The factual basis for the  uninfected
patients  will  obviously not include the same causation  factor.
Their  claim  is based on an allegation that the conduct  of  the
defendants  occasioned the notices which,  in  turn,  foreseeably
caused them nervous shock. The difference in what each group must
prove affects the definition of the common issues for each group.
[22] I would define the common issue for the uninfected patients,
and their derivate claimants, in the broadest terms, as did
Jenkins J. The common issues for trial should be &#147;liability and
punitive and exemplary damages.&#148;
[23] This is in contemplation that the evidence as to the alleged
negligence and reaction of the authorities can be conveniently
tried without a significant involvement of the uninfected members
of this subclass and, if appropriate, the use of s.24 of the Act
to assess aggregate relief and proportional or average
application of that relief.</pre>
    <pre>The Infected Patients</pre>
    <pre>[24]  I have no difficulty agreeing with both Jenkins J. and  the
Divisional  Court  and  their  reasons  for  finding  that  these
patients comprise a class, that the pleadings disclose a cause of
action, and that there is a commonality which suggests resolution
in  the  context  of  a  class action. My  concern  is  with  the
definition  of  the common issues and whether  it  can  encompass
liability  and  damages.  In particular,  I  am  concerned  about
causation, and its necessary link to each individual claimant.
[25] The defendants put their position as follows in the factum
of the respondent Wilson, referring to affidavit evidence of Dr.
Loutman:
          </pre>
    <pre>               16.  In order to determine if there is a causal relationship
          between a patient receiving an EEG at one of the clinics and
          their hepatitis B status, serologic data on each patient is
          necessary. While not being conclusive proof of causation, the
          serologic data is a critical factor in assessing whether there is
          a temporal and therefore, causal relationship between the EEG and
          infection.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 17.   In  addition  to  obtaining  and
          analysing this serologic data, each plaintiff
          must  be assessed for other risk factors  for
          hepatitis  B  such as lifestyle,  age,  blood
          transfusions,  recent  travel  to  high  risk
          areas, sexual partners and IV drug use.  This
          examination is required to determine  whether
          a  particular event, namely an EEG,  was  the
          source  of infection. The mere fact  that  an
          individual  underwent an EEG at  one  of  the
          clinics  and presently shows a positive  test
          for  hepatitis B is insufficient to establish
          a causal relationship between the two events.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The reasons of Campbell J. deal with the issue of causation
at p. 243:
          </pre>
    <pre>               But if the plaintiffs can establish a common breach of the
          standard of care for infection control practices, a common
          highly infectious EEG technician, with a particular strain of the
          Hepatitis B virus and a common body of epidemiological evidence
          that patients treated at these clinics by that infected
          technician are over 500 times more likely than the general
          population to come down with Hepatitis B, then they have gone a
          long way towards discharging the onus of proof. A trial judge
          might easily conclude that proof of those facts, in the absence
          of evidence to the contrary, amounts to proof of causation on a
          balance of probabilities.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The certification of the class action in
          respect  of the infected patients  would  not
          reverse the onus of proof. Relatively  simple
          elements can be added to the litigation  plan
          to  ensure, if the plaintiffs prove what they
          say  they can prove, that the defendants have
          a  fair  opportunity to test the  possibility
          that  any one or more of the infected  clinic
          patients   contracted   their   hepatitis   B
          elsewhere. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[27] My concern is that Campbell J. has been too expansive in his
approach  to  defining  the  common  issues  and  has  imposed  a
consequent unfairness upon the defendants; in particular  by  his
inclusion of the issue: &#147;Does the evidence of causation,  in  the
absence of evidence to the contrary, amount to proof of causation
on a balance of probabilities?&#148;
[28] Causation is an individual issue with respect to every
infected member of the class. Some of the patients who answered
the questionnaire were carriers and probably contracted the virus
prior to attending the clinic. The evidence of causation as to
some individuals may be equivocal in the sense that there may be
other competent sources. In such cases the only approach is for
one judge to assess the evidence concerning all competent sources
and make a finding of liability on the basis of probability on
all the evidence.  If there were only one plaintiff, the trial
would deal with the appropriate standard of care, the actual
standard of care, the plaintiff&#146;s evidence as to treatment, and
the plaintiff&#146;s medical and lifestyle history. Evidence on all of
these issues would be necessary to arrive at a balanced
conclusion as to whether there was negligent conduct and whether
this was the probable cause of the plaintiff&#146;s complaint.
[29] The order under appeal contemplates a hearing as to
causation without the involvement of the class members. It
invites a judgment on only a portion of the issue of causation,
which under the Act, is a res judicata against the parties, and
not only stands in the way of a balancing of all evidence by one
judge at one hearing, but also will appear as a reversal of the
onus of proof. Assuming an initial finding against Dr. Wilson and
Mr. Kyprianou, it will be left to them to produce evidence and
satisfy a court that actual causation is elsewhere.
[30] I think that what Campbell J. had in mind was the reasoning
in Farrell v. Snell (1990), 72 D.L.R. (4th) 289 (S.C.C.), to the
effect that it is not essential to have a positive medical
opinion to determine causation. The trial judge may apply common
sense to the evidence and thus draw an inference that the failure
to meet the required standard of competence was the cause of the
injury. That may be the ultimate test, but it is too soon to
anticipate it, and it should only follow discoveries and a trial
involving each claimant.
[31] No case has been produced either here or in the United
States where the class members and their evidence and medical
records were essential to a finding of liability. Implants3,
motor vehicle malfunctions4, improper interest charges5, and
such, all lend themselves to resolution as to liability without
involvement of the injured parties. That is not the situation
here, where an injured person may or may not be able to relate
the infection to the defendants and their clinics.
[32] If causation cannot be handled as a common issue, then
liability and damages must also fall. The question then becomes
whether there are sufficient common issues left to justify
certification. In my view, it seems sensible with this number of
potential plaintiffs and the similarities that are evident in
their claims, that any potential efficiency in advancement of
their claims through the flexibility provided by the CPA should,
where reasonable, be utilized.
[33] Counsel for Dr. Wilson argued that the representative
plaintiffs have failed to identify common issues and in fact, are
unable to do so because this is a medical negligence action. They
submit that in medical negligence actions liability turns on the
medical presentation of each patient. Mr. Kyprianou adopted this
position.
[34]
In my view, this argument is far too broad. Unlike typical
medical negligence cases this action concerns allegations of a
general practice over a number of years falling below acceptable
standards. Those general allegations can be pulled out and tried
separately, to the benefit of all parties.
[35] I agree with the British Columbia Court of Appeal&#146;s
observation, as did Campbell J., that the common issues need only
involve a matter, that if determined, would move the litigation
forward. In Campbell v. Flexwatt Corp. (1998), 15 C.P.C. (4th) 1
(B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
denied, Cumming J.A., speaking for the court at pp. 17 &#150; 18
reasoned:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Class Proceedings Act requires that the claims of the
          class members raise common issues which, for reasons of fairness
          and efficiency, ought to be determined within one proceeding.
          Common issues can be issues of fact or law and do not have to be
          identical for every member of the class.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                When  examining the existence of common
          issues it is important to understand that the
          common issues do not have to be issues  which
          are  determinative  of liability;  they  need
          only  be issues of fact or law that move  the
          litigation  forward.  The   resolution  of  a
          common  issue does not have to be, in and  of
          itself,  sufficient  to  support  relief.  To
          require    every   common   issue    to    be
          determinative   of   liability   for    every
          plaintiff  and  every  defendant  would  make
          class   proceedings  with   more   than   one
          defendant   virtually  impossible.  (Emphasis
          added.)</pre>
    <pre>[36] In this case, the common issue as to the standard of conduct
expected  from  the clinics from time to time, and  whether  they
fell  below the standard, can fairly be tried as a common  issue.
Resolving  this  issue  would move the  litigation  forward.  The
participation  of  the  class members  is  not  needed  for  that
inquiry,  although  their later evidence may  bear  upon  whether
standards,  such  as  the use of gloves,  were  actually  met  in
individual  cases.  Isolating this one  major  issue,  the  class
action proceeding clearly appears to be the preferable method  of
resolution to the benefit of all parties.
[37] Thus, it is my view that the common issues for the
uninfected patients and their family law claimants should extend
from liability through damages but that the common issue for the
infected patients and their derivative claimants should be
restricted to whether the defendants breached the standard of
care for infection control practices.
[38] These reasons should not be read as saying that there cannot
be a certification or a common issue if the claimants&#146; evidence
is individually necessary. Sub-classes and sub-issues are
recognized by the Act. I have noted above that in this case
claimants may have to give evidence as to whether protective
gloves were used when they were treated, as one example of what
could develop from a finding on the common issue. The use of
gloves is something that can be dealt with on discovery and in a
mini-trial without prejudice to the defendant. It would be quite
otherwise if a general finding was made of prima facie causation
and the defendant then had to overcome that by establishing
another cause.
[39] In the result, I have, in effect, identified a subclass of
uninfected patients and family law claimants and should consider
whether separate representation is required as provided in s.5(2)
of the Act. Although the representative plaintiffs are infected
patients, and the Act contemplates representatives that have the
same complaints as the class, I cannot see any reality at this
stage to the argument that they would not fairly and adequately
represent the interest of all patients or that there is presently
any conflict of interest. Most of the facts pertaining to the
issues to be tried are common to all. If and when real problems
arise it will not be difficult to create separate representation.
In the meantime, economy favours single representation.
[40] There were other arguments concerning family claimants and
cross-infected claimants and the creation of sub-classes for
each. I agree with the disposition of these issues by the
Divisional Court and Jenkins J. There will be later opportunities
to make adjustments as may be justified by events, and, with the
more restricted common issue, there is little likelihood that
this will be necessary before the trial of the issue.
[41] I would, therefore, set aside the order of the Divisional
Court and vary the order of Jenkins J. in accordance with these
reasons.
[42] As in the Divisional Court, success has been divided and I
would order no costs of the appeal or motion for leave to appeal.
