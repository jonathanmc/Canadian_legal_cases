</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Mr. and Mrs. Andrews divorced after a 17-year marriage that
produced three children.  At a trial to determine the parties&#146;
financial obligations, Klowak J. found that Mr. Andrews had a
gross annual income of $200,000 per year and ordered him to pay
child support of $2,953 per month, the presumptive amount under
the Ontario Child Support Guidelines (&#147;Guidelines&#148;), a further
$1,200 per month for extraordinary expenses for the children&#146;s
education and $3,000 per month for spousal support.  The effect
of her order is to allocate 60% of the parties&#146; net disposable
income to Mrs. Andrews and 40% to Mr. Andrews.
[2]  Mr. Andrews appeals.  His main contentions are that the
trial judge&#146;s award of extraordinary expenses failed to take into
account the principles in s.7 of the Guidelines, and that her
award of spousal support both failed to take into account the
requirements of the Family Law Act1 and is unreasonable when
combined with his child support payments.</pre>
    <pre>The Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Mr. and Mrs. Andrews married in 1980, separated in September
1994 and divorced in 1997.  They are now each in their mid-40s
and in good health.
[4]  They have three teenage children, two with special needs.
Adam, the oldest, is 15, and has been diagnosed as having an
attention deficit disorder.  Mark and Melina are twins and will
be 13 this month.  Melina has a severe learning disability, and
on the recommendation of an educational consultant, is being
schooled at home by Mrs. Andrews.  Adam and Mark attend private
schools.  Mrs. Andrews has custody of all three children and Mr.
Andrews has reasonable access, the particulars of which are
spelled out in the trial judgment and are not in dispute.
[5]  Before marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews each lived in an
apartment and each had modest assets.  On marriage, Mrs. Andrews
moved into her husband&#146;s apartment.  Both worked &#150; Mrs. Andrews
as a secretary and Mr. Andrews in the computer industry &#150; to save
enough money for a down-payment on their first home in
Mississauga.
[6]  After Adam was born in 1983, Mrs. Andrews stopped working
outside the home.  The decision that she stay home to look after
the children and the household was, as the trial judge found, &#147;a
mutual one&#148;.  Mr. Andrews worked long hours and he readily
acknowledged that at least until 1992 he and his wife were
&#147;partners in every way&#148;.
[7]  In early 1987, when Adam was 3 and the twins were 6 months
old, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews bought a bigger and more expensive home
in Mississauga, using the proceeds of the sale of their first
home.  Then in 1991 they bought a luxurious 9,000 square foot
home in King City for $850,000.  The home had an indoor pool and
was surrounded by 2½ acres of land.  Mr. and Mrs. Andrews paid
for their new home by using their built-up equity of $450,000 and
taking out a mortgage for the balance.  At the time, they
obviously enjoyed a very comfortable lifestyle.
[8]  After they separated in the fall of 1994, they sold their
home in King City, but because of the downturn in the real estate
market, for only $525,000, a significant loss.  Mr. and Mrs.
Andrews each received $15,000 from the net proceeds and the
remainder is in trust.  Mrs. Andrews is to receive a $60,000
equalization payment from the trust funds.
[9]  Mrs. Andrews and the three children now live in a rented,
modest 1,800 square foot home in Aurora.  Her monthly expenses
for the house, including rent, are $1,950.  Mr. Andrews has
recently bought his own home for $239,000, which he has fully
furnished and on which he has now paid off the $175,000 first
mortgage.
[10] Since 1986, Mr. Andrews has been employed as the chief
financial officer for various companies in the computer industry.
Until just before closing the purchase of the family home in King
City he worked for Prime Computers.  After Prime let him go, he
got a contract job and then in May 1992 he was hired by Tandem
Computers as the Vice-President of Finance.  He worked at Tandem
until January 1998.  His gross employment income in 1997 was
$169,000, and he also received a one-time stock option benefit of
$18,433.86.  When he left Tandem in early 1998 he received a lump
sum severance package of $129,000.
[11] In February 1998, Mr. Andrews began working for a new
software company, Insystems Technologies Inc., as its Chief
Financial Officer.  At the time of trial he earned an annual base
salary of $140,000 and received a yearly car allowance worth
$8,400.  He also expected to receive an annual bonus from
Insystems beginning in April 1999.  Mr. Andrews acknowledged that
if, as likely, Insystems became a successful company, his income
will increase.
[12] In addition to being employed in the computer industry, for
several years Mr. Andrews has carried on a part-time accounting
practice from his home.  Because he operates this business out of
his home, he is able to deduct many household expenses.  He
acknowledged that his 1998 &#147;real income&#148; from this practice was
between $12,000 and $15,000.
[13] Mrs. Andrews has a grade 13 education and some working
experience as a legal secretary.  She worked for the Toronto
School of Business where she set up and taught the legal
secretarial program until the birth of her first child.  Between
the fall of 1991 and her separation in the fall of 1994, Mrs.
Andrews did not work outside the home or take any job retraining
programs.  She did however take one retraining program after her
separation.
[14] Although schooling Melina at home and managing the household
fills most of her day, in 1996 Mrs. Andrews began working at home
part time for Career Exchange Opportunities, retyping career ads
from The Globe and Mail and posting them on the Internet.  She is
paid $11 an hour.  This work does not offer much of a future but
it enables her to bring in a little extra income, while handling
her other duties.  At the time of trial she was earning $100 per
week or about $5,000 per year from this part-time job.  In
addition, since 1995, Mr. Andrews has been paying her annual
support of $72,000 &#150; $36,000 for her and $36,000 for the children
&#150; all tax-deductible by him.</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>[15] Support orders made by trial judges are entitled to
deference on appeal.  An appellate court should not interfere
with an order for support unless the trial judge failed to
appreciate material evidence or erred in applying the relevant
principles or unless the amount ordered is unreasonable.2
[16] Mr. Andrews argues that the court should interfere with the
order for extraordinary expenses for the children&#146;s education and
with the order for spousal support.  He makes these submissions:
in holding that Mr. Andrews had a current annual gross income of
$200,000, the trial judge failed to appreciate the evidence of
his current income; in ordering that Mr. Andrews pay $1,200 for
extraordinary expenses, the trial judge failed to apply the
requirements of s.7 of the Guidelines; in ordering $3,000 per
month in spousal support, the trial judge failed to follow the
dictates of the Family Law Act; and the combined amount ordered
for child support and spousal support is unreasonably high.  Mr.
Andrews submits that he can pay one or the other but not both.
[17] Mr. Andrews also argues that the trial judge erred in
failing to order a review of spousal support at the end of June
2002 and in awarding Mrs. Andrews her costs of the action,
including costs on a solicitor-and-client basis after October 22,
1997.</pre>
    <pre>First Issue &#150; Did the Trial Judge Overstate Mr. Andrews&#146; Annual
          Gross Income?</pre>
    <pre>[18] The support orders made by the trial judge depend on
accurately determining Mr. Andrews&#146; income.  Section 2(3) of the
Guidelines requires the court to use &#147;the most current
information&#148;.  Mr. Andrews submits the trial judge did not do
this because she failed to appreciate that his income from his
current employer, Insystems Technologies Inc., was considerably
less than his income at Tandem Computers.
[19] Admittedly, Mr. Andrews&#146; base salary at Insystems is
$140,000, or $29,000 less than his base salary at Tandem.
However, in 1998 he received a substantial severance package from
Tandem, which together with employment benefits and his income
from his part-time accounting practice brought his gross annual
income for the year close to $250,000.  Although the severance
package from Tandem was a one-time payment, the trial judge was
also aware that Mr. Andrews was likely to receive a bonus from
Insystems in April 1999.  She also heard evidence that Mr.
Andrews maintains a very comfortable lifestyle, which includes
vacations, maximum contributions to his R.R.S.P., contributions
to his company pension plan and the purchase of a new house, new
car and home furnishings.  In my opinion, the evidence reasonably
supports the trial judge&#146;s finding that Mr. Andrews&#146; current
annual gross income is $200,000.</pre>
    <pre>Second Issue &#150; Did the Trial Judge Err in Ordering Mr. Andrews to Pay
               Extraordinary Expenses for the Children&#146;s Education?</pre>
    <pre>[20] Subsection 38.1(1) of the Family Law Act directs the court
to give priority to the support of children.  Moreover, the
purpose of the Guidelines is &#147;to ensure that the interests of the
children are put first in terms of financial support when
families separate.&#148;3  I therefore consider the trial judge&#146;s
child support order before considering the spousal support order.
[21] The trial judge ordered Mr. Andrews to pay child support of
$2,953 per month, the presumptive amount prescribed by the
Guidelines, plus a further $1,200 per month for extraordinary
expenses for the children&#146;s education.  Mr. Andrews does not
question the presumptive amount but does take issue with the
order requiring him to pay extraordinary expenses.  He submits
that in making this order the trial judge failed to apply the
principles in s.7 of the Guidelines.
[22] Clause 7(1)(d) of the Guidelines gives the court
jurisdiction to provide in a child support order an amount to
cover extraordinary expenses for education.  Subsection 7(2)
provides that these expenses are to be shared by the parents in
proportion to their respective incomes:

             7. (1) In an order for the support of a child, the court
        may, on either spouse&#146;s request or on the request of an applicant
        under section 33 of the Act, provide for an amount to cover the
        following expenses, or any portion of those expenses, taking into
        account the necessity of the expense in relation to the child&#146;s
        best interests and the reasonableness of the expense, having
        regard to the means of the parents or spouses and those of the
        child and to the spending pattern of the parents or spouses in
        respect of the child during cohabitation:
                                  &#133;
            (d) extraordinary expenses for primary or
            secondary school education or for any
            educational programs that meet the child&#146;s
            particular needs;

          (2) The guiding principle in determining the
          amount of an expense referred to in
          subsection (1) is that the expense is shared
          by the parents or spouses in proportion to
          their respective incomes after deducting from
          the expense, the contribution, if any, from
          the child.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The trial judge found that the additional educational costs
for the children amounted to $1,578.75 per month, made up of
$573.75 for Adam, $605 for Mark and $400 for Melina.  She ordered
Mr. Andrews to contribute $1,200 to these expenses, Mrs. Andrews
being responsible for the balance.  In making this order, the
trial judge did not refer to the requirements of s.7 of the
Guidelines and it would have been better had she done so.
Nonetheless, in the light of the evidence at trial and her
findings, her order for extraordinary expenses is reasonably
supportable.
[24] An order under s.7(1)(d) for Adam, Mark and Melina must
satisfy three criteria:

   (1)  the educational expenses must be extraordinary;

   (2)  the order must take into account the necessity of the
        expense in relation to the best interest of the children; and</pre>
    <pre>   (3)  the order must also take into account the reasonableness of
        the expense, having regard to the means of Mr. and Mrs. Andrews
        and their spending patterns for the children during cohabitation.</pre>
    <pre>The expenses for Melina must meet a fourth criterion: the cost of
her home education programs must meet her special needs.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Mr. Andrews concedes that the private school fees for Adam
and Mark and the expenses for Melina&#146;s home schooling are
extraordinary expenses.  Because of Mr. Andrews&#146; concession, I
need not address the debate over the proper approach to
determining &#147;extraordinary expenses&#148; reflected in the thorough
and thoughtful judgment of Prowse J.A. in McLaughlin v.
McLaughlin.4  I do, however, agree with Prowse J.A. that in
adopting an &#147;add on&#148; approach under s.7, the drafters of the
Guidelines &#147;recognized the importance of addressing the needs of
a particular family with particular expenses&#148;.5  The Andrews
family has particular educational needs and expenses associated
with those needs.  These expenses are not covered by the basic
table amount Mr. Andrews must pay for child support under the
Guidelines.
[26] The evidence shows that the expenses for each of the three
children are necessary in relation to their best interests.  The
expenses for Melina most obviously satisfy the necessity
criterion, and also meet her particular need to be schooled at
home.  For her home schooling she requires the assistance of
various therapeutic, computer and other programs.  The cost of
these programs is not disputed.
[27] The private school expenses for Adam and Mark also satisfy
the necessity criterion.  When Mr. and Mrs. Andrews cohabited,
Adam and Mark went to private elementary schools.  Adam, after
finishing grade 8 at a private school, enrolled in a local high
school in a special education program.  However, he was harassed
and bullied and found he could not cope in the public school
environment.  Midway through the year, Mrs. Andrews arranged for
his transfer to a private school.  Mark was attending a private
school with the concurrence of Mr. Andrews.  However,
unprofessional behaviour by Mark&#146;s classroom teacher caused
several parents, including Mrs. Andrews, to withdraw their
children from the school.  Mrs. Andrews placed Mark in another
private school at an additional cost of about $240 per month.
Mrs. Andrews arranged these transfers for Adam and Mark in their
best interest and to address their special needs.  Mr. Andrews
agreed that Mrs. Andrews&#146; decisions were well thought out and in
the children&#146;s best interests.
[28] His main argument focussed on the reasonableness criterion.
I agree with him that the necessity of an extraordinary expense
must be weighed against its reasonableness.  However, considering
the parties&#146; and especially Mr. Andrews&#146; means, and considering
that Mr. and Mrs. Andrews sent the children to private schools
during cohabitation, I am satisfied that the expenses for all
three children meet the reasonableness criterion.
[29] Under the Guidelines, child support payments are not tax
deductible.  Mr. Andrews&#146; marginal tax rate is 50% and an order
of $1,200 per month must be paid in after-tax dollars.  He says
that he cannot afford it.  But it seems to me that he can on an
income of $200,000.  The trial judge implicitly found that he
could reasonably afford these expenses in her discussion of his
lifestyle and of what he has been able to pay for since
separation.  Moreover, as Mrs. Andrews points out, the
extraordinary expenses for Mark &#150; $605 per month &#150; will likely
end after he finishes grade 8 in the year 2000.  Then he will
either go to the local public school or he will go to the private
school Adam attends, in which case he will pay no additional fees
as long as Adam is in the school.  I would therefore not give
effect to Mr. Andrews&#146; submission on extraordinary expenses for
his children&#146;s education.  If there is to be any reduction in the
amount of support ordered by the trial judge, it should be a
reduction in spousal support, not child support.</pre>
    <pre>Third Issue &#150; Did the Trial Judge Err in Ordering Mr. Andrews to
              Pay Spousal Support of $3,000 per month?</pre>
    <pre>[30] Mr. Andrews submits that the order for spousal support
should be eliminated or at least substantially reduced for two
reasons: first, the trial judge did not follow the requirements
of the Family Law Act; and second, taking into account his child
support obligations, the order for spousal support is
unreasonable.  I would not disturb the order for spousal support.
[31] In Halliday v. Halliday,6 this court emphasized that trial
judges must follow the provisions of Part III of the Family Law
Act in determining the amount and form of spousal support.
The court wrote:7

             Part III of the Family Law Act deals with support
        obligations.  Its provisions chart the course which a trial judge
        must follow in determining whether a spouse is entitled to
        support and, if so, the amount of support and the form of
        support.  In our view, the trial judge failed to follow the
        course.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The trial judge was obliged to consider and
          determine if the appellant was a spouse
          within the meaning of s.29.  He was then
          obliged to consider s.30 which provides that
          &#147;every spouse has an obligation to provide
          support &#133; for the other spouse, in accordance
          with need, to the extent that he &#133; is capable
          of doing so&#148;.  Then, the trial judge must
          consider the purposes of a support order
          found in s. 33(8) and, in determining the
          amount and duration of support in relation to
          need, must consider all the circumstances of
          the parties, including the factors stipulated
          in s. 33(9).  Finally, the trial judge, in
          awarding support, may choose from the various
          forms of support contained in s. 34(1).</pre>
    <pre>[32] In the case before us, the trial judge did not expressly
advert to ss.30, 33(8) and 33(9) of the Act.  But in my view, she
did so implicitly when she found that Mr. Andrews had understated
his true income, that Mrs. Andrews had been &#147;greatly
disadvantaged&#148; by the marriage, that she must devote a great deal
of time to the special needs of her children, that she is now
working &#147;very very long days&#148;, that &#147;she will continue to do
whatever she can with respect to earning her own income&#148;, but
that &#147;she will probably never be able to fully mitigate&#148; her
disadvantageous position.
[33] Mr. Andrews&#146; real complaint, however, is that after taking
into account how much he must pay for child support, the spousal
support order is simply too high.  The issue is not need &#150; Mrs.
Andrews needs this amount of support &#150; but affordability.  In
fixing spousal support, the trial judge had the benefit of the
SUPPORTmate calculations.  These calculations show that the basic
child support order and the spousal order of the trial judge
yield a monthly disposable income of $4,619 for Mr. Andrews and a
monthly disposable income of $5,860 for Mrs. Andrews:</pre>

    <pre>
[34] From theses monthly disposable income figures must be
deducted each party&#146;s obligation to pay the extraordinary
expenses, $1,200 for Mr. Andrews and $378 for Mrs. Andrews.
Taking into account the order for extraordinary expenses leaves
Mr. Andrews with a monthly disposable income of $3,419 and Mrs.
Andrews with a monthly disposable income of $5,482.  In
percentage terms, the trial judge&#146;s orders for child support and
spousal support allocate 40% of the parties&#146; total net disposable
income to Mr. Andrews and 60% to Mrs. Andrews.  To justify
interfering with the order for spousal support, I would have to
be persuaded that this allocation is unreasonable or outside an
acceptable range.  However, I find nothing unreasonable in
allocating 60% of the parties&#146; total net disposable income to
Mrs. Andrews, who has been economically disadvantaged by a  17-
year marriage and who has the responsibility for caring for the
three children, two of whom have special needs.  I would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Fourth Issue &#150; Should the Court Order a Review of Spousal Support
in June 2002?</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge refused to make a time-limited support
order.  Nevertheless, Mr. Andrews submits that if he is required
to pay spousal support, the court should order a review of the
amount of support at the end of June 2002.  Unlike on a variation
application, on a review neither spouse has to demonstrate a
material change in circumstances.  The court determines spousal
support &#150; entitlement, amount, and duration &#150; afresh on the facts
existing on the review date.
[36] Mr. Andrews asks for a review order because he claims to be
concerned that Mrs. Andrews will not begin contributing to her
own support quickly enough.  I find no evidence to support this
concern.  Even while managing the household and teaching Melina
at home, Mrs. Andrews diligently has taken on a part-time job to
bring in some extra income.  When Melina will be able to return
to school, thus freeing Mrs. Andrews to look for a full-time
paying job, remains uncertain.
[37] Moreover, I do not think that the court should routinely
make review orders, especially on appeal, when the trial judge
has not seen fit to do so.  The concern raised by Mr. Andrews is
far better addressed on a variation application.  Failing to make
reasonable efforts to obtain a full-time job when able to do so
can amount to a material change in circumstances.8  I would not
give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Fifth Issue &#150; Did the Trial Judge Err in her Cost Award?</pre>
    <pre>[38] The trial judge awarded Mrs. Andrews party-and-party costs
up to October 22, 1997, and solicitor-and-client costs
afterwards.  In making this award, the trial judge took into
account an offer to settle made by Mrs. Andrews five days before
trial, which was more favourable to Mr. Andrews than the
judgment.
[39] On appeal, Mr. Andrews argues that the trial judge erred in
using the offer to settle to award solicitor-and-client costs
because the offer was made only five days before trial, not seven
as required by rule 49.10.
[40] I would not give effect to this argument.  The cost award
was supportable under rule 49.13, especially considering that
though the trial began on October 27, 1997, it was adjourned
after only two days of evidence, resumed for one day in January
1998 and then was completed by four days of hearing in March
1998.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[41] At the beginning of the appeal, Mrs. Andrews brought a
motion to introduce as fresh evidence Mr. Andrews&#146; 1998 income
tax return.  We reserved our decision on the motion.  Because of
my disposition of the appeal, I need not consider the fresh
evidence.
[42] I would dismiss the motion without costs and I would dismiss
the appeal with costs.</pre>
