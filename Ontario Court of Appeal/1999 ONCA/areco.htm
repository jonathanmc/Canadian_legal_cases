    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice Locke on June 19,
1996 and from the sentence imposed on September 4, 1996</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following his trial before Locke J., sitting without a jury,
the  appellant was found guilty of one count of dangerous driving
causing death and two counts of dangerous driving causing  bodily
harm,  contrary to s. 249 of the Criminal Code. He was  convicted
of  the  offence  of  dangerous driving  causing  death  and  the
remaining two counts were stayed pursuant to the principle in  R.
v.   Kineapple,  [1975]  1  S.C.R.  729  relating   to   multiple
convictions. He was sentenced to a term of one year in prison and
prohibited  from driving for a period of three years. He  appeals
his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.
[2]  The charges arose out of a motor vehicle accident which
occurred in Toronto on November 13, 1994, near the intersection
of Dufferin Street and Rosemount Avenue. At that location,
Dufferin Street is a four-lane roadway which runs north and south
and Rosemount Avenue runs east and west. Around 3:30 a.m., the
appellant was driving his vehicle northbound on Dufferin Street
in the left northbound lane. In the back seat of his car were two
teen-age girls, Ana Lucero and Elianna Calderon. At the same
time, Muktar Ahman was driving his taxi in a southerly direction
in the left southbound lane of Dufferin Street. He had two
passengers in the back seat of his vehicle. Suddenly, the
appellant drove his vehicle across the centre line and crashed
into the taxi. The two cars were very seriously damaged and had
to be pried apart. Elianna Calderon died as a result of the
crash. Both Ana Lucero and Muktar Ahman were injured. The
appellant was also injured.
[3]  No one in the appellant&#146;s vehicle could give evidence about
the accident. The appellant had no memory of the crash itself or
of events that followed. Ms. Calderon was killed instantly and
Ms. Lucero was asleep at the time. One unrelated eyewitness, who
was travelling northbound on Dufferin Street and whose vehicle
had been passed by the appellant shortly before the collision,
estimated that the appellant was driving at 70 to 75 kilometres
in this 50 kilometre zone. The taxi driver and his two passengers
also testified. The gist of their testimony was that the accident
had happened very quickly and that the appellant had taken no
evasive action. Two police accident reconstructionists were also
called as witnesses. There is no suggestion in the evidence that
alcohol or drugs contributed to this accident. There is also no
suggestion of any defect to either of the two cars involved in
the collision or to the road. The weather was clear and the
pavement was dry.
[4]  The trial judge found that the appellant was travelling at
an excessive speed, that he crossed the centre line of the
roadway and that he collided with the taxi without applying the
brakes or taking any evasive action. He held further that, absent
any evidence that would support a non-blameworthy inference, the
appellant&#146;s manner of driving constituted a marked departure from
the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in
the appellant&#146;s situation and, consequently, constituted
dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46.  Section 249(1) defines dangerous driving as the
operation of a motor vehicle &#147;in a manner that is dangerous to
the public, having regard to all the circumstances, including the
nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle
is being operated and the amount of traffic that at the time is
or might reasonably be expected to be at that place.&#148;
[5]  The appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal against
conviction, some of which relate to the reasonableness of the
verdict and others to the applicable burden of proof. We see no
reason to interfere with the verdict.
[6]  The trial judge made findings of fact that were open to him
on the evidence and he applied the correct legal test to those
facts. In particular, his finding that the appellant was driving
at an excessive rate is supported by the testimony, which he
accepted, of both the eye witness and the accident
reconstructionist. Further, his finding that there was no
evidence that would support a non-blameworthy inference is also
reasonably supported on the evidence. It is contended that the
appellant may have fallen asleep or lost consciousness. The
appellant did not testify that he may have fallen asleep; on the
contrary, he maintained that he was not tired. Even assuming that
he may have fallen asleep, there is nothing in the evidence to
support an inference that he may have unexpectedly been overcome
by fatigue nor is there anything in the evidence that would
suggest that the appellant may have lost consciousness.
[7]  The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
[8]  The appellant also seeks to appeal his sentence. He takes no
issue with the prohibition against driving but submits that the
trial judge should have permitted him to serve his  sentence in
the community.
[9]  In determining the appropriate sentence, the trial judge
considered the general principles of sentencing. He found it
likely that the appellant had rehabilitated himself but, given
the nature of the offence, he held that a period of incarceration
was necessary to address the need for general deterrence. He then
refused to accede to the defence&#146;s request that the sentence be
served in the community on the ground that a conditional sentence
would demean the seriousness of the offence.
[10] We see no reason to interfere with the sentence of one
year's imprisonment given the seriousness of the offence and the
need for general deterrence. It is our view, however, that the
trial judge failed to have sufficient regard to the nature of the
conduct that led to the tragic consequences and to the
appellant&#146;s personal circumstances when he refused to order that
the sentence be served in the community.
[11] There is no doubt that the offence was a serious one that
resulted in immeasurable loss to the victims, particularly to the
Calderon family who lost a precious daughter.  The seriousness of
the loss was properly reflected in the imposition of a term of
imprisonment. However, it is not sufficient to look at the
consequences alone when assessing the overall seriousness of an
offence. The blameworthy conduct that led to these consequences
must be considered. In this case, the appellant&#146;s manner of
driving, although dangerous in all the circumstances and
deserving of a criminal sanction, was not the most egregious of
its kind. Rather, in terms of relative seriousness, it certainly
fell within the lower end of the range of dangerous driving
offences. Hence, it is our view that the imposition of a
conditional sentence would not have demeaned the seriousness of
this offence.
[12] Further, the appellant&#146;s personal circumstances do not in
any way militate against the imposition of a conditional
sentence. Mr. Areco was born in 1972. He has no criminal record.
At the time of the offence, he was 22 years old. At the time of
sentencing, he was married, had one daughter and his wife was
expecting a second child. He was employed and he supported his
young family.  Mr. Areco is also an athlete with excellent
potential. The pre-sentence report reveals that he and his family
are honest and hardworking and that they have also been affected
by this most tragic accident. The author of the report
recommended that a conditional sentence be considered as a
sentencing option. We agree with this recommendation. In our
view, appropriate terms can be imposed to satisfy the overall
exigencies of this case.
[13] Leave to appeal the sentence is granted and the sentence is
varied so as to allow the appellant to serve the balance of his
custodial sentence in the community (he has served approximately
20 days in jail) on the following conditions:

     1.   that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour;
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   that he appear before the court when required  to
          do so by the court;
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   that he report to a supervisor
     </pre>
    <pre>          a)   within  one  week of the  release  of  this
               judgment and
     </pre>
    <pre>          b)   thereafter,  when required by the  supervisor
               and in the manner directed by the supervisor;
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   that  he  remain  within the jurisdiction  of  the
          court unless written permission to go outside that
          jurisdiction  is obtained from the  court  or  the
          supervisor;
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   that  he notify the supervisor in advance  of  any
          change of name or address, and promptly notify the
          supervisor   of   any  change  of  employment   or
          occupation;
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   that  he  not  be  outside of his residence  after
          11:00   p.m.  except  where  necessary   for   his
          employment,  or  for any medical requirements  for
          him or his family;
     </pre>
    <pre>     7.   that  he perform a total of 180 hours of community
          service  as  deemed appropriate by the supervisor,
          at  a  rate of at least 15 hours per month,  until
          the 180 hours are completed; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     8.   that  he refrain from association or communication
          with   Nora  Calderon,  Jose  Calderon,  Sebastien
          Calderon or Linda Forias.
</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The prohibition against driving remains intact. It  is  our
understanding that this order was not stayed pending  the  appeal
and, hence, that it has now expired.</pre>
