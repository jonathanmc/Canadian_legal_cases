               ARMSTRONG (Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>               Christopher Webb, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Cunningham J. on
February 25, 1999 and on appeal from the sentence imposed by
Cunningham J. on April 27, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  The evidence against the appellant was overwhelming.  There
was strong circumstantial evidence that it was the appellant, not
a co-worker, who misappropriated some $120,000 over a six-week
period.  Additionally, the appellant made a series of statements
to members of the Loss Prevention Group of the victim (Loblaws)
and others in which he admitted that he was responsible for the
theft that occurred on April 12, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  So far as the circumstantial evidence is concerned, the
trial judge, in full reasons, analyzed the evidence relating to
the appellant&#146;s opportunity to commit thefts.  Additionally, he
considered all issues relating to the admissibility of the
statements.  His reasons reveal no error that calls for our
intervention.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
