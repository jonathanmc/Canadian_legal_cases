    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant makes three submissions: (1) he was not put to
his election for the charge under s. 87 of the Criminal Code; (2)
the convictions for assault with a weapon and assault with intent
to  resist  arrest  are  precluded by the rule  against  multiple
convictions; and (3) the trial judge erred in imposing a  s.  100
order.

[2]  On the first submission, we are of the view that the
appellant through his counsel waived his right to elect. At every
stage in the proceedings the appellant&#146;s counsel indicated that
the appellant wished to be tried in the provincial court. The
appellant was represented by competent counsel and, in the
circumstances, we think there was a waiver. See Regina v.
Mitchell 36 O.R. (3d) 643 (C.A.). This ground of appeal fails.

[3]  On the second submission, whether the assault with a weapon
conviction should be stayed under the Kienapple principle turns
on whether the possession of the knife for a dangerous purpose
preceded its use. Technically, the s. 87 offence was complete
before the knife was used, but as in R. v. Briscoe (1992) 76
C.C.C. (3d) 563 (B.C.C.A.), we think this technical view is at
odds with the spirit of the rule against multiple convictions. We
therefore think that the assault with a weapon charge should be
stayed. We take a different view of the conviction for assault
with intent to resist arrest because of the added legal element
of the intent to resist arrest. See R. v. Prince (1986) 30 C.C.C.
(3d) 35 (S.C.C.).

[4]  On the third submission, the s. 100 order was mandatory
unless the appellant could bring himself within s. 100(1.1) of
the Code. He chose not to make any submissions on whether he
could invoke this exempting provision. Therefore, he has no cause
to complain about the s. 100 order in this court.

[5]  Accordingly, the conviction for assault with a weapon is
stayed under rule in  Kienapple. Otherwise the appeal is
dismissed.</pre></td>
