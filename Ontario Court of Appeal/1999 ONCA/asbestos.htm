    <pre><font size="4">[1]   The  focus  of this appeal is s. 127(1)3 of the  Securities
Act,1  which  gives the Ontario Securities Commission  (&#147;OSC&#148;  or
&#147;Commission&#148;) discretion to make an order in the public  interest
removing  the  exemptions that enable a person to participate  in
the Ontario capital markets.
[2]  In the 1980s the Québec Government acquired control of
Asbestos Corporation Ltd. (&#147;ACL&#148;), a leading asbestos producer in
the province, by purchasing the interest of its majority
shareholder, a Canadian company, from its American parent. After
acquiring control, Québec refused to make an offer to purchase
the shares of the minority shareholders in ACL, many of whom were
resident in Ontario. In 1988, a group of minority shareholders,
represented by the Committee for the Equal Treatment of Asbestos
Minority Shareholders (&#147;CETAMS&#148;), applied to the OSC for a
determination whether Québec&#146;s acquisition of control of ACL
amounted to a take-over bid requiring a follow-up offer to the
minority shareholders or whether the OSC should make an order
under s. 127(1)3 removing Québec&#146;s exemptions.
[3]  Québec&#146;s challenge to the jurisdiction of the OSC to hold a
hearing was dismissed by this court in 1992. The hearing resumed
in 1994 and on July 19, 1994, a three-member panel of the
Commission (Geller, Kitts and Carscallen) dismissed CETAMS&#146;
application. The panel held that Québec&#146;s acquisition of control
of ACL did not amount to a take-over bid, and that although
Québec had treated the minority shareholders unfairly, an order
removing Québec&#146;s exemptions under s. 127(1)3 of the Act was not
warranted.
[4]  On an appeal by CETAMS, the Divisional Court, by an order
dated May 2, 1997, overturned the decision of the Commission. The
Divisional Court held that the Commission erred by failing to
exercise its public interest jurisdiction. It directed the
Commission to order Québec to make a follow-up offer to the
minority shareholders of ACL, failing which Québec&#146;s exemptions
were to be withdrawn.
[5]  Sa Majesté du Chef du Québec (&#147;Québec&#148; or the &#147;Québec
Government&#148;),  Société Nationale de l&#146;Amiante (&#147;SNA&#148;), the Crown
corporation used to acquire control of ACL, and the OSC all
appeal to this court. They submit that the Divisional Court
applied the wrong standard of review, mischaracterized the
panel&#146;s reasons and made an order that misconceived the purpose
of  s. 127(1)3. The gist of their appeal turns on whether the OSC
erred in refusing to make an order under s. 127(1)3, because
Québec&#146;s acquisition of control of ACL did not have a
&#147;transactional connection&#148; with Ontario and because Québec did
not intend to avoid Ontario law. For the reasons that follow, I
would set aside the decision of the Divisional Court and restore
the decision of the OSC.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">A.   Background</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     1.   The Facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[6]   In  the  fall  of 1977, the newly elected  Parti  Québecois
Government  in the Province of Québec decided to nationalize  the
Québec  asbestos  industry. At the time, Québec was  the  world&#146;s
largest  asbestos  producer, accounting  for  about  29%  of  the
world&#146;s  asbestos production. Québec, however, had  virtually  no
secondary  asbestos  industry. Ninety-five  percent  of  the  raw
asbestos  produced  in  the province was  shipped  elsewhere  for
manufacture. The Québec Government wanted  to create an  asbestos
manufacturing  industry  to complement  the  province&#146;s  asbestos
mining industry, in the words of Premier Levesque: &#147;to give  back
a  certain  control over this natural resource, which is  at  the
same time so much and so little our own.&#148;
[7]  To accomplish its objective, the Government decided to take
control of ACL,  which at the time was the province&#146;s second
largest asbestos producer. ACL was a federally incorporated
company whose shares traded on the Toronto and Montreal stock
exchanges. ACL was controlled by General Dynamics Corporation
(&#147;GD US&#148;), a Delaware Corporation with its head office in St.
Louis, Missouri. GD US owned all the shares of General Dynamics
Corporation (Canada) Limited (&#147;GD Canada&#148;), which in turn owned
54.6% of the common shares of ACL. Approximately 30% of the
common shares of ACL were held by minority shareholders resident
in Ontario.
[8]  On October 30, 1977, Premier Levesque announced his
Government&#146;s intention to take control of ACL. He was quoted in
the press as saying &#147;&#133; other shareholders would be uncomfortable
if they were minority shareholders while the Government held
control. The Government must take positions and achieve
objectives that are not always those of ordinary shareholders.&#148;
At the same time, Québec&#146;s Finance Minister, Jacques Parizeau,
undertook on behalf of the Government to offer to purchase the
shares of ACL held by the public. Mr. Parizeau was quoted as
saying: &#147;we will in any case make a bid for all public shares;&#148;
and &#147;a public offer for Asbestos Corp. shares would be at an
equivalent price to that paid for the General Dynamics block.&#148;
[9]  The Québec Government decided to use a Crown corporation to
take control of ACL. In May 1978, SNA was incorporated by an act
of the National Assembly. All of SNA&#146;s shares were allotted to
Québec&#146;s Minister of Finance, and SNA was given the power to
acquire any company in the business of extracting or
manufacturing asbestos. In June 1979, SNA&#146;s incorporating statute
was amended to permit the Québec Government to expropriate the
assets of ACL. However, Québec indicated its preference to
acquire control of ACL by agreement with GD US. It would
expropriate only if negotiations failed.
[10] Québec then began to negotiate with GD US. On September 21,
1979, SNA offered to purchase all of GD Canada&#146;s shares in ACL at
a price of $42 per share. In its offer SNA stated that once it
acquired the shares of ACL held by GD Canada it would offer to
purchase the remaining shares of ACL at the same price. GD US,
however, rejected SNA&#146;s offer, claiming that ACL shares were
worth $99 per share.
[11] Negotiations then stopped because ACL challenged the
constitutionality of the legislation permitting its assets to be
expropriated by SNA. In the spring of 1981,  the Québec Court of
Appeal rejected the constitutional challenge and the Supreme
Court of Canada denied leave to appeal. Québec then imposed a
November 30, 1981 deadline for a negotiated agreement with GD US,
failing which it would expropriate. Negotiations resumed.
[12] On November 9, 1981, the Québec Government and GD US reached
an agreement under which SNA would acquire voting control of GD
Canada and, therefore, indirect control of ACL. The 1981
agreement provided that GD Canada would be recaptialized to
convert its equity into two classes of shares, one voting and one
non-voting; SNA would acquire 51% of the voting shares, but only
17.5% of the equity; GD US would retain 49% of the voting shares
and 82%.5 of the equity; SNA and GD US would enter into a
shareholders&#146; agreement providing that for the next five years
SNA could acquire the remaining shares of GD Canada held by GD US
by means of &#147;put&#148; and &#147;call&#148; options; GD US&#146;s put option gave it
the right to require SNA to purchase and SNA&#146;s call option gave
it the right to require GD US to sell the remaining shares of GD
Canada held by GD US at a price of $42 per ACL share, the price
that the Québec Government had insisted on all along. This 1981
transaction was mainly driven by tax considerations. The put and
call arrangements were intended to permit GD US to accumulate tax
credits, which it would then offset against the capital gains on
the sale of its shares, thus minimizing the taxes it paid.
[13] This 1981 transaction materially differed from the offer
made by SNA in 1979 and rejected by GD US. Under the transaction
contemplated in 1979, SNA would have acquired ACL shares from GD
Canada. SNA would then have made a follow-up offer to the
minority shareholders of ACL to purchase their shares at the same
price.
[14] In the 1981 transaction, SNA did not purchase ACL shares.
Instead it purchased GD Canada shares from GD US. In other words,
the 1981 transaction was an agreement between SNA, a Québec Crown
corporation, and GD US, a Missouri-based Delaware corporation,
for the acquisition of the shares of GD Canada, a private
Canadian company that was not a reporting issuer in Ontario or
anywhere else.  Importantly, the 1981 transaction was not
accompanied by an undertaking to the minority shareholders of ACL
to purchase their shares.
[15] Indeed, on November 11, 1981, two days after the agreement
was reached, Québec announced that it did not intend to make an
offer to the minority shareholders of ACL. On November 13, 1981,
the shares of ACL fell to a four-year low in response to a
statement by Mr. Parizeau that the province had no intention of
buying any ACL shares other than those controlled by GD US. He
said, instead, &#147;it is up to GD Canada to evaluate over the years
the advantage of eventually increasing its share in Asbestos
Corp.&#148; Six days later on November 19, 1981, Mr. Parizeau was
again quoted as saying: &#147;but at the present time, I am not buying
the shares of General Dynamics &#133; but if I force them out &#133; then
obviously I should do something with the minority shareholders.&#148;
The OSC described these statements as &#147;to say the least,
disingenuous.&#148; Nonetheless, the market did not interpret Mr.
Parizeau&#146;s statements as a promise by the Québec Government to
make a follow-up offer to the minority shareholders. The evidence
shows that the price of ACL shares did not increase to levels
consistent with such a promise.
[16] On February 12, 1982, the agreement between Québec, SNA and
GD US was formalized. GD Canada&#146;s name was changed to Mines SNA
Inc. and its registered office was moved from Ottawa to the
Province of Québec. In November 1986, GD US exercised its put
option; and on December 9, 1986, SNA purchased the remaining
common shares of GD Canada held by GD US. The total cost to the
Québec Government of acquiring control of ACL was approximately
$171,000,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     2.   The 1988 Proceedings</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[17]  In  April  1988,  the OSC issued a  notice  of  hearing  to
determine two questions:  first, whether the transaction by which
SNA  acquired GD US&#146;s shares in GD Canada amounted to a take-over
bid  in  Ontario, requiring SNA to make a follow-up offer to  the
minority shareholders of ACL; and second, whether the OSC  should
exercise its public interest jurisdiction under s. 124(1)[now  s.
127(1)3]  of  the  Securities Act and take away Québec&#146;s  trading
exemptions in the Ontario capital markets.
[18] Québec immediately challenged the jurisdiction of the OSC to
inquire into the transaction. In a decision dated August 15,
1988, the OSC held that it had jurisdiction to decide the issues
raised in the notice of hearing. A combined appeal and judicial
review application brought by Québec was dismissed by the
Divisional Court. A further appeal was dismissed by this court on
October 26, 1992.2  In this court, Québec argued two main points:
first, the principle of provincial extra-territorial incompetence
precluded the application of Ontario law to this transaction; and
second, and of significance to the present appeal, the OSC could
only exercise its public interest jurisdiction if the transaction
had a sufficient Ontario connection.
[19] McKinlay J.A., writing for the court, rejected both
arguments. On the first point, she held that the provisions of
the Securities Act raised in the notice of hearing were within
the province&#146;s legislative competence and that it was neither
fair nor reasonable to suggest only Ontario residents are subject
to Ontario regulatory rules when operating in Ontario capital
markets. She wrote at p. 595:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">             </font><font size="3">  &#133; I am of the view that territorial jurisdiction of the OSC
          under s. 124 does not depend solely upon the province or country
          in which relevant transactions may have taken place, but rather
          upon whether or not persons availing themselves of the benefits
          of trading in the Ontario capital markets act in a manner
          consistent with the provisions of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[20]  On  the  second point, McKinlay J.A. held the  Commission&#146;s
public  interest  jurisdiction was not &#147;subject  to  an  implicit
precondition&#148;  that  the  conduct  in  question  &#147;must   have   a
sufficient Ontario connection.&#148;3  She wrote at pp. 592-93:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                 </font><font size="3">   I have difficulty understanding the argument of the
          appellant that s. 124(1) must be interpreted as being subject to
          an implicit precondition that the conduct relied upon by the OSC
          as the basis for the exercise of its discretion must have a
          &#147;sufficient Ontario connection&#148;. The Ontario connection required
          by the section is &#147;the public interest&#148;. I construe &#147;the public
          interest&#148; in that provision as being not only the interest of
          residents of Ontario, but the interest of all persons making use
          of Ontario capital markets. The discretion being contemplated by
          the OSC is a discretion to withdraw special privileges given, in
          this case, to the government of another province. I see nothing
          in the Act, nor do I see any constitutional or policy reason why
          any limited interpretation should be placed on the clear wording
          of the section.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[21] Following this court&#146;s decision, the OSC resumed its hearing
into  whether  the  transaction amounted to a  take-over  bid  or
whether  it should exercise its public interest jurisdiction  and
remove Québec&#146;s trading exemptions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     3.   The 1994 Proceedings Before the OSC4</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[22]  The panel first considered whether the transaction amounted
to  a  take-over bid under the Ontario statute. If  it  did,  SNA
would  be  required  to make a follow-up offer  to  the  minority
shareholders  of  ACL. The panel looked at  the  issue  from  two
perspectives: was it a take-over bid as defined in  the  Act,  or
was  it  a  deemed  take-over bid under the Act&#146;s  anti-avoidance
provisions  because it was artificially structured to  avoid  the
take-over bid rules. The panel held that it was neither.  Because
it  found that SNA&#146;s acquisition of control of ACL did not amount
to  a  take-over  bid triggering the requirement of  a  follow-up
offer to the minority shareholders, the panel concluded that  the
OSC  did not have to seek a compliance order from the court.  The
panel&#146;s  finding that the transaction did not amount to  a  take-
over  bid  was  not appealed and, therefore, is not  before  this
court.
[23] The panel then considered whether it should exercise its
public interest jurisdiction. The respondent CETAMS argued that
Québec and SNA had committed two abuses warranting the
Commission&#146;s intervention: they had failed to provide equal
treatment to the minority shareholders of ACL contrary to the
spirit of the take-over bid rules; and, their public statements
misled the minority shareholders of ACL into believing that a
follow-up offer would be made.
[24] On the first argument, the panel was of the view that &#147;both
the Québec Government and GD US had a moral obligation to concern
themselves with the interests of the minority shareholders of
Asbestos, and about the propriety of GD US walking away with a
sizeable  payment while the minority shareholders were left
behind.&#148;5 The panel, nonetheless, concluded that although the
transaction failed to comply with the spirit of the take-over bid
rules and was unfair to the minority shareholders, it would not
intervene because the transaction did not have a sufficient
Ontario connection or nexus. In the panel&#146;s words at p.281:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                   </font><font size="3"> In our view, the actions of the Québec Government and
          SNA failed to comply with the spirit underlying the take-over bid
          rules of the Act, were abusive of the minority shareholders of
          Asbestos and were manifestly unfair to them. However, in order
          for us to find that such actions were also abusive of the
          integrity of the Ontario capital markets and warranted a clause
          127(1)3 response on our part, a sufficient Ontario connection or
          &#147;nexus&#148; must be present.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[25] The panel then discussed why SNA&#146;s acquisition of control of
ACL did not have a sufficient Ontario nexus and why it was not an
Ontario  transaction  structured to appear to  be  a  non-Ontario
transaction.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                   </font><font size="3"> There was not, in our view, a transactional connection
          of the transaction with Ontario. Asbestos was not an Ontario
          corporation and its registered office was in Quebec. Its Canadian
          operations were in Quebec, not in Ontario. The transactions
          resulting in a change in its control took place outside Ontario
          between non-Ontario parties. In the circumstances of this case,
          the facts that Asbestos was a reporting issuer in Ontario, with
          its common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, that a
          substantial number of its  common shares were held by Ontario
          residents, and that that exchange was the principal exchange on
          which those shares traded, are not, in our view, sufficient to
          establish the transactional connection required.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                     We  were  not presented  with  any
          evidence  that the transaction which  finally
          occurred  was  structured so as  to  make  an
          Ontario  transaction  appear  to  be  a  non-
          Ontario  one.  This  is not  the  case,  like
          Canadian  Tire,  of  &#147;transactions  that  are
          clearly   designed  to  avoid  the  animating
          principles  behind&#148; Ontario&#146;s  take-over  bid
          legislation and rules. The evidence was clear
          that  the  principal  (and  so  far  as   the
          evidence   went,   the  sole)   purpose   for
          structuring the transaction in its final form
          was  the minimisation of taxes on the  profit
          received  by  GD Canada and GD  U.S.  In  our
          view, the structuring of the transaction  was
          not  abusive of the integrity of the  capital
          markets  of  this  province,  and  cannot  be
          relied on to provide the required nexus.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                      Accordingly,  we  find   that   a
          sufficient Ontario nexus for the exercise  of
          our clause 127(1)3 jurisdiction in connection
          with  the  acquisition by SNA of  control  of
          Asbestos has not been established.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[26]  On  the respondent&#146;s second argument, the panel viewed  the
statements  made  by  Québec  cabinet  ministers  about  Québec&#146;s
intention  to make a follow-up offer once GD US had  turned  down
$42  per share in 1979 to be &#147;equivocal&#148;. Although in the panel&#146;s
view the Québec Government should have been more forthright,  its
failure  to  be  so was not abusive enough for the Commission  to
invoke  its  public  interest  jurisdiction.  Moreover,  on   the
evidence before it, the panel concluded it was not reasonable for
investors to rely on these statements as representations  that  a
follow-up offer would be made.
[27] The panel members therefore concluded that although they had
&#147;every sympathy for the unfortunate minority shareholders of
Asbestos who &#133; we find to have been unfairly and badly dealt with
by the Québec Government&#148;, these shareholders were &#147;dealt with in
circumstances in which we find that they are unable to look to
the Act for a remedy.&#148;6</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     4.   The Appeal to the Divisional Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[28]  On  appeal,  the Divisional Court (O&#146;Driscoll,  Steele  and
Crane JJ.) reversed the decision of the Commission. Crane J., who
wrote  for  the  court,  concluded that  the  OSC  had  made  two
jurisdictional  errors:  first, the  &#147;OSC  erred  in  erecting  a
jurisdictional barrier in the form of a transactional nexus  pre-
condition&#148;;  and  second, &#147;the OSC has erred by  holding  that  a
finding  of  fact  of  a conscious attempt to  avoid  what  would
otherwise  be  a  take-over  bid in  Ontario  with  that  as  the
motivating   and underlying reason for  such avoidance  manoeuvre
is  a  necessary prerequisite to the exercise of its  s.  127(1)3
jurisdiction.&#148;   Moreover,  on what he  found  to  be  the  first
jurisdictional error, Crane J. held that the OSC had  also  erred
in   concluding  a  sufficient  Ontario  nexus   had   not   been
established.  On  what  he found to be the second  jurisdictional
error, Crane held that Québec&#146;s motive was irrelevant: &#147;the  task
of  the  OSC  is  to  consider the effects of a  transaction  and
regulate  conduct;  it is not the task of  the  OSC  to  evaluate
proper or improper motives of the participants.&#148;
[29] Having made these findings, the Divisional Court directed
the OSC to order the Québec Government to make a follow-up offer
to the minority shareholders of ACL within 90 days. If it failed
to do so, the OSC was directed to deny the Québec Government all
of the exemptions that allowed it to participate in Ontario&#146;s
capital markets. The Divisional Court also directed the OSC to
order the Québec Government to pay the respondent CETAMS&#146; costs
of the 1994 proceedings before the OSC. It is from the Divisional
Court&#146;s order that Québec, SNA and the OSC appeal.</font></pre>

  Securities Act ?</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     1.   The Standard of Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[30]  The  applicable standard of review of the  decision  of  an
administrative  tribunal &#150; whether the decision  is  entitled  to
deference  from a reviewing court and if so, the extent  of  that
deference  &#150;  mainly  depends  on determining  the  legislature&#146;s
intent  in conferring jurisdiction on the tribunal. To make  this
determination,  the  courts  have looked  at  a  broad  range  of
considerations: for example, whether the tribunal is protected by
a  privative  clause,  whether a right of appeal  lies  from  the
tribunal&#146;s  decision,  the  nature of  the  tribunal&#146;s  role  and
functions,   whether  the  question  goes   to   the   tribunal&#146;s
jurisdiction, or whether the question in issue falls  within  the
tribunal&#146;s expertise.
[31] Where an administrative tribunal is not protected by a
privative clause and its home statute gives the parties a broad
right of appeal, at first blush one might expect the tribunal&#146;s
decisions to receive little or no deference from the courts. But
recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have emphasized
that deference is still called for if the question in issue comes
within the tribunal&#146;s expertise. In both Pezim v. British
Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers)7 and Re Southam8, Iacobucci
J. elaborated on the extent of the deference owed to decisions of
specialized tribunals on issues falling within their expertise
even if the decisions are not protected by a privative clause and
are subject to a broad statutory right of appeal. For these
tribunals deciding these kinds of issues, the standard of review
is reasonableness. Unless the decision under review is
unreasonable, the reviewing court should not interfere with it.
[32] Pezim and Southam apply directly to this case. The decisions
of the OSC  are not protected by a privative clause and instead,
under s.9(5) of the Act, are subject to a broad right of appeal.
But the OSC is a specialized body with broad expertise in
regulating the capital markets and in protecting the investing
public from abuse. This expertise is reflect in two ways:  first
in the wide powers given to the OSC under the Act; and second in
the OSC&#146;s own well-developed, carefully crafted body of
jurisprudence, which is readily accessible to those who must
conform to the regulatory regime that the OSC supervises.
Moreover, the issue before the OSC in this case, whether it
should exercise its public interest jurisdiction under s. 127(1)3
of the Act to withdraw Québec&#146;s trading exemptions, and if so, on
what terms, is an issue that falls squarely within the
Commission&#146;s specialized expertise, and indeed is a core part of
its statutory mandate. The OSC&#146;s decision on this issue is
therefore entitled to deference on appeal.
[33] Also, in deciding whether to exercise its public interest
jurisdiction, the OSC is required to exercise a broad discretion:
the Commission may make an order if, in its opinion, it is in the
public interest to do so. Discretion implies the power to choose
between alternative courses of action. Where a tribunal&#146;s
decision requires the exercise of discretion, courts have
typically used other terms to signal deference: the reviewing
court should only interfere if the tribunal in exercising its
discretion has &#147;erred in principle&#148;, acted capriciously or made a
decision that amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In Pezim,
Iacobucci J. used these terms in discussing when the court could
review a decision made by the British Columbia Securities
Commission under s. 144 of  its Act, a provision comparable to s.
127 of the Ontario Act. In doing so, he relied on an earlier
decision of this court in Re the Securities Commission and
Mitchell9.  Iacobucci J. wrote at pp. 607-8:

    <pre><font size="4">              </font><font size="3"> As we have seen, s. 144 of the Act gives the Commission a

          Commission&#146;s order unless the Commission has made some error in
          principle in exercising its discretion or has exercised its
          discretion in a capricious or vexatious manner.

    <pre><font size="4">[34]  Error  in  principle  is a broad term  that  embraces  many
different grounds of review. It has been held to include not only
error  of  law or applying a wrong legal principle, but as  well,
failing  to  take  into account a relevant  factor,  taking  into
account  an irrelevant factor, failing to give sufficient  weight
to  a  relevant  factor, over-emphasizing a relevant  factor  and
misapprehending the evidence.10
[35] Although the term error in principle embraces different
grounds for review, it does not state a standard of review.
Indeed, errors in principle may range across the spectrum from
the correctness standard at one end to the reasonableness
standard at the other end. The degree of deference to be given to
the tribunal&#146;s exercise of discretion will vary depending on the
nature of the alleged error in principle.
[36] An alleged error in law (for example, the application of a
wrong legal principle), at least on a question outside the
tribunal&#146;s expertise, will invite review on a correctness
standard. No deference need be shown to the tribunal&#146;s
determination. Most alleged errors in principle, however, should
be reviewed against the reasonableness standard. Therefore, when
the tribunal is alleged to have erred in the weight it gave to
various factors bearing on the exercise of its discretion, the
reviewing court should show deference to the tribunal&#146;s
determination. Only if the tribunal has exercised its discretion
unreasonably, should the reviewing court interfere.
[37] To suggest that a reviewing court can interfere with a
tribunal&#146;s decision because in the court&#146;s opinion the tribunal
gave too much weight to one factor or not enough weight to
another factor is to abandon deference altogether. This kind of
interference would deny the very rationale for judicial deference
to the decisions of specialized tribunals. The weighing of
relevant factors, the balancing process, is what the exercise of
discretion is all about. Iacobucci J. made this point in Re
Southam at p. 770:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                  </font><font size="3">  The suggestion remains, however, that the Tribunal
          might have erred in law by failing to accord adequate weight to
          certain factors. The problem with this suggestion is that it is
          inimical to the very notion of a balancing test. A balancing test
          is a legal rule whose application should be subtle and flexible,
          not mechanical. &#133; These sorts of things are not readily
          quantifiable. They should not be considered as matters of law but
          should be left initially at least to determination by the
          Tribunal. The most that can be said, as a matter of law, is that
          the Tribunal should consider each factor; but the according of
          weight to the factors should be left to the Tribunal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">In  other  words,  only if by emphasizing some  factors  and  not
emphasizing   others,  the  tribunal  exercised  its   discretion
unreasonably should the court intervene.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[38]   Applying the reasonableness standard to the  OSC&#146;s  public
interest  discretion  becomes important when considering  whether
the  court  should  intervene because the  panel  emphasized  the
absence  of  a sufficient Ontario connection and the lack  of  an
improper  motive on the part of Québec as factors warranting  its
refusal to make an order under s. 127(1)3 of the Act. To put this
question  in  context, I will briefly discuss the nature  of  the
Commission&#146;s public interest jurisdiction under s. 127(1)3.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          2.    The Public Interest Jurisdiction of the OSC Under
          s. 127(1)3 of the Securities Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[39]  Québec&#146;s and SNA&#146;s acquisition of control of  ACL  did  not
breach  the take-over bid provisions of the Securities Act.  Yet,
the  Divisional  Court directed the OSC to  exercise  its  public
interest  jurisdiction and to do so in a way  that  provided  the
remedy  of  a  follow-up  offer  to  the  minority  shareholders.
Therefore, both the scope and purpose of the Commission&#146;s  public
interest  jurisdiction are significant on this appeal.  And  both
were discussed at some length by the panel in its reasons.
[40] The scope of the Commission&#146;s discretion to act in the
public interest under s. 127(1)3 is very wide. The section
provides:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               </font><font size="3">127. (1) Orders in the public interest. &#150; The Commission may
          make one or more of the following orders if in its opinion it is
          in the public interest to make the order or orders:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               &#133;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">          3.   An order that any exemptions contained in Ontario securities
            law do not apply to a person or company permanently or for such
            period as is specified in the order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[41]  The  exercise  of  the Commission&#146;s discretion  under  this
provision is guided by the two broad purposes of the Act set  out
in  s.  1.1  &#150;  to provide protection to investors  from  unfair,
improper  or  fraudulent  practices;  and  to  foster  fair   and
efficient capital markets and confidence in capital markets &#150; and
by the six &#147;fundamental principles&#148; set out in s. 2.1.
[42] As the panel noted, the Commission&#146;s own jurisprudence
states that the OSC may exercise is public interest jurisdiction
even absent a breach of the Act or of the regulations. The
leading case is Canadian Tire Corporation v. C.T.C. Dealer
Holdings Ltd.11 where the Commission, relying on its earlier
decision in Re Cablecasting Ltd., said: &#147;the Commission should
act to restrain a transaction that is clearly abusive of
investors and of the capital markets, whether or not that
transaction constitutes a breach of the Act, the regulations or a
policy statement &#133; transactions that are clearly designed to
avoid the animating principles behind such legislation and rules
will be scrutinized closely by the Commission and intervention
will be ordered in appropriate cases.&#148;  The Commission&#146;s decision
in Canadian Tire was upheld on appeal by the Divisional Court12,
where Reid J. reiterated at p. 138 that &#147;s. 123[now s.127(1)2] on
its face makes no reference to any breach of the Act, regulations
or policy statement being required. The discretion granted  to
the Commission is not, by anything found in s. 123, confined to
circumstances in which a breach occurs.&#148;13
[43] In its later decision in Re H.E.R.O. Industries Ltd.14 the
Commission affirmed that it will exercise its public interest
jurisdiction in connection with transactions violating the spirit
of the take-over bid rules though not violating the rules
themselves.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          By this stage, there should be no doubt in
          anyone&#146;s mind that the Commission will
          intervene to protect the public interest in
          cases in which the rules in Part XIX are
          complied with, but the spirit underlying
          those rules is not. &#133;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                In  determining whether or  not  to  so
          intervene, the Commission must have regard to
          whether  its  intervention will  enhance  the
          pursuit  of  the  policy  objectives  it  has
          identified. For one thing, it must  determine
          that  the  transaction  in  question  has   a
          sufficient  Ontario connection or &#147;nexus&#148;  to
          warrant intervention to protect the integrity
          of  the capital markets in the province  (see
          Re  Asbestos  Corp. Ltd. (1988), 11  O.S.C.B.
          3419).  It  would  be  futile  (and  probably
          wrong)  for  the  Commission  to  purport  to
          intervene  in a transaction whose connections
          with Ontario were so slight as to render such
          intervention meaningless.15</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[44]   However,   though   the   Commission&#146;s   public   interest
jurisdiction  is  broad, sensibly, the Commission  has  exercised
this  jurisdiction cautiously, absent a breach of the Act.  Thus,
in  Canadian Tire the Commission commented that it is &#147;well aware
of  the  necessity to proceed with caution where a breach of  the
Act or policy statement has not been shown.&#148;16
[45] The purpose of the Commission&#146;s public interest jurisdiction
is neither remedial nor punitive; it is protective and
preventive, intended to be exercised to prevent likely future
harm to Ontario&#146;s capital markets. The past conduct of offending
market participants is relevant but only to assessing whether
their future conduct is likely to harm the integrity of the
capital markets. The Commission discussed the purpose of its
public interest jurisdiction in Re Mithras Management Ltd.17
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          Under   sections 26, 123 and 124 of the  Act,
          the role of this Commission is to protect the
          public  interest by removing from the capital
          markets &#150; wholly or partially, permanently or
          temporarily, as the circumstances may warrant
          &#150; those whose conduct in the past leads us to
          conclude that their conduct in the future may
          well be detrimental to the integrity of those
          capital  markets. We are not here  to  punish
          past conduct; that is the role of the courts,
          particularly under section 118 of the Act. We
          are  here to restrain, as best we can, future
          conduct  that is likely to be prejudicial  to
          the public interest in having capital markets
          that are both fair and efficient. In so doing
          we  must, of necessity, look to past  conduct
          as  a  guide  to what we believe  a  person&#146;s
          future  conduct might reasonably be  expected
          to  be; we are not prescient, after all.  And
          in  so  doing,  we may well conclude  that  a
          person&#146;s past conduct has been so abusive  of
          the   capital  markets  as  to  warrant   our
          apprehension  and intervention,  even  if  no
          particular  breach of the Act has  been  made
          out.</font></pre>

          the public, in respect of trading, distribution of securities and
          take-over bids.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[46]  In  the  light of these principles, I turn to consider  the
Divisional  Court&#146;s  decision  and whether  that  court  properly
concluded that the OSC committed a reviewable error in failing to
exercise its public interest jurisdiction under s. 127(1)3 of the
Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          3.    Was  the Divisional Court Wrong to Conclude  that
          the  OSC  Erred  in  Failing  to  Exercise  its  Public
          Interest Jurisdiction?</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[47]  In  my opinion, the Divisional Court was wrong to  conclude
that  OSC  erred in failing to make an order under s. 127(1)3  of
the  Act. I think that the Divisional Court made four main errors
in  its  analysis of the OSC&#146;s decision. First,  it  applied  the
wrong  standard of review; second, it mischaracterized  what  the
Commission  did;  third, it erred by failing to  appreciate  that
whether  the  acquisition of control of  ACL  had  a  &#147;sufficient
Ontario connection&#148; or a &#147;transactional connection&#148; with Ontario,
whether Québec intended to avoid Ontario law and whether Québec&#146;s
public  statements  misled investors into believing  a  follow-up
offer would be made, were relevant factors for the Commission  to
consider  in  exercising its discretion  under  s.  127(1)3;  and
fourth,  it misconceived the purpose of the OSC&#146;s public interest
jurisdiction  by looking at it as a means of providing  a  remedy
for the individual shareholders of ACL.
[48] In my opinion, the Commission did not set up any
jurisdictional preconditions to the exercise of its discretion.
Instead, it took into account and indeed gave prominence to
factors that were relevant to the exercise of its discretion. It
weighed  those factors and made findings of fact on them that
were reasonably supported by the evidence. Finally, it properly
considered whether the abusive and unfair conduct that it found
to have been established warranted an order under s. 127(1)3 of
the Act, removing Québec&#146;s trading exemptions. In refusing to
make such an order, I am not persuaded that the Commission
exercised its discretion unreasonably or, to use the familiar
language of review of discretionary orders, committed an error in
principle, or acted capriciously, arbitrarily or unjustly.
Therefore, I would set aside the order of the Divisional and
restore the order of the OSC. I will elaborate on my conclusions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">      (i)   The  Divisional Court Applied the Wrong  Standard  of
Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[49]  In its reasons the Divisional Court made no mention of  the
applicable  standard of review. However, I think it  is  apparent
from   the  court&#146;s  reasons  that  it  applied  a  standard   of
correctness,  instead of the proper standard of unreasonableness.
The   Divisional  Court&#146;s  reasons  show  no  deference  to   the
Commission&#146;s  findings,  even to  its  finding  of  fact  that  a
transactional connection with Ontario had not been  made  out  on
the  evidence,  no  appreciation  that  the  Commission&#146;s  public
interest jurisdiction is at the heart of the tribunal&#146;s expertise
and  no  recognition that this jurisdiction should  be  exercised
cautiously when no breach of the Act occurs. The Divisional Court
simply substituted its judgment for that of the OSC on what is in
the best interests of the Ontario capital markets.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">      (ii) The Divisional Court Mischaracterized the Commission&#146;s
Reasons</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[50]  The  Divisional Court also appears to have mischaracterized
what the Commission did. The Divisional Court considered that the
Commission  erected two barriers to the exercise  of  its  public
interest   jurisdiction:  the  requirement  of  a   transactional
connection  with Ontario and the requirement of an  intention  to
avoid Ontario law. In the Divisional Court&#146;s view, the Commission
decided  that  unless both requirements were  met  it  could  not
legally make an order under s. 127(1)3 of the Act. In this  court
the  respondent supported the Divisional Court&#146;s characterization
of the Commission&#146;s reasons.
[51] But the Commission did not decide that it could not make an
order under s. 127. It decided that it would not do so. It did
not treat a transactional connection to Ontario or an intention
to avoid Ontario law as conditions precedent to the exercise of
its public interest jurisdiction. Consistent with its established
jurisprudence, it treated them as factors relevant to the
exercise of its discretion under s. 127 in a case where no breach
of the Act occurred and the acquisition of control of ACL took
place outside Ontario. Thus, drawing on its decision in Re
H.E.R.O., the Commission said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">             </font><font size="3">  H.E.R.O. teaches that the Commission can and should
          intervene to protect the public interest in cases in which the
          take-over bid rules of the Act are complied with, but the spirit
          underlying these rules is not. It, however, also teaches that, in
          determining whether the Commission&#146;s intervention will enhance
          the pursuit of the policy objectives it has identified, it must
          determine that the transaction in question has a sufficient
          Ontario connection or &#147;nexus&#148; to warrant intervention to protect
          the integrity of the capital markets in the province. The latter
          determination must, of course, depend on the facts of the
          particular case, and what might constitute a sufficient nexus in
          the circumstances of one case might not satisfy the test in the
          circumstances of another case.19</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[52] The Commission expanded on this point by affirming that  &#147;in
take-over cases of the type before us&#148;, that is where a change of
control transaction takes place outside Ontario:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">           </font><font size="3">    We should not, in our view, attempt to impose Ontario&#146;s
          requirement of equal treatment of minority shareholders, no
          matter how sensible and appropriate we may consider this
          requirement to be, on transactions which don&#146;t have a
          transactional connection with Ontario and which have not been
          deliberately structured to attempt to turn what is clearly a
          transaction with an Ontario transactional connection into one
          purporting to have no such connection. In our view, the
          protection of those who use the Ontario capital markets and of
          the public interest do no require us to do so, tempting though it
          may be in some cases. 20</font><font

    <pre><font size="4">This is not the language of jurisdictional pre-conditions, but of
factors  relevant to the exercise of the Commission&#146;s  discretion
in the kind of case that was before it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[53]  The  panel was not declining jurisdiction or even  deciding
whether  it  had  jurisdiction to make an  order  in  the  public
interest.  Indeed, the OSC had fought for this  jurisdiction  for
six  years and this court had already decided in 1992 that it did
have  the jurisdiction to make a s. 127 order. The panel was well
aware  of  the  previous  decision of  this  court  and  referred
expressly  to  McKinlay J.A.&#146;s reasons (which I  quoted  earlier)
rejecting   a  sufficient  Ontario  connection  as  an  &#147;implicit
jurisdictional  precondition.&#148;   In  an  important  passage   not
referred   to   by  the  Divisional  Court,  the  panel   plainly
acknowledged  that  a  sufficient Ontario connection  was  not  a
jurisdictional requirement, but a factor that was relevant to the
exercise  of  its discretion under s. 127(1)3 in a take-over  bid
case  such as the present one, and yet a factor that may  not  be
relevant  in  other cases under this subsection.  The  Commission
wrote:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">              </font><font size="3"> Our clause 127(1)3 jurisdiction is, after all, a
          discretionary one, requiring a determination by us of what the
          public interest requires in each case. Rather, we regard this
          statement as a refusal to impose a &#147;sufficient Ontario
          connection&#148; as a jurisdictional requirement which must be
          satisfied in any clause 127(1)(3) proceedings before the
          Commission&#146;s discretion arises, thus leaving it to the Commission
          to make the necessary discretionary determination unencumbered by
          any a priori requirement imposed by the court as a matter of
          interpretation of the statutory provision. We have no doubt that
          in clause 127(1)3 proceedings not relating to take-overs there
          will be situations in which a &#147;sufficient Ontario connection&#148;
          would not be considered by the Commission as relevant to its
          determination to exercise its clause 127(1)3 jurisdiction.21</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">In  other  words,  the  Commission  was  making  a  discretionary
decision that it recognized it had the jurisdiction to make,  and
the Divisional Court erred in holding otherwise.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">      (iii)      The Divisional Court Failed to Consider all  the
Relevant Factors</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[54]  The  Divisional Court also erred by failing  to  appreciate
that  though investor abuse was relevant to the exercise  of  the
Commission&#146;s discretion under s. 127(1)3 of the Act, so too  were
whether  the  transaction had an Ontario  nexus,  whether  Québec
intended to avoid Ontario law and whether the public was  misled.
The   Divisional  Court  focussed  only  on  the  effect  of  the
transaction,  the abusive and unfair treatment  of  the  minority
shareholders,  and ignored the other factors  relied  on  by  the
panel.  The  effect  of a transaction, in this  case  the  unfair
treatment  of  the  minority shareholders, was relevant  and  was
considered  by  the  panel,  but  in  my  view  the  panel  acted
reasonably in considering these other factors as well.
[55] These other factors were relevant in this case because, in
exercising its discretion under s. 127(1)3 of the Act, the
Commission had to consider the likely future harm to the
integrity of Ontario&#146;s capital markets, and the likelihood
Québec&#146;s unfair treatment of the minority shareholders would be
repeated. As the Commission itself said in Canadian Tire22:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">              </font><font size="3"> Moreover, the abuse must be  such that it can be shown to
          the  Commission&#146;s satisfaction that a question of the public
          interest is involved. That almost invariably will mean some
          showing of a broader impact on the capital markets and their
          operation &#133; For the Commission to act, there must be a clear
          showing that the interests of the public marketplace are
          involved.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">And in Re Trend Capital Services Inc.23:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          </font><font size="3">     In our opinion there are two issues which require
          consideration. The first, already mentioned, is whether or not,
          assuming the conduct is objectionable, there is a reasonable
          likelihood it will be repeated. The second is whether or not the
          conduct of the respondents, if objectionable, is such as to bring
          into question the integrity and reputation of the capital markets
          in general. There were the tests which we followed in reaching
          our conclusions.24</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[56]   The  panel  reasonably  considered  that  a  transactional
connection to Ontario was relevant to the exercise of its  public
interest jurisdiction in this case because it was concerned about
&#147;long-arm  regulation&#148;. It was concerned about  the  Commission&#146;s
regulatory reach over a change of control transaction  that  took
place outside Ontario and did not breach Ontario law; and it  was
concerned   about   adversely   affecting   Québec&#146;s   continuing
participation   in  the  Ontario  capital  markets   unless   the
transaction had a sufficient connection to this province.
[57] The panel considered whether the evidence supported a
finding of a sufficient Ontario connection and concluded that it
did not. The Divisional Court disagreed with the panel&#146;s finding,
but in my view that finding was reasonably supported by the
evidence and therefore is not reviewable on appeal. The panel
held (in a passage I repeat for convenience):
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">                    There was not, in our view, a transactional connection
          of the transaction with Ontario. Asbestos was not an Ontario
          corporation and its registered office was in Quebec. Its Canadian
          operations were in Quebec, not in Ontario. The transactions
          resulting in a change in its control took place outside Ontario
          between non-Ontario parties. In the circumstances of this case,
          the facts that Asbestos was a reporting issuer in Ontario, with
          its common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, that a
          substantial number of its  common shares were held by Ontario
          residents, and that that exchange was the principal exchange on
          which those shares traded, are not, in our view, sufficient to
          establish the transactional connection required.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[58]  This  case  is close on the facts to Re  H.E.R.O.,  a  case
dealing with a take-over bid for a British Columbia company  that
was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and that had a number of
minority  shareholders resident in Ontario. In  Re  H.E.R.O.  the
Commission  did find a transactional connection with Ontario  but
in  that  case, the connection to Ontario was stronger than  here
because  the two competing bidders were both based in Ontario.  I
find  no  ground to interfere with the panel&#146;s finding here  that
SNA&#146;s  acquisition  of control of ACL did not have  a  sufficient
transactional connection to Ontario to invoke s. 127(1)3  of  the
Act.
[59] The Commission also reasonably considered whether Québec and
SNA intended to avoid Ontario law as relevant to the exercise of
its discretion under s. 127(1)3. As I have already said, the
purpose of an order under that section is to protect the Ontario
capital markets by removing a participant who, based on past
misconduct, represents a continuing or future threat to the
integrity of these markets. Therefore, the Commission could not
focus only on the effect of the transaction. This transaction was
lawful. The Commission had to consider whether the Québec
Government deliberately attempted to avoid the requirements of
the Act. Indeed, the former Act,25 which applied to this
transaction, recognized the relevance of intention or knowledge.
In s. 91(2), of that Act, the anti-avoidance provisions of the
take-over bid rules, intention to avoid the law was the criterion
that distinguished deemed take-over bids to which the rules
applied from those bids to which the rules did not apply.
[60] Therefore, Québec&#146;s intention was relevant. The Commission
found no intent &#147;to avoid the animating principles behind
Ontario&#146;s take-over bid legislation and rules&#148; and therefore
concluded that &#147;the structuring of the transaction was not
abusive of the integrity of capital markets of this province.&#148;
In my view, the Commission&#146;s finding and</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">its  conclusion are reasonable and, therefore, are not reviewable
on appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[61]   The  respondent  alternatively  submitted  that  even   if
transactional  connection  to  Ontario  and  intention  to  avoid
Ontario  law  were  relevant to the exercise of the  Commission&#146;s
discretion under s. 127(1)3 of the Act, the panel erred by giving
these  factors  too  much weight. The panel certainly  emphasized
these  factors  but  in  doing so I  am  not  persuaded  that  it
exercised  its discretion unreasonably. Therefore,  I  would  not
give effect to the respondent&#146;s alternative position.
[62] Finally, the Commission considered that it could make an
order under s. 127(1)3 if, after SNA&#146;s offer was rejected in
1979, the public was misled by statements from Québec Cabinet
Ministers into believing that a follow-up offer would be made.
That the Commission would consider exercising its public interest
jurisdiction on this basis shows that it did not consider a
transactional connection and an intention to avoid Ontario law to
be, as the Divisional Court contended, jurisdictional barriers or
pre-conditions to an order under s. 127(1)3 of the Act. Although
the Commission viewed the statements of the Québec Ministers as
equivocal, it found that the public was not misled and could not
reasonably rely on the statements. It also found that the market
did not interpret the statements as a promise of a follow-up
offer. These findings, too, were reasonably supported by the
record before the OSC and therefore are not reviewable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">      (iv) The Divisional Court Misconceived the Purpose of a  s.
127(1)3 Order</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[63]  The  Divisional Court&#146;s fourth error is closely related  to
its third error. The Divisional Court misconceived the purpose of
an   order  under  s.  127(1)3  of  the  Act  removing  a  market
participant&#146;s trading exemptions. In focussing only  on  investor
abuse,  the  unfair  treatment of the minority shareholders,  the
Divisional  Court viewed the section as remedial, as a  means  to
give  the  shareholders  what amounts  to  an  oppression  remedy
although  they have never sued for oppression. As I have  already
stated,  the OSC&#146;s public interest jurisdiction is not  remedial,
but  preventive. It is to be exercised to prevent future harm  to
Ontario&#146;s capital markets not to remedy past misconduct.
[64] I therefore conclude that the Commission took into account
relevant factors in the exercise of its discretion not to make an
order under s. 127(1)3. Although it gave great weight to the
absence of a transactional connection and a lack of an intention
to avoid Ontario law, I am not persuaded that in doing so it
exercised its discretion unreasonably. In other words, the
respondent has not persuaded me that the OSC erred in principle,
acted arbitrarily or capriciously or reached an unjust result. I
would therefore set aside the order of the Divisional Court and
restore the order of the OSC.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">C.   The Order of the Divisional Court</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[65] Because I would restore the ruling of the Commission denying
the  respondent relief, it is unnecessary to consider  the  order
made  by the Divisional Court. The appropriateness of that order,
and  even  the  court&#146;s jurisdiction to make  it,  however,  were
thoroughly canvassed by all counsel and I will therefore  briefly
state my views on it.
[66] The Divisional Court actually made three orders. First, it
directed the OSC to order the Québec Government to make a follow-
up offer to the minority shareholders of ACL at a price per share
not less than the price it paid to GD US for voting control of GD
Canada, plus interest at the average prime rate since February
12, 1982. Second, if the Québec Government failed to make a
follow-up offer within 90 days of the Divisional Court&#146;s
decision, it directed the OSC to withdraw all of the exemptions
that allow the Québec Government to participate in the Ontario
capital markets. Third, the Divisional Court directed the OSC to
order the Québec Government to pay all of the respondent&#146;s costs
of the 1994 proceedings before the OSC.
[67] The court&#146;s jurisdiction to make the orders it did must be
found in s. 9(5) of the Securities Act, which provides that on an
appeal the Divisional Court:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">                    &#133; may by its order direct the Commission to make such
          decision or to do such other act as the Commission is authorized
          and empowered to do under this Act or the regulations and as the
          court considers proper, having regard to the material and
          submissions before it and to this Act and the regulations, and
          the Commission shall make such decision or do such act
          accordingly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[68]  In  other words, under s. 9(5) the Divisional Court  cannot
require the OSC to do anything that the OSC itself could  not  do
directly.  The  OSC&#146;s  public  interest  discretion  to  withdraw
exemptions  is prescribed by s.127(1)3 and s. 127(2) of  the  Act
which state:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">          </font><font size="3">          127. (1) Orders in the public interest. &#150; The
          Commission may make one or more of the following orders if in its
          opinion it is in the public interest to make the order or orders:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               &#133;
               </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                     3.    An order that any exemptions
               contained in Ontario securities law do not
               apply to a person or company permanently or
               for such period as is specified in the order.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                (2)   Terms and conditions. &#150; An  order
          under  this  section may be subject  to  such
          terms  and  conditions as the Commission  may
          impose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[69]  One view of the Divisional Court&#146;s first order is  that  it
directed the OSC to order the Québec Government to make a follow-
up  offer to the minority shareholders of ACL. On that view,  the
Divisional  Court had no jurisdiction to make this order  because
the  OSC itself could not make such an order under s. 127 of  the
Act.  An  alternative and more favourable view of the  Divisional
Court&#146;s  first  order, taken together with its second  order,  is
that the Québec Government will lose its trading exemptions until
it  makes a follow-up offer. On this view the making of a follow-
up offer is a term or condition of the s. 127(1)3 order. Once the
condition is satisfied the exemptions will be restored.  On  this
view,  which  I accept, the Divisional Court had the jurisdiction
to  make its first and second orders. The question is whether  it
ought to have made them.
[70] In my view, the Divisional Court should not have made these
orders. Instead it should have remitted the matter to the OSC,
requiring the Commission to exercise its public interest
jurisdiction under s. 127(1)(3) of the Act, but permitting the
Commission to determine which trading exemptions should be
withdrawn, for how long and on what terms. I hold this opinion
for three reasons.
[71] First, these orders went beyond what Commission counsel
asked for before the OSC and beyond what the respondent asked for
in the Divisional Court. Moreover, they were made without giving
any of the parties an opportunity to make submissions on their
appropriateness. Before the OSC, Commission counsel asked only
for an order prohibiting the Québec Government from using the
trading exemptions to make a take-over bid. The Divisional
Court&#146;s order would have the effect of completely expelling the
Québec Government from Ontario&#146;s capital markets unless it made a
follow-up offer. In its factum in the Divisional Court, the
respondent asked either that the Québec Government&#146;s trading
exemptions be withdrawn &#147;for such period and upon such terms as
the Commission may order&#148; or that the Commission reconsider its
decision not to exercise its public interest jurisdiction.
Fairness concerns suggest that the Divisional Court should have
given Québec and SNA an opportunity to argue whether a broader
order than requested was appropriate.
[72] Second, although the Divisional Court may have had the power
to direct the OSC to order the removal of all trading exemptions
until the Québec Government made a follow-up offer, the court
should have remitted the matter to the OSC to decide whether such
an order was appropriate. Whether and on what terms to withdraw
exemptions in the public interest requires specialized expertise.
Indeed, the Commission&#146;s jurisdiction to regulate the capital
markets in the public interest is an important part of its
statutory mandate. Neither the Divisional Court, nor this court,
has the securities or the regulatory expertise to make an
appropriate order under s. 127(1)3 of the Act.
[73] Third, having decided to direct the OSC how to exercise its
public interest jurisdiction, the Divisional Court then failed to
consider factors that the OSC would have considered had it been
given the opportunity to do so. The Divisional Court failed to
consider the effect of its orders on the reputation and integrity
of Ontario&#146;s capital markets; it failed to consider the business
and regulatory costs of denying Québec&#146;s participation in this
province&#146;s capital markets, a participation that raises billions
of dollars per year; and it failed to consider whether these
costs of removing Québec&#146;s exemptions would be proportional to
the regulatory objectives sought to be realized by a s. 127(1)3
order. All of these factors were arguably relevant to the
exercise of the Commission&#146;s discretion. Yet, the Divisional
Court took into account only the unfair treatment of the minority
shareholders. It undoubtedly did so because, as I have already
indicated, it viewed a s. 127(1)3 order as remedial instead of as
a regulatory tool. It used the OSC&#146;s public interest jurisdiction
not as a means of protecting Ontario&#146;s capital markets against
harmful future conduct, but as a means of providing a remedy for
what it perceived to be past misconduct and as a means of giving
the minority shareholders what they wanted but never sued for, a
follow-up offer.
[74] For these reasons, in my view, the Divisional Court&#146;s first
two orders were inappropriate. Having concluded that the OSC
erred by failing to exercise its public interest jurisdiction,
the Divisional Court should have referred the matter back to the
OSC and left it to the Commission to determine what trading
exemptions of the Québec Government were to be withdrawn and for
how long and on what terms.
[75] Finally, as the respondent acknowledged, the Divisional
Court had no jurisdiction to direct the OSC to order the Québec
Government to pay the respondent&#146;s costs of the proceedings
before the Commission. The OSC itself does not have the power to
award these costs and therefore under s. 9(5) of the Act, the
Divisional Court does not have the power to direct the Commission
to do so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">D.   Conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[76]  I  would  allow the appeals, set aside  the  order  of  the
Divisional  Court and in its place order that CETAMS&#146;  appeal  be
dismissed.  In the light of the history of these proceedings  and
the  Commission&#146;s finding that the actions of Québec and SNA were
abusive of and unfair to the minority shareholders, I would  make
no  order  for  costs, either in this court or in the  Divisional
Court.
