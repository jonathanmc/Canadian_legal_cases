    <pre>CATZMAN J.A:
</pre>
    <pre>The background and the appeal</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Ronald and Christina Petit set fire to their house.  It was
almost completely destroyed.  They were charged with arson. Bail
was set at $50,000 cash.  Ronald Petit raised the money from two
sources: he sold an expensive car that he owned for $45,000 and
added $5,000 in cash, the source of which was not disclosed.  He
deposited the $50,000, and he and Christina were released pending
trial.
[2]  The Petits, whose house had a large mortgage, carried a
policy of homeowner's insurance with Chubb Insurance Company of
Canada.  Under the standard mortgage clause in the insurance
policy, Chubb was required to pay the mortgagee regardless of the
Petits' deliberate acts of arson.  Chubb paid off the mortgagee
and took an assignment of the mortgagee's position. It then sold
the property under power of sale, but the sale realized only
about a third of the amount it had had to pay the mortgagee.
[3]  The Petits were convicted of the charges against them.  They
were sentenced to terms of imprisonment: Ronald, for 3 years; and
Christina, for 1 year.  A compensation order of over $460,000 was
made under the Criminal Code in favour of Chubb.
[4]  Following conviction and sentence, Ronald sought to recover
the $50,000 he had deposited for bail.  A number of creditors
laid claim to the money, including Revenue Canada, to which he
owed over $66,000 for arrears of income tax.  Because of the
competing claims, the $50,000 was paid into court under an
interpleader order.
[5]    An application was then brought for payment of the money
out of court.  By the time the application was heard, only two
creditors asserted a claim to the bail money: Chubb  and Revenue
Canada.  Each had filed with the sheriff a writ of seizure and
sale in respect of its debt.  Each took the position that its
claim had priority over the claim of the other.  Since each was
owed more than the total amount in court, the creditor
establishing priority for its claim would take all of the money
and the other would receive nothing.
[6]    Dandie J. held that Chubb had priority and was entitled to
all of the money in court.  Revenue Canada now appeals from that
order.</pre>
    <pre>The decision of Dandie J.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It was common ground between Chubb and Revenue Canada that,
by virtue of Crown prerogative, the claim of the Crown prevails
where its claim comes into competition with a claim of equal
degree owing to a subject: The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia
(1885), 11 S.C.R. 1 at 10; Household Realty Corporation Limited
et al. v. A.-G. Can., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 423 at 426; Re Marten;
Royal Bank of Canada v. the Queen  (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 399 (Div.
Ct.) at 402.  The issue, therefore, was framed by Dandie J. as
follows:
               Is the claim by Chubb, who is a victim of the crime of arson
          in that it paid substantial insurance monies to the mortgagee of
          the accused Petit's residence as a result of a fire set by Petit,
          superior rather than equal to the claim of the Crown, thereby
          entitling Chubb to the monies presently paid into court?
          [emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[8]  He relied on three cases in which &quot;the Crown's prerogative
or the rights of a trustee in bankruptcy were held to not be
available against certain victims of crime&quot;: In re Carson (1924),
4 C.B.R. 683 (Ont. App. Div.); Blackhawk Downs Inc. v. Arnold
(1972), 17 C.B.R. (N.S.) 284 (Ont. S.C.); and Re Kolari (1981),
39 C.B.R. (N.S.) 129 (Ont. Dist. Ct.). From these cases, he
concluded:
               I find that Chubb being a victim of Petit's arson falls
          within the designation a creditor and much more1; I further find
          that the $50,000 fund in question would not have come into
          existence but for Petit's crime of arson, of which Chubb was a
          victim.  Accordingly, I find that Chubb has an interest higher in
          degree than that of Revenue Canada and direct that the balance of
          the monies paid into Court be paid out to Chubb.
          
</pre>
    <pre>&quot;Higher in degree&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In my view, none of the three cases on which Dandie J.
relied supports the conclusion that Chubb&#146;s claim was &#147;higher in
degree&#148; than that of Revenue Canada.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   In re Carson</pre>
    <pre>[10]      In re Carson was a contest between an executor of an
estate and the trustee in bankruptcy of his brother and co-
executor, who had stolen money from the bank account of their
deceased father's estate and had used the money to carry on his
business. On the eve of his bankruptcy, whether from &quot;fear of
prosecution or to cover up his breach of trust or a mere
voluntary payment to favour his father's estate at the expense of
his general creditors&quot;2, he withdrew money from his business and
repaid the sums he had taken from the estate.  His trustee in
bankruptcy sought repayment of those sums as fraudulent
preferences.
[11] Fisher J. agreed that, once the stolen moneys had become
intermingled with other money belonging to the miscreant
executor, the relationship between him and his father's estate
had become that of creditor and debtor.  Fisher J. further found
that, because the miscreant executor had taken money belonging to
his creditors and paid them to himself and his co-executor within
three months preceding his bankruptcy, the payments constituted a
fraudulent preference and the trustee was entitled to an order
for their return.
[12] On appeal, that order was reversed.   Speaking for the
court,  Middleton J.A. found that, although the beneficiary of
the fund from which a defrauding trustee steals was &quot;a creditor
[of the thief] in some sense&quot;3, he was not a &quot;creditor&quot; within
the meaning of the provision of the Bankruptcy Act relating to
fraudulent preferences.  He said, at pp. 684-685:
          What, then is the situation when the debtor
          does not obtain credit in the usual way, but
          illegally takes the property of another and
          uses it in his business?
          That other has a claim as a creditor for
          which he can rank, but his situation is
          widely different from those who become
          creditors of their own volition and for their
          own profit. He is a creditor in invitum much
          against his own will, and with no chance of
          gain, and so it is said he is &quot;a creditor and
          much more&quot;. &#133; if the debtor, moved by his own
          instincts of propriety and his fear of
          punishment for his rascality, makes good the
          trust fund taken, he has always been regarded
          as doing something quite other than
          preferring a creditor contrary to the
          provisions of the bankruptcy statutes. 4</pre>
    <pre>[13] Unlike Carson, the present case involves no bankruptcy, no
trustee in bankruptcy and no suggestion of a fraudulent
preference. The $50,000 in issue was not money Petit stole from
Chubb. Nor, indeed, is it accurate to say that &#147;the $50,000 fund
in question would not have come into existence but for Petit&#146;s
crime of arson, of which Chubb was a victim&#148; 5 except in the
paralogical sense that, if Petit had not set fire to his own
house, he would not have been charged with arson and would not
have had to raise $50,000 bail. But while Chubb was admittedly a
victim of Petit&#146;s crime of arson, Chubb was not a victim of theft
of, or any other criminal dealing with, the $50,000. Chubb is not
a &#147;creditor in invitum, &#133; a creditor and much more&#148;  of the kind
depicted by Middleton J.A. in Carson.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Blackhawk Downs Inc. v. Arnold</pre>
    <pre>[14] Blackhawk Downs was a contest between a trustee in
bankruptcy and victims of fraud to whom restitution had been
offered and paid into court pursuant to court order.   Before the
money could be paid out to the victims, the convicted fraud made
an assignment in bankruptcy.  His trustee in bankruptcy contended
that the money in court was property of the bankrupt to be used
for the benefit of creditors.  Alternatively, he argued that
payment of the money to the victims of the fraud would constitute
a fraudulent preference under the Bankruptcy Act.
[15] Lacourciere J.  rejected the trustee's claim.  Following In
re Carson,
he said, at p. 287:
          &#133; there is something more than a debtor-
          creditor relationship between Naft and
          Blackhawk; the latter had no opportunity to
          investigate Naft's credit and is merely a
          creditor in invitum, being the involuntary
          victim of a fraud who is entitled to retain
          the equitable ownership of all funds
          traceable to the fraud.  This principle was
          recognized in Ontario in Merchants Express
          Co. v. Morton (1868), 15 Gr. 274, as well as
          in Re Carson (1924), 4 C.B.R. 683 at 684
          (C.A.).
          
</pre>
    <pre>[16] He concluded, at p. 289:
          In my view, it would be clearly inequitable
          to allow the repayment to accrue to the
          advantage of Naft in facilitating the
          settlement of his general debts.  Restitution
          was considered by the court as a favourable
          factor, because of the attitude of remorse
          demonstrated, and being a repayment to the
          victims of his crime.  Such moneys should not
          be used in the discharge of the bankrupt's
          general debts, as this would clearly be an
          injustice to the persons aggrieved for whose
          benefit the moneys were repaid.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[17] Again, unlike Blackhawk Downs, the present case involves no
bankruptcy, no trustee in bankruptcy and no suggestion of a
fraudulent preference, nor can the $50,000 deposited for bail be
traced to Petit's fraud. Chubb is not a &quot;person aggrieved for
whose benefit&quot; the $50,000 was paid into court.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   Re Kolari</pre>
    <pre>[18] Re Kolari was a contest between a trust company from which a
senior employee had stolen money and the Minister of National
Revenue for income tax assessed on the amount stolen. The stolen
money had been intermingled with salary cheques paid to the
employee and her husband. The fund claimed by both the trust
company and the Minister of National Revenue represented the
proceeds of bank accounts and the sale of the matrimonial home
and its contents, into which the money stolen could be traced.
[19] Stortini D.C.J. held that the trust company was entitled to
the entire fund in priority to the Minister of National Revenue.
His conclusion rested upon his finding, at p. 135, that the trust
company
               is not an ordinary execution creditor of Kolari.  In equity
          the stolen money is held to be the subject-matter of a fiduciary
          relationship.  This is apart from and in addition to the fact
          that Kolari was at all material times the servant and agent of
          [the trust company] in a fiduciary position.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The fact that the stolen money had been intermingled with
money that was not stolen caused Stortini D.C.J. some concern.
He concluded, however,  that the trust company was entitled to
the proceeds of sale of the home and contents, on the basis of
the failure to &quot;satisfy the onus encumbent on the fiduciary to
identify with reasonable precision the financial contribution
made by Mrs. Kolari toward the purchase of the home&quot;6.  He
concluded, further, that the trust company was entitled to the
balances in the bank accounts, on the basis of the application of
the &quot;first out&quot; principle and the onus of establishing
contribution, from which he found on the evidence that &quot;the
balance of Mrs. Kolari's money in the three accounts now in court
is charged with the equitable proprietary interest of [the trust
company]&quot;7.
[21] Re Kolari rested upon principles of tracing and concepts of
trust that do not arise in the present case.  As Mr. Lester
acknowledged in argument on behalf of Chubb, the $50,000 in the
present case cannot be traced, in whole or part, to the
destruction by fire of the Petit home, nor  can it be said to be
impressed with a trust in Chubb's favour.  The $50,000 that Petit
raised for bail was made up of $45,000 realized on the sale of an
automobile and $5,000 in cash.  Nothing in the material before
the court indicates the source of the $5,000, but there is no
suggestion of any connection between that money and the house,
the mortgage or the fire.  There is, in short, no such link
between Chubb and the fund it claims as there was between</pre>
    <pre>          the beneficiaries of the estate and the money restored
     to the bank account by the miscreant executor in Carson;</pre>
    <pre>           the victims of fraud and the money paid into court by
     way of restitution in Blackhawk Downs; and</pre>
    <pre>          the trust company and the proceeds of funds stolen by
     its employee in Kolari.</pre>
    <pre>[22] If Chubb's claim is to succeed, it must be on some basis
other than that found to exist in the three cases on which Dandie
J. relied in support of the order under appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</pre>
    <pre>[23] In an alternative submission, Mr. Lester argued that Chubb
was entitled to assert a constructive trust over the $50,000
based on a fiduciary duty owing by Petit and breach of that duty.
Petit was said to be in breach of his fiduciary duty to his
insurer and his mortgagee in destroying property which Chubb had
contracted to insure and over which the mortgagee (in whose shoes
Chubb now stands) held a substantial mortgage.
[24] The short answer to this submission is that Petit owed no
fiduciary duty to Chubb either in its capacity as insurer or as
assignee of the mortgagee.  There is authority in this court
against both of these propositions.  The fact that an insurance
contract is one of utmost good faith does not mean that it gives
rise to a general fiduciary relationship: Plaza Fiberglass
Manufacturing Ltd. v. Cardinal Insurance Co. (1994), 18 O.R. (3d)
663 (C.A.) at 669.  Similarly, except for some limited purposes
inapplicable to the present case, the relationship between
mortgagor and mortgagee is not of a fiduciary character and
neither is a trustee for the other: Malahide Developments Ltd. v.
Richard Bennett Developments (Sarnia) Ltd. (1982), 35 O.R. (2d)
373 (C.A.) at  376.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[25] It follows from the foregoing that Chubb stands in no higher
position than Revenue Canada as a creditor of Ronald Petit.
Chubb and Revenue Canada are creditors of equal degree and, as
such, the claim of Revenue Canada must prevail.
[26] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order
of Dandie J. and substitute in its place an order that the money
paid into court under the interpleader order be paid to Revenue
Canada.  Revenue Canada is entitled to its costs, payable
forthwith after their assessment, of the application before
Dandie J. and of the appeal.
