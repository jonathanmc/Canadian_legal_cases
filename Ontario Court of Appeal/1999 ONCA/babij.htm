</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Rita DeFaveri (&#147;the wife&#148;) appeals from two judgments
arising out of her separation and divorce from Wm. Babij (&#147;the
husband&#148;). In appeal C29199 the wife raises two issues. The first
issue concerns the equalization payment and a mortgage placed on
the matrimonial home after separation; the second issue concerns
support for the wife. The mortgage in question is the subject of
the second appeal C30283 involving the Toronto Dominion Bank
(&#147;the Bank&#148;). In that appeal, the wife is asking that the
mortgage be set aside on the basis that she did not receive
independent legal advice prior to entering into the mortgage and
guarantee for repayment.

[2]  The couple married in 1971 and separated in May 1992, after
approximately 22 years of marriage. On the date of separation or
the valuation date, the home, which was registered in the wife&#146;s
name, was free and clear of any mortgage. Following the
separation, in April 1993, the wife placed a mortgage on the
matrimonial home and received proceeds of $140,000. She gave this
money to the husband and he paid down his line of credit at the
Bank. The line of credit reflected a debt owed by the husband to
Revenue Canada for arrears of taxes in the amount of $140,500
incurred during 1992 and 1993. On July 31, 1995, the wife
executed a replacement mortgage in the amount of $168,000. The
wife received $10,000 of these funds. The balance of the funds
was given to the husband. He undertook, pursuant to an interim
separation agreement, to pay the monthly payments on the mortgage
while he was living in the matrimonial home after separation.
During this time, the husband paid no occupation rent. At the
date of trial the amount owing by the wife on the mortgage was
$162,000.

[3]  As of the date of separation the property of the couple as
found by the trial judge was as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                              Husband        Wife

    <pre>               Law Practice   14,046         -----
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subtotal       35,594         238,610
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  As indicated earlier, at the date of separation, the husband
had a debt owing to Revenue Canada of $140,500. The trial judge
did not, however, enter the amount of the debt in the husband&#146;s
column in performing the calculation of the equalization claim.
Instead, the trial judge took the figure for the post separation
amount of the debt and equalized it. In so doing he erred. The
Family Law Act requires the financial snapshot to be taken as at
the date of separation. In addition, debts are the responsibility
of the person who incurred them and are not equalized. The
equalization takes place within the context of the equalization
calculation.

[5]  As a result the calculation should have been:
          </pre>
    <pre>                              Husband        Wife
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subtotal:      35,594         238,610
          </pre>
    <pre>               debts:        140,500             0
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subtotal:     -104,906        238,610
          </pre>
    <pre>               Equalization:  0              238,610
          </pre>
    <pre>               238,610 divided by 2 = 119,305.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The amount of the equalization payment
          owing by the wife to the husband is therefore
          $119,305 or in round figures $119,000.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  A debt in the amount of $50,000 was claimed to be owing to
the wife&#146;s sister. The wife and her sister testified that the
debt was owing as at the date of separation. The husband claimed
the debt had been forgiven ten years earlier. The debt itself was
not evidenced in writing. The trial judge expressly did not
determine if the debt had been forgiven and declined to recognize
the debt in calculating the equalization payment and we would not
disturb his finding in this regard.

[7]  The husband advanced to the wife just over $72,000 after
their separation and the wife is responsible to repay this amount
to the husband. The wife contends that these amounts were used
for &#147;family&#148; expenses because she came over to the house to look
after the children each day after the couple separated. The trial
judge viewed the amount as &#147;voluntary&#148; support for the wife. The
amounts were paid on the assumption the husband would be buying
the wife&#146;s interest in the home. That is not the case and the
husband is entitled to repayment of this amount.

[8]  The husband is responsible to repay to the wife the amount
he received from her following their separation or $168,000-
$10,000=$158,000 less mortgage payments made by him of  $6,000 to
the date of trial or $152,000.

[9]  The post separation calculation is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Wife owes to husband $119,000 + $72,000=$191,000.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Husband owes to wife $152,000.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The difference owing by wife to husband
          is $39,500.</pre>
    <pre>
[10] We now turn to the issue of support. There are three
children of the marriage, born respectively on August 16, 1981,
May 10, 1984 and February 10, 1986. The husband has assumed the
responsibility for financial support of the children. The
husband&#146;s income ranged between $250,000 in 1992 and $75,000 in
1996.

[11] The wife was a teacher at the time of marriage but she
became a full time homemaker when the couple&#146;s first child was
born in August 1981. She attempted to resume her teaching career
when the youngest of the three children, born in February 1986,
began grade one. At that time, she could only obtain occasional
employment as a supply teacher. She continued in the position of
a supply teacher and also became a fitness instructor.

[12] The trial judge found that the marriage had been a long term
traditional one and that the wife was entitled to support. He
ordered spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month
beginning February 1, 1998 for one year from which the wife
appeals.

[13] Counsel for the wife admits that she does not presently need
support. She is presently earning $57,000 replacing a supply
teacher who is ill. Her employment situation is, however,
uncertain. In the event that the wife is unable to obtain
employment to the extent of her current involvement she will need
support. Accordingly, it is submitted that the trial judge erred
in making a time limited order of support.

[14] The wife also appealed the trial judge&#146;s refusal to make any
award for support for loss of economic opportunity. The trial
judge&#146;s reasons for refusing the claim were twofold. He was not
satisfied with the efforts made by the wife to obtain employment
following the separation and held that she should have applied
for a full time teaching position in Espanola, about an hour&#146;s
drive away from her home. In addition the evidence presented in
support of the loss of economic opportunity was a simple loss of
wage calculation and the trial judge held that this was woefully
inadequate.

[15] We agree with the trial judge that the evidence in support
of the claim for loss of economic opportunity was not presented
in the manner it should have been. There was no evidence,
however, that if the wife had applied for the position in
Espanola she would have been successful. Nor do we think that in
the circumstances of this case that she should have been obliged
to do so.

[16] In our opinion, the reasons given by the trial judge do not
provide an adequate foundation for his conclusions that the wife
was not making satisfactory efforts to support herself. There was
evidence on which a finding of loss of economic opportunity
should have been made. The difficulty was calculating the amount.
There is a paucity of evidence on which to base an award for loss
of economic opportunity. In addition, the contingency that the
wife will require support in the future is also a factor to be
considered in making a lump sum award of support. A consideration
in favour of the husband is that he is providing financial
support to the children, who are in his care, and he is not
claiming support on their behalf from the wife.

[17] Having regard to all of the circumstances of the parties, it
seems to us that it is appropriate to award a lump sum of $39,000
on account of loss of economic opportunity and support. It will
be readily apparent that this is the same figure owing by the
wife to the husband under the property calculation and that,
therefore, no exchange of funds need take place between the
parties.

[18] We would allow the appeal in C29199, delete the order of the
trial judge providing for the sale of the matrimonial home and
substitute an order to reflect these reasons. We will await
written submissions from the parties before making our order with
respect to costs.

[19] As to the appeal the wife brings in her action against the
Bank and her former husband, it too must fail.

[20] The appellant&#146;s claims against the husband concerning the
mortgage on the matrimonial home were the subject of extensive
canvass in the Family Law Act litigation. The appellant is
precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from litigating these
issues afresh in this action.

[21] Her claims against the Bank were appropriately dismissed by
Pardu J. It is plain and obvious that they would fail at trial.
There was an evidentiary basis for the finding below that the
appellant did receive independent legal advice in connection with
the mortgage on the matrimonial home. In any event, the mere lack
of independent legal advice does not invalidate a transaction in
the absence of proof of non est factum, unconscionability, fraud,
misrepresentation or undue influence. None of these is present
here. The Bank is entitled to look to the matrimonial home as
security for its loan.

[22] Appeal C30283 is dismissed with costs.
