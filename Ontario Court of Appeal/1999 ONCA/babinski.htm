    <pre>On appeal from conviction for first degree murder by a court
composed of Moldaver J. and a jury on May 26, 1993.</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]       This is an appeal by Richard Babinski from his
conviction for first degree murder on a new trial ordered by this
court, and upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, after a
successful Crown appeal.  The order for a new trial was upheld on
two grounds: (1) the failure of the trial judge to instruct the
jury on &#147;consciousness of guilt&#148;; and (2) the failure of the
trial judge to refer the jury to evidence that could support the
testimony of two jailhouse informants to whom the appellant
allegedly made inculpatory statements.  The reasons for judgment
of this court and the Supreme Court of Canada are now reported at
(1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 187 and (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 286
respectively.  This court, at p. 190, said the following about
the error with respect to the jailhouse informants:
          </pre>
    <pre>            In some cases the failure to draw a jury's attention to
          evidence which could support an unsavoury witness's testimony may
          not be a serious error. In this case, however, where the
          witness's testimony, if accepted, could amount to important
          circumstantial evidence, it seems to us that fairness to the
          prosecution required that the trial judge draw to the attention
          of the jury &quot;by way of illustration an item or items of evidence
          which they may draw upon as confirmation of the witness's
          evidence&quot;. In the particular circumstances of this case it is our
          opinion that the failure to do so constituted an error in law.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[2]       At the new trial before Moldaver J. and a jury only one
of the two unsavoury witnesses testified.  The appellant now
seeks to introduce fresh evidence to demonstrate that this
witness, L.,1 is thoroughly unreliable.  This evidence also tends
to demonstrate that L. was not telling the truth when he claimed
that the appellant made the inculpatory statements.  In view of
the importance of this evidence, for the reasons that follow, I
would admit the fresh evidence, allow the appeal, set aside the
conviction and order a new trial.  I will also briefly deal with
the other grounds of appeal raised by the appellant, including
the charge to the jury with respect to L. and the charge with
respect to consciousness of guilt.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]       The case against the appellant, although
circumstantial, was formidable.  The deceased, Eva Mead, met the
appellant in 1987 when the appellant lived in the same apartment
building in the west end of Toronto as she and her husband.  In
early 1987, Mead&#146;s husband died in an accident.  It was the
theory of the Crown that thereafter the appellant became
infatuated with Ms. Mead.  In February 1988, the appellant was
charged with sexually assaulting her.  The appellant was released
on bail on this charge with terms that he not contact Ms. Mead
and that he observe a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m
except for the purposes of employment.  These terms figure in the
Crown&#146;s case against the appellant.
[4]       Sometime in the early morning hours of Sunday, October
16, 1988, the appellant broke into Ms. Mead&#146;s apartment.  After
he left, Ms. Mead fled to a neighbour&#146;s apartment and the two of
them went to obtain the assistance of Mead&#146;s boyfriend.  On
Tuesday, October 18, 1988, Ms. Mead reported the break-in to the
police.  That evening, police officers installed recording
equipment on her telephone and they stayed at her apartment,
hoping that the appellant would contact her.  The officers
described Mead as extremely upset and terrified.  The following
day, October 19th, the officers arranged for Ms. Mead to come
home from work at the lunch hour and place a call to the
appellant.  During this conversation (and against the officers&#146;
advice) Mead revealed to the appellant where she worked.  She
then returned to work.  Over the next several hours, the police
attempted to locate the appellant to arrest him for break and
enter and breach of recognizance.  They could not find him.  One
of the officers contacted Ms. Mead and advised her that he may
have to escort her home.  Plans to do so were never finalized.
On the evidence at trial, it would have been open to the jury to
find that Ms. Mead was anxious to return home so that she could
take her son to his hockey practice at 5:30 p.m.  Ms. Mead was
last seen alive sometime before 6:00 p.m. when she stopped for
gas at a service station near the town of Bolton, a half-hour
drive from Toronto.  The service station attendant saw another
person, possibly a male, in the car.  Ms. Mead&#146;s body was
discovered some seven months later, near the appellant&#146;s place of
employment, in circumstances that I will set out after
summarizing the evidence of the appellant&#146;s movements during the
relevant period.
[5]       On Monday, October 17, 1988, the appellant went to the
home of Henry Hajdinjak in Scarborough, in the east end of
Toronto, in response to an advertisement for the sale of a 1978
Mercury Cougar.  The appellant purchased the car and drove off
leaving his Honda Civic parked in Hajdinjak&#146;s driveway.  On
Wednesday, October 19th (the date Mead disappeared), the
appellant returned to Hajdinjak&#146;s home between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m.
because the Cougar was not running properly. Hajdinjak worked on
the Cougar for some time but was unable to fix it.  The appellant
said he was in a hurry and he eventually left Hajdinjak's
sometime between 3:40 and 3:50 p.m.
[6]       The appellant was an employee at the Stowe and Davis
plant in Mississauga, a city to the west of Toronto.  His shift
ran from 3:30 p.m. on October 19th to 2:00 a.m. on October 20th.
The appellant did not report for work.  However, at midnight, the
appellant went to the plant and spoke to another employee.  This
employee described the appellant as looking &#147;as if he robbed the
bank&#148;.  He asked the appellant what had happened and the
appellant said that it was better if he did not know.  The
appellant asked the employee to tell their supervisor that he had
seen the appellant in the parking lot at 3:00 p.m. and that the
appellant had said he was not coming to work.  The appellant also
asked the employee to telephone him later and let him know
whether the police or their supervisor were asking about him.
The employee called the appellant&#146;s home at about 3:00 a.m. on
October 20th and told him that no one was looking for him.  This
was not true.  The employee was aware that the police had been
looking for the appellant since the afternoon of October 19th.
[7]       The police went to the appellant&#146;s apartment and banged
on his door on the morning of Thursday, October 20, 1988.  The
appellant testified that he was home at this time.  He saw
through the peephole in the door that it was the police and he
did not open the door because he was worried that the police were
there to arrest him for the break and enter of Mead&#146;s apartment.
After the police left, the appellant telephoned his uncle and
asked him to provide a false alibi for the weekend (when the
break and enter was committed) and the previous evening.  The
appellant asked his uncle to say he was with him at approximately
6:30 or 7:00 p.m. on October 19, 1988.  The appellant&#146;s professed
reason for seeking the false alibi for the previous evening was
because he had been in breach of his curfew.  It will be
recalled, however, that the curfew did not start until 10:00 p.m.
This evidence is important to the appellant&#146;s appeal concerning
the direction on consciousness of guilt.
[8]       The appellant testified that after leaving Hajdinjak&#146;s
on the afternoon of October 19th he was angry because the Cougar
was not working so he decided not to go to work.  Instead he
decided to visit his uncle, who lived north of Huntsville.  The
appellant purchased a bottle of rum, which he consumed on the
drive north.  Just 45 minutes from his uncle&#146;s home, the
appellant stopped driving because he was intoxicated.  He pulled
off the road and fell asleep.  When he awoke he decided to return
to Toronto.  He denied stopping at the Stowe and Davis plant or
speaking to the employee at the plant or on the telephone.
[9]       After he called his uncle for the false alibi, the
appellant drove to the police station to report, pursuant to the
bail order on the sexual assault.  He was arrested later that day
for the break-in at Mead&#146;s apartment.  At the time of the arrest,
the appellant had some scratches on his face.  It is unclear in
the evidence whether he had those scratches prior to the
disappearance.  The appellant testified that he received the
scratches while working on his car on the morning of October
20th.  He denied abducting and killing Ms. Mead. The appellant
has remained in custody since his arrest.
[10] In February 1989, the appellant was transferred to the North
Bay jail to deal with outstanding charges in that jurisdiction.
In the jail he was re-acquainted with L., an inmate he had known
for at least seventeen years.  L. has a substantial criminal
record, including convictions for crimes of dishonesty such as
theft, fraud and public mischief.  At the trial before Moldaver
J., L. testified that the appellant began to work in the kitchen
with him.  According to L., the appellant told him that he had
committed the &#147;perfect crime&#148;.  A short time later, the appellant
was reading a newspaper in which there was a story about the
disappearance of Ms. Mead and the offer of a reward for
information about her whereabouts.  L. testified that the
appellant said: &#147;They must&#151;don&#146;t have too much on me because
they&#146;re advertising in the newspaper.&#148;  The appellant then
laughed.
[11] L. testified that he did not disclose this information to
obtain the reward or any other favours from the authorities.  In
examination in chief, he explained that he came forward with his
information for the following reason:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Well, if nobody did, you know, like the little boy does have
          no family any more so&#133;  I was just somebody with&#151;that would ever
          happen to me, I wish somebody would come forward also, you know.
          It was just good on my part, I figured.</pre>
    <pre>[12] On March 1, 1989, the appellant was transferred from the
North Bay jail back to the Toronto Detention Centre.  On March 3,
1989, L. met with a North Bay police officer.  This interview
forms part of the fresh evidence and I will return to it later.
A short time later, L. was transferred down to Toronto and
incarcerated with the appellant at different times during the
balance of 1989.  According to L., the appellant made several
more inculpatory statements including: &#147;Don&#146;t worry Frenchie,
they&#146;ll never find the body.&#148;  Moldaver J. excluded this
statement and other Toronto statements because of a violation of
the appellant&#146;s rights under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.
[13] The appellant admitted knowing L. and reading aloud from a
newspaper with a story about Mead&#146;s disappearance in it.  He
denied making the inculpatory statements.
[14] On May 19, 1989, Ms. Mead&#146;s body was discovered in an
undeveloped area near the Stowe and Davis parking lot.  Her body
was badly decomposed.  She was unclothed and wire had been used
to tie her legs and arms.  It would be open to the jury to find
that this wire had come from the Stowe and Davis plant and from a
piece of machinery to which the appellant had access.  The cause
of death appeared to be strangulation.  The expert evidence was
that the state of the remains was consistent with the body having
been outside any time starting from June of 1988 to January of
1989.</pre>
    <pre>THE FRESH EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[15] On May 26, 1993, the appellant was convicted following the
second trial.  He appealed his conviction to this court.  On
December 12, 1995, shortly before the first scheduled date for
the appeal, L. contacted the appellant&#146;s trial counsel, Richard
Prendiville, and said that he wanted to talk about his evidence
at the appellant&#146;s two trials.  On December 27, 1995, Mr.
Prendiville and a law student went to Cowansville penitentiary to
interview L.  In the interview, L. recanted his trial testimony
that the appellant had said that he had committed the perfect
crime.  He reaffirmed the appellant&#146;s remark about the police not
having much on him if they had to advertise.  He also recanted
the statement, excluded at the second trial: &#147;Don&#146;t worry
Frenchie.  They&#146;ll never find her.&#148;
[16] L. told Mr. Prendiville that one of the Toronto
investigating officers had instructed him on how to testify in
order to strengthen the case against the appellant.  He also
alleged that the officer and a Crown attorney had coached him
before he testified and that the police had agreed to help him
get out of jail and into the witness relocation programme.  He
claimed he was recanting in order to clear his conscience.
[17] After Mr. Prendiville left the penitentiary, L. contacted
his own lawyer and resiled from his recantations and withdrew his
imputations of misconduct on the part of Crown counsel and the
investigating officer.  This lawyer told L. to contact the
police.  On January 2, 1996, L. called the investigating officer
and told him that he had recanted his earlier testimony.  L. told
him he recanted because he had received a threatening note from
another inmate.  He called the officer the following day and read
the note to him over the telephone.  L. claimed that an inmate
named Levesque gave him the note.  In the note, which is unsigned
but purports to come from a good friend of the appellant, L. is
told to contact Mr. Prendiville prior to the appeal and say that
he fabricated his testimony.  In the note, the friend threatens
that his home and his mother&#146;s home will be burned down if he
does not recant.  The note concludes:
          </pre>
    <pre>               PS.  Don&#146;t get the Pigs involve in this you know what happen
          in Frontenac it can Happen in Cowansville too.</pre>
    <pre>[18] L. told the officer that the reference to Frontenac was an
incident in which an inmate stabbed him and said: &#147;This is for
Richard&#148; (meaning the appellant).  L. claimed that as a result of
this stabbing he escaped from Frontenac.  On January 3, 1996, L.
turned over the note to Quebec police officers and swore a
statutory declaration attesting to its authenticity.
[19] At the request of Crown counsel, Staff Sergeant Wilson of
the O.P.P. was assigned to conduct an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding L.&#146;s recantation and his allegation of
police and Crown counsel misconduct.  In the course of this
investigation, L. was interviewed on several occasions and
examined under oath.  In addition, the note was submitted for
handwriting analysis.  Through the various interviews and the
examination, L. made numerous inconsistent statements about the
note, the stabbing at Frontenac and the reasons for his escape.
As I understand it, for the purposes of this appeal, Crown
counsel now accepts that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   L. forged the note.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   There was no inmate named Levesque
          at Cowansville during the relevant time.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   L. was not stabbed at Frontenac
          Institution.</pre>
    <pre>[20] In February 1996, Staff Sergeant Wilson, as part of his
investigation into L.&#146;s recantation, spoke to Constable Belanger
of the North Bay police.  As a result, Belanger provided Wilson
with a tape recording of the conversation he had with L. on March
3, 1989.  Wilson also obtained notes of conversations L. had with
various members of the North Bay police department in which L.
offered to provide them with information about a local drug
smuggling ring in exchange for money and assistance with his
criminal charges.  None of this material had been disclosed to
defence counsel prior to the first or second trial.  The most
important material is the tape recording of the March 3, 1989
conversation with Belanger.  A portion of that conversation is as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Belanger:    What did he talk to you?  Did he talk to you about
          the body?
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.:       Yeah. Well, I got a few ideas
          where he was but, ah &#133; not where he was
          sitting with her and all that, but where she
          might be.  She could be ah &#133; in the Keswick
          area, the Sutton area or the Huntsville area.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: Did he tell you he killed her?
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        No, he didn't say anything
          like that.  Too many people around.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: And then &#133; when you go back
          down, probably hook up with him again?
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        Yeah, he wants to.  He gave me
          his phone number.  His address, ah &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: Well, he's doing time right
          now?
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        I know.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: When you get back down there,
          you'll probably be in the same area with him
          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        Yeah.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: &#133; working.  Be cool.  Try to
          see what you can get out of him but be very
          cool.
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        Maybe before that.  Well,
          that's what I've been doing here.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Belanger: Yeah.  Stay cool and still
          hear, you know, there's still a person out
          there who took his bribe.  (I/a) He might say
          they'll never find her.  Cool.  If you get
          that, you make a phone call to your sister.
          </pre>
    <pre>               L.        Yeah.  Call from the PC down
          there.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21] Thus, on March 3, 1989, after he claimed that the appellant
made the two inculpatory remarks, L. made no mention of them to
the police.  Further, the officer made a suggestion as to what
the appellant might say.  L. later attributed that remark to the
appellant.
[22] In the course of the O.P.P. investigation, L. disclosed that
he had been heavily involved in the drug trade for an organized
crime family.  This information had not been disclosed prior to
the trial.
[23] L. also attempted to offer his services to the Quebec police
in 1996 to testify against another inmate who had been charged
with killing a police officer.  L. told the police that the
inmate had confessed to him that he had killed the officer.  L.
expected the police to assist him with an outstanding charge and
with the Parole Board.  L. was not called to testify at this
other murder trial.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[24] In addition to the fresh evidence, the appellant raises the
following grounds of appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>            1.      The charge to the jury with respect to evidence
          confirmatory of L.&#146;s testimony;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The charge to the jury with respect
          to evidence of post-offence conduct;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The charge to the jury concerning
          the time of death;
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   The reasonableness of the verdict
          of first degree murder.</pre>
    <pre>[25] I will deal with the admissibility of the fresh evidence
first, and then return to the other grounds of appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>            The Fresh Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[26] The fresh evidence falls into two categories: (1) the
failure to disclose the tape of the March 3, 1989 conversation
between Cst. Belanger and L.; and (2) the evidence surrounding
L.'s recantation.  As the legal tests regarding the admissibility
of these two categories of evidence are analytically somewhat
different, I will begin by approaching them separately.  However,
since the final phases of the tests substantially overlap, some
of my analysis will occur after I have considered all of the
fresh evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (1)     Failure to disclose the tape of the March 3, 1989
          interview</pre>
    <pre>[27] In a series of related cases, the Supreme Court of Canada
discussed the test to be met by an appellant who seeks a new
trial as a result of inadvertent non-disclosure by the Crown.
The principal decision is R. v. Dixon (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.).  The analysis dictated by that case is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>            1.      The appellant must demonstrate a violation of his right
          to disclosure by showing that there is a reasonable possibility
          that the undisclosed information could have been used in meeting
          the case for the Crown, advancing a defence or otherwise making a
          decision that could have affected the conduct of the defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The appellant must demonstrate on a
          balance of probabilities that the right to
          make full answer and defence was impaired as
          a result of the failure to disclose by
          showing that there is a reasonable
          possibility the non-disclosure affected the
          outcome at trial or the overall fairness of
          the trial process.  This involves a two step
          analysis in the appellate court:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    i.   If the appellate court is persuaded
               that there is a reasonable possibility that,
               on its face, the undisclosed information
               affects the reliability of the conviction a
               new trial should be ordered.
               </pre>
    <pre>                    ii.  Even if the evidence on its
               face does not affect the reliability of
               the conviction, the appellate court must
               consider the overall fairness of the
               trial process.  This will require the
               court to assess, on the basis of a
               reasonable possibility, the lines of
               inquiry with witnesses or the
               opportunities to gather additional
               evidence that could have been available
               to the defence had the information been
               disclosed.  In considering the overall
               fairness of the trial process, the court
               will take into account defence counsel&#146;s
               diligence in pursuing disclosure from
               the Crown.  A lack of due diligence is a
               significant factor in determining
               whether the non-disclosure affected the
               fairness of the trial process.</pre>
    <pre>[28] I did not understand Crown counsel to dispute that the tape
recording of Constable Belanger&#146;s interview with L. on March 3,
1989 should have been disclosed.  In any event, it is clear that
the contents of the tape could have been used to meet the Crown's
case.  Thus, the first part of the Dixon test has been met; the
appellant&#146;s right to disclosure was violated.
[29] The second part of the Dixon test requires the appellant to
demonstrate that the non-disclosure impaired his right to make
full answer and defence.  The appellant puts his case for a new
trial on both branches of this part of the test.  The principal
argument is that there is a reasonable possibility that the
interview on its face either alone, or when combined with the
other proposed fresh evidence, affects the reliability of the
conviction.  Alternatively, it is argued that the non-disclosure
affected the overall fairness of the case.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i)  Reliability of the conviction</pre>
    <pre>[30] On March 3, 1989, after the appellant had allegedly told L.
that he had committed the perfect crime and that the police could
not have much evidence against him, in answer to a direct
question:  &#147;Did he tell you he killed her?&#148; L. said,  &#147;No, he
didn&#146;t say anything like that.&#148;  In my view, this part of the
interview alone constitutes a reasonable foundation for a finding
that L. fabricated the alleged confession by the appellant at the
North Bay jail.  Prior to the appeal, L. was examined by counsel
for the respondent and for the appellant.  In that examination,
L. clearly indicated that he was aware of the importance of the
statements allegedly made by the appellant.  He testified that he
would have told Constable Belanger anything significant about the
appellant&#146;s involvement in the murder.  In fact, L. ultimately
took the position that he had told Belanger about the appellant's
inculpatory statements.  There is no such statement on the taped
interview of March 3rd.  Constable Belanger was also examined
prior to the appeal and he confirmed that L. never told him about
the inculpatory statements allegedly made by the appellant.  In
light of the evidence of L. and Constable Belanger, virtually the
only reasonable conclusion is that L. did not tell Belanger of
the remarks because the appellant did not make them prior to
March 3rd.  The undisclosed evidence is therefore important
evidence undermining this part of the Crown&#146;s case.
[31] Counsel for the respondent argues that defence counsel at
trial did not exercise the requisite degree of diligence in
pursuing the possibility that Constable Belanger had relevant
information.  Although the reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada
in Dixon and its companion cases2 are not entirely clear on this
point, it would appear that an investigation into due diligence
is only required where the appellant rests the case for a new
trial on the second branch of the test, namely, the overall
fairness of the trial.  In any event, I am satisfied that trial
counsel did exercise the requisite degree of due diligence.
[32] The respondent&#146;s submission that defence counsel did not
exercise due diligence rests on L.&#146;s testimony at the appellant&#146;s
preliminary inquiry.  In cross-examination, L. was asked about
contacts he had with the North Bay police and he testified that
he had spoken to Constable Belanger on other matters and had also
disclosed that the appellant was in the jail.  L. testified that
he did not tell Belanger about any statement by the appellant
concerning the murder, merely that he wanted to speak to homicide
officers when he reached Toronto.  I agree with Crown counsel
that in light of this testimony defence counsel should have
actively sought and pursued disclosure of L.&#146;s dealings with the
North Bay police. Ms. Forrestell, one of the appellant&#146;s trial
lawyers, filed an affidavit and was cross-examined prior to this
appeal.  This material sets out the numerous requests made by
defence counsel prior to, and during, the second trial for
disclosure generally as well as the assurances from Crown counsel
that complete disclosure had been made.  Ms. Forrestell also
stated that she did not attempt to subpoena Constable Belanger
because defence counsel had been assured that the interview
concerned drugs, not the appellant.  Having made this specific
request, defence counsel was, in my view, entitled to rely upon
the assurances of Crown counsel that the North Bay police had no
relevant information.  Thus, I am satisfied that defence counsel
exercised the requisite due diligence.
[33] The circumstances of this case are not unlike those in R. v.
Skinner, one of the companion cases to R. v. Dixon.  The non-
disclosure in Skinner concerned a statement that one Daye had
given to the police.  The disclosure provided to trial counsel
included a police occurrence report referring to Daye and
indicating that he may have been an eyewitness.  Trial counsel
for Skinner filed an affidavit on the appeal stating that she
believed Daye&#146;s entire statement was included in the police
report and she was unaware that Daye had given a separate
statement.  For that reason, she did not make a request for
disclosure of the statement.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
held that trial counsel had exercised due diligence: (1997), 158
N.S.R. (2d) 81.  This view was endorsed by the Supreme Court of
Canada.
[34] In this case, trial counsel were aware that Constable
Belanger had been involved with L. but they were told the
involvement related to the drug investigation not the appellant.
They were assured that full disclosure had been made.  For that
reason, they did not pursue extraordinary measures such as
subpoenaing Constable Belanger.
[35] In a forceful argument, Mr. Corelli submitted that
notwithstanding the importance of the undisclosed material to
L.&#146;s credibility, the non-disclosure did not affect the
reliability of the conviction.  He made a similar argument in
relation to the impact of the non-disclosure on the overall
fairness of the trial.  I take this element of the Dixon test to
be similar to the fourth element of the test for admission of
fresh evidence laid down in Palmer v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C.
(2d) 193 (S.C.C.). The fourth element of Palmer requires the
court to determine whether the fresh evidence is such that if
believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence
adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.
Because of the substantial overlap in these tests and since they
all relate to L., I will return to that issue after discussing
the remainder of the fresh evidence.  Suffice it to say, I am
satisfied that the non-disclosure affects the reliability of the
conviction and that on that basis alone a new trial is required.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii) The overall fairness of the trial process</pre>
    <pre>[36] The appellant also submitted that the non-disclosure
affected the overall fairness of the trial.  It was argued that
there is a reasonable possibility that disclosure of the March
3rd interview would have had an impact on the conduct of the
defence.  The test to be applied is not an exacting one.  In
Skinner at p. 35, Cory J. put the test as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>            On an appeal, it is impossible to reconstruct the trial process
          and determine exactly how the defence might have used the
          undisclosed statement. Yet there does appear to be sufficient
          relevant information contained in Daye's statement that its
          possible utility to the defence is not a matter of pure
          speculation or fancy. It is reasonably possible that disclosure
          of this statement would have had an impact on the conduct of the
          defence at trial. I conclude therefore that non-disclosure of
          this statement affected the fairness of the trial process and
          impaired the appellant's right to make full answer and defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is true that trial counsel for the
          appellant was aware long before the trial
          began that Daye was a potential eyewitness.
          Yet it is no answer to the impairment of the
          appellant's right to make full answer and
          defence to say that defence counsel could
          have or should have interviewed Daye. Indeed,
          on appeal the issue to be considered is
          whether decisions made at trial would have
          been different if the undisclosed information
          had been available.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[37] Counsel for the appellant argued that had the defence been
aware of the contents of the Belanger interview they might not
have applied to exclude L.&#146;s Toronto statement &#147;Don&#146;t worry
Frenchie, they&#146;ll never find her&#148; under s. 7 of the Charter.  It
was submitted that it would be open to defence counsel to argue
before the jury that this statement was a fabrication and L. was
merely repeating what Constable Belanger had suggested the
appellant might say.  It would then be open to the defence to
argue that all of L.'s statements were fabricated.
[38] Crown counsel submitted that this was an unrealistic
scenario since the trial judge could not simply admit this
statement and exclude the other Toronto statements since all of
the Toronto statements would be necessary to put the &#147;Don&#146;t worry
Frenchie, they&#146;ll never find her&#148; statement in context.  I do not
agree with this submission.  I have reviewed L.&#146;s testimony from
the first trial.  This statement was not tied to any other
statement allegedly made by the appellant in the Toronto
detention centre.  The other statements principally relate to
alleged attempts by the appellant to enlist L.&#146;s help in
providing an alibi for the time of death and to convince the
appellant&#146;s uncle to retract his evidence about the false alibi.
In my view, it is reasonably possible that the disclosure of the
statement would have had an impact on the conduct of the defence
at trial.
[39] I need not decide, however, whether a new trial is required
solely on the basis of the effect on the overall fairness of the
trial.  As I have stated, I am satisfied that a new trial is
required because of the impact of the non-disclosure on the
reliability of the conviction.  I will return to my reasons for
this conclusion.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The evidence surrounding the recantation</pre>
    <pre>[40] The evidence concerning L.&#146;s brief recantation of a portion
of his trial testimony falls within the traditional category of
fresh evidence.  The test for the admission of fresh evidence has
recently been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
Warsing, (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 259.  In that case, at pp. 283-
84, Major J., speaking for all the members of the court on this
issue, affirmed that the test for admission of fresh evidence is
as set down in Palmer v. The Queen, at p. 205:
          </pre>
    <pre>            (1)     The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by
          due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that
          this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a
          criminal case as in civil case;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The evidence must be relevant in
          the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
          potentially decisive issue in the trial;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  The evidence must be credible in
          the sense that it is reasonably capable of
          belief; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  It must be such that if believed it
          could reasonably, when taken with the other
          evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
          have affected the result.</pre>
    <pre>[41] Before dealing with the admission of the proposed fresh
evidence under the Palmer test, however, there is a threshold
issue.  In R. v. O'Brien (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (S.C.C.) at
217-18, the Supreme Court held that it is a prerequisite that any
evidence sought to be adduced as fresh evidence be admissible
evidence. Some of the proposed fresh evidence in this case is
hearsay.  In particular, L.&#146;s statement to Mr. Prendiville
recanting the perfect crime statement would not have been
admissible for its truth at the trial, assuming L. continued to
adhere to his position that the recantation was false, unless the
requirements in R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740 were met.
These requirements would be subject to some modification because
it is the defence rather than the Crown seeking to make
substantive use of the prior inconsistent statement: R. v. G.F.,
a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, released January 20,
1999.  L.&#146;s brief recantation would, however, be admissible for
the limited purpose of impeaching L.'s credibility.  I think it
is preferable to deal with the admissibility of the evidence on
that basis.  Had the recantation been available, L. could have
been cross-examined on it and, if he denied making it, the
statement could have been proved in accordance with s. 11 of the
Canada Evidence Act.  The statement to Mr. Prendiville is clearly
&#147;relative to the subject-matter of the case&#148; within the meaning
of s. 11.
[42] The evidence concerning the reasons for the recantation
poses a different problem.  L. could have been cross-examined on
his reasons for recanting, namely his fear of the appellant.  It
would have been open to defence counsel to suggest to L. that he
forged the note and that a person acting on behalf of the
appellant did not stab him.  If L. denied forging the note and
continued to say that a person acting on behalf of the appellant
stabbed him, the issue would then be whether it would have been
open to the defence to prove these things through extrinsic
evidence.  This issue engages the collateral fact rule.
[43] The effect of the collateral fact rule is that, subject to
certain exceptions, a party is not entitled to introduce
extrinsic evidence to contradict the testimony of an adversary's
witness unless that extrinsic evidence is relevant to some issue
in the case beyond merely contradicting the witness. In my view,
it would be open to a trier of fact to find that L. went to
extraordinary lengths to give a false explanation for his alleged
recantation, including attempts to implicate the appellant in the
recantation.  Therefore, this proposed fresh evidence would not
only be capable of contradicting L., but would have demonstrated
an animus towards the appellant: see R. v. Aalders (1993), 82
C.C.C. (3d) 215 (S.C.C.) at 230.  In the words of Cory J. in that
case: &#147;it would be wrong to deprive the trier of fact of
important evidence relating to an essential element of the case.&#148;
The proposed fresh evidence relates to the reliability and
credibility of important evidence relied upon by the Crown to
prove the identity of the killer. Accordingly, the evidence is
not collateral and would potentially have been admissible at the
trial to contradict L.  I will proceed to consider the four
elements of the Palmer test.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i)  Due diligence</pre>
    <pre>[44] All of the evidence surrounding the recantation was created
following the trial.  Thus, due diligence is not an issue in this
part of the appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (ii)    Relevancy</pre>
    <pre>[45] The proposed fresh evidence concerning the recantation falls
into two different categories.  The first is the recantation
itself, from which L. has now resiled.  The second is the
evidence concerning the reasons for the recantation and then the
resiling from that recantation.  In my view, both categories of
evidence meet the relevancy test.  The Crown relied upon the
statements allegedly made to L. as evidence of the only real
issue in the case, the identity of the killer.  The recantation
of the &#147;perfect crime&#148; statement obviously bears directly on L.&#146;s
credibility and thus the reliability of that statement.  The
evidence about the reasons for the recantation is also relevant
because it casts doubt on all of L.&#146;s evidence implicating the
appellant.  It is not simply that L. appears to be an incredible
witness generally.  This fresh evidence is capable of
demonstrating that in respect of the appellant, L. is prepared to
fabricate incriminating evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (iii)   Credibility</pre>
    <pre>[46] The credibility element of the Palmer test presents a
particular problem in this case.  It was not suggested that Mr.
Prendiville was not credible.  Similarly, the expert and other
evidence concerning the forgery, the circumstances under which L.
received the note and L.&#146;s false allegation of being stabbed is
credible.  Mr. Corelli argued, however, that the question was not
the credibility of the witnesses, but the credibility of the
recantation.  He submits that L. has changed his story so many
times that nothing he has said since the trial can be relied
upon.  He submits that the recantation is not credible and he
argues that there is a close analogy between this case and the
facts in Palmer itself.
[47] It will be necessary to closely examine the Palmer case to
properly apply it to the facts of this case.  The fresh evidence
application in Palmer concerned the principal Crown witness, one
Frederick Ford.  Ford had given lengthy and detailed evidence at
the preliminary inquiry and trial concerning a large-scale heroin
conspiracy.  He was testifying in accordance with an arrangement
with the police and the Crown that was fully disclosed at the
trial.  After the trial and prior to the appeal, Ford gave a
series of statements and affidavits in which he recanted all of
his evidence implicating the appellants.  Ford claimed that he
had testified out of fear and under pressure from the police.
The evidence produced by the Crown on the appeal suggested,
however, that Ford&#146;s recantation was false and resulted from fear
of the appellants and because he had become dissatisfied with
certain aspects of the financial arrangements with the Crown.
The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada were
satisfied that the recantation was a fabrication, whereas the
trial testimony was true.  McIntyre J., at pp. 206-7,
demonstrated why the trial evidence was preferable:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In his declarations, Ford says that he was frightened and
          under pressure and, accordingly, when the time for the
          preliminary hearing came he merely got in the witness-box and
          made up a bunch of lies. It should be noted, however, that at the
          trial, almost a year later, he gave the same evidence and,
          despite strenuous cross-examination on both occasions, no
          assertion is made that there was any significant difference in
          the evidence. The accurate repetition of extemporaneous
          inventions after such a long interval would be a remarkable
          performance on Ford's part under any circumstances but, when one
          adds the fact that the trial Judge considered that his evidence
          was in harmony with the general picture of events which emerged
          from the evidence of many other witnesses, it becomes impossible
          to believe that the evidence was fabricated on the spur of the
          moment.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[48] In my view, it was important to the disposition of the fresh
evidence in that case that the appellate courts were able to look
at the trial testimony and the recantation and satisfy themselves
that the trial testimony, rather than the recantation, was
credible.  The court did not therefore have to deal with the more
difficult question of the admission of fresh evidence that cannot
be discarded as incredible, but which the appellant cannot
demonstrate is credible.  Put another way, what remedy is
available to the court of appeal where the record is not
satisfactory and the court is not in a position to make a finding
that the evidence is credible, but at the same time feels that
the evidence is of such significance that had it been available
to the original trier of fact, whether believed or not, it might
have had an effect on the credibility of the witness or another
witness such that it could have affected the result of the trial?
[49] In my view, where the court of appeal is dealing with the
fresh evidence of a witness who testified at the trial as to
matters of fact and the court is satisfied that the fresh
evidence is not credible and does not affect the credibility of
the testimony given by the witness at trial, the fresh evidence
is inadmissible.  However, where the court of appeal, having
fully reviewed the record, is unable to find that the evidence is
not credible, even though it is unable to say that it is
credible, the court must go on to consider the fourth Palmer
requirement on the theory that the evidence may nonetheless have
substantial impeachment value if made available to a reasonable
trier of fact.  I will now explain why this formulation is not
inconsistent with Palmer and is, in fact, consistent with
decisions of the appellate courts and the Supreme Court of Canada
since Palmer.
[50] The role of an appellate court in dealing with fresh
evidence, especially fresh evidence of a witness who testifies
about matters of fact, as in Palmer or this case, is unusual.
This court&#146;s jurisdiction to interfere with the trial judgment by
making factual determinations and assessments of credibility is
ordinarily a modest one.  Where an accused challenges a
conviction on the basis that the verdict is unreasonable within
the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, this court
must in the words of McLachlin J. in R. v. W. (R.) (1992), 74
C.C.C. (3d) 134 (S.C.C.) at 141 re-examine, and &#147;to some extent
at least&#148;, re-weigh and consider the effect of the evidence.
While the court is entitled to re-examine a verdict even when
based on findings of credibility, the appellate court is not
entitled to simply substitute its view for that of the trial
court.  The test remains could a jury or judge properly
instructed and acting reasonably have convicted?  In applying the
test, as explained by McLachlin J. at p. 142, the court of appeal
should &#147;show great deference to findings of credibility made at
trial&#148;, bearing in mind &#147;the special position of the trier of
fact on matters of credibility&#148;.  The role of the appellate court
is still one of review, rather than as a primary fact-finder.
[51] On applications to adduce fresh evidence in matters of fact,
the role of the appellate court is somewhat different.  The
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Palmer instructs the
appellate court to assess the credibility of that evidence.
Thus, on occasion, this court will hear fresh evidence viva voce,
especially where the Crown challenges the admission of that
evidence on the basis that it would fail the third Palmer
requirement.3  The appellate court cannot avoid the task of
dealing with credibility, i.e. the truthfulness, of fresh
evidence, especially recantations, simply on the basis that the
evidence is tendered for the limited purpose of impeaching the
credibility of the witness&#146; trial evidence.

</pre>
    <pre>[52] If the appellate court, which has the obligation to consider
the sufficiency of the fresh evidence, is satisfied that the
fresh evidence is not credible and does not affect the
credibility of the testimony given by the witness or another
witness at the trial, the evidence cannot meet the third Palmer
requirement, and it is inadmissible.  To hold otherwise, would be
to shirk the responsibility given to the appellate court by s.
683 of the Criminal Code, as interpreted in Palmer, to receive
the evidence of witnesses on appeal.  To admit a recantation
without regard to its credibility simply because it was made,
would run afoul of the admonition in Palmer at p. 205 that it
would not serve the interests of justice to &#147;permit any witness
by simply repudiating or changing his trial evidence to reopen
trials at will to the general detriment of the administration of
justice.&#148;  In R. v. Pizzardi (R.G.) (1994), 72 O.A.C. 241, leave
to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada dismissed December 9, 1994,
this court made a similar observation. Lacourcière J.A. held at
p. 246 that &#147;It would be detrimental to the administration of
justice to reopen trials merely because a trial witness has
changed his mind or repudiated his evidence.&#148;
[53] An aspect of the fresh evidence tendered in this appeal
illustrates the point.  If the only fresh evidence in this case
was the bare recantation by L. of the &#147;perfect crime&#148; statement,
I would have considerable doubt that the evidence could pass the
credibility threshold since the reasons provided for the
allegedly untrue trial testimony and for the recantation can be
shown to be patently false.  It will be recalled that L. claimed
his trial testimony was the product of improper conduct by the
police and the Crown counsel.  This was apparently untrue.  L.&#146;s
explanation, that he was recanting to clear his conscience, also
seems patently untrue.  In those circumstances, the bare
recantation is so lacking in credibility that even as impeaching
evidence it lacks sufficient forensic value to overturn a
conviction otherwise free of error.
[54] Of course, in this case there is far more than the bare
recantation.  L.&#146;s brief recantation must be considered along
with the large body of other evidence that the appellant submits
casts considerable doubt on the reliability of L.&#146;s trial
evidence.  Thus, the credibility requirement from Palmer must be
applied within this context.  The inquiry must focus on McIntyre
J.&#146;s explanation of credible fresh evidence as being evidence
that is &#147;reasonably capable of belief&#148;.  Phrased in this way, the
requirement recognizes that the appellate court is at a distinct
disadvantage as the primary fact-finder, for even if it has heard
the proposed fresh evidence viva voce, it has not heard the trial
evidence.
[55] In my view, the credibility requirement is expressed in
these terms because the advantage and expertise of an appellate
court lies in its reviewing function rather than as the primary
fact-finder.  In some cases, the court of appeal may be
satisfied, based on its own assessment of the proposed fresh
evidence, that it is truthful and reliable.  On the other hand,
in many cases, the court, while unable to make that
determination, may also be unable to reject the evidence as not
credible.  Such evidence is, in my view, reasonably capable of
belief within the meaning of the third Palmer requirement.  It
should not be rejected at the credibility stage, since evidence
that is not rejected as incredible is still capable of affecting
a verdict in a criminal case.4
[56] It must be remembered that McIntyre J. derived the four-part
test in Palmer from what he termed the &#147;leading case&#148; of McMartin
v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484 and at pp. 205-6 he quoted with
approval from p. 493 of the reasons of Ritchie J. in that case:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    With the greatest respect, it appears to me that the
          evidence tendered by the appellant on such an application as this
          is not to be judged and rejected on the ground that it &quot;does not
          disprove the verdict as found by the jury&quot; or that it fails to
          discharge the burden of proving that the appellant was incapable
          of planning and deliberation, or that it does not rebut
          inferences which appear to have been drawn by the jury. It is
          enough, in my view, if the proposed evidence is of sufficient
          strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[57] It was in that context that McIntyre J. held that the
appellate court must consider matters of credibility.  At p. 206,
referring to McMartin, McIntyre J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>            It is clear, however, that in dealing with matters of fact a
          consideration of whether, in the words of Ritchie, J., the
          evidence possessed sufficient strength that &quot;it might reasonably
          affect the verdict of the jury&quot; involves a consideration of its
          credibility as well as its probative force if presented to the
          trier of fact.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Because the evidence was not available
          at trial and because it bears on a decisive
          issue, the inquiry in this case is limited to
          two questions. First, is the evidence
          possessed of sufficient credibility that it
          might reasonably have been believed by the
          trier of fact? If the answer is no that ends
          the matter but if yes the second question
          presents itself in this form. If presented to
          the trier of fact and believed, would the
          evidence possess such strength or probative
          force that it might, taken with the other
          evidence adduced, have affected the result?
          If the answer to the second question is yes,
          the motion to adduce new evidence would have
          to succeed and a new trial be directed at
          which the evidence could be introduced.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[58] In applying the Palmer test, it should be borne in mind that
the recantation by the accomplice Ford in Palmer itself was
assessed only on the basis that it was the true version of events
and the trial evidence a fabrication.  There is no suggestion
that the appellants argued that the evidence of the recantation
could be adduced for the different purpose of impeaching the
trial credibility of Ford on the theory that even if the
recantation could not be proved to be credible, it could not be
said to incredible.  In any event, as shown above, both the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada
were satisfied on their examination of the proposed evidence
against the entire record of the case that the recantation and
the reasons for the recantation were incredible and the trial
evidence credible.  Those courts did not have to deal with the
problem of evidence concerning a recantation that can be neither
accepted nor rejected on credibility grounds alone and is
tendered to impeach the trial testimony of an important Crown
witness.  In such cases, in accordance with the McMartin test,
the court must turn to the fourth Palmer requirement to decide
whether the evidence is of sufficient strength that it might
reasonably affect the verdict of the jury.
[59] That Palmer does not foreclose the possibility that reliable
evidence of a &#147;recantation&#148; tendered only for its impeachment
potential can meet the &#147;credibility&#148; requirement is demonstrated
by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in M.H.C. v. The
Queen (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 385.  M.H.C. had been convicted of
indecent assault of his ex-wife and sexual assault of the
daughter of his subsequent common law wife.  The fresh evidence
issue concerned the sexual assault of the daughter.  Prior to the
trial, the Crown received a statement from the child&#146;s teacher.
In the statement, the teacher related that she became concerned
about the child and questioned her about possible abuse.
According to the teacher, the child &#147;denied everything&#148;.  The
Crown did not disclose this statement to the defence.  McLachlin
J., speaking for the court, dealt with this statement on two
bases.  First, she held at p. 395 that the Crown had a duty to
disclose the statement and that it &#147;could conceivably have
affected the jury&#146;s conclusions on the only real issue, the
respective credibility of the complainant and the appellant&#148;.
[60] However, McLachlin J. also dealt with the value of the
statement as a matter of fresh evidence.  After setting out the
four-part Palmer test, she held, at p. 396:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court of Appeal differed on whether the fourth
          requirement in Palmer was met. I am satisfied that admission of
          the evidence at trial might have reasonably been viewed as
          capable of affecting the result. As I have suggested above, a
          direct denial in response to questioning might be viewed as
          qualitatively different from general evidence that the
          complainant had told no one of the alleged assaults. As this
          court has made clear in R. v. Stolar (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 1, &#133;
          and R. v. Morin (1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 &#133;, its role on a fresh
          evidence application is not to address the merits of the Court of
          Appeal's decision on the application, but rather to assess the
          application anew. Accordingly, if it is held that the fresh
          evidence could reasonably have affected the trial verdict, the
          court has two options. It may consider the evidence conclusive of
          the case, and resolve it, or send the matter back for a new
          trial. I would therefore grant the application for the admission
          of this evidence, and order a new trial.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[61] It is apparent from this part of the judgment, that
McLachlin J. only expressly considered the fourth Palmer
requirement.  However, it is implicit that she was satisfied that
the other three requirements were met.  Otherwise, she would not
have admitted the statement as fresh evidence.  I take it there
was no issue of due diligence since the evidence had been
improperly withheld by the Crown.  The evidence was obviously
relevant since it related to the crucial issue of the
complainant&#146;s credibility.  I can only assume that McLachlin J.
saw no question of credibility because of the obvious credibility
of the teacher to whom the child made the denial and because the
statement was tendered only for impeachment purposes.  There is
no suggestion that the appellate court was required to find as a
fact as a prerequisite to admission that the sexual assault did
not take place because the statement by the child to the teacher
was true, i.e., credible.  M.H.C. seems to represent the classic
case in which the appellate court, although unable to find that
the fresh evidence represents the true state of affairs, is
convinced that it could have substantial value to impeach the
credibility of the Crown witness and in that sense might
reasonably be true.  Admittedly, M.H.C. is not strictly a
recantation case, since the denial came before the offences were
even disclosed.  However, there is a parallel to a recantation
case.  The Crown witness made a statement to a person of obvious
credit inconsistent with her trial testimony.
[62] An important distinction between Palmer and M.H.C. is that
the interest in finality, a factor underlying the care the courts
take in admitting simple recantations, is attenuated in a case
where the statement was made prior to trial.  Simple recantations
are properly subject to strict scrutiny because they can be
easily fabricated.  The &#147;reasonably capable of belief&#148; test can
be an important safeguard against admission of fabricated
evidence.
[63] There have been other cases, in addition to M.H.C., where
appellate courts have held that an inconsistent statement may be
admitted as fresh evidence for the limited use of impeaching a
Crown witness, and not for its truth.5
[64] In particular, this court dealt with the impeachment impact
of fresh evidence in R. v. G. (A.) (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 350.
Two days after the verdict, the young complainant told her mother
that she may have &#147;dreamt what she said in court&#148;.  The accused
sought to introduce the mother&#146;s statement as fresh evidence.  By
the time of the appeal, the complainant had been interviewed by a
psychiatrist and maintained that her trial testimony was true.
This court nevertheless admitted the fresh evidence in view of
the impeachment impact of the statement to the mother, it being
acknowledged that the mother&#146;s evidence was credible, at pp. 351-
52:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is acknowledged that [the complainant] M. made the
          statement to her mother. We have nothing to put the statement in
          context except we know that it was made two days after the
          appellant was convicted of abusing M. There is no evidence from
          M. or her mother on appeal as to the context of this statement,
          or M.'s position in the three years which have passed since she
          made the statement to her mother. We do know that she returned to
          the position she had taken at trial when questioned by the
          psychiatrist. The details of that questioning are not before the
          court.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Had M.'s statement to her mother been
          available to defence counsel at trial, it
          could have been used to impeach the
          reliability of M.'s evidence. The
          admissibility of the statement on this appeal
          turns on whether the impeachment potential is
          such that it could reasonably, when viewed
          with the rest of the evidence, be expected to
          have affected the result: R. v. Stolar,
          [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480 at 486, 40 C.C.C. (3d) 1.
          </pre>
    <pre>               This is not a recantation case and the
          timing of M.'s statement to her mother
          certainly causes concern about its value for
          impeachment purposes as does her subsequent
          reiteration of the position she took at trial
          when questioned by the psychiatrist.
          </pre>
    <pre>               This is a difficult judgment call. We
          are, however, satisfied, in the particular
          circumstances of this case, that the evidence
          of M.'s statement to her mother does clear
          the fresh evidence hurdle and should be
          received on appeal.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[65] The cases demonstrate that the court must consider the
particular circumstances of each case.  It now becomes necessary
to consider whether the fresh evidence in this case is reasonably
capable of belief when tendered for its impeachment potential.
The evidence of the recantation to the appellant&#146;s trial counsel
is reliable in the limited sense that the fact it was made is
clearly established.  The evidence gathered by the police in the
investigation of the recantation is admitted to be credible.  As
a whole, I would find the evidence reasonably capable of belief
even if I was unable to say that any particular statement by L.
can be shown to be truthful.  When the fresh evidence is set
against L.&#146;s trial evidence it has substantial value for
impeachment purposes.
[66] One example will suffice.  The fact that L.&#146;s reasons for
his &#147;false&#148; recantation can be shown to be false, casts new light
on his reasons for initially coming forward.  Against the
background of the fresh evidence, those reasons seem highly
suspect.  It will be recalled that L. claimed that he came
forward as a &#147;good citizen&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Well, if nobody did, you know, like the little boy does have
          no family any more so&#133;  I was just somebody with&#151;that would ever
          happen to me, I wish somebody would come forward also, you know.
          It was just good on my part, I figured.</pre>
    <pre>[67] In R. v. Brooks (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (Ont. C.A.) at
266-67, Laskin J.A., referring to the Kaufman Report [Report of
the Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin (1998)],
pointed out that such claims must be viewed with considerable
skepticism:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The Kaufman Report &#133; [noted] that the two jailhouse
          informants in that case claimed their testimony was motivated by
          their repugnance towards Morin's alleged crime.  The
          Commissioner, the Honourable Mr. Kaufman, did not accept their
          testimony (at p. 563):
               </pre>
    <pre>                    Both Mr. May and Mr. X claimed that they
               were motivated to testify by their repugnance
               towards the crime with which Mr. Morin was
               charged.  As noted earlier, I do not accept
               this testimony.  Their presentation is
               reminiscent of the Los Angeles experience.
               Their attitude demonstrates that an
               informant's motive to lie may not be obvious
               &#150; indeed, it may often be less conspicuous
               than that of a defendant.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Indeed, the Commissioner
          doubted the so-called &quot;good citizen&quot;
          informer, concluding at p. 604 of his
          Report that &quot;most [in-custody] informers
          wish to benefit from their contemplated
          participation as witnesses for the
          prosecution.&quot;  Balogh's good citizen
          intentions are further placed in doubt
          by his admission that he had previously
          approached the police several times with
          information implicating other accused
          charged with murder.  However, before
          this trial he had never been called to
          testify.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[68] L. had a criminal lifestyle and had offered to supply
information to the police on a variety of matters.  In
particular, the proposed fresh evidence discloses that L. offered
to testify against a fellow inmate about a murder of a police
officer in Quebec.  The myriad of provably false statements by L.
as to his motives for recanting and then resiling from the
recantation suggest that L.&#146;s trial evidence as to his motive for
coming forward is untrue.
[69] Finally, the facts of this case are very different from
Palmer.  At trial, L.&#146;s evidence was simple.  The incriminating
parts, the only parts that were allegedly fabricated, consisted
of two brief comments attributed to the appellant.  It is
evidence that is easily fabricated, in contrast to the quite
detailed evidence given by Ford in the Palmer case.  The fresh
evidence tendered in this case is also very different from the
fresh evidence in Palmer. L.&#146;s explanation for falsely recanting
and for adhering to his trial testimony can be proved false by
credible evidence, such as the expert evidence that he forged the
threatening note.  In contrast, in Palmer, it was the reasons for
the recantation that were shown to be suspect.
[70] To conclude on this part of the Palmer test as applied in
this case, the evidence that L. recanted is credible.  The
reasons provided by L. to support his claim that the recantation
is false can be demonstrated by credible evidence to be untrue.
The fresh evidence is reasonably capable of belief, even if
particular statements by L. since the trial cannot ultimately be
demonstrated to be credible.  McIntyre J. said in Palmer at p.
205 that the overriding consideration must be &#147;the interests of
justice&#148; and, as pointed out above, it would not serve the
interests of justice to &#147;permit any witness by simply repudiating
or changing his trial evidence to reopen trials at will to the
general detriment of the administration of justice.&#148;  The fresh
evidence in this case is not a simple repudiation.  Credible
independent fresh evidence demonstrates that L. cannot be relied
upon at least in respect of evidence implicating this appellant.
The nature of that evidence shows him to be unreliable in all
respects and not simply with respect to his post-trial
statements.  The interests of justice require that the court
proceed to consider the fourth Palmer requirement as the evidence
may have substantial impeachment value if made available to a
reasonable trier of fact.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iv) Affect on the verdict</pre>
    <pre>[71] Mr. Corelli placed the burden of his argument against
admitting the fresh evidence principally on this part of the
Palmer test.  The fourth element of Palmer is:
          </pre>
    <pre>            (4)     It must be such that if believed it could reasonably,
          when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected
          to have affected the result.</pre>
    <pre>[72] This test requires the appellate court to relate the
proposed fresh evidence to the evidence at the trial.  In R. v.
Yanover and Gerol (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. C.A.) at 317-
18, Martin J.A. held that in considering whether the fresh
evidence might reasonably have affected the verdict, the court
should look at that portion of the charge to the jury upon which
the fresh evidence would have impacted.  By the same reasoning,
in my view it is also proper to look at the addresses of counsel
at the former trial.
[73] While the case against the appellant was formidable, it was
entirely circumstantial, except for L.&#146;s evidence.  If the jury
accepted L.&#146;s testimony that the appellant said he had committed
the perfect crime, this would constitute a confession and direct
evidence of the appellant&#146;s guilt.  Crown counsel at trial
recognized the importance of L.&#146;s evidence in building the case
against the appellant.  In his jury address, he referred to four
aspects or blocks of evidence:  (1) the appellant&#146;s pursuit of
the deceased; (2) the events at the appellant&#146;s place of work;
(3) &#147;evidence regarding the perfect crime&#148;; and (4) the role, if
any, of the deceased&#146;s boyfriend.
[74] Crown counsel dealt at some length with the evidence
relating to the perfect crime. The fact that there was no trace
evidence on the appellant to link him to the deceased was
potentially a hole in the Crown&#146;s case.  However, by linking the
lack of forensic evidence to L.&#146;s &#147;perfect crime&#148; statement,
Crown counsel was able to turn a weakness in its case into an
important piece of evidence inculpating the appellant.  The
following excerpts from Crown counsel&#146;s jury address illustrate
this strategy:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    I&#146;d like to turn now to the evidence related to the
          perfect crime.  Firstly, we know that whoever committed this
          crime had the foresight to destroy Eva Mead's clothing, thereby
          eliminating an important source of trace evidence.  That of
          course doesn't narrow the field very much, because anyone who has
          experience in or knowledge of the justice system could see the
          importance of such, of doing such a thing.  We do know, however,
          that Babinski seems to have known how to go in Mrs. Mead's
          apartment for quite sometime without leaving fingerprints.
          Furthermore, it is only logical, I suggest, to conclude that the
          person who was wise enough to destroy Eva Mead's clothing would
          also be astute enough to destroy his own.  So if Babinski
          committed this crime, it would not be surprising if there is
          absolutely no trace evidence linking him to it.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The reason for that is that it
          would be the same no matter who committed the
          crime.  There would be no trace evidence
          linking the person to it.  You will, however,
          want to consider the question as to whether
          Babinski changed his clothing before you
          conclude that the forensic evidence does not
          in any way assist him.  You will remember
          that Henry Hadjinjak noticed that the accused
          was wearing white runners, blue jean jacket,
          and blue jeans on October 19.  You will
          recall, as well, that he gave a description
          to Det. John Sheflin during a telephone
          conversation late on October 20.  The accused
          told you in the witness box that he was
          wearing his acid wash jeans, jackets, pair of
          jeans and his boots.  The clothing examined
          by Johanne Aylmer included a blue and black
          down jacket, a blue denim jacket, black
          jeans, and a pair of boots.  Mr. Babinski
          tells you that he put on the same clothing
          the next morning, October 20, as he had on
          the night before.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Then in relation to this block of
          evidence, there is the evidence of [L.], that
          while both were in custody in North Bay,
          Babinski told him he committed the perfect
          crime, and that was in February 1989.  Four
          months had passed without the body of Eva
          Mead having been discovered.  Babinski was
          the only suspect in the death, that he must
          have been starting to feel pretty confident.
          He must have been &#150; according to his own
          evidence, he must have been feeling pretty
          good about the ad offering a reward for
          information.  After all, he says, he read it
          out loud.  Why would he do that? Is he
          pleased?  Of course he's pleased.  He would
          be, I suggest, if he had committed the crime,
          if he had committed the perfect crime.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    [L.] is entirely for you, but I
          wonder what he had to gain by coming here to
          give that evidence.  He seems to be getting
          some pretty stiff sentences, despite his
          being a witness for the Crown, and if this is
          just, as my friend suggests, another example
          of him trying to deceive somebody, it is a
          lot more sophisticated than his usual method,
          which is to write bad cheques, hope he can
          keep moving and then plead guilty when he's
          caught.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[75] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge referred to the
competing theories about L.&#146;s evidence.  However, he then
characterized that evidence as direct evidence of the appellant&#146;s
guilt:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Again, ladies and gentlemen, it is for you to say whether or
          not you accept [L.&#146;s] evidence, bearing in mind my earlier
          instruction to you about the need to proceed with the utmost of
          caution.  If, however, you do accept [L.&#146;s] evidence, and if you
          are further satisfied that when referring to the perfect crime
          Mr. Babinski was talking about the killing of Ms. Mead, you could
          certainly use this as evidence of a direct admission by Mr.
          Babinski that he was in fact the person who had killed Ms. Mead.
          That, like everything else, ladies and gentlemen is for you.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[76] It is also important to bear in mind that while the trial
judge gave the jury a Vetrovec warning in relation to L.&#146;s
evidence, he also instructed the jury that L.&#146;s evidence was
confirmed by other evidence.  This part of the charge also forms
a separate ground of appeal, but that direction bears on the
admissibility of the fresh evidence.  In this respect, the trial
judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>            You will recall that [L.] has a very long criminal record
          dating back to his youth.  Simply put, ladies and gentlemen, this
          man has essentially lived out a life of crime during his entire
          adult life.  He has been convicted of numerous offences involving
          dishonesty, including fraud, false pretences, break and enter and
          the like.  Also, he conceded in his testimony before you that he
          had spent many years misleading people who have trusted him.  In
          view of this, [L.] can only be described as a man of unsavory
          character.  In light of that, I direct you, as a matter of law,
          that you should proceed out of an abundance of caution before
          using anything that [L.] has said to find facts which would go to
          establish Mr. Babinski's guilt.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In directing you as I have, I am
          not saying that you cannot accept [L.]'s
          testimony.  If, despite his past, you are
          nevertheless satisfied that he has told you
          the truth in this courtroom, you are
          certainly at liberty to act upon his
          evidence.  However, as indicated, before
          doing so, you must proceed with the utmost of
          caution.  You should look carefully to see if
          there is other evidence which you accept
          which would serve to confirm [L.]'s evidence
          in a material particular, thereby rendering
          it more probable that his evidence is
          truthful and can be safely relied upon.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    For example, Mr. Babinski himself
          admitted that he did have a newspaper which
          contained an ad regarding a request for
          information relating to the disappearance of
          Ms. Mead.  Mr. Babinski stated that he read
          the ad aloud.  Now, you may look to that
          evidence, ladies and gentlemen, as a piece of
          evidence which might tend to confirm the
          testimony of [L.], thereby rendering it more
          probable that his evidence is true, such that
          it can be safely acted upon.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Whether or not you choose to act
          upon [L.]'s  evidence or any part of it is
          entirely up to you.  Later on, I will review
          with you in more detail the positions of both
          the Crown and the defence regarding his
          evidence.  Suffice it, though, to say at this
          time, by way of repetition, that before
          acting upon his evidence, given his prior
          unsavoury background and history, you must
          proceed with the utmost of caution.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[77] In summary, Crown counsel relied upon L.&#146;s evidence to fill
a gap in the prosecution&#146;s case arising from a lack of trace
evidence to connect the appellant to the crime.  The trial judge
instructed the jury that they could find that the appellant had
confessed to L., with the result that there was direct evidence
of his guilt.  Finally, the trial judge told the jury that L.&#146;s
evidence was confirmed by other admittedly true evidence.  The
undisclosed evidence and the fresh evidence impact upon the
reliability of that part of L.&#146;s evidence implicating the
appellant in the crime.  In my view, had the jury been aware of
the undisclosed evidence and the fresh evidence, it is a virtual
certainty that they would not have attached any weight to L.&#146;s
testimony.  That evidence does not merely go to L.&#146;s credibility;
it effectively destroys his credibility as it relates to the
appellant.  It demonstrates that in respect of the appellant, L.
is prepared to fabricate incriminating evidence.  In the result,
the only direct evidence implicating the appellant would have
disappeared from the case.
[78] In my view, the fresh evidence and the undisclosed evidence
would have had such a devastating effect on L.&#146;s evidence that,
when taken together with the evidence adduced at the trial, it
can, in Palmer terms, reasonably be expected to have affected the
result.  Returning to the application of the Dixon test of non-
disclosure, the non-disclosed evidence also affects the
reliability of the conviction. Accordingly, because both the non-
disclosed evidence and the evidence surrounding the recantation
independently undermine the reliability of the conviction, there
must be a new trial.
[79] Even if there were some doubt about the affect of this
evidence on the reliability of the conviction, in my view, it is
proper to consider the position taken by the Crown in its appeal
from the original acquittal.  The touchstone for admission of
fresh evidence is the interests of justice and accomplishing a
just result.  In the original Crown appeal from the acquittal,
the Crown urged this court and the Supreme Court of Canada to
find that the evidence of the jailhouse informers, L. and another
witness, Kutlesa, who did not testify on the second trial, was of
sufficient importance that the trial judge&#146;s failure to properly
deal with that evidence, when taken with misdirection as to post-
offence conduct (consciousness of guilt), was enough to overcome
a jury acquittal.  This court and the Supreme Court of Canada
accepted this argument and ordered a new trial.  An appellate
court will only overturn a jury acquittal in special
circumstances where the Crown can show that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had properly
directed the jury: R. v. Vézeau, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  Having
ordered a new trial in part on the basis of misdirection
regarding L.&#146;s evidence, it is difficult for this court to now
say that L.&#146;s evidence was so unimportant that removing it from
the trial could not have affected the verdict.  I could not find
that this would be a just result, even bearing in mind the
important distinctions between the first trial and the second
trial and that L. was not allowed to give as much evidence on
this trial as he did at the first trial.  As I have indicated,
Crown counsel at trial took full advantage of L.&#146;s testimony.  It
would not be in the interests of justice to let this conviction
stand.</pre>
    <pre>THE OTHER GROUNDS OF APPEAL
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The charge to the jury on L.&#146;s evidence</pre>
    <pre>[80] I have set out the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury
concerning L.&#146;s evidence.  The trial judge directed the jury that
the appellant&#146;s testimony admitting that he read aloud the
advertisement about the reward was capable of confirming L.&#146;s
testimony.  In the pre-charge conference, defence counsel
expressly conceded that this part of the appellant&#146;s evidence was
capable of confirming L.&#146;s evidence.  In view of the Crown&#146;s
position on this appeal that L. was an unreliable witness, it
seems unlikely that he would be called at the new trial.  Thus,
the question of whether or not this part of the appellant&#146;s
testimony would be capable of confirming L.&#146;s testimony is
unlikely to arise at the new trial.  In these circumstances,
there is no need to consider the merits of this ground of appeal.
I should not be taken as agreeing, however, that this evidence
was capable of confirming the inculpatory evidence provided by L.
As Laskin J.A. said in R. v. Brooks at p. 273: &#147;the courts should
not too readily conclude that any apparently confirming details
restore trust in the credibility of the jailhouse informants.&#148;
The fact that the police were offering a reward in the deceased&#146;s
disappearance was well publicized and a matter in which L. would
have had a particular interest given that he was an acquaintance
of the appellant and a police informer.  I have some doubts that
in the circumstances, the fact that the appellant admitted having
the newspaper and reading about the reward would be sufficient to
restore trust in L.&#146;s credibility.
          </pre>
    <pre>            2.      Post-offence conduct</pre>
    <pre>[81] The trial judge directed the jury that the appellant&#146;s
request to his uncle for a false alibi for the night that the
deceased disappeared was capable of supporting an inference of
consciousness of guilt.  Although this case preceded the decision
of this court and the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. White
(1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.) affirmed (1998), 125 C.C.C.
(3d) 385 (S.C.C.), the charge is essentially consistent with
those decisions.  In particular, the trial judge directed the
jury that the evidence of the post-offence conduct was simply
another piece of evidence that the jury should consider along
with all of the other evidence in deciding whether or not the
Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the only
reasonable inference was that the appellant killed the deceased.
[82] The appellant submits, however, that this is one of the rare
cases where the trial judge should have applied the criminal
standard of proof to the post-offence conduct evidence.  The
appellant relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
in R. v. MacKenzie, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 212.  In that case, the
accused had given an incriminating statement to the police.  The
Crown&#146;s case was based on that statement.  At trial, the
appellant testified and provided an exculpatory explanation for
the statement.  The trial judge had directed the jury that if
they found the accused&#146;s evidence at trial represented the true
facts, or if they had a reasonable doubt about it, they would
reject entirely the earlier statement to the police.  The Supreme
Court held that in the circumstances, this did not constitute
misdirection and was consistent with the trial judge&#146;s duty to
assist the jury in their deliberations.
[83] In R. v. White, the Supreme Court dealt with the application
of MacKenzie to cases of post-offence conduct (consciousness of
guilt).  It is clear from that discussion, that the exception to
the rule in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, that the criminal
burden of proof should not be applied to individual pieces of
evidence, is not limited to cases where the Crown&#146;s case entirely
depends upon a confession.  However, the circumstances in which a
trial judge would be justified, let alone required, to apply the
burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to evidence of post-
offence conduct are limited.  Major J. held as follows in White
at pp. 413-14:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This does not mean that a jury may never be instructed to
          apply the reasonable doubt standard to evidence of post-offence
          conduct. In the rare case where evidence of flight or concealment
          is the only evidence or constitutes substantially all of the
          evidence of the Crown, it follows that such evidence must be
          proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a conclusion
          of guilt, and it would not be error for the trial judge to make
          this clear to the jury. In addition, where evidence of post-
          offence conduct is so crucial to the Crown's case that the final
          determination of guilt necessarily turns upon it, and the
          evidence is subject to two directly conflicting interpretations,
          the trial judge would be justified in telling the jury that in
          choosing which theory to believe with respect to that evidence,
          they should consider the record as a whole and give the benefit
          of the doubt to the accused. As in MacKenzie, however, such a
          charge would only be proper if it did not involve any significant
          departure from the standard of proof that the jury would properly
          apply in any event by virtue of the general instruction on
          reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[84] This case does not fall within the first exception.  The
evidence about the false alibi does not constitute substantially
all of the evidence of the Crown.  There was a significant amount
of other circumstantial evidence such as the evidence of motive,
the wire on the body, the location of the body, the scratches to
the appellant&#146;s face and the appellant&#146;s dealings with the
employee at his place of work the night of the disappearance, all
of which went to support the Crown&#146;s case.
[85] I am also not satisfied that the evidence of the false alibi
was so crucial to the Crown&#146;s case, as it was developed at trial,
that the trial judge erred in law in failing to instruct the jury
that they should give the appellant the benefit of the doubt with
respect to his alibi.  There was no doubt that this was an
important piece of evidence.  If the jury rejected the
appellant&#146;s explanation for seeking a false alibi for the night
of October 19, 1988, that evidence was cogent evidence of a
guilty conscience.  However, it was not crucial to the Crown&#146;s
case at this trial.
[86] However, the request for an alibi had a second evidentiary
value.  That evidence was itself an important piece of
circumstantial evidence inasmuch as it suggested that the
appellant was seeking an alibi for a crime that arguably only the
killer and the police were aware had been committed.  As I
understand the evidence, it was not common knowledge on the
morning of October 20, 1988, that the deceased had disappeared or
that the police were seeking the appellant in connection with her
disappearance.6  Therefore, if the jury rejected the appellant&#146;s
explanation, this evidence not only showed consciousness of
guilt, but guilty knowledge at a critical time: see R. v.
Wildman, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311 at 326.  However, it appears this
evidence was not left to the jury on this second basis and
therefore the second White exception did not apply.
[87] If on the new trial, the Crown advances the theory that the
false alibi demonstrates knowledge that only the killer could
have had then, in my view, it would be open to the trial judge to
consider whether to invoke the second exception in White and in
the words of Major J. at p. 414 direct the jury that &#147;in choosing
which theory to believe with respect to that evidence, they
should consider the record as a whole and give the benefit of the
doubt to the accused&#148; with respect to his explanation.  In my
view, if the jury were to reject the appellant&#146;s explanation
then, as was said in Wildman at p. 326 in respect of a similar
type of evidence, the Crown&#146;s circumstantial case would be
&#147;overwhelming&#148;.
[88] Finally, the judge presiding on the new trial will, of
course, have the benefit of the decision in White and this
court&#146;s decision in R. v. Peavoy (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226
which set out the proper charge to the jury concerning after-the-
fact conduct and the desirability of avoiding the term
&#147;consciousness of guilt&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The time of death
          
</pre>
    <pre>[89] The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the
jury with respect to the evidence of the time of death.  In his
charge to the jury, the trial judge directed the jury that the
inability of the pathologist to pinpoint the time of death was
&#147;not terribly important&#148;.  Counsel for the appellant points out
that by October 20, 1988, the appellant was in custody and
therefore could not have been responsible for the murder, if the
deceased was killed after that time.  When taken in context, this
part of the charge did not constitute misdirection.  The trial
judge made it clear that the jury could only find the appellant
guilty if they were satisfied the deceased was killed the night
of October 19, or the earlier morning hours of the 20th.  The
pathologist&#146;s evidence as to time of death was essentially
neutral.  It merely showed that when the body was found the
deceased had been dead for a very long time, a time that included
October 1988.  In the impugned passage, the trial judge merely
made that point.
          </pre>
    <pre>            4.      The conviction for first degree murder
          
</pre>
    <pre>[90] The verdict of first degree murder was left with the jury
solely on the basis of a murder committed in the course of a
forcible confinement pursuant to s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal
Code.  The appellant argues that the conviction for first degree
murder was unreasonable.  In my view, there is no merit to this
submission.  There was substantial evidence that the deceased was
afraid of the appellant.  She had also told her mother shortly
before her disappearance of her intention to pick up her son for
hockey practice that evening.  Finally, her car was last seen
heading away from her home.  This evidence formed a reasonable
basis upon which the jury could conclude that, at that time, the
deceased would not willingly have accompanied the appellant, if
he was the killer, and that she must have been forcibly confined.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[91] Accordingly, I would admit the fresh evidence, allow the
appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial on the charge
of first degree murder.





</pre>
    <pre>RELEASED: April 30, 1999</pre>
    <pre>_______________________________
1    On October 20, 1997, Osborne J.A. ordered that the name of
this witness not be published.
2    R. v. McQuaid (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (S.C.C.); R. v.
Skinner (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 31 (S.C.C.); R. v. Smith (1998),
122 C.C.C. (3d) 27 (S.C.C.); R. v. Robart (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d)
36 (S.C.C.).
3    In light of Crown counsel&#146;s position in this appeal
concerning the evidence about the forged note and the other
aspects of the fresh evidence, such a step was unnecessary in
this case.
     4    See for example, Cory J. in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1
     S.C.R. 742 at 758:
          In a case where credibility is important, the trial
          judge must instruct the jury that the rule of
          reasonable doubt applies to that issue. The trial judge
          should instruct the jury that they need not firmly
          believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses.
          Specifically, the trial judge is required to instruct
          the jury that they must acquit the accused in two
          situations. First, if they believe the accused.
          Secondly, if they do not believe the accused's evidence
          but still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt after
          considering the accused's evidence in the context of
          the evidence as a whole &#133; [Emphasis added.]
5 See, for example, R. v. V. (D.) (1995), 60 B.C.A.C. 163 and R.
v. Thomson (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (B.C.C.A.)
6    The accused professed to be seeking the false alibi for the
evening of October 19, 1988 because he had been in breach of his
curfew.  He asked his uncle to say he was with him at
approximately 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. on October 19.  His curfew did
not start until 10:00 p.m.</pre></td>
