    <pre>HEARD:         March 24, 1999</pre>
    <pre>               On appeal from His Honour Judge A.L. Eddy dated
               January 22, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raised three grounds of appeal. We called on
Crown counsel to respond only to the submission that the trial
judge did not take into account the mens rea required for the
offence of uttering a death threat. The grounds of appeal on
which we did not call on Crown counsel to respond are, first,
that the trial judge failed to apply the Supreme Court of
Canada&#146;s judgment in W.D. and thus erred in dealing with the
issue of the burden of proof and, second, that the verdict was
unreasonable.

[2]  The trial judge accepted the evidence of the victim and the
neighbours who testified at the trial. He therefore implicitly
rejected the appellant&#146;s evidence which was directly contrary to
the evidence that he accepted. In the circumstances, we do not
think that the trial judge was required to do more. There is thus
no merit in the submission that the trial judge did not properly
apply the burden of proof. Moreover, there was ample evidence to
support the verdict. We therefore see no merit in the submission
that the verdict was unreasonable.

[3]  The trial judge did not deal explicitly with the mens rea
required for the offence of uttering a death threat. We assume
this was because it was not made a live issue at the trial.
Having regard to the content of the threat, the circumstances in
which the threat was made and the absence of evidence,
particularly from the appellant, that the threat was not to be
taken seriously, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the
threat was intended to be taken seriously. Thus, we think that
the mens rea of the offence was established.

[4]  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
