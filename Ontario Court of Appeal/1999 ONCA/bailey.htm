    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Marchand, sitting with
a jury, dated February 14, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals the decision of a jury awarding her
minimal damages for injuries sustained as a result of a motor
vehicle accident.  She also appeals the dismissal of her action
by Marchand J. who found that the injuries did not meet the
threshold within the meaning of s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act.
[2]  Dealing firstly with the threshold issue the trial judge
reviewed the relevant medical evidence, the background of the
appellant, and her complaints as a result of the accident.  He
concluded that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff did not
meet the threshold under s. 266(1).
[3]  In our view, the trial judge correctly applied the decision
of this Court in  Meyer v. Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129. His
decision does not reveal any misunderstanding or misapprehension
of the evidence and is amply supported by the evidence.  This
conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.
[4]  As to the jury verdict, the jury awarded total damages of
$9,900 for general damages, loss of income, and special damages.
The charge to the jury, when read as a whole, was fair and
balanced and appropriate in the circumstances of this case.  We
note that there was no objection to the charge.  The jury had to
resolve important issues of credibility in light of conflicting
evidence and it did not accept the extent of the injuries and the
disabilities alleged by the appellant.  The findings of the jury
are reasonable and supported by the evidence.
[5]  We see no proper basis for the admission of fresh evidence
and no basis to interfere with the trial judge's ruling or with
the jury's verdict.
[6]  The appeal is dismissed with costs, if demanded.
