    <pre><strong>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>RE:            DR. ROBERT G. BAKER (Plaintiff/Appellant)
               v. BOY SCOUTS OF CANADA (Defendant/Respondent)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, CHARRON and BORINS JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Stephen J. Grace,
               for the appellant, responding party and moving party
               by cross-motion</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               William L. Vanveen,
               for the respondent, moving party and respondent party
               to the cross-motion</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         January 21, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                          ENDORSEMENT
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks to appeal from an order a) denying leave</pre>
    <pre>to amend his Statement of Claim b) refusing to determine the</pre>
    <pre>admissibility in evidence at trial of correspondence between</pre>
    <pre>counsel and c) striking out portions of his pleading. The</pre>
    <pre>respondent brings a motion to quash the appeal on several</pre>
    <pre>grounds.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In our view, the order denying leave to amend the pleadings</pre>
    <pre>is clearly interlocutory in nature and this court has no</pre>
    <pre>jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from that decision.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  While we are inclined to the view that the appeal with</pre>
    <pre>respect to the question of admissibility of evidence is without</pre>
    <pre>merit as this is a matter for the trial judge to decide, we do</pre>
    <pre>not need to address the question of merit because the order in</pre>
    <pre>this respect is also interlocutory in nature and no appeal</pre>
    <pre>therefrom lies to this court.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  It is also our view that the appeal from the order striking</pre>
    <pre>out parts of the Statement of Claim should be quashed.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Pleadings referring to a duty to act fairly are relevant to</pre>
    <pre>the cause of action for damages for wrongful dismissal as</pre>
    <pre>determined in Wallace v. United Grain Growers Limited, [1997] 3</pre>
    <pre>S.C.R. 701. However, as the Supreme Court determined in Wallace,</pre>
    <pre>there is no independent cause of action for Abad faith</pre>
    <pre>discharge@.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Consequently, the order striking out the references to a</pre>
    <pre>duty to act fairly, insofar as the pleadings related to the cause</pre>
    <pre>of action for damages for wrongful dismissal, is interlocutory in</pre>
    <pre>nature and this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the</pre>
    <pre>appeal. Insofar as the pleadings purported to raise a separate</pre>
    <pre>cause of action based on a duty to act fairly, the order is</pre>
    <pre>clearly correct and any appeal from the order in that respect is</pre>
    <pre>devoid of merit.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In the result, the motion to quash must succeed. The motion</pre>
    <pre>is allowed with costs and the appeal is quashed.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In the circumstances, there is no need to deal with the</pre>
    <pre>cross-motion seeking an extension of time. It is dismissed</pre>
    <pre>without costs.</pre></td>
