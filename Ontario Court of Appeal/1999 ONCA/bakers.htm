    <pre>COUNSEL:       Tony Van Klink, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Lawrence F. Wallach, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 23, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (O&#146;Leary,
Lofchik and Matlow JJ.A.) dated January 18, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal arises from a landlord and tenant relationship.
The respondent landlord entered into a lease with the appellant
tenant who, in turn, entered into a sublease with its franchisee.
The tenant had a dispute with its franchisee and sub-tenant that
resulted in non-payment of rent.  As a result of the non-payment
of rent, the landlord terminated the lease of the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant brought an application in January 1998 for
relief from forfeiture of its lease with the respondent.  The
respondent filed an affidavit in response.  The appellant wished
to cross-examine the respondent on its affidavit and requested an
adjournment in order to do so.  It was granted and the record was
endorsed as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          At request of Baker&#146;s Dozen matter is
          adjourned to permit cross examination on
          affidavits with a view to determining, inter
          alia, who is/are the tenant(s).  As a
          condition of the adjournment arrears of rent
          of $17,161.80 as of 98.02.01 are to be
          forthwith paid to the landlord, i.e. on or
          before 98.02.10.  Costs of today reserved to
          disposition (illegible) return date 98.02.19.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[3]  Baker&#146;s Dozen abandoned its application for relief from
forfeiture and did not make the payment.  On the return of the
motion, Belleghem J. ordered Baker&#146;s Dozen to pay Doovsal
$8,119.31 as arrears of rent for December and January.  An appeal
to the Divisional Court was dismissed by O&#146;Leary J. with Lafchik
J. agreeing; Matlow J. dissenting.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We agree with the dissenting judge, Matlow J., when he said:</pre>
    <pre>          In my view, the order made by Langdon J.
          imposed an obligation on the appellant to
          make the specified payment to the respondent
          as a condition of remaining entitled to
          proceed with its application on the new
          return date.</pre>
    <pre>          It did not impose any liability on the
          appellant merely in return for the granting
          of the adjournment. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          The appellant retained the right not to
          satisfy the condition imposed, namely, the
          making of the stipulated payment, with the
          resulting consequence that it would not be
          permitted to proceed with its application.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The effect of this reasoning is that, in the absence of a
cross-application or an admission of liability, the respondent
was not entitled to any judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of the
Divisional Court is set aside as is paragraph 1 of the judgment
of Belleghem J.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the
abandoned application awarded by Belleghem J. in the amount of
$2,250.  The appellant is entitled to costs of this appeal and in
the Divisional Court to be assessed.</pre>
