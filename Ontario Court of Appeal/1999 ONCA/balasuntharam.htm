                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal by the appellants from their convictions
before Langdon J., sitting without a jury, of possession of
weapons dangerous to the public peace and possession of a
prohibited weapon.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This is a common sense case.  Four young men were driving
along in a small car with tinted windows shortly before midnight.
It was midnight. when their vehicle was   stopped by a member of
the Peel Regional Police.  The officer stopped the car because he
thought that the tinted windows violated the Highway Traffic Act,
but when he smelled alcohol on the driver&#146;s breath and saw beer
bottles in the back seat, he searched the car.  An AK-47 rifle
and two 17-round clips lay in a bag in the foot well of the
cramped back seat.  Another bag, containing a loaded sawed-off
shotgun, was in the trunk.  As the trial judge observed, human
experience tells us that property of this nature &#147;simply would
not be the subject of unknowing possession.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[3]  None of the appellants was carrying a stitch of personal
property:  no identification, no money, no keys, no cricket gear
? nothing.  The trial judge was justified in relying on this as
an extremely incriminating circumstance.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The car itself was &#147;clean&#148;.  It did not belong to any of the
occupants.  The driver, (the appellant Koneswaran) had the keys
but no driver&#146;s licence or vehicle-related documents.  He told
the officer who stopped the car that he had borrowed the car from
a friend whose identity was never established by this appellant.
If necessary, the appellants could have abandoned the vehicle and
it could not have been traced back to them.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The owner, one Anan, had lent the car to his friend, Arul,
on the understanding that it be returned the same evening.
Within three hours, the appellants were found in the car with the
guns and ammunition.  It can reasonably be inferred that Arul
gave the car to one or more of the appellants as a means of
transporting the weapons.  The total absence of ownership or
insurance documents permitted Arul to claim that someone had
stolen the car if it was ever traced back to him.  But in the
end, that was not necessary because Arul disappeared and was
never found.  He did, however, know enough on Sundaytwo days
later to tell Anan that the police had impounded his car because
someone had been caught drinking and driving.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The principal complaint of the appellants was that the trial
judge was misled by the changing positions of Crown counsel at
trial into making conflicting findings in convicting the four
appellants.  Specifically, the alleged conflict related to
whether the appellants had stolen the car or were part of a joint
scheme with Arul.  We find no conflict of substance in the
findings of the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In his ruling on the voir dire dealing with the search and
seizure of the firearms in the motor vehicle, the trial judge
found that the appellant driver had not called any evidence to
show that he had an honest belief that the person who lent him
the car had the authority of the owner to do so.  The owner
testified to the contrary.  Accordingly, the appellants could not
satisfy the onus on them to show that they had an expectation of
privacy in the vehicle and that it followed from this that their
s.8 Charter rights had been violated.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  None of the appellants testified and the defence led no
evidence establishing that the vehicle was stolen. In his reasons
convicting the appellants, the trial judge rejected the
suggestion made the by counsel for the appellants who had not
testified that they had stolen the motor vehicle in question,
that unbeknownst to them, the firearms were already in the car
and they were not aware of that fact when the vehicle was
stopped.  Instead, the trial judge adopted essentially the theory
of the Crown that the weapons had been placed in the car by the
person who lent the appellants the vehicle or that the appellants
had picked up the weapons after obtaining the vehicle but, in any
event, all of the occupants knew of the presence of the firearms.
Any conflict in these findings is inconsequential and does not
change the fact that there was ample support for the conclusion
that the appellants had knowledge that the weapons were in the
vehicle.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Accordingly, the appeals against conviction are dismissed.
The application for leave to appeal sentence by the appellant
Kandasamy was not proceeded with and is dismissed.</pre>
