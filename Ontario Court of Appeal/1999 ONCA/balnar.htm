appeal</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 31, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice T.D. Marshall, dated
July 6, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Akhtar Mahmood Syed, Amina Syed, Zenaida Mauricio and Zafar
Mahmood Syed, collectively referred to as the appellants, appeal
from the order setting aside certain conveyances of land and
mortgages as being contrary to the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act, the Fraudulent Conveyances Act and the Assignments and
Preferences Act. The conveyances were made by Akhtar Syed (Dr.
Syed) in favour of  Amina Syed and Zenaida Mauricio (the
Spouses), and Zafar Mahmood Syed (the Son).
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  With respect to the land transferred to the Son, the trial
judge found that, at the time of the transfer on November 7,
1989, Syed was unable to pay his debts.  He further found that
the beneficial interest in the land did not pass to the Son, in
part because a mortgage executed by Syed and a transfer to the
Spouses on March 13, 1991 also included the severed lands and
also because, after the transfer, the land continued to be used
as before.  The trial judge was entitled to come to the
conclusion he did.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  With respect to the Home Lands and the Farm Lands the
appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in not recognizing
the contribution of the Spouses to the acquisition of the
properties. At p. 39 of his reasons, the trial judge stated:</pre>
    <pre>          Here, in the court&#146;s view, the two spouses
          who claim, through a trust, were on the
          evidence part of the common enterprise of Dr.
          Syed&#146;s Family. Just as they would have and
          indeed did share in the gains, they should
          share in the losses.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant submits that, in making this comment, the
trial judge ignored the real questions he was obliged to address.
They are whether there was a common intention by the parties that
the Spouses had an interest in the property prior to Dr. Syed&#146;s
inability to pay his debts leading to a resulting trust or
whether a constructive trust should be imposed.  The trial judge
found that no resulting trust existed. There is no issue that the
Spouses contributed their earnings throughout the relationship to
a savings account which was used for family and business
purposes.  The trial judge was entitled to find, as he did, that
there was no clear and cogent explanation with respect to many of
the transactions and that he could not conclude that the funds
contributed were specifically used to purchase the properties.
There also is documentary evidence which supports his conclusion
that the parties did not intend the Spouses to have a proprietary
interest in the properties. Prior to the transfer of the whole
properties to the Spouses, a portion of one of the properties was
severed and transferred to the Son in trust, large mortgages over
these same properties were granted to the Spouses, and the
affidavit of land transfer tax on the transfer to the Spouses did
not disclose any consideration.
[5]  The trial judge also refused to impose a constructive trust.
Having regard to the balancing of interests between the Spouses
and creditors of the Husband, we agree that this is not a case
which calls for the equitable remedy of constructive trust to be
imposed on the Husband in respect of the properties in lieu of
damages.
[6]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
