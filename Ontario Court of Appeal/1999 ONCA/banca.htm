</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a decision of Hoilett J. dated August 26, 1996,
and addenda dated February 5, 1996 and July 3, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants, Baytin Holdings and Russell and Tina Bayko,
appeal those parts of the judgment of Hoilett J. dealing with the
issues of indemnity and costs.
[2]  The Berkindale joint venture was financed by the bank.  The
bank's loan was secured by way of a first mortgage and various
guarantees.
[3]  As a result of a disagreement among the joint venturers,
Finestkind purchased the interests of its co-venturers.  On the
sale of the property, in order to obtain a deed conveying title
to the purchasers, Finestkind had to agree to indemnify and save
harmless its co-venturers from any loss sustained as a result of
the execution of the deed.
[4]  Following the sale of the property, the bank sued the co-
venturers, the guarantors and others to recover the shortfall.
[5]  The appellants raise three issues on this appeal.
[6]  The first issue is with respect to the scope of the
indemnity owed by Finestkind to the  appellant Baytin Holdings.
The trial judge made no finding of an indemnity being an implied
term of the sale of the appellant&#146;s share of the joint venture in
May 1990 and there is no basis for us to do so.  The written
indemnity given in December 1990 cannot, in our view, be
stretched to cover the appellant&#146;s full losses.  Indeed, were it
up to us, we would find the indemnity agreement  limited to those
losses flowing from the execution of the deed.
[7]  With respect to the trial judge&#146;s quantification of the
amount of the indemnity, there was an evidentiary basis for this
finding and hence we would not interfere.  This ground of appeal
therefore fails.
[8]  Secondly, the appellant Baytin Holdings argues that it is
entitled to full indemnity from Hui Hune &amp; Wong, the solicitors
for the purchasers of the property.  The trial judge found that
the indemnity of the solicitors extended only to the holdback
moneys.  We see no basis to extend the indemnity of the
solicitors further.  We were advised during the hearing of the
appeal that counsel had agreed as to the proper rate of interest
to be paid by the solicitors on the amount which they owe
pursuant to the findings of the trial judge.
[9]  Finally, Baytin Holdings argues that the trial judge erred
in the disposition of the costs of the trial.  In our view, the
trial judge considered all the relevant circumstances in his
disposition of the costs of the claims, counterclaims and cross-
claims.   Keeping in mind the considerable discretion allowed to
the trial judge on the issue of costs, we see no basis to
interfere.
[10] In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
