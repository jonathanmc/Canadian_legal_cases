    <pre>HEARD:    June 2, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of J. Bell J., dated February 8,
1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant instituted an action for damages against the
respondent Kenmar Doors Ltd. (&#147;Kenmar&#148;) after applying for and
receiving benefits for his injuries from the respondent Workers&#146;
Compensation Board (&#147;WCB&#148;).  He then applied to WCB for
permission to proceed with his action notwithstanding the receipt
of these benefits.  An agreement was made whereby he was given
permission to have carriage of the proceedings so long as he
protected the interests of the WCB and did not involve it in an
exposure as to costs.  Subsequently, the respondent Kenmar had
WCB added as a party to the action.  WCB regarded this as a
breach of its agreement with the appellant.  The issue was
referred to the motions judge for resolution with WCB maintaining
that the action should be stayed and Kenmar that it should be
dismissed.
[2]  The motions judge made an order declaring that no agreement
exists between the appellant and WCB granting permission to the
appellant to proceed with the action.  She then declared that WCB
is dominus litis in the action.  The formal order also reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the Plaintiffs deliver
          their file to the Defendant, Workers&#146; Compensation Board, in
          order that the Defendant, Workers&#146; Compensation Board, have an
          opportunity to examine and consider fully its position and that
          of the Plaintiffs so that it may decide whether to maintain,
          compromise or discontinue this action.
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the
          motions of the Defendant, Workers&#146;
          Compensation Board, and the Defendant, Kenmar
          Doors Ltd., to stay or dismiss the within
          action should be adjourned sine die to be
          returned no earlier than six months from the
          date of this Order on seven days notice.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The first order of business before us is a motion by WCB to
quash the order in appeal on the basis that it is interlocutory
and not final. In our view, the motion judge&#146;s order is an
exercise in case management. Faced with a dispute between the
appellant and WCB as to whether there was a breach of the
agreement between them covering the conduct of the action
instituted by the appellant, the motions judge held that the
original agreement had been breached by the appellant and that
the WCB was now in charge of the action if it cared to proceed
with it.  She ordered that the file be delivered to the WCB so it
could make a decision and in the meantime the motions for stay
and dismissal were adjourned.
[4]  The effect of the orders is that WCB has a minimum of six
months to decide whether to continue this action or decline to do
so. Depending on its decision, the action will either go forward
under the aegis of the WCB or the appellant. Until the decision
is made, and the matter is returned to the motions judge, there
is no final disposition of any issue between the appellant and
Kenmar in this matter. At that time, the motions of the
respondents will be dealt with.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is quashed with costs.</pre>
