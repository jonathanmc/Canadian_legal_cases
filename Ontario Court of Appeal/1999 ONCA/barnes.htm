    <pre><strong>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v.
               JEFFREY BARNES (Appellant)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, ROSENBERG and O'CONNOR JJ.A.</strong></pre>

               for the appellant</strong></pre>

</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence by a court</pre>
    <pre>composed of Dunn J. and a jury at Brampton. At the conclusion of</pre>
    <pre>argument of this appeal, the court indicated that the appeal from</pre>
    <pre>conviction for dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily</pre>
    <pre>harm was dismissed, that the appeal from conviction for impaired</pre>
    <pre>operation was allowed and the conviction set aside, and that the</pre>
    <pre>appeal from sentence was allowed and the sentence reduced to two</pre>
    <pre>years less one day imprisonment. These are the reasons for that</pre>
    <pre>disposition.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   The application for a mistrial

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Prior to trial, Crown counsel decided not to tender any</pre>
    <pre>evidence of the results of testing of the appellant’s blood</pre>
    <pre>alcohol level. It appears that the Crown had determined that the</pre>
    <pre>results would be ruled inadmissible because of a violation of the</pre>
    <pre>appellant’s rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and</pre>
    <pre>Freedoms. In his opening address, counsel for the Crown at trial,</pre>
    <pre>Mr. Raftery, set out the evidence he anticipated would come from</pre>
    <pre>civilian witnesses as to the appellant’s statement of impairment.</pre>
    <pre>He then said the following:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The police arrived, and, because of certain
          rulings, you are not going to hear much in
          the way of actual police first hand evidence.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]       Following the opening address, defence counsel</pre>
    <pre>immediately moved for a mistrial. Crown counsel acknowledged that</pre>
    <pre>the remark was improper but submitted that any prejudice to the</pre>
    <pre>appellant could be cured by an appropriate instruction to the</pre>
    <pre>jury. The trial judge agreed and dismissed the motion for a</pre>
    <pre>mistrial.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]       The remark by Crown counsel was inaccurate and highly</pre>
    <pre>improper. There had been no rulings of any kind. More</pre>
    <pre>importantly, it was entirely wrong for Crown counsel to suggest</pre>
    <pre>to the jury that they would be deprived of hearing certain</pre>
    <pre>evidence because of legal rulings by the trial judge. Given that</pre>
    <pre>the proceedings were at such an early stage, the trial judge, out</pre>
    <pre>of an abundance of caution, might well have declared a mistrial.</pre>
    <pre>However, the trial judge was of the view that any prejudice could</pre>
    <pre>be cured by an appropriate instruction to the jury and we have</pre>
    <pre>not been persuaded that he improperly exercised his discretion to</pre>
    <pre>refuse the mistrial.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   The inadmissible hearsay

</pre>
    <pre>[5]       Two civilian witnesses testified that the appellant</pre>
    <pre>seemed to be drunk. They were extensively cross-examined to the</pre>
    <pre>effect that they had not told this to the investigating officer.</pre>
    <pre>Both witnesses claimed that they had told the officer, Constable</pre>
    <pre>Mullen, but that he had apparently not included these</pre>
    <pre>observations in their statements. For example, the following</pre>
    <pre>occurred with the witness Grewal:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Q.   And, so you are saying that at that time
          you never told him why you thought that, you
          never told him what you observed, in other
          words, that night?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   No that’s why I just, only just told him
          he seemed to be drunk, he said, when he was
          writing report, he said, Oh, we’ll find out
          [the] proper way, you know whatever, blood or
          breathalyser. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[6]       In the absence of the jury, defence counsel again moved</pre>
    <pre>for a mistrial. Crown counsel resisted the application and</pre>
    <pre>submitted that any prejudice could be cured by an appropriate</pre>
    <pre>jury instruction. The trial judge agreed and dismissed the</pre>
    <pre>application.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]       Much the same thing occurred with the witness Levy. In</pre>
    <pre>re-examination, he was asked if, when he took the statement,</pre>
    <pre>Constable Mullen had directed the witness’ attention to any</pre>
    <pre>particular area. Levy replied:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The gentleman was drunk and driving and the
          police even tested him, the police even
          tested him and said— [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[8]       Crown counsel then cut the witness off and instructed</pre>
    <pre>the witness not to discuss what the police did. Defence counsel</pre>
    <pre>asked for a mistrial, which was again refused. The trial judge</pre>
    <pre>gave these reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Counsel, as I say again, I can’t agree that
          there is a potential for injustice in the
          matter. The other side is the thing that
          would occur to me. There’s a potential that
          it won’t work to the benefit of the accused
          but I, so far I haven’t had any concerns
          especially, hopefully, knowing that the jury
          know what they know, what evidence they must
          weigh, and, when I finish the charge, they
          will know even better. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[9]       We would not interfere with the trial judge’s decision</pre>
    <pre>refusing a mistrial. The trial judge was in the best position to</pre>
    <pre>determine the effect of the impugned answers. We also note that</pre>
    <pre>it is not entirely clear that the comments, especially those by</pre>
    <pre>the witness Grewal, were inadmissible. Defence counsel was</pre>
    <pre>pursuing Grewal on his alleged failure to tell the officer of his</pre>
    <pre>observations as to the appellant’s condition at the scene. This</pre>
    <pre>was an allegation of recent fabrication. The witness was entitled</pre>
    <pre>to rebut the allegation by testifying that he had in fact told</pre>
    <pre>the officer and to provide at least some of the context in which</pre>
    <pre>he had done so. The comments were admissible for that limited</pre>
    <pre>purpose. They were obviously not admissible, however, as proof</pre>
    <pre>that the police had conducted tests or that the tests had proved</pre>
    <pre>that the appellant was impaired. Accordingly, it would have been</pre>
    <pre>preferable if the witnesses had been instructed, in the absence</pre>
    <pre>of the jury, not to refer to any testing by the police.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] Although the trial judge indicated that he would cure any</pre>
    <pre>possible prejudice in his jury instructions, he failed to do so.</pre>
    <pre>On three occasions, the trial judge instructed the jury that they</pre>
    <pre>were to be governed “solely by the evidence introduced at the</pre>
    <pre>trial and by absolutely nothing else”. In the circumstances of</pre>
    <pre>this case that was not sufficient. The problem was that the jury</pre>
    <pre>had heard some “evidence introduced at the trial” that was either</pre>
    <pre>not admissible or was admissible only for a limited purpose.</pre>
    <pre>Particularly in light of Crown counsel’s opening comments, it was</pre>
    <pre>essential that the trial judge direct the jury in the clearest of</pre>
    <pre>terms that there was no evidence of any testing by the police.</pre>
    <pre>The jury should have been told to ignore the hearsay comments by</pre>
    <pre>the witnesses Levy and Grewal who obviously would have had no</pre>
    <pre>first-hand knowledge of any investigation performed by the</pre>
    <pre>police.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] In view of this error, the conviction for impaired operation</pre>
    <pre>cannot stand. Ordinarily, the appropriate disposition would be a</pre>
    <pre>new trial. However, the admissible evidence of impairment was</pre>
    <pre>slight. The appellant had been injured in the accident and the</pre>
    <pre>observations of the civilian witnesses are consistent with the</pre>
    <pre>effects of the accident. In the circumstances, we would allow the</pre>
    <pre>appeal, set aside the conviction for impaired operation and enter</pre>
    <pre>an acquittal. In view of this disposition, it is unnecessary to</pre>
    <pre>deal with the submission that, in any event, this verdict is</pre>
    <pre>perverse.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] We are satisfied that this error did not affect the validity</pre>
    <pre>of the convictions for dangerous driving causing death and</pre>
    <pre>causing bodily harm. The jury acquitted the appellant of the</pre>
    <pre>offences of impaired operation causing death and causing bodily</pre>
    <pre>harm and convicted only of impaired operation simpliciter. The</pre>
    <pre>trial judge instructed the jurors that to convict of the full</pre>
    <pre>offences they need only find that the appellant’s impairment was</pre>
    <pre>a contributing cause of death, outside the de minimus range. By</pre>
    <pre>its verdict, the jury was obviously not satisfied that any</pre>
    <pre>impairment contributed to the accident, which was solely</pre>
    <pre>attributable to the other causes such as excessive speed. The</pre>
    <pre>evidence that the collision was caused by the appellant’s</pre>
    <pre>dangerous driving was overwhelming in this case.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   The Crown’s closing address
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant submits that Crown counsel’s jury address was
improper by suggesting that there was some onus on the defence to
call Constable Mullen and that not having done so the jury could
infer that his evidence would not contradict the witnesses Grewal
and Levy. By the end of the trial, there was no evidence to
contradict Grewal and Levy in their assertions that they had told
Mullen about their observations of the appellant at the scene. It
was open to Crown counsel to point that out to the jury. We have
not been persuaded that the comments by Crown counsel were
improper or misleading. In particular, we are not satisfied that
Mullen’s preliminary hearing testimony conclusively establishes
that Grewal and Levy did not tell him about the appellant’s
condition. This part of the jury address is at worst confusing.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Crown counsel also said the following in his address:
          </pre>
    <pre>          As counsel for the Crown I don’t have an
          individual client. I have a duty in placing
          before you evidence upon which you must
          render your decision. If the Crown wanted to
          keep out evidence…the Crown did not have to
          call, for instance, a witness who would say,
          “No, I didn’t hear slurring of speech.”  But
          the Crown did, because the Crown’s duty here
          is to place before you—let’s put it this way:
          The Crown’s ultimate duty to society is to
          see that justice is done, not representing an
          accused. I have tried to do so in a manner
          which is consistent with that duty that has
          to be done.
</pre>
    <pre>[15] This kind of comment should be avoided. It may be</pre>
    <pre>misinterpreted by the jury and leave the jury with the impression</pre>
    <pre>that the Crown would not have brought the prosecution if the</pre>
    <pre>accused were not guilty. The comments also unfairly diminish the</pre>
    <pre>role of defence counsel. As Hoyt C.J.N.B. observed in R. v. Pitt</pre>
    <pre>(1996), 109 C.C.C. (3d) 488 (N.B.C.A.), leave to appeal to</pre>
    <pre>Supreme Court of Canada refused (1997), 211 N.R. 319n., at p. 504</pre>
    <pre>“Crown counsel’s performance should render a description of his</pre>
    <pre>or her role unnecessary”. However, as in Pitt, we are not</pre>
    <pre>satisfied that the comments prejudiced the appellant’s trial.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          4.   Improper remarks by Crown counsel

</pre>
    <pre>[16] On several occasions, while defence counsel was attempting</pre>
    <pre>to cross-examine Crown witnesses, Mr. Raftery interjected with</pre>
    <pre>what can only be characterized as smart-aleck comments. These</pre>
    <pre>comments were unhelpful and demeaning of his office and the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge ought to have warned counsel to desist. However, these</pre>
    <pre>inappropriate interjections did not prejudice the appellant’s</pre>
    <pre>case nor deprive him of a fair trial.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          5.   Charge to the jury on reasonable doubt

</pre>
    <pre>[17] This case was tried prior to the release of the decision of</pre>
    <pre>the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C.</pre>
    <pre>(3d) 1 and thus does not entirely conform with the model charge</pre>
    <pre>proposed in that decision. The appellant submits that there was</pre>
    <pre>misdirection because the trial judge directed the jury that proof</pre>
    <pre>beyond a reasonable doubt is attained when the jurors feel “sure”</pre>
    <pre>or “certain” of the accused’s guilt but that mathematical</pre>
    <pre>certainty is not essential. Counsel for the appellant argues that</pre>
    <pre>this direction is fatal since it was not coupled with a direction</pre>
    <pre>that proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires more than “probable</pre>
    <pre>guilt”. He relies upon the dissenting reasons of Twaddle J.A. in</pre>
    <pre>R. v. Starr (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Man. C.A.). [An appeal</pre>
    <pre>to the Supreme Court of Canada based on the dissent was heard on</pre>
    <pre>December 3, 1998 and judgment reserved.]

</pre>
    <pre>[18] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The</pre>
    <pre>charge to the jury in this case conforms to the charge in common</pre>
    <pre>use in this province prior to Lifchus. This court has upheld the</pre>
    <pre>use of these directions on several occasions:  See, for example,</pre>
    <pre>R. v. Arsenault, [1997] O.J. No. 3977 (Q.L.), leave to appeal to</pre>
    <pre>Supreme Court of Canada dismissed April 2, 1998 and R. v.</pre>
    <pre>Atkinson, [1997] O.J. No. 4788 (QL). We are not persuaded that</pre>
    <pre>the jury was misled as to the burden of proof on the Crown or of</pre>
    <pre>the meaning of reasonable doubt.

</pre>
    <pre>[19] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction for dangerous</pre>
    <pre>operation causing death and causing bodily harm is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          6.   The sentence appeal

</pre>
    <pre>[20] The appellant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on</pre>
    <pre>the dangerous operation charges. These were serious offences and,</pre>
    <pre>in view of the appellant’s prior record, deserving of a</pre>
    <pre>substantial prison sentence. However, in our view, the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge erred in principle in imposing sentence upon the appellant</pre>
    <pre>on the basis that the “dangerous driving that caused the injury</pre>
    <pre>and caused the death [was] alcohol related”. By acquitting the</pre>
    <pre>appellant of the full offences of impaired operation causing</pre>
    <pre>death and bodily harm, the jury rejected this theory and the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge was bound by this finding:  R. v. Brown, [1991] 2</pre>
    <pre>S.C.R. 518. In our view, an appropriate sentence is two years</pre>
    <pre>less one day imprisonment.

</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellant submitted that if this court imposed a</pre>
    <pre>reformatory sentence, we should make the sentence a conditional</pre>
    <pre>sentence of imprisonment. In our view, the appellant has not</pre>
    <pre>satisfied the condition that “serving the sentence in the</pre>
    <pre>community would not endanger the safety of the community” within</pre>
    <pre>the meaning of s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code. The appellant has</pre>
    <pre>prior convictions for Criminal Code driving offences and was</pre>
    <pre>convicted of several speeding offences while awaiting trial on</pre>
    <pre>these charges. Excessive speed was the principal factor in the</pre>
    <pre>collision that occurred in this case. Accordingly, this is not an</pre>
    <pre>appropriate case for a conditional sentence.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          Disposition

</pre>
    <pre>[22] In summary, the appeal from conviction for impaired</pre>
    <pre>operation is allowed, the conviction quashed and an acquittal</pre>
    <pre>entered. The appeal from conviction is otherwise dismissed. Leave</pre>
    <pre>to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal from sentence is</pre>
    <pre>allowed and the sentence reduced to two years less one day</pre>
    <pre>imprisonment concurrent on both counts. The driving prohibition</pre>
    <pre>will stand.</pre></td>
