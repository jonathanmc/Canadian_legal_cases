    <pre>HEARD:         April 12, 1999</pre>
    <pre>APPEAL
FROM:          G. Mossop J. dated July 11, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal must be allowed.  The proceeding arises out of
an industrial accident which occurred on September 12, 1994.  The
information was sworn on September 8, 1995 within the year
limited for such proceedings by s. 69 of the Occupational Health
and Safety Act.
[2]  What happened thereafter was either a comedy or tragedy of
errors depending upon one&#146;s perspective.  The main reason for the
errors was the amalgamation of the employing company under a
slightly different name on June 1, 1995 and then the continuation
of that amalgamated company under quite a different name, Bauer
Inc., on June 1, 1996.
[3]  Court appearances have been made by a variety of counsel in
a number of capacities apparently on behalf of the employer
and/or one or other of the corporate manifestations of the
company.  The net result is that one of the counts in the
information has been dismissed with no appeal.  The other has not
been tried.  There was an order for trial by Judge Woolcott on
January 27, 1997.  This was set aside by Mr. Justice Mossop on
July 11, 1997.  The Ministry appeals from that decision.
[4]  It is a matter of public interest that the procedural
skirmishing be stopped and that this matter be heard on its
merits.  If the reasons of Mr. Justice Mossop are intended to
conclude that the information already issued cannot be amended,
then clearly they are in error.  It is ordered that the order of
Mr. Justice Mossop be set aside, that the matter be referred back
to the Provincial Court for trial and that that court amend the
information by striking out the name of the accused and
substituting therefor the name Bauer Inc.
[5]  Counsel for Bauer Inc. has asked that such order be subject
to the provisions of s.34(4) of the Provincial Offences Act.  The
relevant parts of that subsection read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>             34.(4)    The court shall, in considering whether or not an
          amendment should be made, consider,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the evidence taken on the trial, if
          any;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  the circumstances of the case;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (c)   whether  the defendant  has  been
          misled   or  prejudiced  in  the  defendant&#146;s
          defence by a variance, error or omission; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (d)   whether,  having  regard  to  the
          merits  of  the case, the proposed  amendment
          can be made without injustice being done.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Notwithstanding the appreciable volume of material which has
been accumulated, we were unable to find any suggestion that
Bauer Inc. has been misled.  Nor is there any indication of
prejudice to Bauer Inc. or to the defence of this matter in that
material.  Nor was counsel for Bauer Inc. able to suggest any
misleading or prejudice when called upon to do so.  In any event,
any prejudice arising out of the passage of time since September
8, 1995, can only be laid at the feet of Bauer Inc. or of its
counsel.  The request of counsel for Bauer Inc. is therefore
refused.
[7]  The appeal is therefore allowed, the order of Mossop J. is
set aside and it is ordered that the matter be returned for trial
on its merits to the Provincial Court and that court is directed
to amend the name of the accused in the information to Bauer Inc.</pre>
