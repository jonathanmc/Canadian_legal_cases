</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is brought pursuant to the Construction Lien
Act.  On the consent of the parties and with the appropriate
designation from the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court we
proceeded to hear the matter with the consent of the parties as
ex officio judges of the Divisional Court.

[2]  We agree with the judgment of Hoilett J. who relied,
correctly, on Wharton Enterprises Ltd. v. Brampton Financial
Corp. (1990), 67 D.L.R. (4th) 119 (Ont. S.C.).

[3]  The Construction Lien Act, in s. 55(2), sets out statutory
limitations on those who can be properly joined as defendants by
counterclaim in such actions.  Section 57(2) of that Act must be
read in that context.  Otherwise it would render s. 55(2)
irrelevant.  The appellant seeks to add parties who fall outside
these statutory limits, something which the governing legislation
simply does not permit.

[4]  The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
