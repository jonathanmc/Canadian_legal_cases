    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Maurice Cullity dated
March 18, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Pursuant to s. 8(2) of the Arbitrations Act, S.O. 1991,
c. 17, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (&quot;ICBC&quot;)
applied to Cullity J. for an order that it is entitled to
indemnification from Royal Insurance Company of Canada (&quot;Royal&quot;)
for the no-fault accident benefits which it paid to its insured
David Leahy.  The application was dismissed.
[2]  For the reasons that follow I disagree with this
disposition.  I would allow the appeal and grant the order
sought.
[3]  The relevant facts are not disputed. On December 24, 1993,
Mr. Leahy, a resident of British Columbia, was driving a motor
vehicle in Ontario when it was involved in a collision with a
Kenwood Transportation truck.  The vehicle driven by Mr. Leahy
was owned by Rita Leahy, an Ontario resident, and was insured by
Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company under a standard Ontario motor
vehicle liability insurance policy.  The Kenwood vehicle was a
&quot;heavy commercial vehicle&quot; within the meaning of Ontario
Regulation 664, s. 9 and was insured by Royal Insurance pursuant
to a standard automobile policy issued in Ontario.  At the time
of the accident, Mr. Leahy was insured for his own motor vehicle
by ICBC pursuant to a standard British Columbia owner's
automobile insurance policy.
[4]  The Kenwood vehicle was at fault for the collision in which
Mr. Leahy sustained personal injuries.
[5]  As a result of the filing of a Power of Attorney and
Undertaking (&quot;PAU&quot;) in 1988, ICBC is a participant in the
reciprocal scheme that exists in Canada for the enforcement of
provincial motor vehicle insurance obligations.  The nature and
purpose of this scheme was described by Blair J.A. in Potts v.
Gluckstein (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 556 (C.A.) as follows at pp. 557-
58:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The reciprocal scheme is based upon a power of attorney
          and undertaking filed by each participating motor vehicle insurer
          with the superintendent of insurance of British Columbia.  He
          accepts the filing on behalf of the superintendents of insurance
          in the other provinces and territories, and sends copies to them.
          They are authorized to accept service on behalf of the insurer
          with respect to an action against it or its insured arising out
          of a motor vehicle accident in their respective jurisdictions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  reciprocal scheme provides  a
          uniform  basis for the enforcement  of  motor
          vehicle  insurance claims  in  Canada.   This
          ensures that a person who has entered into  a
          motor  vehicle  insurance  contract  in   one
          province  is recognized as insured  in  other
          provinces.  In the event of an accident,  the
          insurer agrees to be bound by the law of  the
          province  or  territory where the  action  is
          brought and not the province where the policy
          is   issued.    The  insurer   also   accepts
          liability  to  the limits prescribed  in  its
          policy  or,  at least, to the minimum  limits
          established  in  the  province  or  territory
          where the action is brought.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As a consequence of this scheme, ICBC paid no-fault benefits
to its insured Mr. Leahy at the rates provided pursuant to s. 268
of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-8, as amended.
It now seeks to recover for those benefits from Royal pursuant to
s. 275 of the Act.  As a heavy commercial vehicle, the Kenwood
vehicle qualifies as a class of vehicle the insurer of which is
required under that section to indemnify the insurer responsible
for the payment of statutory accident benefits (&quot;SABS&quot;) under
s. 268(2) for the payment of such benefits.  These sections read
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    268. &#150; (1) Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle
          liability policy, including every such contract in force when the
          Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule is made or amended, shall be
          deemed to provide for the statutory accident benefits set out in
          the Schedule and any amendments to the Schedule, subject to the
          terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits set out in
          that Schedule.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (2)  The following rules apply for
          determining  who is liable to  pay  statutory
          accident benefits:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    1.   In respectof an occupant of an
               automobile,
          </pre>
    <pre>                                      i.  the occupant  has
                         recourse against the insurer of an
                         automobile in respect of which the
                         occupant is an insured,
          </pre>
    <pre>                                       ii.           if
                         recovery is unavailable  under
                         subparagraph  i, the  occupant
                         has   recourse   against   the
                         insurer  of the automobile  in
                         which   he  or  she   was   an
                         occupant,
          </pre>
    <pre>                                       iii.          if
                         recovery is unavailable  under
                         subparagraph  i  or  ii,   the
                         occupant has recourse  against
                         the   insurer  of  any   other
                         automobile  involved  in   the
                         incident   from   which    the
                         entitlement    to    statutory
                         accident benefits arose,
          </pre>
    <pre>                                       iv.           if
                         recovery is unavailable  under
                         subparagraph i, ii or iii, the
                         occupant has recourse  against
                         the   Motor  Vehicle  Accident
                         Claims Fund.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                                275.  &#151; (1)  The  insurer
          responsible  under  subsection 268(2) for   the
          payment  of  statutory  accident  benefits  to     
	  such classes of  persons  as may be named in the
          regulations is entitled,  subject to such terms,
          conditions, provisions,  exclusions and  limits     
	  as may be  prescribed, to   indemnification  in      
	  relation to such benefits  paid by it from  the
          insurers   of   such  class  or  classes     of     
	  automobiles as  may be named in the regulations
          involved in the  incident  from  which      the       
 	  responsibility  to pay  the  statutory accident
          benefits arose.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       (2)     Indemnification    under
          subsection (1) shall be made according to the
          respective degree of fault of each  insurer's
          insured   as  determined  under   the   fault
          determination rules.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (3)   No  indemnity  is  available
          under  subsection (2) in respect of the first
          $2,000 of statutory accident benefits paid in
          respect   of  a  person  described  in   that
          subsection.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (4)  If the insurers are unable to
          agree  with respect to indemnification  under
          this  section, the dispute shall be  resolved
          through  arbitration under  the  Arbitrations
          Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (5)   No arbitration hearing shall
          be held with respect to indemnification under
          this  section if, in respect of the  incident
          for  which indemnification is sought, any  of
          the insurers and an insured are parties to  a
          mediation  under section 280, an  arbitration
          under    section   282,   an   appeal   under
          section  283 or a proceeding in  a  court  in
          respect of statutory accident benefits.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In these circumstances, Cullity J. concluded that ICBC could
not recover from Royal.  The core of his reasoning is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The applicant is entitled to be indemnified by the
          respondent under subsection 275(1) of the Insurance Act (Ont.)
          only if it is &quot;the insurer responsible under subsection 268(2)
          for the payment of statutory accident benefits &#133;&quot; within the
          meaning of subsection 275(1).  In my judgment it does not satisfy
          the description.  Subsections 268(1) and (2) apply only to
          contracts made in Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  As I have indicated, I would come to the opposite
conclusion.  In Peter Joseph Healy v. Interboro Mutual Indemnity
Insurance Company and Guardian Insurance Company of Canada (which
is being released simultaneously with this judgment) this court
held that an extra-provincial insurer that has chosen to
participate in the reciprocal scheme is obliged to pay those SABS
mandated by s. 268(1) of the Insurance Act as if its policy were
a valid Ontario motor vehicle liability policy.  By filing the
PAU, that insurer has undertaken to comply with the no-fault
coverage required by s. 268(1) and (2).
[9]  In my view, that conclusion applies exactly to ICBC in these
circumstances.  Hence, it meets the pre-condition of s. 275 since
because of its PAU it is the insurer responsible under s. 268(2)
for the payment of statutory accident benefits.
[10] This conclusion does not constitute the extra-territorial
application of Ontario law to a British Columbia automobile
insurance contract.  Rather, ICBC is an extra-provincial insurer
which has undertaken through the PAU to be the insurer
responsible under s. 268(2) of the Insurance Act for the payment
of SABS to its insured.  As such, it is entitled as a matter of
the statutory interpretation to indemnification from Royal, since
it meets the pre-condition that triggers s. 275.
[11] For these reasons I would allow the appeal and grant the
order sought by the appellant with costs here and below.
