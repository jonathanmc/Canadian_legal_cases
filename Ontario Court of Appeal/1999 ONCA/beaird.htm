    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by Westinghouse Canada Incorporated
(&#147;Westinghouse&#148;) from a judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice
E.I. MacDonald of the Ontario Court (General Division). The
judgment arose out of an action for wrongful dismissal but the
appeal is restricted to the awards to the respondent of
aggravated damages of $15,000 and punitive damages of $32,000.</pre>
    <pre>     Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent commenced work as a motor winder at
Westinghouse in June 1988. On November 20, 1989 he injured his
back at work while attempting to change a connection on a large
electrical motor. He reported the accident to his supervisor and
a report was sent to the Workers Compensation Board (&#147;WCB&#148;). The
report noted that he was covered under the Westinghouse Income
Protection Plan.

[3]  Subsequent to his injury, the respondent obtained medical
treatment and, except for two days, continued to work. On April
5, 1990, he did not return to work because of difficulty driving
and walking. He began to receive WCB benefits and Westinghouse
short term benefits including prescription drug coverage. On July
26, 1990, he was admitted to St. Catherine&#146;s General Hospital and
underwent surgery on his back.

[4]  After the respondent attempted to return to work, and after
prolonged and extensive medical assessment, Westinghouse, the WCB
and the respondent agreed that the respondent was capable of
modified work. The respondent&#146;s former work was out of the
question and it was determined that he would be retrained as a
computer repair technician at the expense of the WCB.
Unfortunately there was no work of this nature at Westinghouse.
As he could not return to work at Westinghouse in any capacity,
his employment was terminated in June 1992, two and one half
years after his injury.

[5]  Following termination of his employment, the respondent
underwent months of retraining. He obtained a diploma as a
computer repair technician. During this period he repeatedly
expressed a desire to return to Westinghouse, but there were no
jobs available for him. He continued to seek employment at other
work places.

[6]  Two years after his dismissal, the respondent engaged legal
counsel and filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights
Commission stating that he was fit for work and that Westinghouse
had failed to accommodate him in this respect. Westinghouse was
obliged to defend this complaint and it was ultimately dismissed
as being out of time. The respondent then served a formal demand
upon Westinghouse for payment of long term disability benefits on
the ground that he was permanently disabled on the date of his
termination in June 1992. Despite this change of position,
Westinghouse gave notice of the claim to its long term disability
insurer, The Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada (&#147;Mutual&#148;),
which was responsible for payment of these benefits.</pre>
    <pre>The benefits package</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The Westinghouse benefits package is comprehensive. It
embraces a Group Life Plan underwritten by Confederation Life, an
Income Protection Plan underwritten by Mutual Life, and a
Consolidated Pension Plan which is the responsibility of
Westinghouse. There is also provision for medical, dental and
prescription drug benefits that are the responsibility of
Westinghouse.

[8]  The definition of disability in the Income Protection Plan
is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>         A disability is an illness or injury which prevents you
   from performing any of the duties of your occupation during your
   first two years of absence.  Thereafter, a disability is an
   illness or injury which prevents you from performing any gainful
   occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by training,
   education or experience. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The distinction emphasized is important because the evidence
discloses that the responsibility for short term disability
benefits (the first two years or so-called &#147;first tier&#148;) is that
of Westinghouse. Thereafter, the benefits are treated as long
term disability benefits and under the Income Protection Plan are
the responsibility of Mutual Life. During the course of the
trial, the respondent&#146;s counsel conceded that the termination of
the respondent&#146;s employment took place after the two year period
had expired and during what was referred to as the &#147;second tier&#148;
of entitlement to disability benefits.

[10] At the time of his termination, the respondent was receiving
WCB benefits equal to 90% of his pre-injury earnings. He was also
receiving medical and dental benefits from Westinghouse.
Subsequent to termination, the respondent&#146;s entitlement to
benefits supplied by Westinghouse ceased.</pre>
    <pre>History of the proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[11] The proceedings in appeal were commenced by a statement of
claim dated August 29, 1994 claiming:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.   A declaration that Westinghouse wrongfully terminated him on
June 29, 1992;
2.   A declaration that at the time of his wrongful termination
he was and continues to be entitled to receive the long-term
disability benefits provided under the plaintiff&#146;s Income
Protection Plan;
3.   Damages against Westinghouse, in the amount of $325,830.00,
for loss of long-term disability benefits;
4.   Damages against Westinghouse for breach of its good faith
obligation, held towards the plaintiff, in the amount of
$50,000.00.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  By the time the matter reached trial, Mutual Life had been
added as a party as Westinghouse&#146;s insurer of the Income
Protection Plan&#146;s long term disability benefits. The statement of
claim was amended and the claims numbered 1 and 2 above were
deleted. Claims for aggravated and punitive damages were made for
the first time.

[13] At the opening of trial, the parties announced that they had
settled the claim against Mutual Life for long term benefits
under the Income Protection Plan. Mutual Life acknowledged its
responsibility to the respondent for long-term benefits and made
a lump sum payment to him to cover accrued arrears. It refused to
make any payment of interest on the arrears. This interest claim
was still maintained against Westinghouse.

[14] The issues remaining against Westinghouse related to the
respondent&#146;s entitlement to the other benefits in the benefits
package, namely group life coverage, medical and dental coverage
and pension plan accrual. At the end of the trial, the parties
announced a settlement of the outstanding claims under the
benefits package. We were advised on appeal that the respondent
was reinstated with respect to all the coverages claimed.</pre>
    <pre>     Reasons for judgment</pre>
    <pre>[15] At the conclusion of argument, the trial judge delivered
judgment in which she dismissed the claim against Westinghouse
for interest on the Mutual Life settlement. This portion of the
judgment has not been appealed. She awarded aggravated damages in
the amount of $15,000 and punitive damages in the amount of
$32,000. In the course of her reasons she stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>     While I can understand the reasons for the actions of
  Westinghouse, I am of the opinion that they were wrong as to his
  physical condition and that the company should have applied on
  his behalf to Mutual to have him placed on second tier disability
  benefits in accordance with the plan rather than abruptly
  terminate his employment. As was admitted by Robert Stait of
  Westinghouse, whether a person has a disability is a medical
  issue. This issue should have been referred to Mutual in 1992 for
  reference to its own medical expert, if considered necessary, as
  eventually happened in 1995 after this action had been commenced.
          </pre>
    <pre>                                             . . . . .
          . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that an error was made by
          Westinghouse that could and should have been
          corrected. Westinghouse failed in its duty to
          the plaintiff by dismissing him without
          assisting him to obtain long term benefits
          under the income protection plan of the
          company. Westinghouse is, therefore, liable
          to Mr. Beaird for the reasonable and
          foreseeable consequence of its actions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               As Mutual has now settled the claim in
          respect of past disability benefits and I am
          informed that Mr. Beaird&#146;s other claims have
          been negotiated and settled during this
          trial, the only claims left to be adjudicated
          at this time are his claims for aggravated
          and punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In making an award of aggravated damages, the trial judge
relied upon the dissenting judgment of Wilson J. in Vorvis v.
Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (1989), 58 D.L.R. (4th)
193 (S.C.C.) where Wilson J. held that compensatory damages were
available to the employee in an employment contract because &#147;the
parties should reasonably have foreseen mental suffering as a
consequence of a breach of the contract at the time the contract
was entered into&#148; (at p. 212). The trial judge held:
          </pre>
    <pre>     . . . the mental suffering of the plaintiff arose directly
  out of the wrongful conduct of the defendant and I do not think
  that the damage is so remote as to proscribe the recovery of
  aggravated damages. One of the purposes of an income protection
  plan is to provide peace of mind to employees in respect of
  possible future problems. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer
  that it was in the contemplation of the parties at the time the
  plaintiff commenced his employment with Westinghouse that his
  dismissal and denial of benefits in the circumstances of this
  case would cause him to suffer mental distress. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] In awarding punitive damages, the trial judge again relied
upon the dissent of Wilson J. in Vorvis, where she had stated
that &#147; I do not share my colleague&#146;s view that punitive damages
can only be awarded when the misconduct is in itself an
&#145;actionable wrong&#146;&#148; (pp.223-24). The trial judge quoted from the
head note of Vorvis to that effect. She then proceeded to make
findings that in her view supported an award of punitive damages.
She said:
          </pre>
    <pre>             I do not think that, at the point in time when Mr. Beaird
        was dismissed, or indeed at any other time, Westinghouse
        exhibited particular malice towards him. Perhaps the company
        showed some callousness in cutting  him off benefits abruptly
        while it was still not clear that he was employable, but the
        conduct was more heavy handed than malicious. However, as time
        passed, and especially after this action was commenced, the
        behaviour of the company became increasingly reprehensible.</pre>
    <pre>[18] It becomes apparent that the entire focus of the trial
judge&#146;s concern as to what she regarded as the misconduct of
Westinghouse related to its counsel&#146;s treatment of two medical
reports by Dr. H.R. Galway obtained on a consent medical
examination. The first report was dated February 24, 1995 and
there was a follow up report dated November 7, 1995. The reports
concluded that the respondent was permanently disabled. The trial
judge acknowledged that even after receipt of the first report,
Westinghouse had &#147;a reasonable excuse for delaying
reinstatement&#148;. However, the failure to supply a copy of this
report to the counsel for the respondent, as required by the
Rules of Civil Procedure, was &#147;harsh and reprehensible
behaviour&#148;. This despite the fact that on a motion at the opening
of trial to have Westinghouse&#146;s defence struck out for failure to
deliver these two reports, the trial judge had ruled:
          </pre>
    <pre>          . . . the defendant should have produced the reports in a
     timely manner so that counsel for the plaintiff could have
     planned for the trial with the knowledge of those favourable
     reports. I consider the delay in this case to raise not a
     question of prejudice leading to the striking of the defence but,
     rather, a question of costs. Costs are a remedy for this late
     production. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[19] In the last analysis, these reports became central to the
trial judge&#146;s finding as to the entitlement to punitive damages.
She said:
          </pre>
    <pre>           I find that the plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages
     and I am awarding those damages in the amount of $32,000. In
     fixing that amount, I have in mind that, here, there are no
     allegations of dishonesty and the amount should be less than in
     Ribeiro [Ribeiro v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce et al.
     (1989), 67 O.R. (2d) 385 (H.C.J.)]. Indeed, the reprehensible
     conduct is of a different nature. It consists of a refusal to
     recognize entitlement or to assist the plaintiff when entitlement
     should have been recognized and the plaintiff given assistance
     and the failure to provide evidentiary material it was required
     by law to provide.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In awarding punitive damages in the
          amount of $32,000, I have done so on the
          basis that the conduct of the defendant
          became progressively more outrageous. I have,
          roughly speaking, calculated the damages at
          the rate of $1,000 per month from December,
          1995 to November 1996 for a total of $12,000
          and thereafter at the rate of $2,000 per
          month with a somewhat higher rate for this
          partial month of September for a total of
          $20,000 for this period.</pre>
    <pre>Issues</pre>
    <pre>[20] This action began as a claim against Westinghouse for a
declaration that the respondent&#146;s contract of employment had been
wrongfully terminated and for ancillary relief relating to his
loss of benefits resulting from such termination. However, by the
time the matter came to trial, the action was restricted to a
claim for loss of benefits simpliciter. At the conclusion of the
evidence, the parties announced that Westinghouse had settled the
benefits claim by agreeing to re-establish the respondent&#146;s
eligibility for all benefits. The issues before us are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Was the respondent entitled to aggravated 
	  damages as a result of Westinghouse&#146;s alleged failure
	  to assist him in obtaining long term disability benefits?
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   Was the respondent entitled to
          punitive damages?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[21] The respondent abandoned his wrongful dismissal claim before
the trial began. The secondary actionable wrong, that
Westinghouse failed to recognize and support the respondent&#146;s
entitlement to long term disability benefits, then became the
primary cause of action. At the conclusion of the evidentiary
portion of the trial, the parties settled the compensatory
element of the new primary claim. The trial judge was left with
the task of determining if there was any basis in the evidence to
support awards for aggravated and punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Aggravated damages are compensatory, while punitive damages,
as the name implies, constitute a punishment imposed upon a
person by the court. Before either aggravated or punitive damages
can be awarded, a separate actionable wrong must be demonstrated
by the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>Aggravated damages</pre>
    <pre>[23] Although the respondent had abandoned the wrongful dismissal
claim, the trial judge failed to appreciate that it was no longer
the primary cause of action to which a separate actionable wrong
could attach. She found that &#147;Westinghouse failed in its duty to
the plaintiff by dismissing him without assisting him to obtain
long term benefits under the income protection plan of the
company&#148; [Emphasis added]. By abandoning the claim for wrongful
dismissal, the respondent impliedly accepted that Westinghouse
was entitled to terminate his employment because, by reason of
his injury, the respondent was incapable of performing his
regular job or any other job that was available at Westinghouse.
To the extent that the trial judge&#146;s above finding is limited to
the issue of the liability of Westinghouse for its failure to
pursue the respondent&#146;s entitlement to long term benefits from
Mutual Life, it ignores all of the evidence, including the
conduct and assertions of the respondent, that the respondent was
not disabled within the definition in the Income Protection Plan
at the time he was terminated. As soon as the respondent changed
his position, at a time when he could qualify for second tier
benefits, Westinghouse passed his application along to Mutual
Life.

[24] More important to this appeal, in awarding aggravated
damages for mental distress, the trial judge stated that the
suffering of the respondent &#147;arose directly out of the wrongful
conduct&#148; of Westinghouse, i.e., &#147;by dismissing him without
assisting him to obtain long term benefits under the income
protection plan of the company&#148;. The trial judge reasoned that it
was in the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered
into the employment relationship that &#147;his dismissal and denial
of benefits in the circumstances of this case would cause him to
suffer mental distress.&#148;  This is a direct award of damages
arising out of a claim for wrongful dismissal. As such, it is a
misstatement of the law.

[25] This idea that damages for mental distress may arise in
wrongful dismissal actions because they were in the contemplation
of the parties at the time they entered into the contract of
employment was rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Vorvis, supra. McIntyre J., for the majority of the
Court, referred to the modern labour law principle that, in the
absence of a collective agreement, either party can terminate the
contract by giving appropriate notice. Accordingly, the only
damages that can arise from termination must relate to the
failure to give such notice. He then stated at p. 205:
          </pre>
    <pre>                 I would not wish to be taken as saying that
      aggravated damages could never be awarded in a case of wrongful
      dismissal, particularly where the acts complained of were also
      independently actionable, a factor not present here. As noted by
      Hinckson J.A. in the Court of Appeal, at p.46:
                    It was not suggested by the plaintiff
               that Reid&#146;s actions in the months prior to
               his termination constituted a breach of
               contract. Upon the basis of the reasoning in
               the Brown case, Reid&#146;s conduct was not a
               separate head of damages in the claim for
               breach of contract.
               His reference to the Brown case was
          to the words of Weatherston J.A. in
          Brown v. Waterloo Regional Board of
          Com&#146;rs of Police, supra [(1983), 150
          D.L.R. (3d) 729 (Ont. C.A.)] p. 736,
          where speaking for the court, he said:
                    If a course of conduct by one party
               causes loss or injury to another, but is not
               actionable, that course of conduct may not be
               a separate head of damages in a claim in
               respect of an actionable wrong. Damages, to
               be recoverable, must flow from an actionable
               wrong. It is not sufficient that a course of
               conduct not in itself actionable be somehow
               related to an actionable course of conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[26] There was but one cause of action and that was for failure
to acknowledge and support the respondent&#146;s claim for long term
disability payments. I am not sure that there is such a cause of
action, but if there is, it is necessary to find an additional
actionable wrong to support claims for aggravated damages.

[27] In making her finding of  liability, the trial judge relied
upon Tarailo v. Allied Chemical Canada Ltd. (1989), 68 O.R. (2d)
288, a decision of R.E. Holland J. of the High Court of Justice.
While there are many factual similarities to the case on appeal,
it is noteworthy that Tarailo was restricted to a claim for
compensatory damages. There was no discussion of aggravated or
punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>[28] In Tarailo, the employee was disabled by reason of mental
illness, an illness that was not apparent to his employer because
it was not disclosed. His discharge for failing to properly
perform his work terminated his entitlement to permanent
disability benefits. The trial judge found:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I am satisfied that Mr. Tarailo was prevented by illness
      from working and earning his regular income in the six-month
      period following September 6, 1978 [the date of  his
      termination]. There is little evidence to the contrary. He did
      attempt to engage in some stock market activity without much
      success. He suffered from the delusion that he had solved the
      secret of the stock market. He was seriously mentally ill.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                       Mr. Tarailo was a permanent full-
          time employee of Allied when he became ill.
          He became entitled to benefits when his
          illness prevented him from working. Allied
          could not cut off Mr. Tarailo&#146;s benefits by
          discharging him or by telling him he was to
          be discharged and then accepting his
          resignation.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Tarailo brought an action for wrongful dismissal. He also
claimed damages because he was wrongly denied his short and long
term disability benefits.  The wrongful dismissal claim against
his employer was dismissed, but the action against the employer
and the insurer for the benefits was successful.

[30] As I understand the facts, the employer could not have known
of the employee&#146;s mental illness prior to the decision to
terminate him. However, after the supervisor received
correspondence from the employee chronicling his illness and
stating that he was receiving treatment, the employer should have
realized that employee had been mentally ill for some time. The
supervisor had forms for application to the insurer for
disability benefits, but did not feel it was his responsibility
to bring this avenue of relief to the employee&#146;s attention.  In
the opinion of the trial judge, he should have done at least
that. The employer had a responsibility to assist in putting
forward an employee&#146;s application for disability benefits because
it had undertaken to do so in a brochure setting out the
benefits. In these circumstances the trial judge found that for
the purposes of dealing with the benefits, the employer was the
agent of the insurer. In the course of his reasons he said at p.
299:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It should have been in the contemplation of the
   officers or employees of Allied, upon receiving the letters of
   November, 1979, that carelessness on their part may be likely to
   cause damage to their ex-employee. It was not up to them to
   decide whether or not there was a valid claim but rather to
   &#147;assist in completing the required forms&#148;. Mr. Tarailo may well
   have been so mentally ill that he did not appreciate that he
   might have a claim. I conclude that a duty was owed to him. There
   do not appear to be any considerations which ought to negative,
   or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the damages to
   which a breach of it may give rise. Allied did nothing to assist
   Mr. Tarailo.</pre>
    <pre>[31] In the unique circumstances of Tarailo, Holland J. held that
the employee had become disabled prior to his discharge and
accordingly was entitled to claim the short and long term
disability benefits stipulated in his employment contract. The
reason for the employee&#146;s termination was irrelevant. The nature
of the employee&#146;s illness prevented him from recognizing his
disability and in fairness prevented his supervisors from
realizing that the erratic conduct that led to his discharge was
caused by that illness. The fact that recognition of Tarailo&#146;s
disability was not possible until after his discharge did not
disentitle him to claim the disability benefits earned under his
contract of employment. The company was liable for the short term
benefits and the insurer for the long term benefits. The insurer
could not rely upon the late submission of an application for
these benefits because the company was its agent for the purpose
of passing the application to the insurer.

[32] Properly understood, Tarailo is not a precedent for a stand-
alone cause of action for disability benefits arising out of
Westinghouse&#146;s &#147;breach of its good faith obligations&#148;. The
judgment was a recognition of disability benefits accrued by
Tarailo under his contract of employment.</pre>
    <pre>[33] In the case on appeal, the action for a declaration of
wrongful termination was abandoned and the claim for compensatory
damages for loss of benefits under the benefits package was
settled. Therefore, there is no need to explore whether there was
a basis in law for either claim. However, accepting the
submission of the respondent that the issue of liability for the
loss of benefits was still alive for the purpose of resolving the
outstanding claim for aggravated damages, there is no room for a
further finding that there is an actionable wrong to support a
claim for aggravated damages. The same observation will be
pertinent to the claim for punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>Punitive damages</pre>
    <pre>[34] While aggravated damages are compensatory, punitive damages
constitute a punishment imposed upon a person by the court.
However, the punishment cannot be imposed simply because the
trier of fact disapproves of that person in the abstract. It was
put this way by McIntyre J. in Vorvis, supra, at p. 206:
          </pre>
    <pre>        When then can punitive damages be awarded? It must
  never be forgotten that when awarded by a judge or a jury, a
  punishment is imposed upon a person by a court by the operation
  of the judicial process. What is it that is punished? It surely
  cannot be merely conduct of which the court disapproves, however
  strongly the court may feel. Punishment may not be imposed in a
  civilized community without a justification in law. The only
  basis for the imposition of such punishment must be a finding of
  the commission of an actionable wrong which caused the injury
  complained of by the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The two requirements for an award of punitive damages were
stated by Laskin J.A. at paragraph 22 of his judgment in Whiten
v. Pilot Insurance Co., [1999] O.J. No. 237:
          </pre>
    <pre>        For an award of punitive damages to be made, two
  requirements must be met: first, the defendant must have
  committed an independent or separate actionable wrong causing
  damage to the plaintiff; and second, the defendant&#146;s conduct must
  be sufficiently &#147;harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious&#148;
  [Vorvis p.208] or &#147;so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that
  it offends the court&#146;s sense of decency&#148; [Hill v. Church of
  Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at 1208].
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[36] In Whiten, this court expanded the concept of actionable
wrong as the basis for an award of punitive damages. The court
accepted that a claim against an insurer that it dealt with an
insurance claim in bad faith could be classified as a separate
actionable wrong in an action on the policy for damages for the
insurance loss. In other words, the breach of an insurer&#146;s
obligation to act in good faith is a separate or independent
wrong from the wrong for which compensation is paid.

[37] However, no separate actionable wrong exists in the case on
appeal and none is articulated as such by the trial judge.
Indeed, as I indicated earlier, the trial judge appears to have
proceeded on the basis that she was entitled to award punitive
damages almost exclusively because of the treatment by counsel
for Westinghouse of the two assessment reports by Dr. Galway.
There are two problems with this approach.

[38] First, a breach of the Rules of Civil Procedure does not
constitute an actionable wrong. An award of costs will generally
be the appropriate sanction for trial misconduct. For example, in
Gerula v. Flores (1995), 126 D.L.R. (4th) 506 (Ont. C.A.), Weiler
J.A. stated at p.527:  &#147;solicitor-and-client costs should relate
to the conduct of the action and not to the conduct which might
have been the subject of punitive damages&#148;. Although she awarded
punitive damages for the &#147;highly unethical conduct&#148; of the
defendant, she held that solicitor-and-client costs were the
appropriate sanction for subsequent trial misconduct.

[39] The obligation of counsel for the appellant to produce the
reports is found in the Rules (rule 33.06(2)) and those same
Rules expose the appellant to two sanctions for failure to
comply. One is the striking out of the statement of defence (rule
33.07) and the other is an award of costs. The trial judge
declined to impose the first sanction and imposed the second in
the form of an award of solicitor and client costs from the end
of August, 1987 until trial and thereafter.

[40] The second problem is that the respondent has failed to
establish the second requirement of Laskin J.A. as to the nature
of the conduct that could be the basis for punitive damages.
Westinghouse&#146;s conduct must be sufficiently &#147;harsh, vindictive,
reprehensible and malicious&#148; or &#147;so malicious, oppressive and
high-handed that it offends the court&#146;s sense of decency&#148;. The
overall conduct of the appellant cannot possibly attract the
pejorative language necessary for punitive damages. In point of
fact, the trial judge did not even attempt to make such a
finding. I have a great deal of sympathy with the position of the
appellant that she should not have treated Dr. Galway&#146;s reports
as conclusive of the issue whether the respondent was permanently
disabled from the date of his injury.  In my view, the trial
judge read too much into these two reports. Dr. Galway was called
as a witness and testified as to the disabling symptomatology of
back pain. He was forced to rely upon the respondent&#146;s subjective
impressions as to the extent of his pain. He knew nothing about
the respondent&#146;s earlier assertions and actions that were
intended to demonstrate that the respondent was capable of
working. Dr. Galway conceded that the accuracy or correctness of
his opinion depended upon the accuracy of the respondent&#146;s
reporting of his medical history.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[41] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
judgment below awarding aggravated and punitive damages. I would
allow the appellant its costs of the appeal. I would not,
however, interfere with the award of costs below. The trial was
necessary and the settlement with the appellant did not take
place until all the evidence was in. A cost sanction for the
failure to deliver the reports of Dr. Galway was also justified.
