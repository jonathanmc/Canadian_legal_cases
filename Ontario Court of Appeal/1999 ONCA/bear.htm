    <pre>On appeal from the order of Winkler J. dated August 11, 1995.
</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is another chapter in the long-running dispute
between the Temagami Indians and the Ontario Government, a
dispute that originated in the Robinson-Huron Treaty of 1850.
The issue on this appeal is whether the principle of res judicata
precludes the Temagami Indians from maintaining a land claim.
[2]  In the early 1970's the appellants, representing the
Temagami Indians, claimed aboriginal title to a vast tract of
unpatented land in northern Ontario.  To protect their claim,
they registered cautions under the Land Titles Act.  When the
Director of Titles refused to recognize their claim, they
appealed his decisions.  Before the caution appeals were dealt
with on their merits, Ontario began what became known as the Bear
Island case.  In that case Ontario sought a declaration that the
appellants had no interest in the lands they had claimed.  After
a long trial, Steele J. granted the declaration and related
relief.  The appellants' appeals to this court and to the Supreme
Court of Canada were dismissed.
[3]  Ontario then brought an application before Winkler J. for a
declaration that the Bear Island case determined the caution
appeals by rendering them res judicata.  Winkler J. granted
Ontario's application, but relying on passages from the reasons
of this court and the Supreme Court in the Bear Island case, held
that the appellants could start a new proceeding, claiming an
interest in the lands because of Ontario's breach of the Robinson-
Huron Treaty.1
[4]  The appellants appeal Winkler J.'s decision.  They submit
that they should be able to maintain their caution appeals on
either of two bases: breach of fiduciary duty or breach of the
Robinson-Huron Treaty.  Ontario supports Winkler J.'s decision
but submits that he did not go far enough: Ontario submits that
the appellants' claim to an interest in the lands based on a
breach of the Treaty is also res judicata.  I agree with
Ontario's submission, and I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Background Facts</pre>
    <pre>[5]  A detailed history of the dealings and the dispute between
Ontario and the appellants can be found in the reasons of Steele
J. in the Bear Island case2 and in the reasons of Winkler J.  I
will summarize only those facts relevant to this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(a)       The parties</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The parties to this longstanding dispute are the respondent
the Ontario government and three aboriginal groups representing
the Temagami Indians.  The appellant the Teme-Augama Anishnabai
(&#147;TAA&#148;) is a traditional aboriginal organization, recognized by
both status and non-status Temagami Indians.  The appellant the
Temagami Band of Indians, now called the Temagami First Nation
(&#147;TFN&#148;), is a band of status Indians registered under the Indian
Act.3  All members of the TFN are also members of the TAA.  The
intervenor Makominising Anishnawbeg (&#147;MKA&#148;) is a group of heads
of native families from the Temagami region, whose authority is
founded on traditional aboriginal law.  The members of the MKA
come from the TAA and the TFN.</pre>
    <pre>(b)       The Robinson-Huron Treaty and the Bear Island Reserve</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In 1850, eighteen chiefs of various Ojibway First Nations
&#147;inhabiting and claiming the eastern and northern shores of Lake
Huron&#148; and William B. Robinson, an agent for Her Majesty the
Queen, signed what became known as the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  By
the terms of the treaty, the Chiefs and their tribes surrendered
their interest in all of their lands, except for the reservations
listed in a schedule to the Treaty, in return for annual
annuities and the right to hunt and fish in the surrendered
lands.  TFN was not specifically referred to in the list of
reservations in the schedule.
[8]  In the late 1850s, members of the TFN, under pressure from
neighbouring lumbering operations, proposed to the federal
government to surrender their land in exchange for a reserve and
treaty annuities.  No formal surrender took place, but beginning
in 1883 the federal government paid the TFN annuities under the
Robinson-Huron Treaty.
[9]  In 1884, a reserve of 100 square miles at the south end of
Lake Temagami was surveyed for the TFN.  The size of the reserve
was comparable to those reserves received by the First Nations
who signed the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  The federal government
asked Ontario to convey the surveyed land to the TFN, but Ontario
refused to do so.  Ontario took the position that the TFN was not
a party to the Treaty and therefore was not entitled to a
reserve, and that the lumber on the land surveyed was too
valuable.
[10] For the next eighty years or so dealings took place between
the TFN and the two levels of government.  Several times the
federal government requested Ontario to set aside a reserve for
the TFN.  Ontario repeatedly refused these requests, until 1943
when the province finally set aside land on Bear Island in Lake
Temagami.  But it was not until 1971 that the federal government
created the Bear Island Reserve.  The reserve is only one square
mile in size.  None of the affected parties considered that the
creation of the Bear Island Reserve satisfied any obligation owed
to the TFN under the Robinson-Huron Treaty.</pre>
    <pre>(c)       The Cautions</pre>
    <pre>[11] In 1973, the Bear Island Foundation, acting for the
appellants, registered cautions under the Land Titles Act,4
against all unpatented land in 110 townships in the Districts of
Temiskaming, Nipissing and Sudbury.  These lands covered over
4,000 square miles.  In January 1977 the Director of Titles held
that the appellants had failed to demonstrate a sufficient
interest in the lands to support the cautions.  He ordered that
the cautions would cease to have effect unless a notice of appeal
was filed.  The Bear Island Foundation did file a notice of
appeal.  In April 1977, Gary Potts, William Twain and Maurice
McKenzie Jr., also acting for the appellants, attempted to
register additional cautions on the same lands.  The Director of
Titles refused to register these cautions because, in his view,
they too did not establish a sufficient interest in the lands.
[12] The appellants appealed the Director&#146;s refusal.  They also
appealed another decision of the Director of Titles in 1978,
refusing to renew the existing cautions filed by the Bear Island
Foundation.  Various preliminary proceedings took place in these
three caution appeals, but they had not been dealt with on their
merits, when Ontario began the Bear Island action.

(d)       The Bear Island Case</pre>
    <pre>[13] In 1978, Ontario brought an action in the Supreme Court of
Ontario for a declaration that the lands covered by the cautions
were public lands, that the appellants had no interest in these
lands, and that the government had the right to sell the lands
without the appellants&#146; consent.  The appellants counterclaimed
for a declaration that they had an equitable fee simple in the
lands and a better right to possession than the Crown because of
their aboriginal rights and their rights derived from the Royal
Proclamation of 1763.5  Once the litigation was started, the
parties agreed to adjourn the caution appeals pending the outcome
of the Bear Island case.  Significantly, counsel for the
appellants asserted that the parties had agreed the Bear Island
litigation would resolve once and for all whether the appellants
had an interest in the lands and therefore would determine the
caution appeals.  He wrote the Deputy Director of Titles about
this arrangement.

               The Attorney General for the Province of Ontario has brought
          an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario for a series of
          declarations determinative of the ultimate issue as to the
          interests in the land in question.  It would appear that all
          parties are agreed that the most reasonable course to follow at
          this stage would be to get the ruling from the Supreme Court as
          quickly as possible.  When that has been done, it appears that
          these various appeals relating to registerability of documents
          will have been rendered redundant.</pre>
    <pre>[14] In the Bear Island action, the appellants based their claim
to an interest in the lands on aboriginal title.  They did not
claim an interest in the lands because of a breach of fiduciary
duty or a breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  The trial judge
in the Bear Island action, Steele J., characterized the
litigation as a dispute over whether the appellants had any
aboriginal rights in the lands.

               The basic dispute is whether Ontario is the owner of certain
          lands, free of any aboriginal rights claimed by the Indians, or
          whether the band or registered band has aboriginal rights in the
          lands that prevent Ontario from dealing with the lands until
          those rights are properly extinguished.6</pre>
    <pre>[15] After a long trial &#150; consisting of 118 days of evidence over
nearly two years, Steele J. gave judgment concluding that the
appellants had no aboriginal right to the lands but that even if
they did, their aboriginal right had been extinguished by the
Robinson-Huron Treaty to which the Temagami Band of Indians was a
party or to which it had subsequently adhered in 1883.  Steele J.
declared that all the lands claimed by the appellants, other than
Bear Island, were public lands, that the appellants had no
interest in these lands and that Ontario could dispose of these
lands without the appellants&#146; consent.  He also perpetually
enjoined the appellants from continuing proceedings to prevent
Ontario from selling the lands.
[16] Although asked to do so, Steele J. refused to remove the
cautions, holding that their removal should be dealt with in the
caution appeals themselves.  He wrote: &#147;I think it appropriate
that the question of their removal should be dealt with in the
stayed proceedings under the Land Titles Act after considering my
reasons herein.&#148;7
[17] Nonetheless, his reasons show that he thought the cautions
should be removed because at the end of his reasons, when
discussing the application of the Limitations Act, he wrote:
&#147;While the personal or aboriginal right or interest of the
Indians comes within the extended definition of &#145;land&#146; in the
Limitations Act, it is not such an interest in land that gives a
right to file a caution against the Crown&#146;s title pursuant to the
Land Titles Act.&#148;8
[18] The appellants appealed the decision of Steele J. to this
court.  At the beginning of its reasons, this court set out what
was and what was not in issue on the appeal:

               It should be made plain what is in issue in this appeal.
          The subject-matter of the dispute is the title to land.  The
          province takes the position that its ownership of the land in
          question is unencumbered by any aboriginal rights of the
          appellants.  The appellants, of course, argue the contrary.  What
          is not at stake in this appeal is the right of the appellants to
          claim compensation or to claim any other benefit that may accrue
          to them as an unfulfilled obligation under the Robinson-Huron
          Treaty.9</pre>
    <pre>Winkler J. relied on this passage from this court&#146;s reasons to
exclude the appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the lands based
on a breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty10 from the application of
the principle of res judicata.</pre>
    <pre>[19] However, in recognizing in this passage that the appellants
may claim compensation or &#147;any other benefit&#148;, this court was
likely referring to what Ontario had acknowledged in its factum:

               The respondent submits that the appellants have no right,
          title or interest in the lands in question and will ask this
          court to make an order in the appeal that reflects that
          circumstance.  But it is the position of the respondent that the
          Temi-augama Anishnabay do have historical grievances which give
          rise to entitlement to compensation ... the issue of compensation
          does not arise in this appeal.  But this Court should know that
          the disposition of the appeal sought by the respondent does not
          dispose of all rights of the appellants.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Moreover, this court dismissed the appellants&#146; appeal
without any qualification, holding that any aboriginal rights
enjoyed by the Temagami were extinguished by the Robinson-Huron
Treaty.  In the words of the panel:

               The Temagami were signatories to the treaty.  Alternatively
          they adhered to the treaty by receiving annuities pursuant to it
          and later asking for a reserve as was promised in the treaty and
          still later receiving a reserve.  Finally, their rights were
          extinguished, even if the Temagami were not signatories or
          adherents, because the treaty was at least a unilateral act of
          extinguishment by the sovereign authority.11</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellants further appealed to the Supreme Court of
Canada, which dismissed their appeal.  The Supreme Court
disagreed with Steele J. on whether the appellants ever had an
aboriginal right to the lands.  In the Court&#146;s view: &#147;&#133; on the
facts found by the trial judge the Indians exercised sufficient
occupation of the lands in question throughout the relevant
period to establish an aboriginal right&#148;.12  However, the Court
held that: &#147;&#133; whatever may have been the situation upon the
signing of the Robinson-Huron Treaty, that right was in any event
surrendered by arrangements subsequent to that treaty by which
the Indians adhered to the treaty in exchange for treaty
annuities and a reserve.&#148;13
[22] But the Supreme Court then observed that the Crown had
conceded it had failed to comply with its obligations under the
Treaty, thus breaching its fiduciary obligations to the Temagami,
an observation also relied on by Winkler J. in narrowing his
application of res judicata.  The Supreme Court wrote:

               It is conceded that the Crown has failed to comply with some
          of its obligations under this agreement, and thereby breached its
          fiduciary obligations to the Indians.  These matters currently
          form the subject of negotiations between the parties.  It does
          not alter the fact, however, that the aboriginal right has been
          extinguished.14</pre>
    <pre>[23] The &#147;concession&#148; referred to by the Court was undoubtedly a
reference to the factum filed by the Attorney General of Ontario,
which &#150; as did its factum filed in this court &#150; acknowledged that
the failure to pay annuities regularly under the Treaty and &#147;the
long denial of a reserve at Lake Temagami gives rise to a claim
by the Temagami Band under the Treaty&#148;.  But the Attorney
General&#146;s factum was explicit:  &#147;The claim sounds in compensation
or damages&#148;.  Ontario did not concede that the appellants any
longer had a claim to an interest in the lands.  Still, after the
Supreme Court&#146;s decision, the appellants amended their notice of
appeal in the caution proceedings under the Land Titles Act to
include a claim to an interest in the lands based on a breach of
fiduciary duty.

(e)       The Agreement in Principle</pre>
    <pre>[24] The &#147;negotiations&#148; referred to by the Supreme Court in its
reasons in the Bear Island case were the discussions between
Ontario and the appellants that took place within the framework
of a memorandum of understanding dated April 23, 1990.  Under the
memorandum, the parties agreed to negotiate a &#147;treaty of co-
existence&#148;.  On August 17, 1993, the parties reached an agreement
in principle under which the TAA would receive 115 square miles
of land for their exclusive use.  Ontario then took the position
the agreement had to be ratified both by the TAA and the TFN.
The TAA ratified the agreement, but the TFN voted against
accepting it.
[25] During the negotiations, Ontario did not take any steps to
remove the cautions.  However, the agreement in principle
provided that the cautions would be removed on ratification.
When the agreement was not ratified by the TFN, Ontario launched
the proceedings now before this court.

(f)       The Motion before Winkler J.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Before Winkler J. Ontario asked for a declaration that the
Bear Island action determined the appellants&#146; claim to an
interest in the lands, rendering the caution appeals res
judicata.  In reasons dated June 4, 1995, Winkler J. held that
the Bear Island action disposed of and rendered res judicata the
appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the lands on all bases &#150;
including the claim based on breach of fiduciary duty &#150; but one:
the appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the lands based on a
breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  During the hearing before
him, the appellants stated that they intended to raise the breach
of the Treaty as an additional ground to support their claim in
the caution appeals to an interest in the lands.  Although
Winkler J. held that the breach of Treaty issue was not res
judicata, he refused to permit the appellants to amend their
notices of appeal.  The appellants could begin a new proceeding
claiming an interest in the lands because of a breach of the
Treaty but they could not raise this breach in the outstanding
caution proceedings.
[27] After his decision on the res judicata motion, Ontario
brought a separate motion before Winkler J. to quash the caution
appeals relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in
the Bear Island case and on Winkler J.&#146;s earlier ruling.  In
reasons dated November 16, 1995, Winkler J. granted Ontario&#146;s
motion and quashed the caution appeals.  He held:

               In light of my above conclusions, the decision of the
          Supreme Court of Canada in the Bear Island action and the order
          of this Court in the res judicata motion both operate to remove
          the substratum of the appeals in these proceedings.  It has been
          finally and conclusively decided that the appellants do not have
          an interest in the subject lands within the meaning of s.48 of
          the Land Titles Act capable of supporting the cautions.
          Consequently, there is no issue in the cautions appeals left to
          be decided between the parties.15
</pre>
    <pre>This decision is the subject of a separate appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>[28] The question on this appeal is whether the Bear Island
action renders the appellants&#146; caution appeals res judicata.
This question raises three issues.  First, is the appellants&#146;
claim to an interest in the lands based on breach of fiduciary
duty res judicata?  Second, is the appellants&#146; claim to an
interest in the lands based on breach of the Robinson-Huron
Treaty res judicata?  Third, if the appellants&#146; claim to an
interest in the lands based on breach of the Treaty is not res
judicata, may it be raised in the outstanding caution appeals?
[29] Before dealing with these issues, I will briefly discuss the
reach of the principle of res judicata.  The principle of res
judicata is well-established in our law.  It applies to claims by
aboriginal peoples against the Crown in the same way as it
applies in other cases.  Res judicata is a form of estoppel.  It
means that any action or issue that has been litigated and
decided cannot be retried in a subsequent lawsuit between the
same parties or their privies.  The object of res judicata is
judicial finality.  Two reasons are commonly put forward for the
principle: no person should be sued more than once for the same
claim, and our law should not tolerate needless litigation.16
[30] Two aspects of res judicata are relevant to this appeal.
The first aspect, relied on by Ontario, is that res judicata
prevents a party from relitigating a claim that was decided or
that could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.  As our
court said in Parna v. G. &amp; S. Properties Ltd.:  &#147;The rule of res
judicata embraces not only those things which were proven in the
earlier action, but those which might have been proven in that
action.&#148;17  Cartwright J. invoked this aspect of res judicata in
Maynard v. Maynard,18 in a passage that is particularly germane to
this appeal:

               Parties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations because
          of new views they may entertain of the law of the case, or new
          versions which they present as to what should be a proper
          apprehension by the Court of the legal result either of the
          construction of the documents or the weight of certain
          circumstances.
               If this were permitted litigation would
          have no end, except when legal ingenuity is
          exhausted.  It is a principle of law that
          this cannot be permitted, and there is
          abundant authority reiterating that principle
          &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[31] The second aspect of res judicata relevant to this appeal
and relied on by the appellants is that the court retains a
discretion to refuse to apply res judicata when to do so would
cause unfairness or work an injustice.  As Lord Upjohn wrote in
Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner Keeler Ltd. No. 2: &#147;All estoppels
are not odious but must be applied so as to work justice and not
injustice.&#148;19  Although the principle of res judicata reflects the
public interest in the finality of litigation, sometimes an
unyielding application of the principle would be unfair to a
party who is precluded from relitigating an issue.  Judicial
discretion is required to achieve practical justice without
undermining the object of res judicata.20
[32] As is apparent from the case law, the courts have always
exercised this discretion.  For example, the House of Lords has
refused to apply issue estoppel (a form of res judicata) in
&#147;special circumstances&#148;, which include a change in the law or the
availability of further relevant material.  Lord Keith discussed
this special circumstances exception in Arnold v. National
Westminster Bank plc21:

               &#133; there may be an exception to issue estoppel in the special
          circumstance that there has become available to a party further
          material relevant to the correct determination of a point
          involved in the earlier proceedings, whether or not that point
          was specifically raised and decided, being material which could
          not by reasonable diligence have been adduced in those
          proceedings.  One of the purposes of estoppel being to work
          justice between the parties, it is open to courts to recognise
          that in special circumstances inflexible application of it may
          have the opposite result &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[33] The resolution of this appeal turns on these two aspects of
res judicata and on what the Court of Appeal and the Supreme
Court of Canada said about the Robinson-Huron Treaty in the Bear
Island case.</pre>
    <pre>First Issue:   Is the Appellants&#146; Claim to Interest in the Lands
Based on Breach of Fiduciary Duty Res Judicata?</pre>
    <pre>[34] The appellants claim an interest in the disputed lands as a
remedy for Ontario&#146;s breach of fiduciary duty.  I am doubtful
whether the provincial Crown owes fiduciary duties to aboriginal
people that, on breach, would allow for the transfer of land.
The fiduciary duty of the Crown to aboriginal people is
fundamentally a duty of the federal Crown.  It is the federal
government that has legislative responsibility for Indians and
lands reserved for Indians under s.91(24) of the Constitution Act
1867.  As the Supreme Court said in Mitchell v. Peguis Indian
Band: &#147;The provincial Crown bears no responsibility to provide
for the welfare and protection of native peoples.&#148;22
[35] In Perry v. Ontario, this court recognized that the province
may have a fiduciary duty to aboriginal peoples who have an
aboriginal or treaty right to hunt and fish and whose exercise of
that right is affected by a provincial regulation.23  In such a
case, the province&#146;s duty is &#147;a restraint against regulations
improperly affecting aboriginal [or treaty] rights.&#148;  Breach of
the duty may render the provincial regulation unenforceable
against aboriginal people exercising these rights.  But the
fiduciary duty owed by the provincial Crown is a &#147;shield and not
a sword&#148;.  Ordinarily, the affirmative obligation to provide for
the welfare of aboriginal peoples and to implement the terms of
treaties belongs to the federal Crown.  Nonetheless, for the
purpose of this appeal, I will assume, without deciding, that
Ontario has a fiduciary obligation to the appellants and that a
breach of that obligation may be remedied by the grant of an
interest in land.
[36] Winkler J. concluded that the decision in the Bear Island
case prevented the appellants from claiming an interest in the
lands based on a breach of fiduciary duty.  In so concluding, he
relied on the principle that res judicata embraces both those
issues raised in the earlier litigation and those issues that
could have been raised but were not.
[37] The appellants make three arguments to avoid the application
of res judicata to their breach of fiduciary duty claim.  First,
they argue that the court should exercise its discretion against
applying res judicata because of &#147;special circumstances&#148;,
especially the &#147;groundbreaking&#148; decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Guerin v. The Queen.24  Second, the appellants argue
that res judicata should not be invoked because
Ontario negotiated over the agreement in principle in bad faith.
Third, they argue that the claims based on breach of fiduciary
duty and breach of the Treaty are interrelated and, accordingly,
it was illogical for Winkler J. to preserve one and not the
other.  In my view, none of these arguments can overcome the
application of res judicata to the appellants&#146; land claim based
on a breach of fiduciary duty.
[38] In Guerin, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the federal
Crown breached its fiduciary obligation to the Musqueam Indian
Band by obtaining an unfavourable lease of land surrendered by
the Band.  Although the Court ordered the Crown to compensate the
Band in damages for the breach, its reasons recognized that the
Crown owed an equitable or fiduciary obligation to Indians in
dealing with surrendered land on their behalf.  A breach of that
obligation could, in an appropriate case, be remedied by an award
of an interest in land.
[39] The appellants submit that Guerin was a dramatic change in
the law and, together with what should be the court&#146;s reluctance
to extinguish land claims and the Crown&#146;s honour in dealing with
Indians, provide special circumstances for the court to exercise
its discretion not to apply res judicata.  I disagree.  I would
not invoke the special circumstances exception to res judicata.
[40] Guerin was decided over a month before Steele J. released
his decision in the Bear Island action and was referred to by him
in an addendum to his reasons.  Steele J. concluded that nothing
in Guerin changed his conclusions.25  The Court of Appeal&#146;s
decision came five years later and the Supreme Court&#146;s decision
two years after that.  Thus, the appellants had ample time to
raise their theory of breach of fiduciary duty in the Bear Island
litigation, but chose not to do so.  They cannot realistically
assert that new material was needed to support this theory
because both sides had combed the archives and presented to
Steele J. virtually every shred of evidence concerning the
dealings between the appellants and the Crown over the disputed
lands.  Steele J. observed: &#147;The evidence called at trial was
extremely lengthy, far ranging and comprehensive.&#148;
[41] Therefore, even accepting that Guerin dramatically changed
the law and even acknowledging that the court should not lightly
extinguish Indian land claims, I do not think that Guerin
provides a basis for permitting the appellants now to assert an
interest in the disputed lands based on a breach of fiduciary
duty.  As Winkler J. wrote:

               &#133; Counsel for the appellants, for whatever reason, chose not
          to pursue the breach of fiduciary duty argument, notwithstanding
          that the trial judge had himself placed the question in issue.
          The proper time for the appellants to pursue it was on appeal.
          They did not do so, and are estopped from now attempting to
          relitigate the question.26</pre>
    <pre>[42] The appellants submit that Ontario negotiated the agreement
in principle in bad faith and that these bad faith negotiations
provide an alternative basis for not applying res judicata to the
breach of fiduciary duty claim.  This submission has no merit.
Whatever took place in the negotiations between the parties in
the 1990s  has no relevance to the Bear Island litigation and
thus cannot be used to avoid the application of res judicata.
[43] The appellants also submit that Winkler J.&#146;s reasons are
illogical or inconsistent in preserving the appellants&#146; breach of
treaty claim but not their breach of fiduciary duty claim because
the two are &#147;intimately connected&#148;.  The connection, according to
the appellants, is reflected in the following sentence in the
Supreme Court&#146;s reasons in the Bear Island action: &#147;It is
conceded that the Crown has failed to comply with some of its
obligations under the agreement, and thereby breached its
fiduciary obligations to the Indians.&#148;27  Indeed, after the
Supreme Court&#146;s decision, the appellants relied on that sentence
from the Supreme Court&#146;s reasons to amend their notice of appeal
in the caution proceedings.
[44] Even if the two claims are connected as the appellants
maintain, as I said earlier, I think Winkler J. was correct to
hold the claim to an interest in the lands based on a breach of
fiduciary duty was res judicata.  If he erred at all, his error
was in not holding the claim to an interest in the lands based on
a breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty was also res judicata, an
issue I will discuss in the next part of these reasons.
[45] In the Bear Island action, the appellants had to put forward
all of their defences to Ontario&#146;s claim and their failure to do
so is fatal to now asserting a claim based on a theory &#150; breach
of fiduciary duty &#150; that they did not raise in the earlier
proceeding.28</pre>
    <pre>The Second Issue:  Is the Appellants&#146; Claim to an Interest in the
Lands Based on a Breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty Res Judicata?</pre>
    <pre>[46] The appellants also claim an interest in the disputed lands
because Ontario breached the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  In
principle, this claims stands on the same footing as their claim
based on breach of fiduciary duty.  The appellants could have
defended the Bear Island action by arguing breach of the Treaty
but chose not to do so.  Ontario therefore submits that the Bear
Island litigation renders the appellants&#146; claim to an interest in
the lands based on a breach of the Treaty res judicata.
[47] Winkler J., however, concluded that: &#147;the issue of the
alleged violation of the Robinson-Huron Treaty and the question
of what remedy may flow from that are not res judicata.&#148;29  He
thus left open the possibility that the appellants could still
maintain a claim to the disputed lands based on a breach of the
Treaty though, in his view, they could not do so in the caution
proceedings but would have to start a new action.  He held that
the breach of Treaty claim was not res judicata because of what
Steele J., this court and the Supreme Court of Canada said about
the Treaty in their reasons in the Bear Island action.  I do not
read these reasons the same way that Winkler J. did.  He viewed
the reasons in the Bear Island action as preserving the
appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the lands for breach of the
Treaty.  I view these reasons as preserving only a claim to
compensation or related relief, but not to an interest in the
lands.
[48] The effect of the Robinson-Huron Treaty on the appellants&#146;
aboriginal right to the lands was a central issue before Steele
J.  He devotes several pages of his reasons to this issue and
concludes that even if the appellants had an aboriginal right to
the lands, that right was extinguished by the Treaty.  He did not
consider whether Ontario had subsequently breached the Treaty
and, if so, what remedy flowed from the breach because the
appellants did not defend the action on the basis of a Treaty
breach.  Instead, the appellants advanced a single defence at
trial to support their land claims: an aboriginal right to the
lands.  However, Steele J.&#146;s judgment is unqualified and
unequivocal: the appellants had no interest in the disputed lands
(other than the Bear Island Reserve), Ontario had the right to
sell the lands without the appellants&#146; consent and the appellants
were forever enjoined from continuing proceedings to prevent
Ontario from selling the lands.
[49] On appeal, this court did say that what was not in issue
before them was the appellants&#146; right to claim not only
compensation but &#147;any other benefit&#148; because of &#147;an unfulfilled
obligation under the Robinson-Huron Treaty&#148;.  In my opinion, the
phrase &#147;any other benefit&#148; was not meant to include an interest
in the disputed lands.  I say this for several reasons.  First,
the court said expressly what was in issue before them: title to
the lands.  It did not qualify that issue in any way.  Second,
this court dismissed the appellants&#146; appeal.  The court did not
amend the judgment of Steele J. to permit the appellants to claim
an interest in the lands because of a breach of the Treaty.
Third, in excluding from their consideration the appellants&#146;
claim to relief for breach of the Treaty, this court undoubtedly
was responding to Ontario&#146;s acknowledgement in its factum that
the appellants had legitimate grievances over the Treaty,
grievances which entitled them to compensation.  Ontario never
acknowledged that any Treaty breach would entitle the appellants
to an interest in the disputed lands.  Fourth, the parties agreed
&#150; as reflected in the letter from the appellants&#146; counsel to the
Director of Titles &#150; that the Bear Island litigation would
resolve the appellants&#146; land claim.
[50] The Supreme Court of Canada also referred to Ontario&#146;s
concession that it had breached some of its Treaty obligations
and observed that negotiations were then taking place to try to
settle that matter.  Again, however, in my opinion, the Supreme
Court by its reasons did not intend to preserve the appellants&#146;
right to claim an interest in the lands because of a breach of
the Robinson-Huron Treaty.  The Supreme Court dismissed the
appellants&#146; appeal and thus affirmed the unqualified judgment of
Steele J.  The Supreme Court &#150; as did this court &#150; was responding
to Ontario&#146;s &#147;concession&#148; in its factum, a concession that at its
highest recognized the appellants&#146; right to compensation or
damages for breach of the Treaty.  And the parties&#146; arrangement
that the Bear Island litigation would settle once and for all the
appellants&#146; land claim was still in place when the Supreme Court
handed down its decision.
[51] The appellants, having asserted one theory &#150; aboriginal
title &#150; in all courts in the Bear Island case to support their
claim to an interest in the lands, and having had that claim
rejected at every level, cannot now assert new theories to
maintain their 21 year old caution appeals under the Land Titles
Act.  Res judicata applies to these new theories.  Thus, I agree
with Ontario&#146;s position in this appeal.  The Bear Island action
determined and made res judicata the appellants&#146; claim to an
interest in the lands, whether asserted on the basis of
aboriginal right or breach of fiduciary duty or breach of the
Robinson-Huron Treaty.  The appellants do have a claim for
compensation for alleged breaches of the Treaty and that
compensation may, in a negotiated settlement, include land.  But
the appellants&#146; claims in the caution appeals have been rendered
res judicata by the Bear Island case.
[52] My proposed resolution of this appeal would grant Ontario
more relief than that ordered by Winkler J.  However, the
position of the Attorney General, which I have adopted, was fully
argued in its factum.  Therefore, I do not think that my proposed
order is unfair to the appellants.  And ss.134(1)(a) and 134(5)
of the Courts of Justice Act30 provide the statutory authority for
it.  Nonetheless, I will consider the appellants&#146; position on the
assumption that Winkler J. was correct to exclude the breach of
Treaty claim to an interest in the lands from the application of
res judicata.</pre>
    <pre>Third Issue:  If the Appellants&#146; claim to an interest in the
lands based on a breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty is not 
res judicata, can they assert this claim in the caution appeals?</pre>
    <pre>[53] Even if I am wrong on the effect of the judgments in the
Bear Island action and even if the appellants could still claim
an interest in the lands based on a breach of the Treaty, I agree
with Winkler J. that they cannot do so in their outstanding
caution appeals.  I come to this conclusion, however, for
different reasons than he did.  Winkler J. held that breach of
the Robinson-Huron Treaty had not been raised as a ground of
appeal in the appellants&#146; notices of appeal or amended notices of
appeal in the caution proceedings.  He then refused to permit the
appellants to add this ground of appeal in response to his
reasons.  To do so, in his view, was analogous to seeking to
amend a nullity.  Thus, he concluded that: &#147;The appellants may
commence a fresh proceeding claiming the alleged breach of the
treaty&#148; but &#147;they cannot &#133; properly pursue that issue within the
framework of this proceeding&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[54] I would agree with Winkler J.&#146;s reasoning if I were
convinced that the existing notices of appeal did not include
breach of the Treaty as a ground of appeal.  However, in response
to the Supreme Court&#146;s decision in the Bear Island case, the
appellants amended their notices of appeal in the caution
proceedings to include the following ground:

               &#133;The Supreme Court of Canada found that the Crown had
          breached its fiduciary obligations to the Appellants herein in
          connection with an agreement pursuant to which the Appellants
          surrendered their aboriginal right in the subject lands in
          exchange for treaty annuities and a reserve.</pre>
    <pre>[55] Although not well-drafted, this ground can reasonably be
read to refer to a claim to the lands based on a breach of the
Treaty.
[56] However, at least two other reasons support the order that
Winkler J. made.  First, as I have already said, the parties
agreed that the Bear Island litigation would decide the outcome
of the caution appeals.  I find no good reason why the court
should overlook the parties&#146; agreement.  This agreement is
reflected in the wording of the judgment of Steele J., which
deliberately tracks the language of s.48(1) of the Land Titles
Act,31 authorizing the registration of a caution.
[57] Second, the cautions registered by the appellants in 1973
cover over 4,000 square miles.  Cautions over such a vast tract
of land are consistent only with a claim of aboriginal title.
They cannot possibly support a claim to a far more limited area
for a reserve, similar to the reserves set aside under the
Robinson-Huron Treaty itself.  Therefore, I do not think that the
appellants can use the existing cautions to support their new
theory of the case.  They might have tried to register new
cautions based on a breach of the Treaty, but these new cautions
would differ radically from those registered in 1973.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[58] For all of these reasons, I would dismiss the appellants&#146;
appeals, with costs if demanded by Ontario.  I would also modify
the order of Winkler J. to give effect to my conclusion that res
judicata precludes the appellants from claiming an interest in
the lands because of a breach of the Robinson-Huron Treaty.
Winkler J. ordered no costs of the application before him and I
would not disturb that order.</pre>
