    <pre>On appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review Board dated
November 18, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>OSBORNE A.C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Alexander Beauchamp, pleaded guilty to three
counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221), four
counts of failing to remain at the scene of an accident (s.
252(1)), one count of criminal negligence (s. 219), one count of
assault causing bodily harm (s. 267(b)) and two counts of
assaulting a peace officer (s. 270(1)(a)). On October 6, 1998, he
was found Not Criminally Responsible on account of mental
disorder by His Honour Judge Palmer. The trial judge did not make
a disposition pursuant to s. 672.47(1) of the Criminal Code.
Thus, the appellant appeared before the Ontario Review Board (the
&#147;Board&#148;) at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre (&#147;Penetang&#148;)
for hearing and disposition pursuant to s. 672.47(1)) on November
12, 1998.
[2]  The Board determined that the appellant should be detained
in the medium secure unit of the Whitby Mental Health Centre
(&#147;Whitby&#148;), subject to certain conditions, and that he be
detained at Penetang until the order transferring him to Whitby
was effected. It is this Board disposition from which the
appellant appeals. His principal submission is that the Board&#146;s
disposition ordering his transfer to the medium, as opposed to
the minimum, secure unit at Whitby is unreasonable, in that it is
an order that was not supported by the evidence. The appellant
also submits that the Board erred in not imposing a deadline, or
timelines, on his transfer to Whitby. He also complains, in the
circumstances understandably, that he has not in fact been
transferred from Penetang to Whitby. Thus, as the anniversary
date of the Board&#146;s order quickly approaches, it is significant
that the order has not been brought into effect.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>     The Index Offences</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The relevant facts are set out in an agreed statement of
fact which was filed with the court following the appellant&#146;s
arraignment and his plea of not guilty. The agreed statement of
fact was part of the record before the Board. The facts can be
summarized as follows.
[4]  On July 5, 1998, the appellant drove his vehicle at a high
rate of speed in a northerly direction on Highway 400. He
deliberately struck a number of other vehicles, including two
motorcycles. He caused damage to the vehicles and injury to some
of the drivers and occupants. He did not remain at the scene of
any of the multiple driving incidents. He eventually stopped only
to close the hood of his car which had come open following one of
the series of collisions in which the appellant was intentionally
involved. At this time one of the drivers whose car had been
struck by the appellant&#146;s car approached the appellant and the
appellant became involved in a physical altercation with him.
This resulted in the driver suffering bodily harm. The appellant
then drove in a northerly direction on Highway 400. He was
eventually stopped by the O.P.P. following a high-speed chase,
arrested and taken into custody. The next day, at the Barrie
Jail, he was involved in a physical altercation with two
correctional officers. These various incidents led to the charges
against the appellant.
[5]  At the time of the offence the appellant was 22 years old.
He had no criminal record and no history of violence or
psychiatric history. He was not under the influence of drugs or
alcohol at the time of the index offences.
[6]  Following a 30-day assessment, which was ordered by the
court, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from
schizophrenia of the paranoid type. His psychiatrist&#146;s opinion
was that, during the index offences, the appellant was in a
psychotic state and was not capable of appreciating the nature
and quality of his actions from a moral and legal perspective.
[7]  On October 6, 1998, the appellant was found Not Criminally
Responsible on three counts of criminal negligence causing bodily
harm, four counts of failing to stop at the scene of an accident,
two counts of assaulting a police officer, one count of criminal
negligence and one count of assault causing bodily harm.</pre>
    <pre>THE BOARD HEARING AND DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[8]  At the time of the s. 672.47(1) hearing on November 12,
1998, the Board had before it the report of the administrator of
the Mental Health Centre, two reports from Dr. Mantle, a
psychiatrist who was responsible for the appellant&#146;s care at
Penetang, the agreed statement of fact filed in the provincial
court and letters of support for the appellant. In addition, on
November 12, 1998, the Board heard viva voce evidence from Dr.
Mantle, the Clinical Liaison Officer of the Mental Health Centre
and the appellant.
[9]  It was common ground that the appellant required further
treatment in a hospital setting and that he should not be
discharged absolutely or on conditions. It was accepted that the
appellant did not need to be detained in a maximum security
environment. In the result, the issue before the Board was
whether a medium or minimum secure hospital order should be made.
The Board also had to consider where the appellant should be
detained.
[10] The Mental Health Centre clinical team responsible for the
appellant&#146;s care in Penetang expressed the opinion that the
appellant should be transferred to the locked minimum secure unit
at Whitby. Dr. Mantle testified that she had witnessed a steady
and gradual improvement in the appellant while he was at
Penetang. She said that his needs could be better addressed in
the minimum secure setting at Whitby. She did, however, express
concern that the appellant had potential for unpredictable,
explosive behaviour and that further assessment of him was
required. In the hospital administrator&#146;s report, dated October
29, 1998, it was noted that the appellant was still unable to
appreciate the potentially serious consequences of his behaviour
during the index offences and how dangerous his behaviour had
been to the well-being of others. Apparently, during clinical
interviews the appellant stated in a quite matter of fact manner
that he did not consider his driving to be out of the ordinary.
He was of the opinion that his actions did not really endanger
any one. He continued to think that others on the road intended
to harm him.
[11] Dr. Mantle recognized that the appellant had only been
receiving active treatment for &#147;a relatively short period of
time.&#148;  She confirmed that the clinical team was concerned about
the appellant&#146;s past substance abuse. In this regard, the
appellant admitted having used cocaine, marijuana and alcohol
because they made him feel good. She was, nonetheless, confident
that the appellant would not seek drugs in a less secure
facility.
[12] Dr. Mantle said that the appellant would require ongoing
treatment for his condition on an indefinite basis and that if he
stopped taking his medication it was quite likely that there
would be a recurrence or a relapse.
[13] In preparation for the hearing, Dr. Mantle spoke to Mrs.
McAuley, the intake person at Whitby, about the nature of the
programs and services available there. Dr. Mantle concluded that
all of the appellant&#146;s treatment needs were available at Whitby.
[14] The alternate chairperson of the Board questioned Dr. Mantle
about the differences between the treatment available in the
minimum and medium secure units at Whitby. Dr. Mantle stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               When I asked Mrs. McAuley if much of the same services were
          available in the medium secure part of the facility, she replied
          in the affirmative. However, much of our focus here is seeing Mr.
          Beauchamp receive much of his rehabilitation supervised in the
          community with a view to eventually having more independent
          living, and Mrs. McAuley did indicate to me that just by virtue
          of the fact that the medium security is just that, the
          opportunity for even staff accompanied access would be less
          likely than if he were in minimum security. So that was the issue
          we were somewhat concerned with.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[15] Dr. Mantle also referred to the results of the appellant&#146;s
EEG test done on July 5, 1998. That test revealed a very mild
abnormality. To complete the medical picture, it was recommended
that the appellant have a further EEG before he was transferred
to Whitby.
[16] The clinical team and hospital administrator were of the
view that the appellant required &#147;intensive rehabilitative
programming along with carefully and professionally supervised
gradual community access.&#148;  The administrator&#146;s report recognized
that the recommendation that the appellant be transferred to the
minimum secure unit at Whitby was &#147;unusual, particularly in this
case given the seriousness of the index offence.&#148;  The clinical
team and hospital administrator nonetheless maintained this
minimum security recommendation because it would provide the best
opportunity to the appellant to benefit from rehabilitative
therapies and to facilitate his reintegration into the community.
[17] The appellant testified that he was no longer &#147;psychotic.&#148;
He explained that his psychosis had been eliminated by
&#147;medication.&#148;  He pledged that he would take his medication as
long as his doctors told him to do so.
[18] The Board stated in its disposition that it had canvassed
all of the evidence and reviewed the parties&#146; submissions. Having
done so, the Board concluded that the appellant remained a
significant threat to the safety of the public and he needed to
remain in a hospital environment for an extended period. The
Board concluded that the appellant was not totally clear as to
what his problem was. It also noted that Dr. Mantle acknowledged
that further EEG testing of the appellant was desirable.
[19] I should note that the Board&#146;s order that the appellant be
transferred to Whitby was significant in that it was recognized
that the appellant had benefited, and could continue to benefit,
from the support of his family. Whitby is a hospital reasonably
close to the appellant&#146;s family. Thus, ongoing consistent family
visitation could best be effected were the appellant to be
detained at Whitby, not some other medium or minimum secure
facility.
[20] Presumably, the Board&#146;s decision to attach no date by which
the appellant was to be transferred to the Whitby medium secure
unit was based upon evidence concerning the need for further
treatment at Penetang. Although Dr. Mantle had received &#147;verbal
approval&#148; from the Whitby with respect to the appellant&#146;s
transfer there, the Board recognized that it might not be
possible to effect an immediate transfer.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[21] Against that general background the appellant raises the
following issues:
     </pre>
    <pre>     i)   Did the Board err in finding that the appellant should be
          detained at Whitby in its medium secure unit rather than at the
          same hospital in its minimum secure unit?
     </pre>
    <pre>     ii)  Did the Board err in not imposing a time limit within which
          its order was to be implemented?</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     i)   Did the Board err in finding that the appellant should
          be detained in Whitby in its medium secure unit rather
          than at the same hospital in its minimum secure unit?</pre>
    <pre>[22] The authority of the Board is set out in s. 672.54 of the
Criminal Code. It provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               672.54    Where a court or Review Board makes a disposition
          pursuant to subsection 672.45(2) or section 672.47, it shall,
          taking into consideration the need to protect the public from
          dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, the
          reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of
          the accused, make one of the following dispositions that is the
          least onerous and least restrictive to the accused:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  where a verdict of not criminally
          responsible on account of mental disorder has
          been rendered in respect of the accused and,
          in the opinion of the court or Review Board,
          the accused is not a significant threat to
          the safety of the public, by order, direct
          that the accused be discharged absolutely;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  by order, direct that the accused
          be discharged subject to such conditions as
          the court or Review Board considers
          appropriate; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  by order, direct that the accused
          be detained in custody in a hospital, subject
          to such conditions as the court or Review
          Board considers appropriate.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant&#146;s release by an absolute or conditional
discharge order was, and is, a non-issue since it was accepted by
all concerned that the appellant required continued treatment in
a custodial/hospital setting. The issue here is whether the
medium security condition attached to the Board&#146;s disposition, as
opposed to a minimum security condition, was &#147;appropriate&#148;  in
the context of the appellant&#146;s submission that the medium secure
unit condition was unreasonable, that is a condition which was
not supported by the evidence.
[24] The authority of the Court of Appeal is set out in s.
672.78. It provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               672.78  (1)  The court of appeal may allow an appeal against
          a disposition or placement decision and set aside an order made
          by the court or Review Board, where the court of appeal is of the
          opinion that
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)       it is unreasonable or cannot
          be supported by the evidence;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)       it is based on a wrong
          decision on a question of law; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)       there was a miscarriage of
          justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The court of appeal may dismiss an
          appeal against a disposition or placement
          decision where the court is of the opinion
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  that paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c)
          do not apply; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  that paragraph (1)(b) may apply,
               but the court finds that no substantial wrong
               or miscarriage of justice has occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  Where the court of appeal allows an
          appeal against a disposition or
          placement decision, it may
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  make any disposition under section
               672.54 or any placement decision that the
               Review Board could have made;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  refer the matter back to the court
               or Review Board for rehearing, in whole
               or in part, in accordance with any
               directions that the court of appeal
               considers appropriate; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  make any other order that justice
          requires.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[25] Section 678.78(1)(a) provides that the court may allow an
appeal against a disposition where it is of the opinion that the
disposition is &#147;unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence.&#148;  As Doherty J.A. observed in Peckham v. Attorney
General of Ontario et al. (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Ont. C.A.)
this language is the same as appears in s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the
Criminal Code in respect of appeals from conviction. In Peckham,
Doherty J.A. stated, at p. 454:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The caselaw developed under s. 686(1)(a)(i) has direct
          application to s. 672.78(1)(a). That caselaw recognizes that the
          section empowers an appellate court to review findings of fact
          made at trial. That power is, however, limited to the
          reasonableness standard set out in the section. An appellate
          court may not judge the correctness of findings of fact made at
          trial or the verdict based on those findings, but can assess only
          the reasonableness of those findings and the consequent verdict.
          An appellate court may interfere only where it is satisfied, upon
          an independent review of the evidence, that a trier of fact,
          properly instructed and acting reasonably could not have
          convicted.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[26] The review under s. 672.78(1)(a) is not a review of the
correctness of findings made in the disposition. The review is
limited to a review of the evidence to determine whether the
Board, properly instructed and acting reasonably, could have
reached the conclusion it did &#150; in this case that the appellant
be transferred from the maximum secure unit at Penetang to the
medium secure unit at Whitby.
[27] In undertaking the reasonableness analysis required by
s.672.78(1)(a), the reviewing court must take into account the
Board&#146;s expertise and its special advantage in dealing with
issues like those that were before the Board here. See
Penetanguishene Mental Centre v. Ontario (Attorney General)
(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 473, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada refused May 31, 1999.
[28] In my view, given the evidence before the Board and its
accepted expertise and advantages, I do not think it can be said
that the medium security condition attached to the Board&#146;s
disposition was unreasonable. There is no doubt that the medical
(hospital) evidence supported a minimum secure unit, not a medium
secure unit, condition. However, the evidentiary record before
the Board extended beyond the evidence of the clinical staff
and the Hospital.
[29] The Board fully reviewed all of the documentary and oral
evidence that was before it. In my opinion, the Board was
entitled to reject the recommendation of the clinical team and
the hospital administrator on the issue whether the appellant&#146;s
continuing hospitalization should be in a minimum or medium
secure unit. In resolving this issue as it did I do not think the
Board acted unreasonably. It was entitled to consider and did
consider:
    </pre>
    <pre>        the nature and circumstances of the index offences which
       reveal a serious potential for lethal acts by the appellant;
    </pre>
    <pre>        the short period of treatment that the appellant had
       undergone while at Penetang;
    </pre>
    <pre>        the appellant&#146;s incomplete understanding of his mental
       condition and his actions at the time of the index offences;
    </pre>
    <pre>        the only meaningful difference between the treatment
       available to the appellant in the medium and minimum secure units
       at Whitby is the ease with which the appellant would have access
       to the community;
    </pre>
    <pre>        the need to protect the public from persons who might be
       dangerous.</pre>
    <pre>[30] I would, therefore, not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     ii)  Did the Board err in not imposing a time limit within
          which its order was to be implemented?</pre>
    <pre>[31] I do not think the Board erred or acted unreasonably in not
imposing a time limit for the appellant&#146;s transfer to Whitby.
Having said that, the failure to effect the transfer before June
15, 1999 when this appeal was argued seems to me to border on the
inexcusable. I will return to that issue shortly.
[32] As I have noted, there was some evidence that militated in
favour of reasonable flexibility concerning the appellant&#146;s
transfer due to further EEG testing which the appellant required.
This, of course, would not support a lengthy delay in the
transfer since the EEG could, if required, be done at Whitby.
While there was some contact with the administrators at Whitby
the result of which was &#147;a verbal approval&#148; for the appellant&#146;s
transfer to the minimum secure unit of that hospital, the
evidence was not clear whether this verbal approval also extended
to his placement in the medium secure unit. In any case, given
the lack of certainty about the date on which the transfer could
reasonably be effected, I do not think the Board erred in not
imposing a deadline.
[33] There is no statutory requirement that the Board include a
date by which a hospital transfer order is to be implemented. For
the system to work, orders of the Board must be capable of
implementation and the implementation of the Board&#146;s orders must
be effected within a reasonable time. What the time frame will be
will depend on a variety of circumstances.
[34] In this case, I think it was reasonable for the Board to
conclude that it was not necessary to impose timelines on the
appellant&#146;s transfer to a medium secure unit in Whitby.
[35] This, however, does not resolve the appellant&#146;s current
problem. As I have said, he has not yet been transferred to
Whitby at all. This is clearly unacceptable.
[36] The Supreme Court of Canada recently considered the
constitutionality of the mental disorder amendments to the
Criminal Code in R. v. Winko (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 129 in
response to the accused&#146;s submission that the Code&#146;s provision
for the detention of those found Not Criminally Responsible were
unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that the amendments,
Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code, did not violate the accused&#146;s
rights to liberty, security of the person and equality under the
Charter.1
[37] McLachlin J. reviewed the policy objectives of the mental
disorder amendments. She said, at paras. 21 and 42:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Part XX.1 rejects the notion that the only alternatives for
          mentally ill people charged with an offence are conviction or
          acquittal; it proposes a third alternative. Under the new scheme,
          once an accused person is found to have committed a crime while
          suffering from a mental disorder that deprived him or her of the
          ability to understand the nature of the act or that it was wrong
          that individual is diverted into a special stream. Thereafter,
          the court or a review board conducts a hearing to decide whether
          the person should be kept in a secure institution, released on
          conditions or unconditionally discharged. The emphasis is on
          achieving the twin goals of protecting the public and treating
          the mentally ill offender fairly and appropriately.

    <pre>               By creating an assessment-treatment
          alternative for the mentally ill offender to
          supplant the criminal law conviction &#150;
          acquittal dichotomy, Parliament has signalled
          that the NCR accused is to be treatment with
          the utmost dignity and afforded the utmost
          liberty compatible with his or her situation.
          The NCR accused is not to be punished. Nor is
          the NCR accused to languish in custody at the
          pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor, as was
          once the case. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[38] I do not think that this court is in a position to order the
appellant&#146;s immediate transfer since we are unaware of the
competing demands to which the medium secure unit at Whitby may
be exposed. However, I think that any system that would meet the
standards referred to by McLachlin J. in Winko, must in fact
operate so that transfer orders, such as the order made here, are
implemented within a reasonable time.
[39] Leaving the appellant in a maximum security environment
where it is acknowledged he does not belong does not represent
treatment that is fair and appropriate. Leaving the appellant
where he is, in the face of the Board&#146;s transfer order, does not
provide a satisfactory alternative to the old system referred to
by McLachlin J. when she said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Nor is the NCR accused to languish in custody at the
          pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor, as was once the case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[40] Counsel for the administrator suggested that the appellant
could apply under s. 672.82. It provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               672.82 (1)  A Review Board may hold a hearing to review any
          of its dispositions at any time, at the request of the accused or
          any other party.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Where a party requests a review of
          a disposition under this section, the party
          is deemed to abandon any appeal against the
          disposition taken under section 672.72.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[41] I acknowledge that the appellant could make application
under this section and that, as counsel suggested, that
application might bring the facilities issue to the forefront. I
do not think access to this section of the Code resolves the
appellant&#146;s problem. The appellant should not have to apply to
the Board to secure the implementation of the Board&#146;s transfer
order. In any event, a s. 672.82 motion would result in a
circular movement, likely not progress. It may well be that, in
order to achieve the transfer that the Board has ordered, the
appellant will have to bring an application by way of mandamus,
outside of Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code. Whatever is done, the
appellant&#146;s transfer should be effected quickly, I would hope
without further intervention of the courts.
[42] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.
