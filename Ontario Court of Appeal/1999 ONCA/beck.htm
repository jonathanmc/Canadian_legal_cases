</pre>
    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Given the complexity of the respondent's treatments and
injuries, the trial judge's unusual suggestion to the jury to
attempt to deal separately with each injury was, in this case,
not an error.  There was no objection to the charge by the
appellants' counsel at trial and the evidence of the respondent's
injuries is largely uncontradicted.  In any event, the assessment
of damages is consistent with the respondent's injuries.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellants submitted that they were prejudiced by the
trial judge's refusal to permit the showing of the 75-minute
surveillance tape during the respondent's case.  In particular,
they submit that the inability to use the tape in the cross-
examination of the respondent and of some of the experts reduced
the appellants' ability to make an impact on  the jury.  We do
not agree.  The appellants were not deprived of the right to show
the tapes and in fact did so in the presentation of their case.
There were, in addition, ample opportunities for appellants'
counsel to use the information on the tapes in cross-examination.
The jury was reminded, both by appellants' counsel in final
submissions and by the trial judge in his charge, of the
discrepancies between the respondent's evidence and what the
tapes demonstrated.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We see no prejudice to the appellants in the trial judge's
ruling regarding the surveillance tape, and would not interfere
with the exercise of his discretion about the timing of its
presentation during the trial.  Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67
(H.C.) has no application since the safeguard belongs to the
witness, who, in this case, chose to waive it.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellants object to the rulings by the trial judge
which allowed four expert reports to be made exhibits when their
authors also gave oral evidence at the trial.  Counsel relies on
the decision of this court in Ferraro v. Lee (1974), 2 O.R. (3d)
417, which held that, as a general rule, medical reports are not
to be filed in jury trials if the medical expert is called to
give evidence.  However, that case held that it is a matter of
discretion for the trial judge.  The trial judge in the present
case applied that rule in the case of the medical doctors who
were called, but because he was, erroneously, of the view that a
psychologist's report was not covered by s. 52 of the Evidence
Act, he allowed Dr. Scherer's report to be filed.  In our view,
there was no prejudice in allowing Dr. Scherer's report to be
filed, as the defence called no evidence  to respond to his
report and counsel did not suggest that Dr. Scherer was
successfully undermined in cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge also allowed the reports of three other
experts, not covered by s. 52 of the Evidence Act, to be filed.
There is no rule corresponding to s. 52 for non-medical reports.
That is a matter of discretion for the trial judge.  We see no
error in the exercise of his discretion and can see no prejudice
caused to the appellants from the filing of the three reports.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant argues that he should have been able to call
Dr. Freedman, a neuropsychologist.  Dr. Freedman's report was
prepared at the request of Royal Insurance of Canada, the
respondent's insurer, for the sole purpose of determining whether
the respondent qualified for weekly income benefits under the
Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule of the Insurance Act.  At
the outset of the trial, both parties agreed that no reference to
insurance benefits would be made to the jury.  When the
appellants sought to introduce Dr. Freedman's evidence, the
respondent objected on the basis that he could not effectively
cross-examine Dr. Freedman without asking who commissioned his
report and for what purpose, the very issue the parties agreed
would not be mentioned to the jury.  The trial judge accepted the
respondent's argument and refused to allow either Dr. Freedman's
viva voce evidence or the filing of his two reports.  We agree
with the trial judge that the prejudice to the respondent would
have been substantial in allowing the evidence to be introduced,
whereas any prejudice to the appellants was minimal, especially
since they were able to produce evidence from their own
neuropsychological expert.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The parties agree that the calculation of damages should be
varied in a number of respects.  We leave to counsel the proper
arithmetical calculations and the judgment will be varied
according to their agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Subject to that variation, the appeal is dismissed with
costs.</pre></td>
