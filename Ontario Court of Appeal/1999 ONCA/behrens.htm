    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Pardu J. dated September 1, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.: (Dissenting)</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal by Cherie Stoodley from the judgment  of
Pardu  J.,  dated  September 1, 1998,  awarding  custody  of  her
daughter,  C.J.,  to  the child&#146;s father, Douglas  Behrens,  with
generous access to the appellant.
[2]  The trial judge was of the opinion that it was in the best
interest of the child that she be in the custody of her father.
In reaching this conclusion, she addressed the guidelines in s.
24 of the Children&#146;s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 for
determining the best interest of a child.  As well, she rejected
the recommendation of Jean-Marc Bisson  that the appellant resume
sole custody of C.J.  Pursuant to the order of Caputo J. made
under s. 112 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43,
Mr. Bisson conducted an investigation of the circumstances
relating to the best interest of C.J., and in two reports which
total 32 pages presented his recommendations to the trial judge.
As well, he testified at the trial.
[3]  To place the trial judge&#146;s conclusions in context, I will
summarize the relevant facts which emerge from the evidence
presented at trial and an agreed statement of facts.
[4]  About four months after C.J.&#146;s birth on February 26, 1990,
the appellant and the respondent, who were married, separated.
They signed a separation agreement on May 15, 1992, in which the
appellant obtained the sole care, custody and control of her
daughter, with no right of access to the respondent.  The
appellant and the respondent were divorced on May 20, 1993.  The
respondent lives in a common law relationship with Carrie
Shelbourne.  They have two young children.  The appellant married
Brian Stoodley in June, 1996.
[5]  Subsequent to the separation, the respondent did not see his
daughter until February, 1994.  Because the appellant believed
that it would be in C.J.&#146;s best interests to develop a healthy
relationship with her father, she arranged for the respondent to
visit with C.J.  This proved to be successful, and over the
following 2-l/2 years C.J. spent lengthy vacation periods with
the respondent and his family.
[6]  During C.J.&#146;s summer visit with the respondent in 1966, she
expressed the wish to spend the school year of 1996-1997 living
with her father and attending school in the area in which he
lives.  Because it was her goal that the child be able to enjoy a
healthy relationship with both of her parents, the appellant,
with some reluctance, agreed.  However, it was understood by the
appellant, the respondent and C.J., that when the school year
ended in June, 1997, C.J. would resume living with her mother.
[7]  As the result of an acrimonious telephone conversation in
March, 1997, between the appellant and Carrie Shelbourne, in
which it appears the appellant indicated she wanted C.J. to be
returned to her, the respondent consulted a lawyer and, on April
3, 1997, commenced proceedings to obtain custody of C.J. On May
16, 1997, the respondent was awarded interim custody of C.J. The
trial which lasted six days, commenced on August 10, 1998.  At
this time, C.J. had been residing with the respondent for about
26 months, prior to which she had lived with her mother since
birth in circumstances in which her mother was her primary
caregiver.  Indeed, throughout the first four years of C.J.&#146;s
life, her mother was her exclusive caregiver.
[8]  In his report of October 14, 1997, Mr. Bisson, to whom C.J.
had stated she wished to live with her mother, recommended that
the respondent resume sole custody of C.J.   Although he reported
that both parents love C.J. and can provide an appropriate home,
it is apparent from his report that his view of C.J.&#146;s custody
was that she was to resume living with her mother at the end of
the 1996-1997 school year.  He felt that it had probably been a
mistake for the parents to believe that a six-year old child &#147;was
emotionally ready to distance herself from her mother for an
entire school year&#148;.  He concluded:</pre>
    <pre>          C.J.  has expressed a deep desire to  be
          with her mother.  Cherie is willing  and
          available  to  resume the child&#146;s  care,
          has  appropriate accommodation  and  the
          support  of her spouse, and so it  would
          be  in C.J.&#146;s best interest to return to
          her   mother&#146;s  care  at  the   earliest
          opportunity.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   By  the time Mr. Bisson prepared his second report on  July
21,  1998,  for  the  purpose  of updating  his  earlier  report,
circumstances had changed somewhat.  A year had passed  and  C.J.
had  now lived for over two years with her father.  She expressed
the  wish  to  continue  living  with  her  father.   Mr.  Bisson
speculated  that  she may have expressed this  wish  because  the
delay of a year in bringing the case to trial may have caused her
to conclude &#147;that her initial wish to return to her mother&#146;s home
was  just not going to happen and therefore [she] settled on  her
father&#146;s  home&#148;.  As well, he thought that C.J. might  have  been
influenced by the respondent and his partner &#147;to think  that  she
should be living with her father and Carrie&#148;.
[10] Mr. Bisson concluded his second report as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It    should   be   noted    that    the
          recommendations  made  in   my   initial
          report  were  not based  solely  on  the
          child&#146;s  clearly stated wishes, although
          this  was  a  factor to  be  considered.
          Several   other  points  of  view   were
          outlined  that would give merit  to  the
          child being returned to her mother.
          </pre>
    <pre>          C.J.&#146;s  bond with her mother is stronger
          than  the  relationship she shares  with
          her  father. This is probably due to the
          fact  that C.J. was reared by her mother
          from  birth  until  age  6.   This  bond
          between  C.J.  and her mother  is  still
          evident today. Although this father  can
          provide   an  adequate  home   for   his
          daughter, it must be recognized that due
          to  his  commitment to work,  the  child
          would  largely be reared by  his  common
          law    partner.    Although    a    good
          relationship exists between  Carrie  and
          C.J., it does not override the bond that
          exists between C.J. and her mother.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is apparent that C.J. needs a lot of
          adult  attention.   This  can  be   more
          easily  provided  in the  mother&#146;s  home
          since  she  does not have to divide  her
          attention  between  two  other  children
          like Carrie must do.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Because  C.J. has lived in her  father&#146;s
          home  for  the  past two  years,  it  is
          natural  that  she would have  developed
          relationships  with  her  siblings   and
          neighbourhood  friends.  However,  after
          considering all the factors,  especially
          C.J.'s  long-standing relationship  with
          her  mother, I believe that  this  child
          should  still be returned to her  mother
          immediately and that the recommendations
          as  outlined  in  my initial  report  be
          implemented.</pre>
    <pre>[11]  It is regrettable that neither party has provided the court
with any information about C.J.&#146;s well-being during the 15 months
that have passed since the trial.  This leaves the court with  no
alternative  but  to assess what is in her best interest  on  the
basis  of  the  circumstances which were presented to  the  trial
judge.
[12] As I understand her reasons, the trial judge was not
prepared to attach any significant weight to C.J.&#146;s expressed
wishes to the assessor in 1997 to return to her mother.  In
reaching this conclusion, Pardu J. was influenced by what she
believed was C.J.&#146;s &#147;preparation&#148; by a psychotherapist for C.J.&#146;s
interview by the assessor and by a telephone conversation between
C.J. and her mother, which the respondent had secretly tape
recorded, in which the mother directed &#147;venom&#148; toward the
respondent and appeared to exert pressure on C.J. to return to
her home.
[13] As I mentioned earlier, Pardu J. rejected the
recommendations contained in Mr. Bisson&#146;s two reports.  As well,
she was not prepared to attach much weight to C.J.&#146;s wishes, as
expressed to Mr. Bisson, due to &#147;the variability of the child&#146;s
wishes&#148;.  These appear to be the trial judge&#146;s reasons for doing
so:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   commitment  demonstrated  by   the
          mother  in  providing for  her  daughter
          during  the  first  six  years  of   the
          child&#146;s   life   is   substantial,   and
          particularly impressive in light of  the
          fact that she had no assistance from the
          child&#146;s  father from separation  to  the
          child&#146;s fourth birthday.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  father&#146;s  last 26 months  with  the
          child  must  also  be  weighed  in   the
          balance. The child has a close emotional
          bond with the mother, but also with  her
          father,  Carrie Shelbourne, her siblings
          and    Tina    Behrens,   the   paternal
          grandmother.   This  child  has  endured
          multiple separations from individuals to
          whom  she  has been close, firstly,  the
          move  from  Sudbury, and close proximity
          to  the  maternal grandmother; secondly,
          the  ending  of  the close  relationship
          with  Steven Wicks and his parents  and,
          finally  the separation from her mother.
          After more than two years, the child has
          adjusted  to  living with  her  father&#146;s
          family,  and  leaving  that  home  would
          entail   a  wrenching  separation   from
          family members with whom      she has  a
          close relationship.  A change in custody
          would   require  adjustment  to  a   new
          community  and  a  new school,  and  new
          caregivers which would be required  when
          the  Respondent  and  her  husband  were
          working.  The child is secure and  happy
          in her father&#146;s home.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  activities  which the  child  would
          share  with her mother would undoubtedly
          be  different  from those in  which  the
          father  has an interest, but  I  am  not
          prepared  to conclude that doing  crafts
          and  shopping  are more in  the  child&#146;s
          best  interests than hockey, soccer  and
          baseball.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Although  Pardu  J. was satisfied that  either  parent  was
capable   of   providing  C.J.  with  guidance,  education,   the
necessaries  of  life and seeing to her special needs,  &#147;weighing
all  in  the  balance&#148;, she concluded &#147;that it is in the  child&#146;s
best interests to remain with her father with generous access  to
her mother&#148;.
[15] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge
made three fundamental errors in principle:

          (1) She refused to accept Mr. Bisson&#146;s conclusions
          concerning the child&#146;s wishes and his recommendation
	  regarding custody based on those wishes, and, therefore,
	  attached insufficient weight to his recommendation that
	  there be no change in C.J.&#146;s custody.
          (2)   She attached undue weight to the  tape-
          recorded telephone conversation between  C.J.
          and her mother.
          (3)   She attached undue weight to the status quo.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  I  am  mindful  of the standard of appellate  review  of  a
custody  decision.  In Haider v. Malach (1999), 48  R.F.L.  (4th)
314 (Sask. C.A.), that standard was considered by Jackson J.A. on
behalf of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.  After noting that in
Adams  v. McLeod, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621 the Supreme Court of Canada
had approved the standard of appellate review stated by the House
of Lords in McKee v. McKee, [1951] A.C. 352 to the effect that  a
trial  judge&#146;s  decision as to custody should  not  be  overruled
unless he or she has acted on some wrong principle or disregarded
material evidence, she continued at pp. 318-19:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Today, this standard is stated in  terms
          of  an error in principle, a failure  to
          consider   all   relevant   factors,   a
          consideration of an irrelevant factor or
          a   lack  of  factual  support  for  the
          judgment (see, for example, C. (G.C.) v.
          New  Brunswick  (Minister  of  Health  &amp;
          Community  Services),  [1988]  1  S.C.R.
          1073   (S.C.C.),  at  1077),   but   the
          standard   of   appellate   review    is
          essentially the same as that  stated  in
          McKee:  error  in  principle  or   clear
          factual    error   in   a   matter    of
          significance.    The     most     recent
          confirmation of the standard  of  review
          comes from Gonthier J., writing for  the
          Court, in Nouveau-Brunswick (Ministre de
          la  santé &amp; des services communautaires)
          c.  L. (M.) (1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th)  58
          (S.C.C.)  where  he  cautions  appellate
          courts  to be circumspect in family  law
          matters,  especially  where  the   trial
          judgment is detailed and meticulous (see
          para.  36  of  the unreported  judgment)
          which  the  judgment under under  appeal
          is.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Counsel  for  the respondent argued that  the  standard  of
appellate  review  precludes intervention  in  this  appeal.   He
referred  to a number of custody cases in which, exercising  this
standard, appellate courts have declined to intervene.   However,
there  are cases in which this court, and other courts of appeal,
like  the  court  in  Haider,  have intervened.   I  adopt  these
comments  of Jackson J.A. at p. 319: &#147;We cannot say that  custody
cases need never be appealed.  The standard is a strict one,  but
by  its  very  terms it admits of intervention in the appropriate
case.&#148;  In my view, I am satisfied that this is such a case.
[18] Although counsel for the appellant chose to characterize the
grounds for appeal as I have indicated, the real issue which the
appellant raised is the failure of Pardu J. to consider whether
it was in C.J.&#146;s best interest to change her custodial parent,
particularly in regard to the circumstances in which C.J. came to
live with the respondent and the absence of any suggestion by the
respondent, or Mr. Bisson, that the appellant is an unfit parent.
Stated somewhat differently, the appellant&#146;s position is that the
trial judge failed to give appropriate weight to maintaining the
stability of the relationship which C.J. has with the appellant,
who has been C.J.&#146;s primary caregiver since her birth. The onus
was on the respondent, who sought to interfere with the stable
relationship which existed between C.J. and her mother since
C.J.&#146;s birth, to establish that a change in custody could only be
made if it were in C.J.&#146;s best interest. It is worth emphasizing
that in presenting his case the respondent advanced no
substantial reasons why he should be granted custody of C.J.  He
did not rest his case on the ground that the appellant was an
unfit parent, but rather that throughout the time C.J. resided
with him he had demonstrated his fitness as a parent.
[19] In Haider, a child had lived with her parents for more than
three years prior to their separation, and for more than three
years thereafter had lived exclusively with her mother until the
trial which resulted in her father&#146;s successful application for
custody.  In reversing the trial judge, Jackson J.A. concluded
that the trial judge erred in principle in failing to recognize,
and consider, the emphasis placed by Canadian courts on the need
to maintain stability in a child&#146;s life unless there is the most
compelling reason to disturb it.  In my view, Pardu J. made a
similar error in principle.
[20] In Haider, at p. 337, Jackson J.A., quoted the following
passage from the reasons of L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. in Gordon v.
Goertz, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, at 92-93, commenting on the
significance of the primary caregiver and psychological parent:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   assessment  of  the  child&#146;s  best
          interests  also involves a consideration
          of  the  particular role  and  emotional
          bonding the child enjoys with his or her
          primary  caregiver.  The  importance  of
          preserving the child&#146;s relationship with
          his or her psychological parent has long
          been  recognized  by  this  court  on  a
          number of occasions (Catholic Children&#146;s
          Aid  Society of Metropolitan Toronto  v.
          M.  (C.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165 at p. 202;
          Racine v. Woods, supra, at p. 188:  King
          v.  Low, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 87, at p. 101).
          There is a growing body of evidence that
          this  relationship may well be the  most
          determinative factor on the child&#146;s long-
          term  welfare.  As I mentioned in Young,
          supra,  at p. 66, the vital link between
          continuity  in the emotional bonding  of
          the  child with his or her psychological
          parent  and  the  best interest  of  the
          child   finds  ample  support   in   the
          literature:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Goldstein,  Freud  and   Solnit&#146;s
               Beyond  the Best Interest of  the
               Child,   supra,   while   perhaps
               lacking   in   empirical    data,
               remains  an influential  analysis
               of  the  psychological  needs  of
               children following divorce.   The
               authors  emphasize,  among  other
               factors,   the   importance    of
               continuity    in   the    child&#146;s
               relationships  and conclude  that
               the   major   focus  of   custody
               decisions  should be to  preserve
               and   protect   the  relationship
               between the child and his or  her
               psychological parent. [L&#146;Heureux-

    <pre>[21]  Jackson  J.A.  continued at p. 337 in a passage  which  has
particular application to the circumstances of this appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>          While  the cases to which L&#146;Heureux-Dubé
          J.   mentions   are  ones  involving   a
          biological   parent  and  a   government
          agency,  the principle she cites appears
          in  custody cases at the appellate level
          as  well.  The principle is referred  to
          variously     as    &#147;maintaining     the
          relationship   with  the   psychological
          parent&#148; or &#147;maintaining the status  quo&#148;
          or simply &#147;maintaining stability&#148; in the
          child&#146;s life.  However one describes the
          principle, the Court&#146;s response  is  the
          same.</pre>
    <pre>[22] In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in failing to
give  adequate  consideration to the  importance  of  maintaining
established  stable relationships, and did so in the  absence  of
any  compelling evidence that it was in the best interest of  the
child  to terminate the relationship which had existed since  the
child&#146;s  birth  and  to which the parties had  agreed  when  they
signed  their separation agreement and when they agreed that  the
child  could reside with the respondent throughout the  1996-1997
school year.
[23] Nowhere in her reasons did the trial judge state that in
making a decision as to custody, consideration must be given to
the importance of maintaining stability in the child&#146;s
relationships. Rather, her focus was on the fitness of the
parties and their partners to be parents and the report and
recommendations of the assessor, which, as I have mentioned, she
did not accept.  Although she concluded that either parent could
care for C.J.&#146;s needs, on balance she concluded that it was in
C.J.&#146;s best interest to remain with her father.  As I understand
her reasons, a significant fact leading to this conclusion was
the 26 months which C.J. had spent with her father, subsequent to
his custody application and prior to the trial.  However, in
considering this fact, she failed to appreciate the reason why
C.J. came to live with her father in the summer of 1996, which
was the desire of the appellant that C.J. have the opportunity of
establishing a relationship with her father, together with the
understanding of the parties and C.J. that at the end of the
school year the appellant&#146;s custody of C.J. would continue.
[24] It is in respect to the foregoing fact that the appellant&#146;s
third ground of appeal was directed.  Counsel for the appellant
took the position, with which I agree, that the trial judge
attached undue weight to the status quo as she perceived it.
Moreover, in my view, not only did the trial judge err in
principle in doing so, she misconstrued the true status quo.
[25] A proper characterization of the true status quo at the time
of trial must take into consideration these facts.  The appellant
was the primary and exclusive caregiver of C.J. from the time
C.J. was about four months of age, as acknowledged by the parties
in their separation agreement.  After the parties separated, the
respondent had no contact with C.J. for four years until, in
1994, the appellant encouraged the respondent to exercise access
with a view to C.J. establishing a healthy relationship with her
father which she believed would be in C.J.&#146;s best interest.  When
C.J. came to live with her father for the 1996-1997 school year,
it was with the intention to further establish the relationship,
and with the clear understanding of all concerned that this was
to be a temporary arrangement and that at the end of the school
year C.J. would continue in her mother&#146;s custody.  It was never
intended by anybody that this period of time would be allowed to
ripen, as it were, into a change of custody.  What happened was
that the appellant&#146;s reward for being attentive to her child&#146;s
best interest was the loss of the custody of her child.
[26] Although she did not put it in these precise terms, as I
read the trial judge&#146;s reasons what influenced her decision was
the maintenance of the status quo as she perceived it.  The true
status quo was that the appellant had primary care of C.J., and
when the school year ended, C.J. was to continue living with her
primary caregiver.  The trial judge should not have considered as
a component of the status quo the additional time during which
C.J. resided with her father consequent to his application for
custody and the delay which occurred in bringing the case to
trial.
[27] As well, the trial judge permitted her concept of the status
quo to influence her conclusion that during the extended period
C.J. lived with her father he was able to demonstrate his
abilities to become her custodial parent and that C.J. was
comfortable living with him.  As Abella J.A. stated on behalf of
this court in MacGyver v. Richards (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 481 at
488:
          </pre>
    <pre>          But  it  is, in my view, a quantum  leap
          from the observation that a child has  a
          good  relationship with a  non-custodial
          parent   to  the  conclusion  that   the
          preservation of this relationship is the
          determinative factor in deciding what is
          in the child&#146;s best interests.</pre>
    <pre>[28]  To  characterize  the status quo as  the  trial  judge  did
constituted  a fundamental error in principle.  In my  view,  not
only  does  her characterization work to bonus the respondent  by
creating  a  distorted status quo resulting  from  the  delay  in
bringing  the case to trial, but it also encourages a  parent  in
the position of the respondent to take advantage of the situation
to  seek a change in custody, and then to take steps to delay the
commencement of the trial.  However, I do acknowledge that on the
record  before this court there is no explanation why  the  trial
did not commence before August 10, 1998.
[29] I appreciate that I have defined the issues somewhat
differently than did counsel for the appellant.  However, I did
so for the purpose of better focusing on the real issues before
this court.  Although I did not deal expressly with the first two
grounds of appeal advanced by the respondent, they have not been
overlooked.  Rather, they have been encompassed in the approach
which I have taken to the proper manner of considering the best
interest of C.J. in the context of the facts and circumstances of
this appeal.
[30] With the greatest respect, I must conclude that the trial
judge made the two errors in principle which I have discussed.
Given these errors, I am not satisfied that she would have
reached the same result had she taken the correct approach to
determining the best interest of the child.
[31] As neither party requested that the court order a new trial,
which is one option open in the event that the appeal was
successful, I do not intend to do so.  Rather, I will allow the
appeal and set aside the judgment of Pardu J.  As the appellant
is C.J.'s custodial parent pursuant to her parents&#146; separation
agreement, the respondent is to return C.J. to the appellant&#146;s
custody, and the respondent is to have access on the same terms
as stipulated by the trial judge for the appellant.  The
appellant will have her costs of the trial and the appeal.

    <pre>Released: MAC   DEC 17 1999        Signed: &#147;S. Borins J.A.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[32]  I  have  had  the advantage of reading the  reasons  of  my
colleague  Borins J.A.  With respect, I am unable to  agree  with
the conclusion he has reached.  For the reasons which follow,  it
is  my  view that the trial judge made no error in principle  and
that there is no basis for this court to interfere with the trial
judge&#146;s  determination that it is in the best  interests  of  the
child that she be in the custody of her father, the respondent on
this appeal.
[33] Borins J.A. has set out the essential facts and I will not
repeat them here.  However, there are certain additional facts
which, in my view, do bear upon the issues raised.
[34] Between 1991 and 1995, the appellant developed a close
relationship with Steven Wicks.  This fact is important as the
child, C.J., developed a close relationship with Mr. Wicks,
referring to him as &#147;daddy&#148; and to his parents as &#147;grandma and
grandpa&#148;.  C.J.&#146;s relationship with Mr. Wicks and his parents was
severed when the relationship between Mr. Wicks and the appellant
ended in March 1995.  I mention this as the number of separations
C.J. had endured was a factor considered by the trial judge.
[35] It is also significant, in my view, that on February 18,
1996, a few months before C.J. started living with her father,
the appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident from which
she suffered soft tissue injuries.  The trial judge found that as
a result of this accident, the appellant was unable to work and
that she found it difficult to cope with life for a certain
period of time.  The accident and its effects would seem to have
had some bearing upon the decision of the appellant to allow C.J.
to live with her father for the 1996-1997 school year.
[36] In addition to the disagreement in March 1997, there was
another incident that prompted this application by the respondent
for custody.  A dispute erupted in December 1996 over money owing
pursuant to the separation agreement.  The trial judge found that
in a fit of temper, the mother had retaliated by indicating that
the child would not be returned to her father.  The trial judge
further found that it was the repetition of this threat in March
that led the respondent and his partner to become concerned that
the appellant would remove C.J. from them and that they proceeded
with this custody application.
[37] Finally, I note that there is nothing in the record before
this court to explain why there was a delay from the date interim
custody was ordered in May 1997 until this matter proceeded to
trial before Pardu J. in August of 1998.  There is certainly no
evidence that the respondent was in any way responsible for that
delay nor is there any evidence that the respondent sought to
gain an advantage in his custody application by inappropriately
resting on the interim order he had secured rather than
proceeding expeditiously to trial.
[38] The appellant has raised three grounds of appeal which are
as follows:</pre>
    <pre>1.     that the trial judge erred in refusing to accept the
recommendation of the assessor appointed pursuant to the Courts
of Justice Act R.S.O. 1990, c.43, s.112;
2.     that the trial judge placed undue weight on a tape-
recorded telephone conversation between the appellant and the
child; and
3.     that the trial judge attached undue weight to the status
quo.</pre>
    <pre>[39] In my view, there is no merit to any of these grounds.
[40] The trial judge carefully considered the assessor&#146;s report
and had the advantage of hearing him give his evidence, tested by
cross-examination.  The trial judge&#146;s reasons indicate that she
carefully considered his report and quite simply rejected his
assessment of the best interests of this child.  It is well
established that a trial judge should not delegate decision-
making authority to an assessor:  Strobridge v. Strobridge (1994)
18 O.R. (3d) 753 (C.A.).  The trial proceeded over some six days
affording the trial judge a fuller picture of the situation than
was available to the assessor.  The trial judge concluded that
the assessor&#146;s recommendations had been unduly influenced by his
assessment of the child&#146;s wishes and by his perception that there
was a need to reverse what he considered to be the appellant&#146;s
mistaken decision in the fall of 1996 to allow the child to live
with her father for one year.  The trial judge considered that
the assessor was influenced by what he perceived to be the
inequity that would result from the mother losing custody of her
daughter having taken the risk of re-introducing the father and
the daughter for laudable reasons.  The trial judge found, having
heard the evidence, that she could not accept the assessor&#146;s
conclusions regarding the child&#146;s wishes.
[41] In my view, it was open to the trial judge to make those
findings on the record before her.  In particular, she was
correct in according paramountcy to the best interests of the
child.
[42] With respect to the audio tape, it was more or less conceded
before this court that the trial judge did not err in admitting
the tape into evidence.  In my view, the trial judge was
perfectly entitled to conclude that the tape constituted &#147;graphic
and distressing evidence of venom directed towards the father and
pressure exerted upon the child&#148; and that these statements to the
child &#147;were extremely distressing&#148; and &#147;harmful to her emotional
well-being&#148;.  I observe, however, that I do not agree with the
submission that the trial judge placed undue weight upon this
single piece of evidence.  Rather, the trial judge&#146;s reasons
indicate that she carefully considered all of the evidence,
including what she considered to be inappropriate efforts by the
mother to influence the child in her direction and against the
father.
[43] Finally, I do not agree that the trial judge placed undue
weight upon the status quo.  The trial judge referred to and
applied the criteria identified as applicable to the
determination of the best interests of the child in the
Children&#146;s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.12 s.24.  One of the
criteria, identified in ss.24(c), is the following:  &#147;the length
of time the child has lived in a stable home environment&#148;.  The
trial judge carefully weighed the close emotional bond the child
has with her mother but noted that the child also has a close
emotional bond with her father, her father&#146;s partner, her
siblings, and her paternal grandmother. The child had undergone
what the trial judge aptly described as &#147;multiple separations
from individuals to whom she has been close&#148;.  After more than
two years, she adjusted to living with her father&#146;s family.  The
trial judge concluded that to remove the child at this point from
her father&#146;s family &#147;would entail a wrenching separation from
family members with whom she has a close relationship&#148;.
[44] Far from failing to give adequate consideration to the
importance of maintaining established stable relationships, it
was that very consideration that led the trial judge to find that
it was in the best interests of the child that she be left in the
custody of her father.  Two years is a very long time in the life
of a young child and the trial judge properly considered the
adjustment the child had made to her situation with her father.
The trial judge quite properly focussed squarely on the question
of what was in the best interests of the child in light of the
actual circumstances as they existed at the time of the trial
rather than base her decision on some earlier state of affairs,
or on the perceived rights and wrongs as between the parents or
the need to redress past decisions that might now be regretted.
[45] As this and other courts have repeatedly emphasized, trial
judges are uniquely situated to determine the best interests of
children in custody disputes.  Absent any error in principle, it
is inappropriate for an appellate court to interfere with a trial
judge&#146;s determination of this sensitive issue:  Woodhouse v.
Woodhouse (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) at 439-440; Adams v.
McLeod, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621 at 625;  Fast v. Fast (1983), 33
R.F.L. (2d) 337 (Sask. C.A.) at 346.  In my view, the trial judge
considered the appropriate factors, made no error of principle,
and the appellant has failed to demonstrate any reason for this
court to intervene.
[46] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
