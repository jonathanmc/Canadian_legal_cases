    <pre>[1]  The appellants argue three issues on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  First, they argue that the trial judge erred in making his
finding of fraudulent misrepresentation.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We disagree. The appellants concede that there was an
evidentiary foundation on which the trial judge could properly
find that Mr. Andreoli made a representation concerning the
absence of UFFI insulation which was false and which he knew to
be false. The appellants argue, however, that there was no basis
on which to conclude that Mr. Andreoli intended to deceive the
respondents.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In our view, particularly given the evidence of Mr. Burke
about his discussions with Mr. Andreoli concerning UFFI, its
dangers and the desirability of keeping the presence of UFFI
quiet, it was quite open to the trial judge to find that this
element of the cause of action was established.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  It was equally open to him to conclude that the respondents
relied on this misrepresentation, would not have purchased had
they been told the truth, and suffered damage as a consequence.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  This ground of appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Second, the appellants argue that from the time of the major
renovations in approximately June of 1990, the presence of UFFI
in the building was reasonably discoverable by the respondents
and therefore the appellants are not responsible for losses
incurred by the respondents thereafter.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Again, we disagree. The individual respondents were under no
obligation to inquire about or investigate concerning UFFI,
particularly given the misrepresentation which had been made to
them. There is no evidence that either respondent attended at the
premises during these renovations. Nor was there any evidence
that they otherwise learned of the presence of foam insulation
from those they had employed to do the renovations who, of
course, had no reason to report it to them. Indeed, had the
respondents seen such insulation on the site, it is not at all
clear that they would have known it was UFFI. Mr. Burke said that
this would not be apparent to the average person. Mr. Andreoli
testified that he saw the foam insulation and did not recognize
it as UFFI.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the presence of
UFFI should reasonably have been discovered by the respondents in
1990.</pre>
    <pre>[10] This ground of appeal also fails.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Third, the appellants argue that Mrs. Andreoli should not be
held liable for the fraudulent misrepresentation of her husband.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Again, we disagree. Mrs. Andreoli conferred the broadest
scope of authority on her husband to sell her shares. She is
therefore responsible for his fraudulent misrepresentation where
it was made clearly within the scope of authority as it was here:
See Middleton J.A. in Hughes v. Ojibway Realty Co. (1924), 55
O.L.R. 611 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[13] The respondents cross-appeal from the damage award made in
favour of the numbered company for arrears of rent and unpaid
taxes owing to it.</pre>
    <pre>[14] We see no merit in their submission that Mr. and
Mrs. Andreoli will be unjustly enriched by this damage award
unless it is set off against the damage award for fraudulent
misrepresentation. There is equally no merit in the submission
that the numbered company ought to be responsible for the
fraudulent misrepresentation which would be an alternative basis
on which to set off the two damage awards. Both arguments ignore
the legal reality that the unpaid rent and taxes are owed to the
numbered company, not the Andreolis, and the loss due to the
fraudulent misrepresentation is the responsibility of the
Andreolis, not the numbered company.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The respondents also cross-appeal as to quantum.</pre>
    <pre>[16] No basis was advanced before us to interfere with the award
for arrears of rent.</pre>
    <pre>[17] However, the amount ordered for unpaid taxes by the trial
judge, namely $17,201.24, could not be explained by counsel. The
respondents asserted that the correct amount is $9,138.76 and the
appellants did not contest this. We would allow the cross-appeal
to this extent.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The respondents also argue that the damage award against
them should be reduced by $12,000 representing the security
deposit and that likewise the damages for fraudulent
misrepresentation should be reduced by the same amount. The
appellants agree and we would allow the appeal on the cross-
appeal to reflect this.</pre>
    <pre>[19] We would also order that there be the appropriate
adjustments, if any, in the calculation of pre-judgment interest.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Otherwise, the appeal is dismissed with costs. The cross-
appeal is allowed to the extent indicated but given the limited
success, without costs.</pre></td>
