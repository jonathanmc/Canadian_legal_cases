    <pre><b>                      ENDORSEMENT</b>     
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a three-day hearing in January 1998, Rosenberg J.
dismissed the appellant's motion to amend its claim and granted
summary judgment to the respondents dismissing this action with
solicitor and client costs.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We would dismiss the appeals from these decisions.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The amendments to the claim were sought on the eve of a
peremptory date for argument of the summary judgment motion. This
came at the end of a long process of case management of a
significant commercial dispute. The amendments sought were
significant. No affidavit explanation was offered for the need
for or for the delay in seeking the proposed amendments.
Rosenberg J. refused the motion to amend because, in the exercise
of his discretion, he found the amendments sought to be, in the
circumstances, an abuse of process.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We see no basis for interfering with this exercise of
discretion. While the case management system does not demand
slavish adherence, in the circumstances presented here it was
quite proper, indeed perhaps essential, for the motions judge to
be shown a very good reason for departing at such a late date
from the course which had been set on a peremptory basis.
Otherwise, the efficiency of the case management system risks
serious compromise.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In granting summary judgment Rosenberg J. approached the
matter properly. He did not engage in findings of credibility. He
applied the correct test. In allowing the respondents' motion for
summary judgment he determined that there was no genuine issue
for trial. In the equivalent language of the American
jurisprudence, “no reasonable trier of fact could, on this
record, find for the non-moving party”, namely the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The core of the appellant's case, with or without the
proposed amendments, is that the respondent Astral, in concert
with the other respondents, breached the non-competition
provisions which bound it first in the 1989 agreement with Saturn
and then in the 1995 agreement by which Saturn purchased Astral's
interest in Belsat. It is argued that particularly after 1993
Astral violated these provisions by engaging in rack jobbing when
it performed warehousing and supply functions that did not
involve it in in-store activities for retailers.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  This is a position that is bound to lose at trial. The non-
competition clauses used &quot;rack jobbing&quot; as a defined term. The
agreements clearly defined &quot;rack jobbing&quot; as in-store servicing
such as stock balancing, stock dealing, stock rotating, display
materials supplying and rack and/or fixture installing. As used
by the parties, &quot;rack jobbing&quot; meant in-store activity. In our
view, Rosenberg J. was correct in viewing this question as one of
contractual interpretation the answer to which determined this
central issue.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  However, we are urged by the appellant to have regard to the
context of the contractual relationship to elucidate the proper
meaning of the non-competition clauses. We do not think the clear
contractual language necessitates this. Nevertheless, if the
commercial context were needed to confirm this meaning of &quot;rack
jobbing&quot;, it can be found in the recognition of all parties that
Astral could carry on its pre-existing and well-known warehousing
and supply functions to support BVHV sales to distributors other
than Belsat, something which would have been precluded by the
broader reading of the term as proposed by the appellants. The
commercial sense of this business arrangement from Saturn's
perspective was to obtain a limited non-competition constraint on
Astral in return for access to the Disney product which Astral
could deliver. It is essentially only the unilateral
understanding of Mr. Kennedy, who as the owner of Saturn had a
clear interest in the matter, that would suggest the broader
meaning for &quot;rack jobbing&quot;. This is not enough to raise a genuine
issue for trial.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Given particularly the language of the non-competition
clauses together with this business context, we agree that no
reasonable trier of fact could find for the non-moving party, the
appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant argues as well that even on this definition of
rack jobbing there remains a genuine issue for trial. It says
that Astral engaged in rack jobbing so defined after 1993 through
its ownership in BVA which in turn &quot;supervised&quot; the in-store
service provider for BVHV, Actmedia.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In our view, this is too tenuous an extension ladder to
support a genuine issue for trial. The evidence shows no
involvement of Astral in the activities of BVA beyond mere equity
ownership. Nor is there any evidence of direction or control by
BVA over the in-store servicing provided by Actmedia. No
reasonable trier of fact could find that, through the medium of
BVA, Astral breached its non-competition obligations concerning
rack jobbing.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Finally, the appellant says that Astral itself engaged
directly in rack jobbing. The documentation relied on for this
simply does not support that conclusion. It does no more than
describe Astral's warehousing and supply servicing role. It does
not reveal Astral as a provider of the in-store services that
comprise rack jobbing.</pre>
    <pre>[13] If Astral was not in breach of its non-competition
obligations to Belsat, neither it nor the other respondents could
be said to have conspired to do so. This disposes of the heart of
the appellant's claim.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant's other allegations, either in the original
claim or in the proposed amendments, were not pressed before us.
It is enough to say that they would all be inevitably destined to
fail at trial. Given our finding as to the meaning of the
contract between the parties, on this record there can be no
finding of a breach by Astral of its duty of good faith. Nor can
there be a finding of breach of fiduciary duty or oppressive
conduct under the OBCA. Moreover, there is nothing in the record
to support the claim that Belsat had a continuing right to
receive Disney product from BVHV or that the cessation of this
supply was initiated to injure the appellant. Nor is there any
evidence that Astral refused to continue to supply Belsat so far
as it was able to do so. Hence, there can be no claim of wrongful
interference with economic interests or inducing breach of
contract or wrongful termination of the distributorship
agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[15] In the result, despite Mr. Burden's forceful argument, we
would dismiss this appeal with costs.</pre></td>
