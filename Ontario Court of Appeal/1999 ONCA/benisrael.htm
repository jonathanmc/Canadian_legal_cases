</pre>
    <pre>     Liability</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge found that the appellants had agreed &#147;not to
compete with the plaintiff&#146;s (respondent&#146;s) pillow nor to
approach the plaintiff&#146;s customers.&#148;  This is a finding of fact
that is supported by evidence.  The appellants have not
demonstrated that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding
error that affected his assessment of the facts.  We see no basis
to interfere with this finding.
[2]  There was evidence to support a finding that both
appellants, Vitacare and Engineered Foam, were parties to the non-
competition agreement.  However, there was no evidence that
Engineered Foam breached that agreement.
[3]  The agreement was first made in 1985. at a time when
Vitacare was an unincorporated division of Engineered Foam.
After the incorporation of Vitacare in 1987, Engineered Foam had
no further involvement with the production or sale of the pillows
about which the respondent complains.  The breaches of agreement
found by the trial judge began in 1990.  It was Vitacare, not
Engineered Foam, that solicited the respondent&#146;s customers and
sold pillows to those customers in breach of the agreement.
[4]  The respondent argues that Engineered Foam should be held
liable because it is a related company to Vitacare.  The two
companies were owned by the same shareholders, had some common
principals and were part of the same corporate group.
Nevertheless, they were separate legal entities and as such the
acts of one, without more, are not in law considered to be the
acts of the other.  Given that there was no evidence showing that
Engineered Foam was involved, either directly or indirectly, in
the conduct that constituted the breaches of the non-competition
agreement, the trial judge erred in holding Engineered Foam
liable for the breach of the agreement.
[5]  Ms. Gross argues that the trial judge erred in finding that
Vitacare breached a duty of confidence owed to the respondent
relating to the design of the respondent&#146;s pillow, the insert and
certain pricing and marketing information of the respondent.
[6]  We have serious doubts that this information, or at least a
substantial part of it, was confidential within the meaning of
the test set out in the cases.  However, in view of our
conclusion that Vitacare is liable for breach of the non-
competition agreement and our conclusions with respect to the
issues of damages, there is no practical consequence to the trial
judge&#146;s finding that Vitacare also breached a duty of confidence.
As a result, we do not find it necessary to address this ground
of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Damages</pre>
    <pre>          Loss of Profit</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In compensating the respondent for the breach of the non-
competition agreement and for the breach of the duty of
confidence, the trial judge awarded damages based on the
respondent&#146;s loss of profit for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 in
the amount of $56,250 per year.  Ms. Gross challenges this award
on several grounds.
[8]  The trial judge&#146;s calculation of the loss of profit was
based on figures for sales, revenues and costs provided by the
respondent.  Many of these figures were unsupported by
documentary evidence and there was difficulty in reconciling
certain of the projected and actual sales figures.  That said, an
assessment of damages will often, by necessity, involve some
speculation and estimate.  It is generally difficult to ascertain
with precision the loss of sales and loss of profit suffered by a
plaintiff:  S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, looseleaf edition
(Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 1996) at p. 540.
[9]  Before this court interferes with an award of damages it
should be satisfied that the trial judge has acted upon a wrong
principle of law or has misapprehended the facts or has made a
wholly erroneous estimate of the damages suffered.
[10] In calculating the respondent&#146;s loss of profit the trial
judge made two reversible errors.  First, he should not have
included an award for the loss of profit for 1990.  He awarded
damages on the basis of lost sales of 7,500 pillows annually.
This figure was based on projected annual sales of 10,000 pillows
and actual sales of approximately 2,500.  However, in 1990, the
respondent sold over 11,000 pillows which is more than he had
ever sold before.  Simply put, there was no evidence of lost
sales in 1990.  The 1990 loss of profit was not proved.
[11] The respondent answers by arguing that if 1990 is excluded
from the award for loss of profit, then 1993 should be included,
on the theory that the trial judge intended to compensate the
respondent for loss of profit for three years and not
specifically for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992.
[12] We disagree.  The trial judge&#146;s reasons are clear that he
intended to compensate for the period ending with the year 1992.
We see no basis to extend that period.  Thus, we reduce the
damage award by the amount of $56,250, being the loss of profit
awarded for 1990.
[13] The second error with the award for the loss of profit
relates to an adjustment made by the trial judge for the impact
of increased competition on the respondent&#146;s sales.  The trial
judge misunderstood the respondent&#146;s evidence to be that the loss
of profit from lost pillow sales was $63,750 per year.  In fact,
the respondent&#146;s evidence was that the loss of profit from lost
sales was $56,250 per year.  In his testimony, the respondent
referred to the amount of $63,750.  However, this amount included
a claim for $7,500 per year for reduced profits on actual sales,
a claim for which the trial judge made a separate award of
damages.  The trial judge reduced the amount of $63,750, which he
incorrectly understood to be the loss of profit for lost sales,
by $7,500 to reflect the effects of increased competition.  In
our view, he was correct in making an adjustment for the effects
of competition.   We would therefore reduce the award for the
loss of profit from the loss of sales for the years 1991 and 1992
by $7,500 for each year.</pre>
    <pre>          Consultant&#146;s fees/design fee</pre>
    <pre>[14] In regard to the finding that Vitacare breached a duty of
confidence, the trial judge awarded $75,000 as a fee to
compensate the respondent for his time and effort in developing
his pillow.  The trial judge stated that a figure between $50,000
and $100,000 would be a reasonable consulting fee had Vitacare
hired someone to develop the pillow.  He then awarded $75,000.
[15] There was no evidence to support this award.  The respondent
did not provide an accounting of his time and expenses, nor did
he claim a specific figure or put forward an estimate upon which
the court could base this award.  The respondent did not call any
evidence as to what a consultant&#146;s fee would have been.
[16] The respondent had the onus to prove his damages.  This type
of damage claim is capable of proof with some degree of
precision.  The trial judge erred in awarding damages in the
absence of evidence to support this claim.
[17] Moreover, the award of damages for the respondent&#146;s loss of
profit was intended to put the respondent in the same position
that he would have been in had Vitacare not breached the duty of
confidence.  Expenses incurred in developing the pillow would
have been incurred whether or not there had been a breach.  Those
expenses were necessary to enable the respondent to earn the
profits that he actually realized and to earn the profits for
which he is being compensated by the award of damages in this
case.  An additional award to compensate for development expenses
would constitute a windfall or double recovery.  In addition,
there is no evidence to suggest that the respondent&#146;s design had
any value to Vitacare other than in connection with the sales of
its pillow that form the basis of the award for the loss of
profit.
[18] For the same reason set out in the preceding paragraph, we
conclude that the trial judge also erred in awarding the
respondent damages in the amount of $5,060 to compensate him for
the design of the pillow insert.</pre>
    <pre>          Pre-judgment interest</pre>
    <pre>[19] After hearing counsel&#146;s submissions on the issue of pre-
judgment interest the trial judge, as part of his order for the
payment of damages, made an award of pre-judgment interest from
October 5, 1990 (the date the action was commenced) at 12.9%.
This pre-judgment interest rate reflects the provisions of ss.
127 and 128 of the Courts of Justice Act.  The appellants contend
that to avoid over-compensating the respondent the trial judge
should have awarded pre-judgment interest at the average pre-
judgment interest rate over the approximately 7 year period
between the commencement of the action and the issuance of the
trial judgment.  In that period there was a significant
fluctuation of interest rates with the result that the average
rate over the relevant period was 6.6%.
[20] We accept that the principal rationale for pre-judgment
interest is compensatory.  However, the respondent was prima
facie entitled to pre-judgment interest at the rate prescribed in
ss. 127 and 128 of the Courts of Justice Act. The onus was on the
appellant to justify a deviation from that &#147;presumptive rate.&#148;
See Spencer v. Rosati (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 661 (C.A.); Graham v.
Rourke (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 622 (C.A.).
[21] In selecting the pre-judgment interest model that is now
reflected in the Courts of Justice Act, the Legislature must have
recognized that where interest rates fluctuate during the
relevant pre-judgment interest period there necessarily will be
some element of over (or under) compensation.  With respect to
over-compensation, the central issue here, it should be noted
that to achieve full compensation pre-judgment interest should be
paid in an amount that would compensate the plaintiff for the
loss of use and the loss of value of his monetary award until it
is paid.  However, the statutory scheme for pre-judgment interest
does not provide for compound interest.  There is no doubt that
compound interest would more accurately compensate a plaintiff.
See Andani v. Peel (Regional Municipality) (1993), 66 O.A.C. 137
(C.A.).
[22] We recognize that trial judges frequently average pre-
judgment interest over the relevant period. We see nothing wrong
with this.   Indeed, we might have chosen that approach were we
to consider the pre-judgment issue afresh.  We are, however, not
persuaded that the trial judge erred in exercising his discretion
by selecting the prima facie interest rate prescribed in the pre-
judgment interest provisions of the Courts of Justice Act.
[23] We would, therefore, not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     CROSS-APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[24] The respondent cross-appeals seeking damages for the loss of
sales of &#147;products other than the double contoured therapeutic
pillow.&#148;  The trial judge found that there was a non-competition
agreement between the parties &#147;regarding the double contoured
pillow.&#148;  He did not find that the agreement extended to other
products nor did he find a breach of duty of confidence with
respect to other products.  We see no basis to extend the trial
judge&#146;s findings as requested by the respondent in his cross-
appeal.
[25] In oral argument, the respondent did not pursue the other
grounds raised in the cross-appeal.  We see no merit in any of
these grounds.  The cross-appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SUMMARY</pre>
    <pre>[26] The appeal is allowed and the judgment below is varied as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  the judgment against Engineered Foam is set aside; and</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  the damage award against Vitacare is reduced by the
following amounts:
               </pre>
    <pre>               1990 profits			      $56,250
               Adjustment for competition             $15,000
               Consultant&#146;s fee			      $75,000
               Design of insert			       <u>$5,060</u>
               Total				     $151,310

</pre>
    <pre>[27] The cross-appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[28] On this appeal the two appellants were represented by the
same counsel.  The appellants achieved partial success and, in
our view, should have partial recovery of their costs.  We order
that the appellants recover 50% of the costs of the appeal and
cross-appeal.</pre>
