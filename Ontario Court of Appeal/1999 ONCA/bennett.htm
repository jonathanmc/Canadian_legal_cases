    <pre>HEARD:         June 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Métivier J. dated November 21, 1997.

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  court is unanimously of the opinion that  this  appeal
fails and must be dismissed.
[2]  The only issue in the case that concerned us was the
submission that the trial judge should have disqualified herself
from proceeding with the trial, after having refused an
application to adjourn the trial.  The submission was that there
was a reasonable apprehension that the trial judge was biased as
she had made a decision which reflected adversely on the
appellant&#146;s credibility.  The record, with its endorsement,
disposing of the motion to adjourn the trial, is not before us.
It is, however, clear that the endorsement was referred to on the
motion to disqualify the trial judge.  The text of the
endorsement is referred to.  It is clear that it did not depend
on any finding of credibility.  In addition, in dealing with the
motion to disqualify the trial judge after she had referred to
the text of the endorsement, she confirmed that no finding of
credibility had been made in disposing of the motion to adjourn
the case nor was it in issue.  In the circumstances, we are
satisfied the trial judge made no error in proceeding with the
trial.
[3]  The appellant was not represented by counsel.  He made a
number of submissions pointing to contradictions in the evidence
which he contends show that the trial judge did not fairly
consider the evidence and the issues that had to be decided.  The
trial judge, in a very careful and thorough judgment, made clear
findings of credibility and findings of fact which were supported
by the evidence as she saw it.  There is no basis on which we can
interfere.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
