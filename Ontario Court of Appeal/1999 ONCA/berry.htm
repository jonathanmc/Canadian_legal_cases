    <pre>On appeal from the order of Madam Justice Eberhard dated November
19, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Sugarbush is a rural community near the Horseshoe Valley Ski
Resort.  It was developed in three phases. The homes in Phases  I
and  II form a recreational cottage community. The homes in Phase
III,  which  were  built much later, form  a  modern  residential
subdivision.  The appellant Indian Park Association  maintains  a
recreation centre and other common areas in the community for the
benefit  of all the residents. The Association&#146;s by-laws  require
every  resident  of Sugarbush to be a member of the  Association.
The  by-laws  also  contain  a number of  restrictive  covenants,
restricting how owners can use their land. The Association claims
that these land use restrictions are enforceable because they are
part  of  a  valid  building  scheme covering  all  the  lots  in
Sugarbush.
[2]  The respondents are a group of aggrieved neighbours who live
in homes in Phase III of the Sugarbush community. They object to
being required to join the Association and to being required to
comply with the land use restrictions in the Association&#146;s by-
laws. These owners applied to court to be relieved of their
obligations under the by-laws. In a judgment dated November 19,
1997, Eberhard J. declared that the challenged by-laws of the
Association were not enforceable against the lots in Phase III.
She held that there was no valid building scheme over Phase III
and that the challenged by-laws exceeded the powers of the
Association in its letters patent and in the Corporations Act.
[3]  The Association appeals and submits that Eberhard J. erred
both in failing to find a valid building scheme and in holding
that the Association exceeded its powers in passing the by-laws
in question.</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The homes in Phases I and II of the Sugarbush community were
built  in  1974  and 1975 by two developers, Kitwee  Developments
Incorporated  and Modco Investments Ltd. Phase I consists  of  94
lots,  Phase II of 63 lots. Kitwee and Modco built small, rustic,
wooden,  chalets  on  these lots. These chalets  were  built  for
seasonal  use by those who skiied at Horseshoe Valley.  They  had
few  amenities  and  were located in quiet, wooded  and  somewhat
isolated surroundings.
[5]  Under a development agreement with the local municipality,
Kitwee and Modco provided the part-time residents of Sugarbush
with a number of services that the municipality was unable or
willing to provide, including snow and garbage removal and the
supply of clean water. To maintain these services and to allocate
their costs to the residents, Kitwee and Modco applied to turn
Phases I and II into a condominium. However, their application
was rejected. Kitwee then created a &#147;mock&#148; condominium scheme by
incorporating the Association as a non-share capital corporation.
[6]  On August 30, 1974, Kitwee, Modco and the Association signed
an agreement (the Kitwee agreement) which expressly established a
building scheme governing the management of the land in Phases I
and II. Under the Kitwee agreement, the Association undertook to
manage and maintain for the residents the water supply and
distribution system and the sewage disposal system. Kitwee also
transferred some land in Sugarbush to the Association to be used
for a common parking lot and a recreational centre. In addition,
Kitwee and Modco agreed with the Association that when they sold
lots in Phases I and II they would impose on the purchasers a
number of restrictive covenants affecting how lot owners could
use and enjoy their land. These land (or lot) use restrictions
were contained in the Association&#146;s by-laws and were registered
against title to each lot in Phases I and II. They provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Provisions Respecting the Lots:  The use of the Lots
          shall be in accordance with the following restrictions for the
          enhancement in value of all of the Lots and Land and the better
          enjoyment thereof by the members:
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (i)   No garage or fence shall  be
               constructed or erected on any Lot save and
               except each lot owner may construct  and
               install  a  pool which can be fenced  in
               accordance  with the by-laws and  zoning
               restrictions of the Township of Oro.
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (ii) &#133; no improvements, alterations
               or  additions  to  any  Lot  or  to  the
               exterior  of any premises thereon  shall
               be   made,   performed  or   constructed
               without  the  prior written approval  of
               the  board, which approval shall not  be
               unreasonably withheld.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (iii)      No trees shall  be  cut
               down other than those which are dead  or
               diseased &#133;.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (iv) No motor vehicles of any kind
               other  than  snowmobiles or  motorcycles
               shall  be  parked  on any  Lot,  &#133;  only
               snowmobiles may be driven on or over the
               lands owned by the Corporation or parked
               on such lands.
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (v)  There shall be no littering on
               any Lot &#133;.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (vi)  No animal shall be  kept  or
               brought  on any Lot other than  domestic
               animals normally regarded as pets.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (vii)     No signs advertising any
               Lot  for  sale or rent shall  be  placed
               thereon   without  the   prior   written
               approval  of  the board  which  approval
               shall not be unreasonably withheld.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (viii)    The beneficial ownership
               in   and   to  any  Lot  shall  not   be
               transferred  by sale, gift,  bequest  or
               otherwise,  other than to a  person  who
               shall  acknowledge, in writing,  to  the
               Corporation  his membership therein  and
               accordingly his obligations  to  observe
               this  and  any  other  By-laws  of   the
               Corporation.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   When Phases I and II were built in 1974 and 1975 no further
development  within  the  Sugarbush community  was  contemplated.
However, in 1988 the directors of the Association negotiated with
Monica Interior Designs Ltd., the owner of the adjoining land, to
amalgamate  its  land  with  the  original  Sugarbush  community.
Instead,  however,  of  adding to the existing  seasonal  cottage
community,  Monica  developed its land into a modern  residential
subdivision,  consisting  of  year  round  homes  with  amenities
including   private  driveways,  garages,  lawns  and  basements.
Monica&#146;s development became Phase III of the Sugarbush community.
Phase  III  consists  of 178 lots on which Monica  has  built  82
permanent homes.
[8]  In November 1988 before any Phase III lots had been sold,
the Association passed new by-laws, containing even more onerous
restrictions on the use of lots in Sugarbush. These new
restrictions included:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Board approval must be obtained for the construction or
          installation of any structure of all new dwellings prior to
          receiving a building permit, excepting those homes built by the
          developer.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 6.     No  pool  or  fence  shall   be
          constructed or erected on any Lot.
          </pre>
    <pre>                7.   Except in authorized garages, Lots
          may  not  be  used  to store  the  following:
          unlicensed vehicles, boats, trailers,  mobile
          vans,  non-permanent structures not  approved
          by  the  Board,  heavy equipment,  machinery,
          garbage  and  debris.  These  items  will  be
          removed at the Owner&#146;s expense.
          </pre>
    <pre>                10.   Only  vehicles  used  for  normal
          passenger transportation should be parked  on
          the   lots.   Commercial  trucks  and   other
          commercial vehicles may not be parked  within
          Sugarbush.
          </pre>
    <pre>                14.  Lots cannot be used for commercial
          ventures.  Home occupations are permitted  as
          long   as   lots   are  not  advertised   for
          commercial use.
          </pre>
    <pre>                17.   Lots  shall  be used  for  single
          family use only. For the purpose of this  By-
          law &#147;family&#148; means one human being or two  or
          more  human beings related by blood, marriage
          or legal adoption or a group of not more than
          three human beings who need not be related by
          blood or marriage living together as a single
          housekeeping unit &#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   In  August  1991  Monica  and  the  Association  signed  an
agreement  (&#147;the Monica agreement&#148;) by which the Phase III  lands
were  brought under the umbrella of the Association&#146;s  management
of  Sugarbush. Monica agreed &#147;on behalf of itself, its successors
and  assigns&#148;  to abide by the Association&#146;s by-laws,  rules  and
regulations. In turn, the purchasers of lots in Phase III  became
members of the Association and also undertook in their agreements
of  purchase  and sale to comply with the Association&#146;s  by-laws,
rules and regulations.
[10] Although the Phase III development has commonly being
considered part of the Sugarbush community, it differs in
significant ways from the development in Phases I and II. Phase
III was built years later and by a different developer than
Phases I and II. The Phase III land was developed as a modern
permanent residential subdivision. The developer, Monica, built
large, brick homes with basements and private driveways. The
homeowners use municipal garbage collection. The land in Phases I
and II was developed as a seasonal, recreational cottage
community. The developers, Kitwee and Modco, built small, wooden
cottages without basements or private driveways. The cottagers
use common parking lots and garbage dumpsters. The Monica
agreement covering Phase III does not refer to the establishment
of a building scheme. The Kitwee agreement, covering Phases I and
II, does refer to the establishment of a building scheme.
Finally, the Association&#146;s restrictive covenants are not
registered on title to the land in Phase III, but are registered
on title to the land in Phases I and II.
[11] These differences led to disputes between Phase III
residents and the Association, which was controlled by the
residents in Phases I and II. The Phase III residents complained
that many of the services provided by the Association and for
which they paid yearly maintenance fees, were irrelevant to them.
For example, the Association provides garbage collection, sewage
disposal, water supply and distribution, and snow removal from
garbage dumpsters and common parking lots. The Phase III
residents contributed to the costs of these services which they
did not need and which benefited only the residents in Phases I
and II. Eventually, many of the Phase III residents stopped
paying their maintenance fees and these court proceedings were
launched.</pre>
    <pre>      First  Issue:    Are the Phase III Lands Part  of  a  Valid
Building Scheme?</pre>
    <pre>[12]  The  Association  seeks to enforce its  by-laws,  including
those  containing land use restrictions, against  the  owners  of
land in Phase III. These by-laws amount to restrictive covenants,
restricting  the way in which the owners may use their  property.
Because no privity of contract exists between the Association and
the  Phase III owners, the Association cannot enforce its by-laws
under contract law.
[13] But restrictive covenants relating to land are also governed
by property law. In some circumstances, property law principles
permit restrictive covenants relating to land to be enforced
despite the lack of privity of contract. For example, one
exception, in equity, provides that if certain conditions are
met, both the burden and the benefit of a restrictive covenant
may be annexed to the land and so &#147;run with the land&#148;. This
exception, which originates in the case of Tulk v. Moxhay1, does
not apply here. The Association concedes that the restrictive
covenants in its by-laws do not run with the Phase III lands
under the principles in Tulk v. Moxhay.
[14] The Association relies on another equitable exception by
which restrictive covenants relating to land may be enforced.
This exception concerns building schemes. A restrictive covenant
imposed for the purpose of land development may be enforceable
despite the lack of privity of contract, if the land is included
within a building scheme. A building scheme may exist when
restrictive covenants are imposed during the course of
development with the intent that once the scheme has crystallized
on the sale of the first lot, the vendor will be bound by the
scheme and the restrictions will be mutually enforceable by the
purchasers of the various lots.2  The rationale for building
schemes rests on the notion that because the restrictions are
imposed for the general benefit of the development, all owners
have a common interest in their enforcement. This underlying
notion of community of interest imports reciprocity of
obligation.3  Thus, under a valid building scheme, restrictive
covenants are enforceable by and against the original purchasers
and their assignees.
[15] The Association submits that the Phase III land is included
within a valid building scheme and thus it may enforce the land
use restrictions in its by-laws against homeowners in Phase III.
The Association frames this submission on two different footings
&#150; either the Phase III development became part of the pre-
existing Phase I and II building scheme or an entirely separate
building scheme exists for Phase III. The latter footing has no
merit whatsoever. The Association has sought to enforce the same
set of restrictions against Phases I, II and III; it has never
treated the Phase III land as a separate scheme. The Association
always considered that only one building scheme existed, which
comprised Phases I, II and III of the Sugarbush community. Thus I
focus on whether the Phase III development, when built in 1988,
became part of an existing building scheme.  As did the trial
judge, I assume without deciding, that a valid building scheme
exists for Phases I and II.
[16] Elliston v. Reacher4 is still the leading case on the
requirements of a building scheme. In that case Parker J. set out
four requirements that must be met to enforce restrictive
covenants as part of a valid scheme.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; it must be proved
          </pre>
    <pre>                (1)   that both the plaintiffs and  the
          defendants  derive  title  under   a   common
          vendor;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (2)   that  previously to  selling  the
          lands  to which the plaintiffs and defendants
          are  respectively entitled, the  vendor  laid
          out  his estate, or a defined portion thereof
          (including   the  lands  purchased   by   the
          plaintiffs  and the defendants respectively),
          for  sale in the lots subject to restrictions
          intended  to be imposed on all the lots,  and
          which,  though  varying  in  details  as   to
          particular    lots,   are   consistent    and
          consistent only with some general  scheme  of
          development;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (3)    that  these  restrictions  were
          intended by the common vendor to be and  were
          for  the benefit of all the lots intended  to
          be  sold,  whether  or  not  they  were  also
          intended  to be and were for the  benefit  of
          other land retained by the vendor; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (4)   that both the plaintiffs and  the
          defendants, or their predecessors  in  title,
          purchased  their lots from the common  vendor
          upon   the   footing  that  the  restrictions
          subject  to  which the purchasers  were  made
          were  to  enure for the benefit of the  other
          lots  included in the general scheme  whether
          or  not  they  were  also to  enure  for  the
          benefit  of  other  lands  retained  by   the
          vendors.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Although its strict requirements have been relaxed in  some
jurisdictions, Elliston v. Reacher has been consistently  applied
by  courts  in  Ontario  including  this  court.5   However,  the
requirements of Elliston v. Reacher co-exist with the  provisions
of the Land Titles Act6, which permit restrictive covenants to be
registered and thus annexed to land. Subsections 118(1), (3)  and
(5),  the  provisions of the Act in force when this case  arose7,
prescribed the procedure and requirements for registration:
          </pre>
    <pre>               118. &#150; (1)     Upon the application of the owner of land
          that is being registered or of the registered owner of land, the
          land registrar may register as annexed to the land a condition or
          restriction that the land or a specified part thereof is not to
          be built upon, or is to be or is not to be used in a particular
          manner, or any other condition or restriction running with or
          capable or being legally annexed to land.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (3)   Upon the application of  the
          owner of land that is being registered or  of
          the   registered  owner  of  land,  the  land
          registrar may register as annexed to the land
          a  covenant that the land or a specified part
          thereof is not to be built upon, or is to  be
          or  is not to be used in a particular manner,
          or any other covenant running with or capable

    <pre>[18] The trial judge considered Elliston v. Reacher and s. 118 of
the  Land  Titles Act and found that Monica did not  establish  a
building  scheme over the Phase III land. I think  that  for  two
main  reasons the trial judge was correct in her finding.  First,
Monica  did  not apply to register the land use restrictions  now
sought to be enforced as restrictive covenants under s.118 of the
Land  Titles  Act. Instead, it simply registered  notice  of  the
Monica agreement (which included the Association&#146;s letters patent
and by-laws as schedules) under s. 74 of the Land Titles Act. The
trial  judge  held,  and I agree with her, that  registration  of
notice  of the agreement did not have the effect of annexing  the
land  use restrictions in the Association&#146;s by-laws to the  Phase
III  lots. Monica&#146;s failure to register the restrictions on  land
use  as restrictive covenants under s. 118 of the Land Titles Act
stands in sharp contrast to the action taken by Kitwee concerning
the  land in Phases I and II. In 1974 Kitwee applied to the  land
registrar under s. 118 of the Act to annex to the Phase I and  II
lands the restrictive covenants underpinning the building scheme.
The  land registrar exercised his discretion by registering these
restrictive covenants. I think that there is much to be said  for
the  recommendation  of  the 1989 Ontario Law  Reform  Commission
Report on Covenants  Affecting Freehold Land:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the event that the formal requirements [of registration
          of a building scheme] are not satisfied, the instrument should be
          deemed conclusively not to create a land obligation or a
          development scheme (although, in such a case, the instrument
          might create a personal covenant or other obligation).8</pre>
    <pre>[19]  At  least  Monica&#146;s  failure  to  register  the  land   use
restrictions  as  restrictive covenants affords  strong  evidence
against the establishment of the building scheme over Phase III.
[20] Second, apart from s. 118 of the Land Titles Act, the
requirements of Elliston v. Reacher have not been met. The first
requirement is a common vendor. There is no common vendor. The
Association and the owners of Sugarbush received title to their
lands from three vendors, Kitwee, Modco, and Monica. Some courts,
however, have relaxed the requirement of common vendor and
instead focussed on the other requirements of the Elliston v.
Reacher9.
[21] Even if I were to ignore the common vendor requirement, the
second requirement in Elliston v. Reacher has not been satisfied.
Under the second requirement, before selling any land, the vendor
must have laid out its property for sale in lots subject to
restrictions intended to be imposed on all the lots and
consistent with a general scheme of development. In 1974 and 1975
when Sugarbush was conceived and developed by Kitwee and Modco,
Phase III was not laid out or defined as part of the Sugarbush
community. Indeed, Phase III was not even contemplated at the
time.
[22] Moreover, I cannot find in the record any evidence that
Monica intended to establish a valid building scheme and to
impose the Association&#146;s by-laws on all Phase III lot owners.
Again the contrast between what Kitwee did in 1974/75 and what
Monica did in 1988 is instructive:  in 1974 and 1975 Kitwee
registered on title to the Phases I and II  lands an agreement
between it, Modco and the Association, which expressly recited
that &#147;the parties hereto have agreed to the establishment of a
building scheme for the better enjoyment of and the enhancement
of the value of the said lands.&#148;  The Monica agreement contains
no express intention to establish a building scheme. Although
such an intention might be inferred in an appropriate case, all
that the Monica agreement recited was that Monica &#147;wished&#148; all
Phase III lot owners to become members of the Association. This
wish falls short of intending to impose the Association&#146;s by-laws
on each owner.
[23] Also, the Phase III development is not consistent with the
scheme of development established in Phases I and II. The scheme
developed in Phases I and II preserves Sugarbush as a
recreational cottage community; Phase III is a modern residential
subdivision. Counsel for the respondent owners accurately
described Sugarbush as an &#147;incongruous marriage&#148; between Phases I
and II on the one hand, and Phase III on the other. The benefits
of the building scheme are not shared by the Phase III residents.
[24] In summary, the restrictive covenants were not registered
under the Land Titles Act, and the Association has not met the
Elliston v. Reacher  requirements for establishing the existence
of a building scheme. Accordingly, the Association must fail on
this first issue.</pre>
    <pre>                    Second  Issue:  Are the Association&#146;s By-laws
                    Restricting Land Use and Requiring  Mandatory
                    Membership Enforceable?</pre>
    <pre>[25] In every agreement of purchase and sale between Monica and a
purchaser of a lot or home in Phase III, the purchaser agreed  to
abide  by the rules of the Association. The Association therefore
submits  that  its by-laws are binding on Phase III  owners.  The
trial   judge  rejected  this  submission.  She  held  that   the
Association   exceeded  its  powers  in  passing   by-laws   that
restricted  the  use to which  Phase III owners could  put  their
property  and that required all owners to become members  of  the
Association.  She therefore concluded that the Association  could
not  enforce its by-laws restricting land use and that the  Phase
III  owners  had the right to terminate their membership  in  the
Association. I agree with her conclusion.
[26] In addition to imposing a mandatory membership scheme the
Association&#146;s by-laws, in effect, restricted members from:</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     installing a swing set on their land without  the
          approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     placing  a  dog house on their land  without  the
          approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     building  a  patio  on  their  land  without  the
          approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;    building a deck on their land without the approval
          of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     installing   a  shed on their  land  without  the
          approval of  the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     building  a  garage  on their  land  without  the
          approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     planting trees on their land without the approval
          of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     painting their house without the approval of  the
          Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     renting space in their home to a temporary lodger
          without the approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     altering, improving, or adding to their  property
          without the approval of the Association&#146;s directors</pre>
    <pre>	  &#149;     installing a pool on their land</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     paving their driveway</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     building fences</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     parking  boats, trailers, mobile  vans  or  other
          recreational vehicles on their land</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     resigning from the Association</pre>
    <pre>          &#149;     transferring their membership in the  Association
          unless they transfer ownership of their homes</pre>
    <pre>[27]  The  Association  is a non-share capital  corporation.  Its
powers  to require mandatory membership and to impose these  land
use  restrictions must be found in its letters patent or  in  the
Corporations Act10. The objects of the Association set out in its
letters patent are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)       To acquire the ownership of certain lands and
               premises in the Township of Oro, in the County of Simcoe and
               Province of Ontario [i.e., the common lands of Sugarbush and not
               privately held lands] and to manage, maintain, develop and
               improve such lands for the benefit of the members of the
               Corporation;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  To manage and maintain any services
               for the mutual benefit of the members of
               the Corporation;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  To erect and maintain a building or
               buildings  on the said lands [i.e.,  the
               recreation centre];
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  To promote social activities among
               the members;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)    To  advance  the  interests   and
               welfare   of   the   members   of    the
               Corporation; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (f)   To  assess  and collect  from  the
               member  of the Corporation such sums  of
               money   as  the  Corporation  may   deem
               necessary,  from time to time,  for  the
               purpose   of  carrying  out   the   said
               objects. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28]  The Association submits that subparagraphs (a) and (e) give
it  the  power to impose the by-laws challenged by the owners.  I
disagree.  Far more specific language would be required  to  give
the  Association the power to pass by-laws restricting how owners
can use their own land or indeed the power to require every owner
to  become a member of the Association. Eberhard J. made the same
point in the following passage in her reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    It cannot be imagined that a non-share capital
          corporation without the benefit of these vast bodies of
          supporting law could take upon itself the power to restrict use
          of privately owned land of its members under the general object
          &#147;to advance the interest and welfare of the members of the
          corporation&#148; appearing in a list of specific objects which make
          no mention of the use of private lands. Neither could it be
          imagined that the general duty of the corporation &#147;to advance the
          interest and welfare of the members, in a list of duties
          concerned with managing common land, managing the water supply,
          collecting contributions for common expenses and effecting
          compliance with bylaws, could support the much more significant
          duty to control the use of privately owned lands.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     A  general  object to advance  the
          interest of members of a corporation must  be
          read together with the other objects in order
          to  understand  what is intended.  A  general
          clause  is  not licence to pursue a direction
          that is not consistent with the total objects
          of the corporation.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     I  find that insofar as the bylaws
          purport to restrict the use of private  land,
          they are manifestly outside of the objects of
          the corporation.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  Equally,  nothing in either s. 23 of the  Corporations  Act
(the  section  giving  the  Association  powers  incidental   and
ancillary  to its objects) or in s. 129 (the section  giving  the
Association&#146;s directors the power to pass by-laws consistent with
the  Association&#146;s  objects) assists the Association&#146;s  position.
The  challenged  by-laws  are beyond  its  powers  and  therefore
unenforceable.
[30] Even if the Association had the power to pass these by-laws,
I doubt that it could enforce them against Phase III owners. No
privity of contract exists between the Association and these
owners and, absent a valid building scheme covering Phase III,
the Association does not have standing to enforce its by-laws.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[31]  For these reasons I would dismiss the Association&#146;s  appeal
with costs.
