[1]  The facts and the decision of Roberts J. are reported at
(1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 417. The sole ground advanced on appeal is
that Roberts J. seriously misapprehended the evidence on the
issue of whether the appellant is a person &quot;who has on the faith
of any such representation (that there is a partnership) given
credit to the firm&quot; within the meaning of s. 15(1) of the
Partnerships Act.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Reliance is a question of fact. The appellant submits that
because the payment of the moneys to be advanced for the mortgage
was by way of a cheque payable to the firm and deposited in the
trust account and that the cheque was written after there had
been a holding out of Mr. Alexandor as a partner, Alexandor is
liable. While these are important factors they are not
conclusive. The trial judge's finding that there was no reliance
on the representation is supported by the evidence and, in our
opinion, he did not misapprehend the evidence. The appeal is
therefore dismissed. Costs of the appeal are to the respondent.</pre></td>
