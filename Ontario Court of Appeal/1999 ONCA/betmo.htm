COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
      <pre>RE:            BETMO  INVESTMENTS  LIMITED (Plaintiff/Respondent)

      <pre>COUNSEL:       H.J. Ash

      <pre>Appeal from the order of Brennan J. dated March 18, 1997</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
      <pre>[1]  In the final analysis, we are of the view that the trial
judge did not err in his interpretation of the 1988 lease.  In
particular, we think that having regard to clauses 5(q), 5(s) and
8, the trial judge was correct in concluding that the appellant,
upon removing the trade and security fixtures, was required to
leave the premises in good repair.  The appellant did not do so
and it was open to the trial judge to fix the damages as he did
based on the evidence before him.
[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.  In view of
that conclusion, the appellant requires leave to appeal costs.
We see no basis for granting leave and leave to appeal is denied.
The cross-appeal with respect to costs is abandoned.</pre>
