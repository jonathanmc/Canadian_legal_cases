COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and SETH JEREMY
               BEZUSKO (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, CATZMAN and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Peter B. Hambly, for the appellant
               Eric Siebenmorgen, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Mr. Hambly made two submissions in support of this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The first related to an incriminating statement made by the
co-accused Burton in the absence of the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  While it may well be that the statement was properly
admissible not only against Burton but against the appellant as
well, the trial judge expressly instructed himself that the
statement was not to be used in assessing the culpability of the
appellant and, immediately after giving himself that instruction,
simply listed that statement in his enumeration of a number of
facts in the evidence that led him to the finding of guilt that
he made.  We see no error in his reference to the statement in
the disposition of the charge against the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The second submission was that the verdict was unreasonable.
While the evidence against the appellant was subject to some
frailty, we are unable to say that, on the totality of the
evidence, no reasonable trier of fact, acting judicially, could
have reached the conclusion reached by the trial judge in this
case.  In particular, we see no error in the manner in which the
trial judge addressed the circumstantial evidence on which the
Crown's case was based.  Though he did not state the test in the
classic language relating to such evidence, he clearly refused to
draw any inferences that were, in his words, &quot;open to any doubt&quot;
and thus made no error in his assessment of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
