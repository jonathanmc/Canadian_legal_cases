</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant  Jag  Bhaduria appeals  and  the  respondent
Toronto  Board  of  Education cross-appeals  from  the  order  of
Feldman J. in which she struck out all the claims for relief made
by  Mr.  Bhaduria in his statement of claim except the claim  for
defamation  against the Board. In making her order,  the  motions
judge  applied the decisions of the Supreme Court  of  Canada  in
Weber  v.  Ontario  Hydro (1995), 125 D.L.R. (4th)  583  and  New
Brunswick v. O’Leary (1995), 125 D.L.R. (4th) 609.

[2]  Mr. Bhaduria submits that the alleged violations of his
constitutional and other rights by various Board Trustees in
proceedings and in committee deliberations preceding the
grievance and arbitration process are not covered by the
principle in Weber. We disagree. Mr. Bhaduria’s claims, in their
“essential character”, arise under the collective agreement and
relate to events that led to his termination, which in turn
triggered the grievance and arbitration proceedings. We therefore
agree with the motions judge that the allegations in the
statement of claim raised by Mr. Bhaduria on appeal are
foreclosed by Weber. These allegations fall within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the grievance and arbitration process.

[3]  However, the motions judge permitted the defamation claim
against the Board to stand, holding that it was not barred by
Weber. This defamation claim is the subject of the Board’s cross-
appeal. In our opinion, the defamation claim, as well, should
have been struck out because it too was covered under the
principle in Weber. The claim for defamation is based on the
publication in the Board’s minutes of January 25, 1990 of the
resolution of the Board approving the termination of Mr.
Bhaduria’s teaching contract and providing reasons for the
termination.

[4]  The Board was under an express statutory obligation to give
reasons. The reasons dealt with Mr. Bhaduria’s status as an
employee. Therefore, the essential character of Mr. Bhaduria’s
claim for defamation pertains to his termination from his
teaching position and, as such, arises under the collective
agreement. Weber precludes Mr. Bhaduria from proceeding with this
claim. This court recently reached a similar conclusion in Giorno
v. Pappas [1999] O.J. No. 168.

[5]  Accordingly, Mr. Bhaduria’s appeal is dismissed, the Board’s
cross-appeal is allowed and the order of Feldman J. is varied to
provide that the statement of claim be struck out in its entirety
and that the action be dismissed with costs. The Board is
entitled to its costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, including
any costs reserved to this panel.</pre></td>
