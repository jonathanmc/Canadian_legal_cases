    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Matheson dated January
11, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   At  issue  on this appeal is the ownership of the  property
situated  at 6352 High Street in Niagara Falls, Ontario.  At  one
time,  the property was owned by Mary Biamonte, William Ward  and
Jean  Ward as tenants in common. These three original owners  are
now  deceased  and their estates are parties to this  litigation.
Several   transactions  occurred  which  led  to   the   ultimate
conveyance  of the property to Robert Hanna, which conveyance  is
at  issue on this appeal. The trial judge, Matheson J., held that
the  conveyance to Robert Hanna was invalid and that the property
was  beneficially  owned by the estate of Mary Biamonte.   Robert
Hanna  appeals this finding both in his personal capacity and  as
representative  of  the  estate of his  mother,  Jean  Ward.  The
representatives of the estates of Mary Biamonte and William  Ward
are respondents on the appeal.
[2]  The following transactions are relevant to this appeal:</pre>
    <pre>     1.    Instrument  No.  546772  -  By instrument  no.  546772
     registered February 1, 1989, the property was transferred to
     Mary  Biamonte,  William Ward and Jean Ward  as  tenants  in
     common.  It  is common ground between the parties  that  the
     tenancy was in equal shares. William Ward and Jean Ward were
     siblings and the children of Mary Biamonte.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.    Instrument No. 683556 - William Ward died intestate on
     January 17, 1994. Due to the value of his estate, all of his
     assets  passed  to  his widow, Donna  Ward.  Jean  Ward  was
     appointed administrator of the estate of her brother William
     Ward.  On  January 18, 1995, by instrument no. 683556,  Jean
     Ward,  as  administrator  of the  estate  of  William  Ward,
     conveyed  his one-third interest in the property to herself.
     Although  the  validity  of  this conveyance  was  initially
     disputed, it is not in issue on this appeal. The trial judge
     held  that this conveyance was valid and no appeal is  taken
     from  this  finding. Hence, as a result of this  conveyance,
     Mary Biamonte and Jean Ward became owners of the property as
     tenants  in  common,  in  one-third  and  two-third   shares
     respectively.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.    Instrument  No.  700665 -  On  January  22,  1996  the
     property was transferred by instrument no. 700665 from  Mary
     Biamonte and Jean Ward as tenants in common to Mary Biamonte
     and  Jean  Ward as joint tenants. Although the  validity  of
     this  transaction  was disputed at the commencement  of  the
     proceedings,  it was no longer contested at  trial  and  its
     validity is not in issue on this appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.    Instrument No. 708758 - On July 5, 1996,  a  Power  of
     Attorney,  dated  November  30, 1991  and  granted  by  Mary
     Biamonte  to  Jean  Ward  and Joseph Biamonte,  jointly  and
     severally,  was  registered  on  title.  By  instrument  no.
     708758,   also  registered  on  July  5,  1996,  Jean   Ward
     transferred her interest in the property to her  son  Robert
     Hanna. By the same instrument, Jean Ward, through her  Power
     of  Attorney, also transferred the interest of Mary Biamonte
     to Robert Hanna. It is this conveyance which is the subject-
     matter of this appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Jean  Ward died on July 30, 1996. In September  1996,  Mary
Biamonte brought this application seeking, amongst other  things,
a declaration that she is the legal owner of a one-third interest
in  the  property. Mary Biamonte died on November 29,  1996.  Her
estate  continued the litigation and the estate of  William  Ward
was  added  as co-applicant. The application was heard  over  the
course  of  three days in October 1998 and judgment  rendered  on
January 11, 1999.
[4]  The trial judge held that Jean Ward improperly exercised her
power of attorney in order to further her son&#146;s interest, without
consulting her mother or her brother Joseph Biamonte, the other
attorney. He found that the transaction evidenced by instrument
No. 708758 &#147;reeks of fraud&#148; and that it should be set aside. The
trial judge further held that the parties should be restored to
the position in which they were before the registration of
instrument no. 708758, that is with title held by Mary Biamonte
and Jean Ward as joint tenants. Consequently, he concluded that,
upon Jean Ward&#146;s death the property went to Mary Biamonte by
right of survivorship, and on Mary Biamonte&#146;s death, to her
estate.
[5]  The appellants advance two arguments. Firstly, they argue
that the trial judge erred in finding that the exercise of the
power of attorney by Jean Ward was invalid. They submit that the
power of attorney, on its face, is wide enough to empower Jean
Ward to convey her mother&#146;s interest in the property. This fact
is not contested. The appellants concede that Jean Ward never
consulted Mary Biamonte with respect to the conveyance and that
this may give rise to suspicions but they submit that this was
satisfactorily explained by Robert Hanna who testified that it
was well known in the family that his grandmother intended the
property to go to him. The appellants submit that the trial judge
erred in not giving sufficient weight to the evidence of Robert
Hanna and in failing to draw an adverse inference from the fact
that the respondents did not call any evidence.
[6]  Secondly, the appellants submit that, even if the exercise
of the power of attorney was invalid, there is no reason to set
aside Jean Ward&#146;s conveyance of her own interest in the property
to her son Robert Hanna. They argue that, in so transferring her
interest to her son, Jean Ward effectively severed the joint
tenancy and that, as a result of the conveyance, Mary Biamonte
and Robert Hanna became tenants in common. Hence, the appellants
submit that, upon Mary Biamonte&#146;s death, her estate became
entitled only to her share in the property and not to the whole
property as found by the trial judge.
[7]  The respondents submit that the trial judge&#146;s finding that
the power of attorney was improperly exercised is supported by
the evidence and that it should not be interfered with. They
disagree with the appellants&#146; submission that the trial judge did
not place sufficient weight on the testimony of Robert Hanna and
note that Robert Hanna himself conceded in his testimony that his
grandmother did not agree with the position he was advancing at
trial. The respondents argue further that the conveyance by Jean
Ward to her son did not effect a severance because Jean Ward
never intended to sever the joint tenancy. She intended, rather,
to convey the whole property to her son. Hence, they submit that
the trial judge was correct in setting aside the entire
conveyance and in restoring the parties to their position prior
to the registration of the transfer.
[8]  Despite the able argument of counsel for the appellants, I
am not persuaded that this court should interfere with the trial
judge&#146;s finding that Jean Ward improperly exercised her power of
attorney in order to advance her son&#146;s interest and that she did
so contrary to the interest of the grantor, Mary Biamonte. It was
open to the trial judge to draw this inference from the
surreptitious manner in which the conveyance was made and it was
also open to him to reject Robert Hanna&#146;s explanation of these
suspicious circumstances. Consequently, I would not interfere
with the finding that the conveyance of Mary Biamonte&#146;s interest
to Robert Hanna should be set aside.
[9]  However, I do not agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
that the entire conveyance to Robert Hanna should be set aside as
fraudulent. Jean Ward was always at liberty to convey her own
interest in the property as she pleased. There is nothing
fraudulent in that conveyance. Counsel for the respondent
concedes that any transfer by Jean Ward to her son by separate
instrument would have been valid and that it would have effected
a severance of the joint tenancy. I see no reason why the result
should be different because the transfer of both Jean Ward&#146;s
interest and Mary Biamonte&#146;s interest was effected in one
instrument. Jean Ward signed the deed in her own capacity and
again as attorney for her mother. It is clear that she intended
to convey her own interest to her son Robert Hanna. It is well
established that a transfer by one joint tenant of her undivided
interest to a stranger will result in a severance of the joint
tenancy: Stonehouse v. Attorney-General of British Columbia,
[1962] S.C.R. 103 at 107.
[10] Consequently, by instrument 708758, Mary Biamonte and Robert
Hanna became co-owners of the property as tenants in common.
Since Mary Biamonte is now deceased, her estate is entitled to
her share and is now tenant in common with Robert Hanna.
[11] Counsel for the respondent raised an additional question at
the hearing of this appeal as to the respective shares of the
tenants in common in the event that this court held that a
severance was effected.  Can Robert Hanna claim ownership to the
beneficial two-third interest owned by his mother at the time the
joint tenancy was created by instrument 700665 or was his
mother&#146;s beneficial interest reduced to one-half as a result of
the creation of the joint tenancy?
[12] Since the size of the respective shares was neither raised
at trial nor in either party&#146;s factum, it was not fully argued
before this court at the hearing of the appeal. Consequently,
this court requested that counsel make further submissions in
writing on this point.  The submissions have now been received.
[13] In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant takes
the position that instrument no. 700665 from Mary Biamonte and
Jean Ward as tenants in common to Mary Biamonte and Jean Ward as
joint tenants is invalid and that, consequently, Jean Ward still
had a two-thirds interest at the time of the conveyance to her
son. Counsel for the respondents submits that it is not open to
the appellants to now dispute the validity of instrument no.
700665. I agree. The validity of this conveyance was never
questioned at trial and, in any event, the appellants maintained
throughout the proceedings that both this conveyance into joint
tenancy and the later conveyance to Robert Hanna were valid.
[14] In the event that the joint tenancy is valid, counsel for
the appellants takes the position that Jean Ward would only have
had a fifty per cent interest to pass to her son Robert Hanna and
not the two-thirds interest she held prior to the conveyance into
joint tenancy. Counsel for the respondent agrees with this
position.
[15] Given that both parties are in agreement that, on the facts
of this case, Robert Hanna obtained a one half interest in the
property upon severance of the joint tenancy, this effectively
disposes of the last issue on this appeal.
[16] Consequently, I would allow the appeal, set aside paragraphs
2, 3, 4 and 5 of the judgment below and, instead, make a
declaration that Robert Hanna and the Estate of Mary Biamonte
Ward are owners of the subject property as tenants in common in
equal shares. In light of the divided success, I would award the
appellants one half of their costs of the appeal.
