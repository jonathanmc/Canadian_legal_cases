</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by G.B. Smith  J. dated
February 9, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was involved in 7 bank thefts in  1994.  The
ringleader, Hornett, worked for Intercon Security and as a result
had access to the Royal Bank branches. The appellant participated
with  Hornett in all 7 thefts, and for one of them,  Hornett  had
recruited  a  third man, Vance. Hornett and a fourth man,  Dobson
conducted 4 other thefts in the same way.
[2]  The modus operandi for all of the thefts was similar and
involved gaining access to the combination for the ATM machine in
the branch and using that combination to empty the bank&#146;s ATM of
its stock of $5 and $20 dollar bills. The total amount stolen in
all of the thefts was $1.1 million.
[3]  Each of the 4 men pleaded guilty. The appellant&#146;s
proceedings were separate from the others. He received a sentence
of two years less a day and a restitution order in favour of the
Royal Bank in the amount of $638,534.00. He has served his jail
sentence and seeks to appeal the quantum of the restitution
order.
</pre>
    <pre>                              I

</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The ringleader, Mr. Hornett was involved in all 11  of  the
thefts  which  resulted in a total loss  to  the  Royal  Bank  of
$1,099,622.24,   of  which  $237,000  was  recovered   from   the
perpetrators. Mr. Hornett received a sentence of 4 years  in  the
penitentiary   as  well  as  two  restitution  orders   totalling
$862,622.24, one in favour of the Royal Bank for $409,234.54  and
the  other in favour of American Home Insurance, its insurer  for
$453,387.70.  The  amount of $862,622.24 represented  the  entire
unrecovered  portion  of the bank&#146;s total  loss,  $453,387.70  of
which,  relating  only to the 7 Hornett/Biegus thefts,  had  been
repaid to the bank by its insurer.
[5]  Mr. Dobson was involved in 4 of the thefts with Mr. Hornett.
He received a sentence of two years in the penitentiary and a
restitution order of $210,088.72 in favour of the Royal Bank.
This was the amount which he and Mr. Hornett stole in the four
robberies in which he participated. No part of that money had
been repaid to the bank by insurance. Mr. Vance was involved in
only one theft and was very co-operative with the police. He
received a conditional sentence of 60 days.
[6]  Mr. Biegus was involved in 7 break-ins on three nights with
Mr. Hornett. The total loss from those thefts was $652,534.12.
Mr. Biegus co-operated fully with the police. He returned $14,000
which he had available in cash. The bank instituted civil
proceedings against him, pursuant to which an order was obtained
which froze all of his assets including a house which he had
purchased and  GIC&#146;s. The freeze order was put in place pending
the outcome of the sentencing.
[7]  Mr. Biegus had used his share of the funds to continue his
school career at Ryerson, to place a downpayment on a house and
to make some investments. He did not embark upon an extravagant
lifestyle, in contrast with Mr. Hornett who spent the money on
expensive goods.
[8]  During the sentencing proceedings, counsel for Mr. Biegus
suggested to the court that the most that Mr. Biegus received as
his share of the proceeds of the crimes he committed with Mr.
Hornett (and Mr. Vance) was $250,000, although exact figures were
not available. He indicated that Mr. Biegus was prepared to
accept a restitution order in that amount.
[9]  The Crown sought a sentence of two years less a day in
reformatory as well as a restitution order in the amount of
$638,534 in favour of the bank. ($652,534 - $14,000). The trial
judge accepted that submission.
[10] Crown counsel on the appeal indicated that each of the
restitution orders made in these cases is considered to be joint
and several, the effect being that to the extent that the bank
recovers from any one of the perpetrators, the amount of the
recovery accrues to the benefit of the others and the principle
of subrogation also applies.
</pre>
    <pre>                              II

</pre>
    <pre>[11]  In  my  view  the  sentencing judge erred  in  law  in  the
imposition of the restitution order on the appellant, by  failing
to  give  any  consideration to the issue of the ability  of  the
appellant  to pay the amount ordered. This resulted in  an  order
which was excessive in the circumstances.
[12] Furthermore, the effect of the four orders in these cases
where there are multiple perpetrators and where the orders
overlap in amount because they are each intended to cover the
entire amount of the loss for which each was responsible, is to
create an unclear legal situation on the issue of accounting and
subrogation. For example, what will determine whether it is the
appellant or Dobson who is able to claim the benefit of any
payment which may be made by Hornett to the bank on its judgment?
Or, to the extent that Hornett may make any payment to the
insurance company on its judgment which represents part of the
bank&#146;s loss on the Hornett/Biegus thefts, what is the legal
mechanism for the appellant to obtain credit for such payment in
respect of his order which is all in favour of the bank?
</pre>
    <pre>1) ABILITY TO PAY

</pre>
    <pre>[13] This court has recently addressed the proper factors which a
sentencing judge is to weigh when considering whether to impose a
restitution order, now under s. 738 of the Criminal Code, as part
of a sentence: R. v. Devgan (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 161 at 168.
[14] The issue was also recently fully canvassed by the Manitoba
Court of Appeal in R. v. Siemens (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 353.
[15] Both courts have pointed out that one of the factors which
the court is to consider is the ability of the accused to pay. A
restitution order made by a sentencing court survives any
bankruptcy of the accused: Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. B-3, s. 178(1)(a).  Therefore, it is there for life. It
is not intended to be such a burden that it may affect the
prospects for rehabilitation of the accused. That is why ability
to pay is one of the factors which the court must consider.
[16] In a case such as this where the perpetrator committed
crimes jointly with others and split the proceeds, no one
perpetrator is in a position on his own to make good the full
loss to the victim from the property stolen, even though each is
fully responsible for the victim's full loss. Section 738 of the
Code provides for compensation to any person for the loss of
property &#147;as a result of the commission of the offence&#148;.
[17] Therefore where the sentencing court is considering a
restitution order in these circumstances, it must give particular
consideration to the source from which the convicted person is
going to be able to repay the portion of the funds which went to
a co-accused.
[18] The decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeals in R.
v. Lewis, [1975] Crim. L.R. 353, applied this principle under its
legislation in circumstances similar to the case at bar. Four men
robbed a company of £8,000. The police found £5,445 at the home
of one of the robbers, Mr. Lewis. He however, said that his share
of the proceeds of the robbery was only £2,000. He was ordered as
part of his sentence to pay restitution of £5,445 plus a further
£2,000 for other compensation and to legal aid. The Court of
Appeal held that because there would be joint and several civil
liability of each robber for the whole amount stolen, there was
no reason why Mr. Lewis should not pay restitution of more than
£2,000 where he had available from whatever source the sum of
£5,445 from which to make restitution. However, with no evidence
of his means to pay anything more, the balance of the order was
quashed.1
[19] In this case during submissions on sentence the judge had
the following exchange with defense counsel:

          THE  COURT:  Well, let&#146;s  be  practical.
          The man is only going to live another 50
          years.    He  won&#146;t  be  able   to   pay
          $600,000.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr. McKinnon: No, he won&#146;t be.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT: So I mean we&#146;re talking just
          hot  air  really that I would be talking
          if  I  imposed a restitution  order  for
          $600,000. We know he&#146;s not going to  pay
          that.


</pre>
    <pre>[20]  In  his  reasons  for  sentence, the  judge  discussed  the
appellant&#146;s  inability  to  pay in  the  context  of  remorse  as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          I have some difficulty with the question
          of  restitution  and the  remorse  other
          than  that expressed by Mr. Biegus which
          was  expanded upon significantly by  Mr.
          McKinnon.  In  my  view,  if  there  was
          remorse which had commenced in the  mind
          and  heart of the accused prior  to  his
          being  investigated there would  be  now
          significantly  more money  available  to
          pay  to  the  bank by way of restitution
          than  $14,000 and the interest in a home
          which  he  apparently has purchased.  In
          other  words,  if  remorse  had  set  in
          shortly  after  the  commission  of  the
          offences ceased, in my view the  accused
          would  have squirreled away certainly  a
          larger  amount of money than $14,000  in
          order to pay the money back to the  bank
          which he had stolen.
          </pre>
    <pre>          So   with  the  uncertainty,  and   even
          unlikelihood  of  restitution   anywhere
          near  the amount that the bank has lost,
          being obvious from the facts which  have
          been   put   before  me,  I  have   some
          difficulty with the degree or the  depth
          of the remorse with which the accused is
          now motivated. But I do, as I have said,
          pay  heed  to  the importance  of  there
          being   some  consideration  given   the
          accused not only for his plea of  guilty
          but for his co-operation with the police
          upon his being investigated. In my view,
          the  sentence of two years  less  a  day
          significantly reflects that advantage to
          the accused. (Emphasis added).

</pre>
    <pre>[21] There is no other discussion of the factors to be considered
in  the  imposition of a restitution order as part of a sentence.
The  judge imposed a sentence of two years less a day in jail and
added  that &#147;a restitution order will go in favour of  the  Royal
Bank for $638,534.&#148;
[22] The sentencing judge recognized the accused&#146;s inability to
pay the order imposed, but failed to address why that fact became
irrelevant in ultimately imposing the order. Although the
sentencing court is not required to make ability to pay the
overriding consideration in respect of a restitution order, it is
one of the factors which the court must consider and weigh: R. v.
Fitzgibbon (1990), 40 O.A.C. 81 at 90 (S.C.C.). In this case it
is clear that the court was very aware of the inability to pay
and appeared to therefore consider the order somewhat futile, but
imposed it in any event. In my view the judge erred in that
regard.
[23] For the purpose of the appeal the appellant was cross-
examined by Crown counsel as to his current income status. He is
employed in a job which pays him $30,000 a year. Over time he has
the potential to earn a salary of $45,000 - $50,000 in a job in
his field. This information does not change the conclusion of the
sentencing judge that he will never be able to pay the amount of
the restitution order. The appellant advised the court at the
appeal that he would be prepared to accept an order in the amount
of $264,000 which he believed represented his share of the
proceeds of the stolen money.</pre>
    <pre>2)   THE EFFECT OF ORDERING RESTITUTION OF THE FULL AMOUNT STOLEN
     AGAINST EACH OF THE THREE PERPETRATORS.

</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In  this case, the effect of the restitution orders against
Hornett, Dobson and Biegus works a potential unfairness to Biegus
in  the event that the Bank or its insurer may be able to recover
any portion of the loss from Hornett.2
[25] First, on the facts presented by the Crown on the appeal
$453,387.70 of the $638,534 for which the appellant is
responsible has been repaid to the Bank by its insurer.
Nevertheless, the appellant was ordered to pay the full amount as
restitution to the Royal Bank, although at the sentencing
hearing, counsel did attempt to explain the insurance involvement
to the court. No issue was raised on appeal as to the propriety
of the order made, and as such, I make no comment on it. However,
one potential problem for the appellant is that to the extent
that payment may be made by Hornett on the American Home
judgment, there is no mechanism by which such payment will be
treated as credit to the appellant on his judgment in favour of
the Bank.
[26] Second, because of the fact that Biegus and Dobson were
involved in entirely separate thefts, neither is entitled to any
credit on his judgment for a payment by the other to the Bank.
However, if Hornett makes any payment, there is no mechanism for
determining which thefts are to be credited and therefore whose
judgment is to be reduced, Dobson&#146;s or the appellant&#146;s. Because
these orders were made as restitution orders in separate criminal
proceedings, instead of through the civil process where the
issues of the mechanics of orderly and fair recovery could be
fully canvassed and the appropriate orders or directions made,
the result is that these issues have not been addressed or
provided for.
[27] In Devgan and Siemens, the courts both reiterated the long-
standing principle that restitution orders are to made cautiously
and with restraint and are intended to be applied where the
circumstances are relatively simple and straightforward in terms
of the amount to be ordered and the effect of the order. In
Siemens, at p. 357 the court stated as the final principle that
&#147;The fact that there were multiple participants in the crimes &#133;
is a factor which militates against a restitution order
enforceable against one accused, but not against the others.&#148;
This case is a variation on that fact situation, and suggests a
variation on that principle: Where there are multiple
perpetrators, the order must ensure not only the proper recovery
for the victim, but also not work an unfairness as between the
perpetrators that would not result if the matter had been left to
the civil courts.
[28] Although there is no bar which prevents a court from making
an order against each co-accused for the full amount of the
victim&#146;s loss if the circumstances justify such an order, because
of the various complications resulting from the orders made in
the separate proceedings on the guilty pleas of Hornett and
Dobson, it was not appropriate for the sentencing judge in this
case to make a restitution order against the appellant for the
full amount stolen.  However, in another case it may be possible
to reconcile orders made against co-accused or in separate
proceedings in a way that would not have the potential to work
unfairness to any of the parties.
[29] The issue then becomes the appropriate amount of the
restitution order in this case.  In all the circumstances, the
amount of the order should be limited to the amount that the
appellant acknowledged he received from the robbery and for which
he could not seek indemnity from Hornett, nor claim credit for
any amount paid by Hornett.  There is no suggestion on this
record that this amount is inaccurate.
[30]  Such an order would not preclude the Bank from continuing
with the civil proceedings against the appellant for the higher
amount if it so chose, as the doctrine of res judicata does not
apply in respect of civil judgments and restitution orders (see
Devgan at p. 165-67). It would also make the restitution order a
fair one within the principles which are applicable for the
imposition of such orders.
</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION

[31] The sentencing judge erred by failing to consider the factor
of  ability  to pay in determining the quantum of the restitution
order,  and by failing to take account of the potentially  unfair
effect  of the orders already made against other accused  on  the
execution  of  the  restitution order for this  appellant.  As  a
result  this  court  may assess and impose  the  order  which  it
considers reasonable in the circumstances.
[32] I would therefore grant leave to appeal sentence in respect
of the restitution order, allow the appeal, set aside the
restitution order in favour of the Royal Bank in the amount of
$638,534, and impose an order in favour of the Royal Bank in the
amount of $264,000.

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1 The commentary in the [1975] Crim L.R. notes that two statutes
applied in that case, the Theft Act 1968 and the Powers of
Criminal Courts Act 1973. Under the Theft Act, the convicting
court may order the person convicted of theft to repay a sum not
exceeding the value of the stolen goods out of money found in the
possession of the person. However, under the Powers of Criminal
Courts Act, where a compensation order is being considered, the
convicting court is to have regard to the means of the convicted
person.
2 Section 2 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.
M.10 deals with the rights of co-debtors and provides:

     2.  --(1) &#150; Every person who, being surety for the debt
     or duty of another or being liable with another for any
     debt  or  duty, pays the debt or performs the  duty  is
     entitled to have assigned to the person or to a trustee
     for  the  person  every judgment,  specialty  or  other
     security that is held by the creditor in respect of the
     debt  or duty, whether the judgment, specialty or other
     security  is  or  is not deemed at  law  to  have  been
     satisfied by the payment of the debt or the performance
     of the duty.
     </pre>
    <pre>      (2) -- Such person is entitled to stand in the place of the
     creditor, and to use all the remedies and, on
     proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor in any
     action or other proceeding in order to obtain
     from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor
     or co-debtor, indemnification for the advances
     made and loss sustained by such person, and the payment or
     performance made by the person is not a
     defence to such action or other proceeding by the person.</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  --  No  co-surety, co-contractor or  co-debtor  is
     entitled  to  recover  from any  other  co-surety,  co-
     contractor  or co-debtor more than the just  proportion
     to  which,  as  between themselves, the  last-mentioned
     person is justly liable.</pre></td>
