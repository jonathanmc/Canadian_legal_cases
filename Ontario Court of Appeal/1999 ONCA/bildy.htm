    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Carol Dianna Bildy appeals an award of spousal and child
support by the Honourable Mr. Justice Beckett of the Ontario
Court (General Division Family Court) dated November 26, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The parties settled the corollary issues in this dispute,
including custody, access, quantum of child support and quantum
of spousal support. It was agreed that the appellant would have
sole custody of the two children of the marriage. The respondent
would have access as defined in the Minutes of Settlement and
would pay child support of $30,000 per year for each child. He
was also to pay the appellant $30,000 per year in spousal support
for a total of $90,000 per year in support payments.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Counsel before us agreed that the provisions of the Income
Tax Act apply as they were prior to May 1, 1997. The effect is
that the respondent can deduct the full amount of the support
payments from his income and the appellant must pay income tax on
the full amount of the support payments she receives.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  To the extent that it was not fully agreed, it was
determined at trial that the appellant was to pay $43,165.31 for
the equalization of net family property. This amount was to be
payable in monthly instalments of $500, commencing April 15,
1997. At this rate, it would take between 7 and 8 years to
complete the equalization payment.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The only unresolved issue was whether the payments of
spousal support were to be limited as to time. The trial judge
accepted the argument of the respondent on this issue and ordered
that all spousal support payments were to commence on April 30,
1997 and terminate on April 30, 2002. He also awarded the
respondent the costs of the trial on a party and party basis.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The time limited spousal support payments for the appellant
and the disposition of costs are the issues in this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant is 39 years old, and the respondent is 40.
They were married on July 17, 1982 and separated on February 5,
1995. They have two children, Stefan born June 1, 1988 and
Michael born July 10, 1990.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The respondent is a partner in a major law firm with offices
in London, Ontario. He holds an LL.B. from Osgoode Hall Law
School and an LL.M. from Cambridge University, England. For
several years, he has received a substantial six-figure income
from his practice, with a 1996 gross practice income of about
$251,436.34. At the time of trial the respondent had a gross
practice income of $240,000.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant had not worked outside of the home for over
eight years, since the oldest child was born. Her role had been
full-time mother and homemaker. Her formal education ended with
grade 12. She had worked at a variety of secretarial jobs,
topping out at $27,000 per annum while working at an oil company
in Calgary. She left that job when she and her husband moved back
to London. The respondent took up a position with a local law
firm and shortly afterwards became a founding lawyer at the
London offices of his present law firm.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The respondent made it clear in his evidence that, following
separation, he did not expect the appellant to seek employment
while either of the children was still at home. The youngest
child would have started full-time at school in September, 1996,
just six months before the trial and over a year and a half after
separation.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant is a devoted mother and spends considerable
time with the children in their extra-curricular activities,
especially in sports. With a grade 12 education, her job
expectations contrast starkly with the respondent=s potential.
There was no evidence that there were jobs available that the
appellant could have taken. The trial judge found only that the
respondent had given the appellant a list of names of possible
employers, and she had not followed up.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge, in arriving at the conclusion that this was
a proper case for time limited spousal support payments stated:
                         There is no doubt that Mrs.
          Bildy is a devoted mother and spends a
          considerable time with the children in their
          extra-curricular activities especially in
          sports, but so too does Mr. Bildy. He also
          appears to be a devoted parent. He has the
          children every second weekend as well as one
          overnight during the week. I get the
          impression from the Applicant=s evidence and
          the manner in which she answered questions
          that she continues to harbour considerable
          bitterness and resentment towards Mr. Bildy
          and for that, or perhaps other reasons, is
          not anxious to return to work and become self-
          supporting. I was not assured by her evidence
          that she has any intentions of doing so in
          the near future or that she feels any
          obligation to do so. She was, no doubt, a
          very competent secretary with both London
          Life and Norsen. One would have expected that
          she might have made inquiries with her former
          employer, London Life. Although Mr. Bildy
          made it clear in his evidence that following
          separation, he did not expect her to seek
          employment while either of the children was
          still at home, he now takes the position that
          she has an obligation to make some reasonable
          efforts to become self-supporting.
          </pre>
    <pre>[13] As the trial judge recognized, the support payments to the
appellant are not overly generous and, in my opinion, cannot on
their own make the appellant self-sufficient. The reality is that
at the present time the appellant is receiving $90,000 per year
in support payments for both herself and the children and has the
burden of paying the respondent $6,000 per year to satisfy the
equalization payment.</pre>
    <pre>[14] It is unfortunate that this matter was presented to the
trial judge with such limited options. On this record, the
appellant has never earned as much as $30,000 a year and it is
acknowledged that that figure by itself would not make her self-
sufficient. The goal in this case must surely be to encourage her
to be self-sufficient, while still recognizing that support
payments will be necessary from the respondent for some time in
the future. With respect, the trial judge was in error in placing
so much emphasis on self-sufficiency in this case.</pre>
    <pre>[15] As was said by Osborne J.A. in Linton v. Linton (1990), 30
R.F.L. (3d) 1 at pp.35-6:
                              The objective of self-
          sufficiency must be assessed in the context
          of the marriage, particularly in a marriage
          involving a long period of cohabitation. To
          do otherwise is to recognize inadequately the
          economic value of the functions of child care
          and household management, and the economic
          disadvantages accruing as a result of a long-
          term absence from the work-force.
                                  . . . .
                    In my view, the provisions of s. 15
          [of the Divorce Act] require both need and
          self-sufficiency to be considered as above
          stated. The Aonce a secretary always a
          secretary@ support model is not reasonable in
          a marriage of long duration. It does not
          adequately address the factors and objectives
          set out in subss. 15(5) and 15(7).
                               . . . .
                    Although I acknowledge that self-
          sufficiency may lead to a clean break, it
          must be remembered that the objective of self-
          sufficiency, as referred to in s. 15(7)(d),
          is qualified. Thus, the clean break approach
          to support must be viewed as having a limited
          legislative underpinning.
          </pre>
    <pre>[16] This was a marriage of 13 years duration and the children
are presently 11 and 9 years of age. They will require continuous
supervision by the appellant until they are in their late teens.
Additionally, the spousal support payments are not overly
generous in the first place and are subject to the obligation of
the appellant to pay the equalization payment until 2004. In my
view, an order for the continuation of the $30,000 spousal
support payment until the year 2006 gives adequate recognition to
the need to encourage the appellant to take some positive steps
towards self-sufficiency by finding employment. At that time,
either of the parties should have the right to review the quantum
of the support payments.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, and vary the order of
Beckett J. to provide that the spousal support payments of
$30,000 a year are to commence on April 30, 1997 and terminate on
April 30, 2006. At that time, either party may apply to the court
to reconsider the appellant=s entitlement to support and any
continuation of support. The quantum of support, if any, should
be decided in light of all of the circumstances as may then exist
and upon the application of ss. 15(5) and (7) of the Divorce Act,
R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2nd Supp.). There should be no costs to either
party with respect to the proceedings before Beckett J.</pre>
    <pre>[18] I would allow the appellant her costs of this appeal.
