</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Somers J. dated December 19, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  1991 Kevin Bird and Penny Mitchell formed a partnership
to  carry  on a graphic design business. A year later  they  each
incorporated  companies  which  became  the  partners   in   that
business.  In 1995 the personal relationship which had  developed
between  them ended, and as a result, they brought their business
relationship  to  an end. This was done by means  of  a  Purchase
Agreement and a Non-Solicitation Agreement by which the interests
of Mr. Bird&#146;s company in the partnership was acquired by a second
company owned by Ms. Mitchell.
[2]  This litigation is over the money said to be owing on this
purchase.
[3]  At trial, Somers J. found Ms. Mitchell&#146;s two companies to be
liable in breach of contract for $164,250 together with pre-
judgment interest. He also found Ms. Mitchell personally liable
for this sum based on the oppression remedy section of the
Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.B16, namely s.248. He
made the judgment against Ms. Mitchell conditional on the
plaintiffs amending their statement of claim to assert this
relief within three weeks of the release of his judgment.
Finally, he dismissed the counterclaim seeking damages for the
alleged breach of these contracts by Mr. Bird and his company.
[4]  Ms. Mitchell and her companies appeal from all three
findings.
[5]  For the reasons that follow I would dismiss the appeals from
the judgment against Ms. Mitchell&#146;s companies and from the
dismissal of the counterclaim. I would allow the appeal from the
judgment against Ms. Mitchell personally and would remit that
issue for trial.

THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The  Purchase Agreement and the Non-Solicitation  Agreement
were  both signed on October 6, 1995. Each side had its own legal
advice. The Non-Solicitation Agreement was attached as a schedule
to the Purchase Agreement.
[7]  The Purchase Agreement identified Mr. Bird&#146;s company, which
owned a half interest in the graphic design partnership, as the
vendor. It set out as the purchaser a second company owned by Ms.
Mitchell. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, Ms. Mitchell&#146;s
two companies each had a half interest in the graphic design
business.
[8]  The Purchase Agreement recited that it was for the
consideration of $10. Later, in the same agreement, the vendor
agreed to sell its interest in the partnership to the purchaser
for $1. It also provided that Mr. Bird and the purchaser company
would enter into the Non-Solicitation Agreement. Mr. Bird was a
party to both agreements. Ms. Mitchell was a party only to the
Non-Solicitation Agreement. The latter prohibited Mr. Bird and
his new company from dealing with, or soliciting business from,
any of the existing customers of the partnership. It also
provided that Mr. Bird and his new company would provide such
consulting services to the partnership as might be mutually
agreed upon and that for providing such services Mr. Bird and his
new company were entitled to receive $30,000 on closing and a
further $170,000 on specified dates over the following 27 months.
At trial $164,250 of this amount was outstanding.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[9]   Against this backdrop the primary defence raised  at  trial
was  that Ms. Mitchell had sought the consulting services of  Mr.
Bird  and  his new company and had been refused, thereby negating
any further payment obligations. This refusal was also argued  to
be  a  breach  of contract for which damages were sought  on  the
counterclaim.
[10] The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and found as
a fact that neither Mr. Bird, nor his company, ever refused to
provide further consulting services when asked to do so by the
appellants. There is abundant evidence in the record to support
this factual conclusion, and it cannot in any sense be said to
constitute a palpable and overriding error. Since the
counterclaim was based on the assertion that Mr. Bird refused to
honour his obligation to provide consulting services when
requested, this finding of fact required that the counterclaim be
dismissed. There is no basis to interfere with this finding. The
appeal from the dismissal of the counterclaim must therefore
fail.
[11] The appellants also contest the finding of the trial judge
that as a matter of contractual interpretation the two appellant
companies are obligated to pay the respondent $164,250. They say
that the Non-Solicitation Agreement created an entitlement for
this compensation only if Mr. Bird and his new company actually
performed consulting services for the respondents after October
6, 1995. It was argued that since none were performed no payment
was required.
[12] In my view, the trial judge was correct in concluding that
the Purchase Agreement and the Non-Solicitation Agreement were so
intertwined that they must be taken together as one contract and,
further, that the amounts to be paid actually represented the
purchase price for the half interest in the partnership to be
paid by the two Mitchell companies owning the partnership.
[13] The language of the documents and the factual matrix
surrounding them provide an ample basis for this conclusion. The
two agreements cross-reference each other. One is attached as a
schedule to the other. One contains a term explicitly requiring
the execution of the other. The evidence makes clear that the
parties intended that the two documents should be treated as a
single contract and that the payments provided for constituted
the purchase price for the half interest in the business. The
transaction was structured as it was because of tax advice and to
preserve for Ms. Mitchell some access to Mr. Bird&#146;s expertise if
she ever sought it and he consented. However, this structure does
not alter the underlying reality of the contract, namely, that
Ms. Mitchell through her companies was buying the half interest
in the partnership from Mr. Bird&#146;s company for the price of
$200,000. Judgment was therefore properly granted against the two
corporate appellants for the balance that remained outstanding on
that purchase price. The appeal from this order must be
dismissed.
[14] The order made against Ms. Mitchell is, however, more
problematic. Based on her cross-examination, the trial judge
found that Ms. Mitchell had made the following admissions: she
had withdrawn some $100,000 from the partnership and transferred
it to her family trust; and the fixed assets of the partnership
were transferred to her new firm &#147;at book value&#148;. These  acts
were done with full knowledge of Mr. Bird&#146;s action and had the
result of rendering insolvent the partnership and the two
appellant companies that owned it. The trial judge concluded that
Ms. Mitchell had thus systematically stripped the partnership of
its assets and transferred them to a new company.
[15] It was less than two weeks before trial that the plaintiffs
advised, as against Ms. Mitchell personally, that they were
seeking a remedy relating to oppression under s.248 of the
Business Corporations Act. Despite this, the trial judge found
that judgment should go against Ms. Mitchell personally on this
basis. This was in addition to the finding of breach of contract
made against her two companies. The trial judge put his
conclusion in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     No explanation was offered  to  me
	  by plaintiffs&#146; counsel as   to why he did not
	  notify  defendants&#146;  counsel  earlier  of his
	  intentions which he should have done. Neither
	  has he explained why todate[sic] he has taken
	  no steps to amend his statement  of  claim to
	  make such a claim.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  view of this and of the  clear
          admissions  made by Miss Mitchell during  the
          trial, I am satisfied that no prejudice would
          ensue if an amendment were to be made even at
          this  late date. I conclude, therefore,  that
          there  should be judgement of the  plaintiffs
          against  the  corporate  defendants  and  the
          defendant, Mitchell, for the sum of $164,250.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      With  respect  to  the  judgement
          against  the defendant, Mitchell, personally,
          this  will be granted provided the plaintiffs
          arrange  within  three  weeks  to  make   the
          appropriate  amendments  to  the  claim   for
          relief under the provisions of Section 248 of
          the  Business Corporations Act. I order  that
          such an amendment, the form of which is to be
          approved by me, will have leave to be made.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  This finding, in essence, grants the amendment required  to
accommodate the conclusion of the trial judge without  it  having
been requested by the plaintiffs. Moreover, at this stage of  the
proceedings  and  in these circumstances, in my  view,  prejudice
would be an almost inevitable consequence of such an amendment.
[17] There was nothing in the plaintiffs&#146; pleadings to suggest a
claim for oppression. There was no reference whatsoever to the
Business Corporations Act. When such a claim was first raised
shortly before trial it consisted of a bald reference to s.248 of
that Act and the remedies relating to oppression contained
therein. There was no indication of the facts said to constitute
oppression. The defendants immediately set out their opposition
to such a claim and indicated that it was too late to have the
productions and discoveries that such a claim would require.
[18] At trial the plaintiffs made no reference in opening to the
claim for an oppression remedy. While plaintiffs&#146; counsel told us
that defence counsel (not Mr. Zarnett or Ms. Rosenthal) indicated
in final argument that no further evidence would be necessary to
defend such a claim, Mr. Zarnett could not confirm this. There is
no suggestion of such a concession in the trial judge&#146;s reasons.
Moreover, defence counsel made no attempt to re-examine or call
further evidence to elaborate or explain the bald assertions
elicited in cross-examination of the transfer of $100,000 and the
fixed assets as surely would have been done had defence counsel
been aware of the oppression claim. Nor did defence counsel call
evidence to demonstrate the legitimate expectations of the
parties as he undoubtedly would have, had the oppression claim
been properly pleaded.
[19] An amendment made in these circumstances would mirror the
findings of oppressive conduct already made by the trial judge
without the defence having had any prior notice that this conduct
was alleged to violate s.248 or having any chance to respond. In
my view, the amendment should not have been allowed and to this
extent the appeal must succeed.
[20] The evidence upon which the trial judge concluded that Ms.
Mitchell had oppressed the creditors of her companies was
undoubtedly thin. In light of the remedy I propose it would not
be appropriate to make further comment. Suffice it to say that
given the remedial flexibility provided by s.248 of the Business
Corporations Act, I cannot say that the conclusion of oppression
clearly represents reversible error. The error here is that Ms.
Mitchell was not given an opportunity to answer the claim.
[21] Hence, the appropriate remedy is that the appeal from the
judgment against Ms. Mitchell personally be allowed and the claim
of oppression pursuant to s.248 of the Business Corporations Act
be remitted for trial, subject to the appropriate amendments to
the pleadings and such further productions and discoveries as are
required by the those amendments. I would therefore grant leave
to amend the claim accordingly with costs fixed at $1500 payable
to Mrs. Mitchell in any event of the cause if the appellants
proceed to make the amendment.
[22] The appeal is therefore allowed in part. The judgment below
is varied by striking out paragraphs two, three and five and
substituting a paragraph remitting the oppression claim for trial
as described above. Success being divided in this court there
should be no order as to costs of the appeal.</pre>
