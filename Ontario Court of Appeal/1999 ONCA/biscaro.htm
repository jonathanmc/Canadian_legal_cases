</pre>
    <pre>[1]  While this case was treated by the judge below as a motion
under rule 20 of the Rules of Practice, it is apparent to us that
in fact it was dealt with by him and by the parties as a trial
based upon agreed upon facts.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  With exception of his erroneous reference to an automobile
allowance, we can find no error in the reasons of the judge
below. His overall conclusion is amply supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appeal is dismissed, with costs.
