<pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   In  convicting the appellant of abduction, the trial  judge
did  not  shift  the  burden of proof. He instructed  himself  in
accord  with  R.  v.  W.D.  The trial  judge  then  rejected  the
appellant’s  evidence  and found that the appellant  was  not  so
intoxicated he could not form the intent required by  s.  281  of
the  Code.  Indeed,  the trial judge made an express  finding  of
intent.  His findings were reasonably supported by the  evidence.
We, therefore, see no ground to interfere with the conviction for
abduction.

[2]  The appellant submits that the conviction for kidnapping
cannot stand because the period of forcible confinement was of
such short duration. We disagree. The duration of confinement
must be looked at in context. The child was induced into the car
by a ruse or misrepresentation and kept in the car until the
appellant apparently changed his mind. On these facts, the
relatively short duration of the confinement does not undermine
the conviction.</font></pre>
