    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from his conviction for second degree
murder.  This was the second trial for the appellant on this
charge following a retrial ordered by this court for reasons
reported at (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 350.  At the conclusion of
argument by counsel for the appellant, the court indicated that
it would not call upon counsel for the respondent and that the
appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was tried with Lannieteen Champagnie.  The
deceased was killed in the course of a drug deal that had been
arranged by Champagnie.  The killing was witnessed by Angela
Connell, the girlfriend of the deceased.  She identified the
appellant and Champagnie as the persons who shot the deceased and
Brandy Willis,1 as being present and possibly blocking an escape
route.  Champagnie testified that it was the appellant who had
fired all four shots.  He claimed that while he was involved in
the drug deal (possibly an attempt to steal the drug money from
the deceased), he did not know that the appellant was armed or
that he intended to kill the deceased.  The jury acquitted
Champagnie.
[3]  The appellant did not testify at the trial and relied upon
three inconsistent defences.  His counsel argued that he was not
present at the scene.  Alternatively, he argued that if he was
present, nevertheless it was Champagnie who had shot the
deceased.  Finally, he argued that if the jury was satisfied that
he was the perpetrator, he acted in self-defence.  The appellant
raised four grounds of appeal.  In our view, none of the matters
raised constitutes reversible error.</pre>
    <pre>               1.   The Charge to the Jury on Reasonable Doubt
[4]  The trial in this matter took place prior to the decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C.
(3d) 1 and therefore does not contain some of the elements in the
model charge suggested by Cory J. in that case.  As well, there
is some language that Cory J. has suggested should be avoided.
The charge was, however, similar to the standard charge in use in
this province prior to Lifchus and we are satisfied that it
adequately conveyed the meaning of reasonable doubt to the jury.
</pre>
    <pre>               2.   Challenge for cause
[5]  Prior to jury selection, counsel for the appellant and the
co-accused applied to the trial judge to challenge each juror for
cause.  They sought to ask the jurors the following question:</pre>
    <pre>               The accused in this case are immigrants from Jamaica. Do you
          hold any pre-set opinions about people from Jamaica, particularly
          with respect to crime or drugs that might interfere with your
          ability to try this case fairly?
          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  The trial judge refused to permit challenge for cause on
this basis, although Crown counsel did not oppose the defence
application.  The trial judge did permit the appellants to
challenge for cause in accordance with this court&#146;s decision in
R. v. Parks (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 350 to address bias against
black people.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  At the first trial involving the appellant and Champagnie,
which was held prior to the decision in Parks, counsel had sought
to ask this same question.  It appears that at the first trial no
challenge for cause of any kind was permitted.  In allowing the
appeal from the first trial, this court noted that in light of
Parks, the Crown conceded that there should be a new trial.  The
court held as follows at p. 352:
               Upon receipt of the intervener's factum, and after further
          careful consideration of the issue, Crown counsel reconsidered
          the position proposed to be taken on the appeal and now submits
          that the trial judge did err in denying the appellants the right
          to challenge for cause as requested, that the issue was resolved
          by the Parks decision, and conceded that there should be a new
          trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The argument that the trial judge erred
          in light of what was said by this court in
          Parks was obviously a very tenable position
          and, in the absence of any submission to
          support the judge's ruling, the only
          appropriate position for the court is to
          allow the appeals, set aside the convictions
          and direct a new trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>[8]  We agree with the trial judge that the decision at the first
trial does not stand for the broad proposition that accused have
the automatic right to challenge for cause on the basis of
country of origin.  We also disagree with the proposition that we
can take judicial notice that there is a realistic potential of
the existence of partiality on the basis of the appellant&#146;s
country of origin by reason of the nature of the crime.  In a
decision released since the second trial in this matter, this
court held that the ruling in Parks did not extend to country of
origin.  Rather, if the defence wish to challenge on that basis
they must comply with the decision in R. v. Sherrat (1991), 63
C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).  See R. v. Koh (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d)
257 (Ont. C.A.) at 274.</pre>
    <pre>               3.   Disclosure
          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  Angela Connell was an important witness for the Crown.  She
was present at the scene and identified the appellant as one of
the persons who killed the deceased.  The day following the
killing, Ms. Connell identified Champagnie and Brandy Willis,
from photographic lineups.  About a week later, Connell was shown
a line-up that contained a photograph of the appellant and she
identified him as one of the perpetrators.  She had seen both the
appellant and Champagnie on different occasions.  It became clear
in the course of cross-examination by counsel for the appellant,
that Ms. Connell originally had difficulty putting the correct
name to the second perpetrator.  She used the names &#147;Dave&#148; and
&#147;Ritchie&#148; to identify this person.  She eventually agreed that
Dave and Ritchie were different people and that only Ritchie was
a name used by the appellant.  She also agreed that she had
originally identified the second perpetrator as Dave and that he
had a pierced ear and an earring.  When the appellant was
arrested he did not have a pierced ear.  She was also cross-
examined on a conversation she had with one Paul Watson.  She
admitted asking Watson for help in identifying this other man.
She testified that she gave Watson a description and he told her
it was &#147;Dave&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Prior to the second trial, counsel for Champagnie sought
disclosure of any wiretap conversations involving Ms. Connell.
The police provided him with transcripts of conversations between
Connell and Watson.2  For some reason, these same transcripts
were not provided to counsel for the appellant.  Counsel for the
appellant only learned of them after Champagnie closed his case.
At that time, counsel for the appellant applied for a mistrial.
The trial judge refused but did offer to have Ms. Connell
recalled for further cross-examination or counsel could read the
relevant passages of the conversations to the jury.  Counsel
opted for the latter.
[11] Counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge erred
in failing to declare a mistrial.  He argues that the opportunity
for further cross-examination or to read in the relevant calls
was not an adequate remedy for what is conceded to be a failure
to make proper disclosure.  Counsel rely in particular on this
court&#146;s decision in R. v. L.A.T. (1993), 64 O.A.C. 188.
[12] In our view, the trial judge did not err in refusing to
declare a mistrial.  Ms. Connell had been extensively cross-
examined about her confusion over &#147;Dave&#148; and her conversation
with Paul Watson.  Had the wiretap transcripts been available at
the time they would have largely confirmed what Ms. Connell had
already conceded.  The only thing that the wiretap added was that
when Watson expressly asked Ms. Connell if the shooter was
&#147;Ritchie&#148; she said that it was not.  On the other hand, she also
told Watson, and testified at trial, that she knew the shooter to
be an associate of a man nicknamed &#147;Bulbeye&#148;.  When the appellant
was arrested, he was in possession of a photograph of himself
with two other men, including &#147;Bulbeye&#148;.
[13] In the circumstances, we are satisfied that there is no
reasonable possibility that the late disclosure affected the
outcome of the trial or prejudiced the fairness of the trial.  In
the context of this case, the remedies offered to the appellant
were adequate.  Counsel made a tactical decision to merely read
in the relevant parts of the conversation.  This is not a case
like L.A.T. were a wholly new matter that could substantially
undermine the credibility of the Crown&#146;s main witness is
disclosed for the first time at the end of the trial.  Ms.
Connell&#146;s confusion about &#147;Dave&#148; and her conversations with
Watson had already been extensively canvassed during the Crown&#146;s
case.
               4.   Self-defence
          </pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the
jury with respect to self-defence.  The appellant relies upon
this passage from the charge to the jury:</pre>
    <pre>               Furthermore, a person acting in self-defence is not expected
          to measure with nicety the proportionality of the force required
          to repel the assailant&#146;s force particularly where he reasonably
          believes that the assailant is armed with a loaded gun.
          </pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellant argues that in this passage the trial judge
erred by introducing the concept of proportionate force into the
determination of self-defence under s. 34(2) of the Criminal
Code.  He also argues that this error was exacerbated by
reference to the position of the Crown that the discharge of four
bullets into the deceased was &#147;grossly excessive force&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[16] When the instructions on self-defence are read as a whole we
do not agree that there was any error.  The instructions on self-
defence were complete and accurate and indeed entirely favourable
to the appellant, given the almost complete lack of a factual
basis for this defence.  The impugned passage is a caution not to
impose a concept of proportionality.
[17] The reference to the Crown&#146;s position was simply that.  That
position was a reasonable one, given the fact that the deceased
was unarmed and outnumbered and in view of the lack of evidence
that the appellant reasonably believed that he could not
otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.
[18] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
