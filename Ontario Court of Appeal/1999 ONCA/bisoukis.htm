    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Langdon J. dated July 30, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On March 18, 1993, the appellant, Maria Bisoukis, sustained
injuries when the automobile she was driving went out of  control
upon  encountering  black  ice on McVean  Road  in  the  City  of
Brampton (the &#147;City&#148;).  On September 23, 1993, a claim was issued
against the City in which Mrs. Bisoukis and members of her family
were  plaintiffs.  Her claim was based on the failure of the City
to  keep McVean Road in repair, a duty which was imposed on it by
s. 284(1) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 45.  The claim
was  not  brought within three months of the time the appellants&#146;
damages were sustained, as required by s. 284(2) of the Act.
[2]  Langdon J. dismissed the plaintiffs&#146; claims.  He found, that
Mrs. Bisoukis had failed to establish that she was under a
disability within the meaning of s. 47 of the Limitations Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 15, with the result that s. 47 could not be
applied to extend the three month limitation period.  He found
that McVean Road was in good repair, and absolved the City of
liability on the ground that it was not negligent because it
maintained a reasonable system of road inspection.  In the event
that he was incorrect in this finding, the trial judge found that
Mrs. Bisoukis was 30% at fault in contributing to the cause of
her accident and injuries.  He assessed Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; general
damages at $75,000, the parties having agreed to special damages
of $140,000.  In addition, he assessed the damages of her
husband, Christos, and her daughter, Sophia, who were claimants
under the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 3, at $7,500 and
$5,000, respectively.
[3]  The appellants have raised four grounds of appeal.  It was
submitted that the trial judge erred:
</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  in dismissing the Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; claim against the City,
     </pre>
    <pre>     (2)  in failing to extend the limitation period through the
	  application of s.47 of the Limitations Act, and</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  in finding Mrs. Bisoukis 30% contributorily negligent.</pre>
    <pre>As  for the fourth ground, it was submitted that certain comments
made  by  Langdon J. in the course of the trial, and  in  certain
passages   in  his  reasons  for  judgment,  raise  a  reasonable
apprehension of bias.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   For  the reasons which follow, I would give effect  to  the
first  three  grounds  of appeal, with  the  result  that  it  is
unnecessary to consider the fourth ground.  However, I propose to
address  this  ground of appeal because, in my  view,  the  trial
judge  made  gratuitous  and  unnecessary  comments  about   Mrs.
Bisoukis  and the members of her family which cannot be permitted
to stand without comment.</pre>
    <pre>THE LIMITATION ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>The Facts
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Because  of my view that the trial judge erred  in  finding
that  s.  47  of the Limitations Act did not apply to extend  the
three  month  limitation period prescribed by s.  284(2)  of  the
Municipal Act, a careful review of the evidence is required.
[6]  Mrs. Bisoukis was born in Greece, where she received her
education, which was concluded when she completed grade 9.  She
came to Canada in 1968.  After holding three jobs, in 1971 she
became the manager of a Becker&#146;s store, a position she held at
the time of her accident.  At that time she was the main wage
earner for her husband, Christos, and her daughters, Nicolletta
and Sophia.  As a result of years of hard work, she was able to
have a 7,000 square foot house built for the family in 1990, in
which she took considerable pride.  Mrs. Bisoukis was the
dominant figure in the family, assuming responsibility for the
care of her husband and children, as well as the management of
the household.  Typically, she spent long days working at the
store, preparing meals for the family and taking care of the
house.
[7]  Following the accident she was admitted to the hospital
under the general care of her family doctor, Dr. Zaremba.  She
was treated for a compound fracture of her right distal ulna, a
major laceration of her right forearm and soft tissue injuries.
Her treatment included a plate for the ulnar fracture and
reconstructive plastic surgery of the wound site.  During
hospitalization she began to exhibit symptoms of depression and
exhibited unusual resistance to looking at her wound.  The
possibility of a psychiatric consultation was raised, but did not
materialize.  After twenty-three days in hospital, she was
discharged on April 9, 1993.  As of the time of the trial in
1996, Mrs. Bisoukis had been unable to return to work.
[8]  Following  her discharge from hospital, Mrs. Bisoukis
continued under the care of Dr. Zaremba.  He assessed her mental
status as extremely agitated and depressed, for which he provided
her with supportive therapy and reassurance.  However, Mrs.
Bisoukis did not respond to this treatment. Indeed, her
depression became more acute.  Consequently, Dr. Zaremba referred
her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Menchions, who held his first clinical
interview with her on May 6, 1994.  At the time of the trial,
Mrs. Bisoukis was still receiving treatment from Dr. Menchions.
[9]  Dr. Menchions, who testified at the trial, prepared a number
of medical reports which were introduced in evidence.  He
reported, and testified, that when he assessed her initially, she
showed symptoms of severe depression, including sadness, labile
affect, hopelessness, and extreme self-deprecation.  His
diagnosis was major affective disorder.
[10] Mrs. Bisoukis did not respond well to the treatment she
received from Dr. Menchions.  He felt that one of the reasons for
this was that the other three members of the family continued to
lean heavily on her for guidance, advice and support.
Consequently, by the summer of 1995, Dr. Menchions felt that a
second opinion would be helpful.  He referred Mrs. Bisoukis to
Dr. Jeffries.
[11] Dr. Jeffries&#146; opinion was that there were three options
remaining.  While he recommended treatment with the then latest
anti-depressant, Effexor, or a trial of the original group of MAO
Inhibitor types of anti-depressants, his primary recommendation
was electro-convulsive therapy, which was indicative of the
seriousness of Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; depression.
[12] It is helpful to quote from Dr. Menchions&#146; report of
December 5, 1995 in which he discussed Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; response to
Dr. Jeffries&#146; recommendations and her ability to form a decision
to retain a lawyer to advise her whether she had a legal remedy
arising from the circumstances surrounding her accident.
</pre>
    <pre>          And  in this last situation lies what  I
          believe  is  key  in understanding  Mrs.
          Bisoukis&#146;s  ability to  direct  counsel:
          typical  of most decisions she has  been
          asked  to  make  with  respect  to   her
          ongoing treatment, she dithers, and  has
          enormous  difficulty feeling  worthy  of
          making  the  treatment  decisions.   She
          feels that she is worthless, and that no
          one  should care for her.  She  has  the
          presence  of mind to seek help,  and  to
          attempt  to follow directions  (although
          sometimes  compliance is  difficult  for
          her  because of side effects),  but  has
          much    difficulty    initiating     the
          expression of her choices.  For example,
          although      we      discussed      the
          recommendations Dr. Jeffries  had  made,
          and   she   clearly  showed   that   she
          remembered  and understood  the  options
          available to her, she initially  refused
          to try anything new, instead choosing to
          keep   taking  the  Manerix  for  weeks.
          Later,  after several sessions  with  me
          reviewing   with   her   the   remaining
          alternatives to the Manerix, she  stated
          that  she  did  in  fact  want  to   try
          something further (such as the Effexor),
          but  felt  that she was not entitled  to
          express this until I had coaxed  her  to
          review the options several times.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  my  opinion, her depression  greatly
          reduces  her  sense  of  being  able  to
          express her wishes and have them imposed
          on  others  (even  in a  straightforward
          situation such as choice of medication).
          She  feels  that to ask for help  is  to
          impose  on  others, and repeatedly  made
          reference to &#147;wasting the time&#148; of other
          therapists  and  physicians.    In   the
          family   context  as   well,   she   has
          repeatedly  felt  unable  to  exert  her
          opinions  on her husband and  daughters,
          feeling  that she &#147;doesn&#146;t  deserve&#148;  to
          have  her  thoughts listened to  (again,
          despite   being  asked  by  her   family
          members in many ways).
          </pre>
    <pre>          OPINION
          </pre>
    <pre>          In    my    opinion,   Mrs.   Bisoukis&#146;s
          depression   has  prevented   her   from
          expressing her wishes, especially  about
          receiving  help (except in  obvious  and
          emergency   situations,  such   as   the
          emergency surgery and medical  care  she
          required),   as  she  sees  herself   as
          worthless.     There   is   considerable
          improvement  in  this  condition   (such
          improvement seemed first apparent in  my
          opinion   in  the  winter  of  1995   in
          response to Manerix), but it is still  a
          significant  factor  in  her   treatment
          management.    It   appears   from   the
          clinical  records, and the  opinions  of
          her   ongoing  physicians,   that   this
          depression  was reactive  to  the  March
          1993  motor vehicle accident, and in  my
          opinion  probably  interfered  with  her
          ability to direct counsel to act on  her
          behalf  from  the time of the  accident,
          and  to  some extent persists  (although
          she  is  now  able to direct counsel  to
          proceed  in this matter).  There  is  no
          evidence of inability to appreciate  the
          options  and consequences, and there  is
          no   evidence   of  psychotic   thought;
          however,   her  inability  to   initiate
          expression  of her wish for  help  in  a
          variety of ways because of the depth  of
          her  depression probably, in my opinion,
          amounts    functionally    to     mental
          incompetence  in her ability  to  direct
          counsel,  certainly in the period  prior
          to 1995. [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  In  his last report, prepared on April 12, 1996, which  was
about  seven  months before the commencement of  the  trial,  Dr.
Menchions stated that his earlier opinion had not changed.
[14] In his testimony, Dr. Menchions said that Mrs. Bisoukis
demonstrated &#147;an unusually severe depression&#148;, which diagnosis
had been confirmed by Dr. Jeffries.  She also demonstrated a
profound inability to adapt to change, which in Dr. Menchions&#146;
opinion was caused by a pervasive sense of shame and guilt which
interfered with her view of herself and her ability to do things.
[15] When asked about when the depression began, Dr. Menchions&#146;
opinion was that it was triggered by the accident.  In support of
his opinion, he referred to early clinical notes made on Mrs.
Bisoukis&#146; admission to the hospital which he found to be
consistent with a &#147;quite significant depression&#148;.  He also
referred to comments in her clinical record about her depression
made by each of the physicians who treated her in the hospital.
He added:
</pre>
    <pre>          And  in my opinion she would not at  the
          time   of  the  accident,  and   for   a
          considerable length after that, have  of
          her  own  volition  felt  that  she  was
          entitled  to take any action at  all  or
          direct  counsel&#133;. That she was not  able
          to,   of  her  own  volition,  undertake
          activities  or make choices which  would
          bring   her  relief  or  pleasure,   and
          certainly  it&#146;s my opinion she  was  not
          able to make choices about any sense  of
          entitlement  for  restitution&#133;  [A]lmost
          immediately  &#133;  on  the  scene  of   the
          accident,  [she had] begun to experience
          this pervasive sense of failure for  the
          accident having occurred.  And  I  think
          that  quite  clouded her  thinking,  and
          continues  to cloud her feelings  today.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  When  Dr. Menchions was asked his opinion about  when  Mrs.
Bisoukis  was  first able to really appreciate her situation  and
when  she was first in a &#147;mental position&#148; to direct and instruct
counsel, he replied that there was &#147;not a specific time at  which
that  occurred&#148;.  He testified that when he first met her in May,
1994, and asked her about any legal consequences of the accident,
she replied that she did not feel that there would be any.  Thus,
in Dr. Menchions&#146; opinion, in May, 1994, Mrs. Bisoukis was unable
to  direct counsel.  He added: &#147;And I don&#146;t think there&#146;s been  a
specific  threshold  we&#146;ve  crossed since  then  &#133;.  She  remains
ambivalent about her entitlement to be involved in this process.&#148;
[17] In summary, it was Dr. Menchions&#146; opinion that Mrs. Bisoukis
became acutely depressed right after the accident and that as a
result, of her own volition, she lacked the ability to make a
decision to retain a lawyer with respect to her accident.  This
was because she blamed herself for causing the accident.  In the
doctor&#146;s opinion, this was not an illness from which she suffered
prior to the accident.
[18] Counsel for the defendant provided no evidence to refute the
opinion of Dr. Menchions. He appeared content to attempt to
devalue Dr. Menchions&#146; opinion by way of cross-examination.  In
my view, he was unsuccessful.  Rather, the doctor confirmed the
opinion he expressed in his testimony-in-chief that Mrs. Bisoukis
did not have the mental capacity to decide to retain a lawyer
within the three months following her accident.
[19] Counsel&#146;s cross-examination with respect to this issue was
brief, occupying about 2-1/2 pages.  Because counsel for the
defendant placed significant reliance on his cross-examination of
Dr. Menchions in support of his position that Mrs. Bisoukis had
the mental capacity to retain counsel within the relevant period
of time, I find it helpful to reproduce this portion of the cross-
examination:
</pre>
    <pre>        Q.   Now, on this business about instructing counsel, you can&#146;t
        really say, standing here today, can you, that if she went to a
        lawyer she wouldn&#146;t understand what he was telling her and ---
        and she couldn&#146;t give him instructions to act on her behalf?</pre>
    <pre>        A.   I think that certainly when I first started to see her, and
        continuously for some time into the treatment, but not
        continuously now, she would not volitionally undertake any
        activity that she felt was to her benefit, in &#150; in the sense of
        almost self-punishment she would withhold making decisions that
        seemed to be something to help her or in her - -- her best
        interest.
        </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;.
        </pre>
    <pre>        Q.   --- and you say [in your report of Dec. 5, 1995] &#145;She has
        the presence of mind to seek help and to attempt to follow
        directions, although sometimes compliance is difficult for her
        because of side-effects, but has much difficulty initiating the
        expression of her choices.&#146; Now, forgive me, but that seems to
        fly in the face of what you&#146;ve been saying?</pre>
    <pre>          
        A.   It&#146;s a matter of degree.  I think that, for example, in the
        hospital immediately after the accident she would have been
        competent to give consent for surgery on her arm, as she would
        understand this could take her life were she not to consent to
        have the treatment done.  Things which involve meeting
        obligations to others are certainly things that she has attempted
        to undertake.  For example, she sees my prescription for
        medication as something I wish her to do, so she takes it for me
        in --- large measure.  The --- the most difficult decisions for
        her have been those which involve her having to create and
        initiate some kind of activity for herself.  So it&#146;s a matter of
        degree and I think at the time when I first assessed her and at
        the time in this report, she would not have decided on her own
        that she should undertake, for example, to direct counsel to
        pursue this matter.
        </pre>
    <pre>        Q.   All right.  Of course, doctor, you may not be aware of the
        fact that nine months before you saw her for the first time she
        had instructed counsel on the statement of claim in this action
        that had been issued on September 23, 1993?</pre>
    <pre>        A.   I&#146;m not aware of the date.  I don&#146;t --- of course we&#146;re both
        speculating on her state of mind at that time as well.  My guess
        would be that she had some assistance in --- in making that
        decision.  That&#146;s my guess.
          </pre>
    <pre>        Q.   May well be; may well be.  But were you aware at the time?</pre>
    <pre>        A.   No, I&#146;m not aware of the time on that.</pre>
    <pre>        Q.   All right.  So whatever her state of mind was on May 6th,
        &#146;94 when you first saw her and for the lengthy time thereafter
        that you&#146;ve been telling us about, she had already addressed the
        problem on some basis, in some way, because the action had been
        going for nine months before she came to see you; right?</pre>
    <pre>        A.   You&#146;re telling me that ---</pre>
    <pre>        Q.   That&#146;s what I&#146;m telling.
        
        A.   --- yes.  My re --- my observations are based entirely on
             her in --- internal world, as it were ---</pre>
    <pre>        Q.   Yes.

        A.   --- because that&#146;s what I explored.</pre>
    <pre>        Q.   I guess the reason I put that to you that way is that it
             goes along with what I said at the outset, you were speculating
             to some extent, and you don&#146;t know for sure that she was not
             capable of instructing counsel because de facto, she has
             instructed counsel?</pre>
    <pre>        A.   Right.  It&#146;s just my opinion.
             [Emphasis added.]
               
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  In my view, this cross-examination underscores and explains
why,  in  Dr. Menchions&#146; opinion, Mrs. Bisoukis did not have  the
mental  capacity  to retain counsel in respect to  commencing  an
action against the defendant within three months of her accident.
Dr.  Menchions explained why she had the mental capacity to  make
some decisions, but not others, during this period.  Although she
had  little  difficulty in making decisions based on  suggestions
made  by  others,  such as decisions concerning  aspects  of  her
treatment, she could not on her own make decisions which involved
having  to create or initiate some kind of activity for  herself,
such  as  making  a decision to sue the City.   Indeed,  in  this
regard, as the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Bisoukis indicates,  Dr.
Menchions  was prescient in his &#147;guess&#148; that Mrs. Bisoukis  would
have  required assistance in making the decision, which she  made
about  September  23, 1993, to commence her  action  against  the
City.   Further,  Dr.  Menchions&#146; explanation  for  why  she  was
unable, on her own volition, to make the decision to sue the City
is  significant  as  it  reinforces his testimony-in-chief.   She
could  not  do  so  because of a sense  of  guilt  that  she  was
responsible  for  what occurred, which, as he  explained  in  his
earlier testimony and his reports, is a manifestation of a severe
depression.
[21] Subsequent to Dr. Menchions&#146; examination by counsel, the
trial judge asked him a number of questions, none of which arose
from his testimony.  I would characterize the purpose of the
trial judge&#146;s examination of the witness as an attempt to obtain
the doctor&#146;s concurrence in, or support of, his perception of
Mrs. Bisoukis and the members of her family.  This exchange bears
upon the apprehension of bias issue, which is addressed briefly
at the conclusion of my reasons.
[22] The testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Bisoukis regarding the
circumstances in which they retained a lawyer is relatively
sparse.  When asked when he went to see a lawyer after the
accident, Mr. Bisoukis did not say when he did so.  Instead, he
explained why he did so.  He said it was because a man from Royal
Insurance, who came to their house, said: &#147;You people, you better
go find a lawyer.&#148;  He explained that they had not done so
previously because his &#147;mind was so busy&#148; at that time that they
did not think about going to a lawyer.  After hearing from her
husband what the insurance person had suggested, Mrs. Bisoukis
said &#147;that&#146;s a good idea we have to go to talk to somebody else&#148;.
Mr. Bisoukis said that on the following day a friend recommended
Mr. Zeppieri.  That was how it came about that he and his wife
and daughters went to Mr. Zeppieri&#146;s office.  However, there was
no evidence when the plaintiffs received the suggestion that they
consult a lawyer, or when they went to his office.
[23] When cross-examined, Mr. Bisoukis said that, although after
the accident he believed it was the defendant&#146;s fault because it
had not sanded the highway and he had taken pictures of the area
the day after the accident, he first thought about suing the
defendant when the person from Royal Insurance said that &#147;you
people got a good case [and] you better find a lawyer&#148;.  However,
I attach little weight to this evidence.  His claim against the
City is derivative of his wife&#146;s claim.  The decisions to obtain
the advice of a lawyer about the accident and to sue the City
were hers to make.
[24] As for Mrs. Bisoukis, she did not remember when she first
went to see a lawyer.  When asked why she went to see a lawyer,
she said: &#147;I don&#146;t know.  It&#146;s confusing&#148;.  Then she added:
          </pre>
    <pre>          To  start there was the adjuster  and  I
          really  have stress and worry about  the
          life  and  everything and  he  says,  &#147;I
          can&#146;t do anything, you&#146;d better go see a
          lawyer.&#148;  So, I said, &#147;No, I don&#146;t go to
          a  lawyer.&#148;   And then I think  so,  the
          family discussed with somebody.</pre>
    <pre>Mrs.  Bisoukis remembered explaining the accident to the  lawyer,
but  could  not  recall what she discussed  with  him  about  the
accident.
</pre>
    <pre>Reasons of the trial judge
</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Langdon J. characterized the limitation issue in this  way:
Is  Mrs.  Bisoukis  entitled to an extension of  the  three-month
limitation  period  by  reason of being a &#147;mental  defective&#148;,  a
&#147;mental  incompetent&#148; or &#147;of unsound mind&#148;  for  at  least  three
months  after  the accident within the meaning of s.  47  of  the
Limitations Act?  This section reads:
</pre>
    <pre>      47.  Where a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in
      section 45 or 46 is at the time the cause of action accrues a
      minor, mental defective, mental incompetent or of unsound mind,
      the period within which the action may be brought shall be
      reckoned from the date when such person became of full age or of
      sound mind.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[26]  In  his findings of fact relating to the accident and  Mrs.
Bisoukis&#146; injuries, the trial judge was alert to this issue as he
made  frequent references to what he described as Mrs.  Bisoukis&#146;
mental  capacity  at the time of the accident.  For  example,  he
made  reference to the ambulance attendant&#146;s testimony that  Mrs.
Bisoukis was alert and able to talk when he assisted her  to  the
ambulance  at  the  site of the accident and to  Dr.  McGonigle&#146;s
finding  that  she was alert and oriented and able  to  give  her
consent  to  treatment when she arrived at  the  hospital  twenty
minutes later.  As well, he found that she was able to consent to
surgical treatment on March 20 and April 6.  He went on to find:
</pre>
    <pre>          All  of this evidence suggests that  Ms.
          Bisoukis  was  from the  very  beginning
          conscious,    alert,    oriented     and
          completely   cognizant   of   what   was
          happening   about  her.   There   is   a
          significant  body  of  further  evidence
          which supports that conclusion.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[27]  The &#147;further evidence&#148; consisted of Mrs. Bisoukis&#146;  ability
to  communicate without difficulty to a police officer about  two
hours  after the accident, to recall that she had left her  purse
at  the  scene of the accident and to telephone her husband  from
the  hospital several times each day to inquire about the welfare
of  her  family and her business.  As well, he made reference  to
Mrs. Bouskis&#146; decision to withhold from her daughter Sophia,  who
was  on vacation in Mexico, that she had been injured in a  motor
vehicle accident and to Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; ability to attend, on  her
own,  &#147;a hectic regimen of medical and physiotherapy appointments
in diverse locations&#148; after her release from hospital.
[28] Langdon J. said that there were only two incidents which
might tend to cast doubt on Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; mental capacity at the
time of, and immediately after, the accident. He identified these
incidents as her determination &#147;to deceive her daughters&#148; about
the true cause of her injuries and her refusal to look at her
injury for a long time after the accident. The trial judge
described these incidents as &#147;quirks&#148; and did not view either of
them as demonstrative of a lack of cognitive ability.
[29] Langdon J. engaged in a lengthy dissertation on what he
described as &#147;the unhealthy or dysfunctional familial
relationship which existed before the accident&#148;.  As this
dissertation is one of the focal points in the appellants&#146;
assertion that the trial judge was biased, I will refer to it
again when I deal with that issue.  While the primary focus of
the dissertation appears to relate, properly, to Mrs. Bisoukis&#146;
claim for damages with respect to the psychological injury caused
by the accident, it also appears to form part of the trial
judge&#146;s analysis of the limitation issue.
[30] In considering Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; claim for damages for her
psychological injury, Langdon J. was faced with the defendant&#146;s
assertion that Mrs. Bisoukis did not suffer a severe reactive
depression as a result of the accident.  The defence position,
the trial judge noted, was not based on contrary medical
evidence, but, rather, on evidence of her family doctor, Dr.
Zaremba.  Ultimately, the trial judge found for Mrs. Bisoukis on
this issue, &#147;but on a qualified basis&#148;.  In doing so, he engaged
in an extensive review of Dr. Zaremba&#146;s testimony and the
doctor&#146;s opinion that she had &#147;an obsessive, compulsive
personality (disorder)&#148;.  The trial judge found that at the time
of the accident:
          </pre>
    <pre>          At  this moment Ms. Bisoukis was or  had
          become   the   perfect   &#147;thin   skulled
          plaintiff&#148;.    She  was   a   potential,
          psychological  disaster  looking  for  a
          place to happen.  She had undertaken and
          endured years of overwork and consequent
          &#147;malaise&#148;.  She had not yet reached  the
          breaking   point.    Persons   of   less
          fortitude might have broken or rebelled.
          She  did not. I am satisfied that it was
          this traumatic accident which pushed her
          over the edge. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>He  later  added: &#147;Ms. Bisoukis has demonstrated then  that  this
accident precipitated in her severe reactive depression.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[31]  Toward the conclusion of his reasons, Langdon J. considered
the limitation issue. His reasons respecting this issue are brief
and are reproduced in their entirety:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  conceded that Ms. Bisoukis began
          this  action  September 23,  1993,  more
          than  three months after expiry  of  the
          limitation period provided in s. 284  of
          The  Municipal Act.  She can find relief
          from this limitation only under s. 47 of
          the Limitations Act.  I can grant relief
          only if I can find that Ms. Bisoukis was
          at  the  time of the incident  a  minor,
          mental defective, mental incompetent  or
          of  unsound mind.  She was 53  years  of
          age when the accident occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  I  understand the three  expressions
          used  in  s. 47 of the Limitations  Act,
          there  is not the slightest evidence  to
          suggest that Ms. Bisoukis qualifies  for
          relief from the limitation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  expression mentally incompetent  is
          obviously  a  lift  from  the   previous
          Mental Incompetency Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
          M.  9.  That Act spoke in s.s. 1(a)  and
          (b) of a mentally incompetent person  as
          one,
          </pre>
    <pre>            in  whom there is such a condition  of
            arrested or incomplete development  of
            mind,  whether  arising from  inherent
            causes   or  induced  by  disease   or
            injury  or who is suffering from  such
            a  disorder  of  the  mind,  that  the
            person requires care, supervision  and
            control  for  her protection  and  the
            protection of her property.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In no way could Ms. Bisoukis&#146;s condition
          at  its worst approximate the extent  of
          disability of Justin Clark, in Clarke v.
          Clark,  40 O.R. (2d) 383.  He was  found
          to  be  mentally  competent.  A  similar
          approach  to interpretation  of  similar
          words was taken by the Alberta Court  of
          Appeal  in Kaszyk v. Kloestra et al,  71
          D.L.R.  (3d) 458.  Clearly Ms.  Bisoukis
          bears   the   onus   of   proving    her
          unsoundness  of  mind.  Barnes  v.  Kirk
          [1968] 2 O.R. 213, C.A.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Ms.  Bisoukis was from the  very  moment
          after  the accident in complete  control
          of  her faculties.  There is simply  not
          the least evidence to the contrary.  She
          had  some  quirks of personality  to  be
          sure.   That  is  a vast  distance  from
          being    of   unsound   mind,   mentally
          defective or from suffering from such  a
          mental disorder that she requires  care,
          supervision   and   control   for    her
          protection or for that of her  property.
          If Ms. Bisoukis is mentally incompetent,
          then   a  fortiori,  so  is  her  entire
          family;  she  cared for them.  [Emphasis
          added.]
</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[32]  In  my  opinion,  Langdon J. erred  in  finding  that  Mrs.
Bisoukis had failed to establish the application of s. 47 of  the
Limitations Act. Consequently, he erred in concluding  that  when
she  commenced her action against the City it was barred  by  the
three-month  limitation period stipulated by  s.  284(2)  of  the
Municipal  Act.  Langdon J. did not engage in an analysis  of  s.
47,  nor  did  he  interpret the terms mental  defective,  mental
incompetent and unsound mind.  He focused on whether it had  been
established that she was a mental defective, whereas it  was  her
position that she had established that she was of unsound mind at
the  relevant  time.   He failed to take into  consideration  the
testimony  of  Mr.  and Mrs. Bisoukis and  Dr.  Menchions  as  it
related  to  the  issue of whether Mrs. Bisoukis was  of  unsound
mind.  In my view, the uncontradicted testimony of Dr. Menchions,
as  amplified  by  his  medical reports,  established  that  Mrs.
Bisoukis was of unsound mind within the meaning of s. 47  at  the
time her cause of action against the City accrued.
[33] It is helpful to refer to the history and purpose of s. 47
of the Limitations Act.  As Brooke J.A., on behalf of this court,
pointed out in Papamonolopoulos v. Board of Education for the
City of Toronto (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 1 at 2, s. 47 finds its
origin in an early English statute, An Act for Limitation of
Actions, 1623, 1 Jac., c. 16.  In Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3
S.C.R. 549 at 566, Major J. observed that s. 47 &#147;merely codifies
the common law rules against allowing time to run against those
under a legal disability&#148;.  Section 47 was enacted in 1910 when
the forerunner of the present Act was passed: S.O. 1910, e. 34.
The language of s. 47 has remained unchanged since 1910, except
that the words &#147;an infant&#148; in the earlier Act have been replaced
by the words &#147;a minor&#148;.
[34] Section 47 allows the running of time established by a
limitation period to be postponed if the plaintiff is under a
legal disability &#147;at the time the cause of action accrues&#148;.
Although s. 47 applies to limitation periods fixed for the causes
of action enumerated in ss. 45 and 46 of the Act, it applies both
to limitation periods prescribed by the Act, and by other
statutes where such statutes do not restrict its application:
Murphy v. Welsh, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 1069.  It has been held by the
Divisional Court that s. 47 extends the three month limitation
period fixed by s. 284(2) of the Municipal Act, which governs the
plaintiffs&#146; claims in this appeal: MacKinlay v. Matthews (1993),
12 O.R. (3d) 700.
[35] Section 47 is typical of similar provisions found in
limitations statutes in other provinces.  However,
notwithstanding a recommendation made thirty years ago that the
Ontario Limitations Act &#147;should be replaced with a statute that
is contemporary both in language and substance&#148;, the Act remains
essentially unchanged since its introduction in 1910.  See,
Ontario Law Reform Commission, Report on Limitation of Actions,
1969.  Although s. 47 reads as it did in 1910, similar provisions
in other provinces have been modernized to reflect their purpose
that persons under disability should not be adversely affected by
the running of a limitation period while they remain under
disability.  As well, while no definition of the categories of
disability are found in the Ontario Act, appropriate definitions
of disability are now found in the limitations statutes of many
of the other provinces.
[36] Typical of modern legislation extending limitation periods
are ss. 6 and 7 of the Limitation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 266,
which were considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Novak v.
Bond (1999), 172 D.L.R. (4th) 385.  Section 6 is a codification
and enlargement of the discoverability principle, while s. 7,
like s. 47 of the Ontario Act, postpones the operation of a
limitation period while a person is a minor or under a
disability.
[37] Although the focus of Novak was the interpretation and
application of s. 6(4)(b) of the British Columbia Act, McLachlin
J. provided guidance in the interpretation of limitations
statutes and, in particular, provisions thereof intended to
extend limitation periods which, she observed, are aimed at
treating plaintiffs fairly.  In an observation at p. 410 which
applies to s. 47 of the Ontario Act, she stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Section  7 of the Act allows the running
          of time to be postponed if the plaintiff
          is under a legal disability, a provision
          that   is   also  directed  to  ensuring
          fairness to plaintiffs.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[38]  It is unnecessary to provide a detailed review of McLachlin
J.&#146;s  thorough  discussion  of the interpretation  of  limitation
statutes,  in particular s. 6 of the British Columbia Act,  which
is  found  at  pp.  407-418.   It is sufficient  to  extract  the
approach  which,  in  my  view, should guide  the  court  in  the
interpretation of s. 47 of the Ontario Act, which I take to be as
follows:
       </pre>
    <pre>   §    The cardinal principle of statutory interpretation is that a
        legislative provision should be construed in a way that best
        furthers its objects.
</pre>
    <pre>   §    A provision extending a limitation period should be
        interpreted in a way that best furthers its goals.
       </pre>
    <pre>   §    Although the traditional interpretation of limitation
        statutes has reflected the interests of potential defendants,
        modern interpretation has become more balanced, to take into
        account the plaintiff&#146;s interests, by favouring a more contextual
        view of the parties&#146; actual circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>   §    Thus, the contemporary approach is that when construing a
        limitation statute the plaintiff&#146;s concerns must be considered
        together with the defendant&#146;s need to be protected from stale
        claims brought by dilatory plaintiffs.
       
</pre>
    <pre>[39] Returning to s. 47 of the Limitations Act, the categories of
disability  specified in the section &#150; mental  defective,  mental
incompetent  and  unsound  mind &#150; are not  defined  in  the  Act,
although the section itself, by the use of the term &#147;sound mind&#148;,
appears  to  equate mental defectiveness and mental  incompetence
with  unsoundness  of mind.  We were provided  with  no  Canadian
authority which has defined these terms within the context of  s.
47.
[40] For Mrs. Bisoukis to bring herself within s. 47, she must
establish not only that she was of unsound mind, but also that
she was of unsound mind at the time her cause of action accrued
which in this appeal, as no issue as to discoverability was
raised, must be taken as the day on which the accident occurred &#150;
March 18, 1993.  Both the plain language of s. 47, and relevant
caselaw, requires that the plaintiff be under disability &#147;at the
time the cause of action accrues&#148;: Kaszyk v. Kloetstra, [1976] 5
W.W.R. 205 (Alta. C.A.); Kirby v. Leather, [1965] 2 Q.B. 367
(C.A.).
[41] Of the authorities which I have considered, the only case
which has interpreted &#147;unsound mind&#148; in the context of
legislation similar to s. 47 is Kirby. In that case, the
applicable legislation postponed the operation of the governing
limitation period in circumstances where, on the date a right of
action accrued, the plaintiff was a person under a disability,
namely, of unsound mind.  The plaintiff was rendered unconscious
when seriously injured in an accident which occurred on May 15,
1959.  As a result of the accident, he suffered continuously from
mental illness due to a brain trauma.  In somewhat unusual
circumstances, in the summer of 1963 the plaintiff found his way
to the offices of a firm of solicitors which, after making
inquiries, took up his case and issued a writ in his name on
October 2, 1963.  This was about 17 months after the expiry of
the governing limitation period.
[42] As in the Limitations Act, the words &#147;unsound mind&#148; were not
defined in the applicable legislation.  After noting this, as
well as that &#147;unsound mind&#148; was not defined in many statutes,
Lord Denning, M.R. continued at pp. 383-4:
          </pre>
    <pre>          So the question comes down to this.  Was
          David  Kirby, at and after 8.5  p.m.  on
          May  15,  1959,  of unsound  mind?   The
          words &#147;unsound mind&#148; are not defined  in
          this  statute.   Nor are  they  in  many
          statutes.  It seems to me that the words
          &#147;of  unsound mind&#148; in a statute must  be
          construed  in  relation to the  subject-
          matter   with  which  the   statute   is
          dealing.    In   Whysall   v.   Whysall,
          Phillimore  J.  held  that  the   phrase
          Sunsound mind&#148; in a statute relating  to
          dissolution of marriage must be taken to
          describe  a  mental  state  which  would
          justify  a  dissolution of the  marriage
          tie, that is, mental incapacity such  as
          to  make  it impossible for a couple  to
          live a normal married life together.  So
          here  it  seems to me in this statute  a
          person is &#147;of unsound mind&#148; when he  is,
          by  reason  of mental illness, incapable
          of  managing his affairs in relation  to
          the  accident as a reasonable man  would
          do.  It  is similar to the test where  a
          guardian  ad litem or a next  friend  is
          appointed under the new R.S.C., Ord. 80,
          r. l.  That states that a person under a
          disability means &#147;a person who by reason
          of   mental  disorder  is  incapable  of
          managing  and administering his property
          and  affairs.&#148;  So here it seems  to  me
          that David Kirby was of unsound mind  if
          he  was,  by  reason of mental  illness,
          incapable  of  managing his  affairs  in
          relation  to  this accident.   [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[43] Lord Denning was satisfied that there was ample evidence  to
entitle  the trial judge to hold that Kirby had been  of  unsound
mind  and  under  a disability from the moment  of  the  accident
onwards.  Although Kirby, who was badly mentally affected by  the
accident,  was  able to appreciate (from being  told  by  others)
something  of what had happened to him, the psychiatric  evidence
was that he could not concentrate on it long enough to appreciate
the nature and extent of any claim he might have.
[44] In my view, Lord Denning&#146;s interpretation of &#147;unsound mind&#148;
in comparable English legislation should be applied in
interpreting &#147;unsound mind&#148; in s. 47 of the Limitations Act.  It
accords with the approach derived from Novak to guide the court
in interpreting a provision like s. 47, intended to extend the
running of a limitation period where the prospective plaintiff is
under a disability.  It takes a purposive approach, which best
furthers the goals of the legislation by according fairness to
the prospective plaintiff in the context of the circumstances in
which the plaintiff finds himself or herself.  Thus, applying
Kirby, a person is of unsound mind within the meaning of s. 47
when he or she, by reason of mental illness, is incapable of
managing his or her affairs as a reasonable person would do in
relation to the incident, or event, which entitles the person to
bring an action.
[45] I am satisfied that there was ample evidence from Dr.
Menchions to establish that Mrs. Bisoukis was of unsound mind at
the date her cause of action accrued, March 18, 1993, and that
she continued to be of unsound mind well beyond the date she
commenced her action against the City of Brampton.
[46] As I have reviewed Dr. Menchions&#146; evidence in considerable
detail, I need refer only to his uncontradicted opinion that she
became acutely depressed right after the accident and that as a
result, of her own volition, she lacked the ability to make a
decision to retain a lawyer with respect to her accident.  His
opinion was supported by the fact that she did not consult a
lawyer until it was suggested that she do so by the
representative of Royal Insurance.  Indeed, more than a year
after the accident, when she was first assessed by Dr. Menchions,
Mrs. Bisoukis continued to be acutely depressed.
[47] In my view, it follows that on the date of the accident Mrs.
Bisoukis was of unsound mind because she was, on that day, by
reason of mental illness, incapable of managing her affairs in
relation to the accident as a reasonable person would do, a
condition which was continuing when she commenced her claim
against the City.  Accordingly, her claim was not barred by s.
284(2) of the Municipal Act.
[48] Had Langdon J. engaged in a proper analysis of s. 47 of the
Limitations Act instead of focusing on whether the Mrs. Bisoukis
was a mental defective, when it was her position that she was of
unsound mind, and had he not ignored Dr. Menchioins&#146; opinion, he
should have reached the correct result.  Rather, he placed undue
emphasis on Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; capacity to do routine things, such as
communicating information to police officers and doctors and
keeping in touch with her business and family, and he disregarded
Dr. Menchions&#146; testimony which correctly focused on her ability
to manage her legal affairs.  A person&#146;s ability to function on a
day-to-day basis and make the decisions required in daily life
may have some evidentiary value, but it is not determinative of
that person&#146;s capacity to manage her affairs in relation to the
accident.  The trial judge erred in equating the two.
[49] Indeed, the trial judge did not appear to appreciate what is
involved in bringing an action, the capacity to do so being
central to the application of s. 47.  The act of bringing an
action requires that a person make several informed decisions
arising out of a complex of facts which form the basis for a
potential cause of action.  Such facts would include the
existence of a duty owed to the person by the prospective
defendant and a breach of that duty causing injury, damage or
loss.  For a person&#146;s decision to commence an action to be
informed, he or she will require the advice of competent persons,
such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.  As well, a decision to
commence a lawsuit must be informed by a competent legal
assessment of its chances of success and the range of recoverable
damages, and whether these factors justify the expenditure
involved, including the cost to the plaintiff if the action
should fail.  None of these factors was considered by the trial
judge.  Yet they underscore why it would be unfair to force a
person under a disability to bring an action when prevented by
her disability of managing her legal affairs.  The following
observation of McLachlin J., in the context of applying s.
6(4)(b) of the British Columbia Act in Novak, at p. 415, applies,
as well, to s. 47 of the Ontario Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Litigation  is  never a  process  to  be
          embarked  upon casually and sometimes  a
          plaintiff&#146;s individual circumstances and
          interests may mean that he or she cannot
          reasonably bring an action at  the  time
          it  first  materializes.  This  approach
          makes  good  policy sense.  To  force  a
          plaintiff  to sue without having  regard
          to  his or her own circumstances may  be
          unfair  to  the plaintiff and  may  also
          disserve the defendant by forcing him or
          her to meet an action pressed into court
          prematurely:  see generally  B.  Legate,
          &#147;Limitation    Periods    in     Medical
          Negligence     Actions    Post-Peixeiro&#148;
          (1998), 20 Advocates&#146;Q. 326, at p. 334.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[50]  Before leaving this ground of appeal, I would refer to  two
findings that Langdon J. made in respect to liability and damages
which  appear  to be at odds with his finding on  the  limitation
issue.   As  I indicated previously, he was satisfied that  &#147;this
traumatic  accident &#133; pushed [Mrs. Bisoukis] over the edge&#148;  with
respect to her psychological injury.  He found, as well, that she
had  &#147;demonstrated  &#133; that this accident precipitated  in  her  a
severe reactive depression&#148;.  In assessing her general damages at
$75,000,  he  allocated  $35,000 for her  physical  injuries  and
$40,000   &#147;for   the  ongoing  but  slowing  improving   reactive
depression&#148;.  These findings could have been based  only  on  the
testimony  of Dr. Menchions.  However, it was overlooked  by  the
trial judge in his findings with respect to the limitation issue.
[51] There is an additional observation to make which bears on
the unfairness of an interpretation of s. 47 which precludes Mrs.
Bisoukis from asserting her claim against the City.  In a
relative sense, she was not dilatory in issuing her claim.  Three
months is one of the briefest limitation periods to be found in
the Ontario statutes.  She commenced her action a little more
than six months after the accident.  Six months would also
represent a brief limitation period, particularly when measured
against the limitation periods in ss. 45 and 46 of the
Limitations Act.  The City has not said it was prejudiced in
defending Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; claim because she was three months late
in asserting it.  Indeed, the City could scarcely do so.  My
review of the transcript of the trial shows that the City had no
difficulty in presenting a thorough defence.
[52] On the basis of the foregoing analysis, I would give effect
to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE LIABILITY ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>The facts
</pre>
    <pre>[53] The accident occurred on McVean Road while Mrs. Bisoukis was
driving  home  from work on the evening of March 18,  1993.   All
that  she  was  able  to recall was that while  travelling  north
within  the posted speed limit of 70 kilometres per hour her  car
slid  on  black  ice, was thrown across the road,  flipped  three
times  and  came  to rest in a field.  McVean Road  is  a  rather
heavily  trafficked north-south access road located in the  rural
part of the City of Brampton.
[54] The location of the accident was immediately south of the
intersection of the driveway to the Robinson farm and McVean
Road.  There is a drainage ditch which runs parallel to McVean
Road and flows through a culvert that passes under the driveway.
At an unknown time prior to the accident, the culvert had frozen
causing the water in the ditch to build up, overflow and flood
McVean Road. As the result of a steady drop in temperature from
plus 3.3º C on March 17 to minus 16.1º C during the night of
March 17-18, the water froze and became black ice.  On March 18
the temperature was well below freezing all day.  Mrs. Bisoukis
encountered the black ice and her car went out of control.
[55] To the investigating officer, Constable Frape, who arrived
at the scene shortly after the accident, the black ice had
produced a dangerous situation.  It covered both the northbound
and southbound lanes of McVean Road.  He saw no evidence that the
road had been recently sanded or salted.  He contacted the City
of Brampton to attend to the problem and closed the road to
prevent further accidents.  Soon after Constable Frape&#146;s call to
the City, it dispatched a crew to thaw the culvert and to place a
sand/salt mix on the ice. The crew also found a second frozen
culvert, which it thawed. On the morning following the accident,
the City again sanded the road.
[56] To Constable Frape &#147;it appeared that the day&#146;s water run-off
had spilled out to the roadway and frozen&#148;.  In his experience,
this was a common occurrence during the month of March on roads
in the rural area of the City where McVean Road is located.  He
explained that during that time of the year black ice is created
by thawing and freezing conditions.  Indeed, he had on other
occasions investigated similar accidents on McVean Road which had
occurred during the same season of the year.  When he encountered
what he called a &#147;thaw/freeze problem&#148; while on patrol,  he would
notify the City to sand the area involved.
[57] As it relates to the appellants&#146; attack on the trial judge&#146;s
finding that Mrs. Bisoukis was contributorily negligent because
she was driving too fast, I note that Constable Frape indicated
that he interviewed her at the hospital a few hours after the
accident and made notes of the interview.  He had no note that
Mrs. Bisoukis was driving too quickly.  Had she mentioned
excessive speed, he would have made a note of it.  From his
investigation, &#147;there appeared to be nothing untoward with regard
to her driving&#148;.  He added: &#147;The accident appeared, from my
experience, to have occurred as a result of the condition of the
roadway at that location.&#148;
[58] Three employees of the City of Brampton testified with
regard to this incident, the City&#146;s system of inspecting roads
and their awareness of problems created by the thaw/freeze cycle
that typically occurred in the spring in the rural areas of the
City such as the area through which McVean Road runs.  Mr.
Baulne, an employee of twenty years, had the responsibility of
patrolling the area in which McVean Road is located.  Mr.
Browning, an employee of thirty-one years, was the foreman with
the Public Works Department responsible for making repairs to
roads and culverts in the same area.  Mr. Pimental was the
operations co-ordinator of the Public Works Department
responsible for the maintenance of the City&#146;s road system.  Of
the three, only Mr. Pimental testified for the City.  Indeed, he
was the only witness called for the defence.
[59] The system of road inspection which the City had in place in
March, 1993, was based on the division of the City into
quadrants.  The two quadrants located east of Highway 410 were
the responsibility of Mr. Baulne, and the two quadrants west of
Highway 410 were the responsibility of another inspector.  They
were the only inspectors employed by the City.  It was their job
to patrol the roads in their respective areas.  If they
encountered a situation which required maintenance, they
contacted the Public Works Department which was expected to deal
with the situation.  As well, the inspectors were frequently
asked by the Department to respond to problems which had been
reported by the police, as in this appeal, by a motorist, or by a
person living in the area.  Because of the size of the area to be
patrolled and the frequency of the need to respond to particular
problems as they were reported, Mr. Baulne required from two to
two and a half weeks to patrol his entire area.  This meant that
he was able to patrol McVean Road on the average of about twice a
month.
[60] In regard to the frequency with which Mr. Baulne was able to
patrol McVean Road during the thaw/freeze cycle that occurred in
March, all three of the City&#146;s employees were aware that during
this period of the year it was not unusual that culverts would
become frozen, resulting in water overflowing drainage ditches
and freezing on the road surface.  For example, Mr. Baulne stated
that when the weather forecast predicted the temperature was to
drop below freezing, as in this appeal, that he, and others who
patrol the roads, were required &#147;to look for the road to freeze
up&#148;.  Mr. Browning, who said that there were about twenty
culverts on the two kilometre stretch of McVean Road where the
accident took place, was aware that ponding occurred on that road
during &#147;freeze/thaw cycles&#148;.  He added that the problem of
ponding and freezing was not limited to McVean Road, but involved
&#147;the entire country&#148;, meaning the rural area of the City.
[61] Mr. Pimental&#146;s testimony, in my view, requires added
consideration.  He testified that during the thaw/freeze cycle
road inspectors were required to &#147;look for any potential ice on
the road conditions&#148; that required attention, adding that &#147;it&#146;s
our job to go out there and get to them as quickly as possible
once we&#146;re aware of them&#148;.  Moreover, he was aware, as in this
appeal, that culverts might freeze, resulting in highway
flooding. When informed of a frozen culvert, the City would send
a team to thaw it of ice.  He testified that, although the City
had no record of the culvert under the Robinson driveway having
frozen on a previous occasion, its records disclosed that there
had been frozen culverts at other locations on McVean Road.   He
added that it was the City&#146;s practice to spread a sand/salt mix
on rural roads if there was &#147;the possibility of a thaw cycle
where there&#146;s water on the road&#148; and when &#147;there had been rain on
the road surface and there&#146;s a possibility that the temperature
will drop in the evening&#148;.
[62] I find Mr. Pimental&#146;s evasiveness, when cross-examined in
respect to the City&#146;s responsibility at the time of thaw/freeze
conditions to inspect roads, such as McVean Road, where flooding
and icing conditions were caused by frozen culverts, to be
significant.  Although not well-phrased, what counsel was
attempting to get Mr. Pimental to acknowledge was the particular
need to inspect these roads on March 18, when a deep freeze had
occurred following two days of precipitation and thawing.
Ultimately, Mr. Pimental responded: &#147;We can&#146;t be everywhere all
the time&#148;.
[63] As for McVean Road, it was patrolled for flooding on March
16 by Mr. Baulne as there was a combination of rain and snow that
day.  He found no evidence of flooding.  Although he was on duty
on March 17, he did not patrol McVean Road as he was unable to
patrol it everyday.  However, on that day he was required to
remove ice from a catch basin and to clear a frozen culvert.  Mr.
Baulne did not work on March 18 as he was sick  and was not
replaced by another employee.  Nobody patrolled McVean Road, or
any other road east of Highway 410, on that day.
[64] The records of the City indicated that a sand/salt mix were
spread on the roads in the area, including McVean Road, on March
17, but not on March 18.  It was not until after the accident had
been reported that McVean Road was sanded and the culvert at the
Robinson farm was thawed, as well as another culvert located
nearby.</pre>
    <pre>Reasons of the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>[65]  Langdon J. found that the cause of the black  ice  was  the
frozen culvert, resulting in the drainage ditch overflowing  onto
the roadway where the water &#147;froze creating a hazardous condition
of  sudden and unexpected ice&#148;.  He said: &#147;This is not a  new  or
unexpected phenomenon.  It occurs frequently&#148;.  He then  referred
to  the  practice of the City of responding to this condition  by
thawing frozen culverts.
[66] In the trial judge&#146;s view, the City&#146;s problem in dealing
with frozen culverts was their &#147;entirely random nature&#148;, there
being &#147;literally thousands of driveways in large rural areas
[that] connect to highways over culverts&#148;.   I note there was no
evidence to support this finding.  He then referred to the City&#146;s
inspection programme, and Mr. Baulne&#146;s role in that programme,
much as I have described.
[67] In the course of his review of the evidence, the trial judge
said: &#147;Constable Frape obviously suspected excessive speed on the
part of the driver, but Ms. Bisoukis did not admit to such
speed.&#148;  Later he added:  &#147;I must say that the severity of this
one car accident, coupled with the distance the auto travelled
after losing control on the ice, suggests to me very strongly
that Ms. Bisoukis was travelling at a somewhat excessive rate of
speed when she hit the ice patch.&#148;
[68] Langdon J. stated that he was &#147;unable to make any findings
of negligence on the part of the City&#148; for the following reasons:
</pre>
    <pre>          In  a  perfect  world, the  City  might,
          during  all  seasons of thaw and  freeze
          cycles,  post a workman at  the  end  of
          every  driveway which crosses the  ditch
          beside  the  highway  by  means   of   a
          culvert.   In  the real world  any  such
          notion   is   instantly   rejected    as
          prohibitively   costly,   wasteful   and
          unrealistic.   Absent  any  history   of
          chronic   flooding  in   the   area   in
          question,  I  am at a loss to  see  what
          more  the City could have done  than  it
          did.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  had  in place a perfectly reasonable
          system  of inspection manned by  capable
          employees as far as any one could  judge
          by  their testimony.  This road would be
          inspected  visually at least once  every
          14  to  18  days.  As an arterial  road,
          this   one   might  even   get   further
          attention.   It had been checked  within
          the last two or three days.  There is no
          evidence   that  anything  unusual   was
          found.  The condition which developed is
          one  which can occur anywhere and within
          a  very short time.  The City really has
          no alternative but to hope to catch some
          such  conditions  by  means  of  routine
          inspections  when they occur;  otherwise
          it  must  await them being  reported  by
          concerned motorists or police.  In  this
          case, the City responded promptly to the
          report and in an appropriate manner.  It
          might  be  criticized  for  failure   to
          follow  through because of  the  ponding
          which  had occurred the next day  &#150;  but
          that  water  had  not  yet  frozen  when
          photographed.   Any negligence  in  this
          regard  was without consequence; it  did
          not    contribute   to   Ms.   Bouskis&#146;s
          accident.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In   short   I   find  no  evidence   of
          negligence  or  want of repair  of  this
          road which caused or contributed to  the
          accident.   If  I err in  this  finding,
          then  I would assess Ms. Bisoukis to  be
          30%  at  fault  for  travelling  at   an
          excessive rate of speed at the  time  of
          the  incident for the reasons  I  stated
          earlier.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[69]  Subsequently, in considering the issue of costs, the  trial
judge  added:  &#147;Ms. Bisoukis was the victim of an accident  which
was almost inevitable; it could not likely have been prevented by
the exercise of reasonable care.&#148; [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[70] Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; claim is based on the failure of the City  to
perform its statutory duty under s. 284(1) of the Municipal  Act,
which  was subsequently repealed and replaced by S.O. 1996, c.32,
s.  54(1).   As  it read at the time of the accident,  s.  284(1)
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          284.-(1)  Every highway and every bridge
          shall   be   kept  in  repair   by   the
          corporation  the council  of  which  has
          jurisdiction over it or upon  which  the
          duty  of repairing it is imposed by this
          Act   and,  in  case  of  default,   the
          corporation,  subject to the  Negligence
          Act, is liable for all damages sustained
          by any person by reason of such default.
</pre>
    <pre>This provision not only imposes a duty on a municipal corporation
to  keep  its highways in repair, it also imposes civil liability
on a municipality whose default in its duty results in damages to
an  individual.  Generally speaking, the only issue present in  a
claim  based  on  s.  284(1) is whether the municipality  was  in
breach of the duty which it owed to the injured party.</pre>
    <pre>[71] It is the appellants&#146; position that there was a condition of
non-repair  on  McVean Road which caused the accident,  and  that
Langdon J. erred in finding that the road was in good repair,  as
well as in finding that the City had in place a reasonable system
of  road  inspection.  I agree with the appellants&#146; position  and
conclude that the trial judge erred in finding that the City  was
not in breach of its duty to keep the McVean Road in repair.
[72] In my view, in the circumstances of this appeal, there are
two reasons why this court is entitled to interfere with the
findings of the trial judge and reach its own finding that the
City was in breach of its duty to keep McVean Road in repair. The
first reason is that the trial judge did not engage in the
analysis required where there is a claim under s. 284(1) of the
Act. The second reason is the trial judge&#146;s findings that McVean
Road was in good repair and that the City had in place a
reasonable system of inspection.
[73] In Montani v. Matthews (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 257, this court
considered the approach required by the court in a claim for
damages arising out of the failure of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications to perform its duty to keep a
bridge in repair imposed by s. 33(1) of the Public Transportation
and Highway Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 50.  This duty,
which applies to provincial highways, is the same as the duty
imposed on municipalities in respect to municipal highways by s.
284(1) of the Municipal Act.
[74] In Montani, the plaintiff was injured when the car in which
she was a passenger lost control on encountering an accumulation
of black ice on a bridge. The trial judge found that the
formation of black ice was a virtual certainty, and having regard
to the history of the bridge and the particular conditions on the
day in question, that the Ministry knew, or should have known, of
this.  As such, the bridge constituted a special and highly
dangerous situation and the Ministry&#146;s failure to take the
remedial step of salting and sanding the ice amounted to a breach
of its statutory duty to keep the bridge in repair.  The
Ministry&#146;s appeal to this court was dismissed for the reasons
delivered by Moldaver J.A., writing for the majority.
[75] Before turning to the reasons of Moldaver J.A., it is useful
to refer to the reasons of Dickson J., on behalf of the majority,
in Millette v. Coté, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 595, in which an accident
was caused by ice developing on a highway in a location where
this condition occurred regularly in February and March when the
sun would melt the snow, which would freeze at night and become
treacherously slippery.  The trial judge found that this
condition was known, or ought to have been known, to employees of
the Department of Highways whose duty it was to keep the highway
in repair and, therefore, that the stretch of highway in question
was not in good repair and &#147;called for special attention by the
highway authorities&#148;.  On the basis of the weather conditions at
the time, he found that the highway authorities should have known
that in the time before the accident a dangerous situation must
have been developing.
[76] At pp. 603-4, Dickson J. stated the test to be applied in
determining whether a highway authority has breached its duty to
keep a highway in repair:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Imposition of some measure of  liability
          upon  the Minister of Highways does  not
          import  recognition of any general  duty
          to salt or sand highways, failure in the
          discharge  of  which  would  expose  the
          Minister   to  civil  claims.   Recovery
          against the Minister in this case  rests
          upon  narrower ground, characterized  by
          Aylesworth J.A., in the Court of  Appeal
          as:
          </pre>
    <pre>            &#133;   a   highly  special   dangerous
            situation at a certain location  in
            the  highway  which  otherwise,  to
            persons reasonably using the  same,
            was  quite passable and usable  for
            traffic.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I agree with the statement of Aylesworth
          J.A. that
          </pre>
    <pre>           In  the  absence of any evidence  or
           explanation   from  the   Department
           with   respect  to  that   dangerous
           special  situation, and in  view  of
           the  evidence actually adduced  that
           the  police  knew of  the  situation
           approximately two hours  before  the
           regrettable  accident  involved   in
           these   proceedings  occurred   and,
           further, that the police were  aware
           that     day,    through    previous
           experience    in   patrolling    the
           highway,     that    the     weather
           conditions were such as most  likely
           to  bring  about at this  particular
           location    the   actual   dangerous
           situation which indeed resulted,  we
           conclude  that  the  same  knowledge
           was   available  to  the  Department
           itself  from  any reasonable  system
           of  patrol or supervision  and  that
           the  department is chargeable in law
           with  a  failure  to  maintain   the
           highway  &#150; at the dangerous point  &#150;
           within   the   provisions   of   the
           Highway  Improvement  Act  in   that
           regard; &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  duty  of care which rests upon  the
          Minister   of  Highways  admittedly   is
          confined   to   reasonably   foreseeable
          dangers,  the broad general  test  being
          that   enunciated  by  this   Court   in
          University Hospital Board v. Lepine,  at
          p.  579,  &#147;whether  a reasonable  person
          should   have  anticipated   that   what
          happened  might be a natural  result  of
          that  act  or omission&#148;. If one  applies
          that  test  to  the present  case,  what
          happened here was a series of collisions
          between  motor vehicles.   The  impugned
          act  or  omission lay in  permitting  to
          continue  for some hours a &#147;treacherous,
          slippery  and  dangerous&#148; icy  condition
          upon  a  short stretch of much-travelled
          highway with a known tendency to ice up.
          It  would  seem to me that a  reasonable
          person,  familiar with Canadian winters,
          should   have  anticipated   a   vehicle
          collision or collisions as the  natural,
          and  indeed probable, result of  such  a
          condition of manifest danger.  It is not
          necessary that one foresee the  &#147;precise
          concatenation of events&#148;; it  is  enough
          to fix liability if one can foresee in a
          general  way  the class or character  of
          injury which occurred. [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[77]  In Montani, Moldaver J.A. described the Ministry&#146;s duty  in
respect to the repair of highways at p. 267:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In    accordance   with   the   existing
          jurisprudence, the Ministry is  required
          to  take remedial steps when it knows or
          ought  to  know of a special and  highly
          dangerous   situation   at   a   certain
          location  on the highway that creates  a
          risk  of  serious and imminent  harm  to
          motorists.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[78] At p. 270, Moldaver J.A. went on to elaborate:
          </pre>
    <pre>          But   what  is  a  special  and   highly
          dangerous condition?  More particularly,
          in  cases  such as this, is it necessary
          for  the  ice  to  have actually  formed
          before it can be said that a special and
          highly  dangerous condition  exists?   I
          think  not.   In McAlpine  v.  Mahovlich
          (1979),  9 C.C.L.T. 241 (Ont.  C.A.),  a
          case  decided several years after  Coté,
          this court reaffirmed the principles  it
          had  formulated in Landriault v.  Pinard
          (1976),  1  C.C.L.T.  216  (Ont.  C.A.),
          namely:
          </pre>
    <pre>          -    that a highway may be found to be in
	       a state of non-repair when a condition 
	       exists that could be remedied by applying
	       sand or salt; and</pre>
    <pre>          -    that is a question of fact in each case
	       whether a condition of non-repair exists.</pre>
    <pre>          Mindful  of  Coté, supra, the  court  in
          McAlpine  also stressed that,  in  order
          for  there  to  be a condition  of  non-
          repair,  &#147;a  &#145;highly special,  dangerous
          situation [must be found to exist] at  a
          certain  location of the  highway  which
          otherwise  to  persons reasonably  using
          the  same  would be quite  passable  and
          usable for traffic&#146;&#148; (p. 247).</pre>
    <pre>[79]  At  p.  270 Moldaver J.A. said that because the bridge  had
proved  to  be  extremely  dangerous  in  the  past  due  to  its
propensity  to  ice  over, this presented a  special  and  highly
dangerous situation which &#147;required an added measure of attention
on  the  Ministry&#146;s part&#148;.  At p. 272, he added  that  the  trial
judge&#146;s  finding that it was a virtual certainty that  black  ice
would  form on the bridge created a special and highly  dangerous
situation.   He  concluded: &#147;In my opinion, as a matter  of  law,
there  is no need to insist on the actual formation of black  ice
as a condition precedent to a finding of non-repair.&#148;
[80] In my view, Langdon J. failed to apply a proper analysis in
considering whether the City was liable.  As the authorities
indicate, he was required to determine whether McVean Road was in
a state of non-repair.  If so, he was required to ask himself
whether the tendency of culverts on McVean Road to freeze during
thaw/freeze cycles, causing the road to flood and black ice to
form, created, or had the potential to create, a special and
highly dangerous situation which the City knew, or ought to have
known, required its special attention.  If the evidence pointed
to an affirmative answer, then he was required to determine
whether the City had established that it had taken reasonable
steps to prevent the formation of the black ice which was the
cause of Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; injuries.
[81] In analyzing the trial judge&#146;s reasons, in the final
paragraph which is quoted in paragraph 68, he found that the road
was in good repair.  On the basis of this finding, strictly
speaking, it was unnecessary for him to consider whether the City
had acted reasonably in the circumstances.  He was required to do
so only if he had found there to be a condition of non-repair.
However, he did so, focusing on whether the City was negligent.
[82] In his analysis of whether the City was negligent, he
indicated that during a thaw/freeze cycle the City might post a
workman at the end of every driveway that passes over a culvert.
This was not the position taken by the appellants.  He referred
to the absence of chronic flooding in the area in question.  This
finding was contrary to the evidence of the City&#146;s three
employees who were aware of the tendency of culverts on McVean
Road to freeze during thaw/freeze cycles.  He said that the
condition which developed at the Robinson farm could occur
anywhere and within a very short time.  While it was true that
frozen culverts occurred in many locations, the evidence
suggested that this culvert did not freeze within a very short
time.  Rather, the evidence was that this thaw/freeze cycle
occurred  during a two-day period &#150; March 17 and 18.
[83] My extensive review of the evidence relating to this issue
was driven by the similarity of the facts of this appeal to those
in Montani and Coté.  In my view, it is clear from the evidence
of the three City employees that they were aware that at the time
of a thaw/freeze cycle there was a tendency for the culverts
along the stretch of McVean Road where the accident occurred to
freeze, causing the road to flood and black ice to form.
Although it is true that this condition had apparently not
occurred at the Robinson farm where the accident took place, the
City&#146;s records indicated that the condition had occurred in
proximity to other culverts on McVean Road.  Indeed, on the night
of the accident, the City&#146;s work crew found another frozen
culvert on McVean Road. As Dickson J. pointed out in Coté, it was
not necessary for the City to foresee that Robinson&#146;s culvert
would freeze.  It was enough for the City to foresee that
culverts on McVean Road had the tendency to freeze in conditions
similar to those of March 16, 17 and 18.
[84] This condition created a risk of serious and imminent harm
to motorists using McVean Road.  It is to be recalled that when
Constable Frape attended the scene, he considered the situation
to be so dangerous that he closed the road.  As well, as Moldaver
J.A. decided in Montani, there was no need to insist on the
actual formation of black ice as a condition precedent to a
finding of non-repair.  It was sufficient, as the evidence in
this appeal established, that the thaw of March 16 and 17
followed by a deep freeze on March 17-18 made it extremely likely
that one, or more, culverts would freeze and black ice would
form.  In my view, this presented a special and highly dangerous
situation which required an added measure of attention on the
part of the City.  However, the City paid no attention whatsoever
to McVean Road on March 18.  The employee assigned to inspect
McVean Road was off sick that day, and nobody was designated to
replace him.  I am satisfied that a timely inspection on March 18
would have resulted in appropriate remedial steps being taken
prior to the accident, which occurred in the evening.
[85] In my view, the evidence before Langdon J. did not support
his finding that the City had in place a perfectly reasonable
system of inspection.  It may have been reasonable at other times
of the year to inspect McVean Road on the average of twice a
month, but not during a thaw/freeze cycle known to produce frozen
culverts and black ice.  The issue before the trial judge was
whether the City&#146;s inspection system was adequate in light of the
climatic conditions of March 16, 17 and 18 and the City&#146;s
knowledge of the tendency of the culverts along McVean Road to
freeze in such conditions, resulting in the formation of black
ice and the causation of dangerous driving conditions.
[86] As I have mentioned, not only was the inspector assigned to
McVean Road absent on March 18, but nobody was designated to
replace him.  Contrary to the trial judge&#146;s inability &#147;to see
what more the City could have done than it did&#148;, it would not
have been a difficult matter for it to assign another employee to
inspect McVean Road.  The City provided no evidence that it could
not do so.  Indeed, it provided no explanation why it had not
inspected McVean Road on March 18.  It follows that I cannot
agree with the trial judge&#146;s finding that the City had no
alternative &#147;but to hope to catch some such conditions by means
of routine [bi-monthly] inspections&#148;, or otherwise wait for the
conditions to be reported by a motorist or the police.
[87] I am satisfied from my review of the evidence that the trial
judge&#146;s findings that McVean Road was in good repair and that the
City had in place a perfectly reasonable inspection programme are
not only unsupported by the evidence, but are contrary to the
evidence.  Consequently, this court is entitled to interfere with
his findings, and to substitute its own findings of fact for that
of the trial judge: Re: Equity Waste Management of Canada and
Corporation of the Town of Halton Hills (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321
(C.A.).
[88] In my view, the City is liable for the non-repair of McVean
Road which caused Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; injuries for the following
reasons:

     §  It permitted a condition of non-repair to occur, and to
        remain, on McVean Road.
       </pre>
    <pre>     §  It knew of the propensity of culverts on McVean Road to
        freeze, causing the road to flood and black ice to form during a
        thaw/freeze cycle such as occurred on March 16, 17 and 18, 1993.
       </pre>
    <pre>     §  It failed to perform any inspection of McVean Road on March
        18, 1993.
       </pre>
    <pre>     §  It failed to take reasonable steps to reduce the risk of
        danger to motorists resulting from the formation of black ice, or
        to warn the public regarding the danger.</pre>
    <pre>[89] Consequently, I would give effect to this ground of appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</pre>
    <pre>[90]  The  trial judge found that Mrs. Bisoukis was 30% at  fault
for  causing  the  accident  because she  was  travelling  at  an
excessive  rate  of speed.  It would appear that  he  based  this
finding on Constable Frape&#146;s suspicion that she was driving at an
excessive  rate of speed, and his own speculation  that  she  was
driving too fast.
[91] However, Constable Frape did not express any belief about
the speed at which the car was driven.  He did not suspect that
she was driving at an excessive speed.  He found nothing untoward
about her driving.  He was of the opinion that the accident was
caused by the condition of the road.  As well, he testified that
Mrs. Bisoukis told him that she was travelling within the speed
limit.  There was simply no evidence to support a finding of
contributory negligence, nor was it appropriate for the trial
judge to base this finding on his speculation that she was
driving too fast.
[92] I would, therefore, give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>APPREHENSION OF BIAS</pre>
    <pre>[93]  As  I have reached the conclusion that the appeal  must  be
allowed   and  judgment  entered  for  the  appellants,   it   is
unnecessary to deal with this ground of appeal which, if it  were
to  succeed,  would  result  in the  ordering  of  a  new  trial.
However,  I  cannot  close these reasons  without  commenting  on
certain  passages  in  Langdon  J.&#146;s  reasons  for  judgment  and
interjections which he made throughout the trial.  In doing so, I
do  not  intend to review all of the complaints raised by counsel
for  the  appellants.  Nor is it necessary to  conclude  whether,
taken  separately or cumulatively, that they reveal a  reasonable
apprehension of bias.
[94] There are passages in the trial judge&#146;s reasons where he
uses hyperbole to make his point.  Unfortunately, he does so in a
way which was potentially quite hurtful to the Bisoukis family.
I have in mind his description of the family home as a &#147;turkey&#148;
and the passage in which he suggests that Mrs. Bisoukis was
either a &#147;superwoman or a slave.&#148;  Hyperbole is best excluded
from the rhetoric of judges.
[95] I also think that the trial judge&#146;s musings that the two
Bisoukis daughters might be &#147;better persons&#148; because the accident
suffered by their mother would require them to look after
themselves rather than depend on her were irrelevant to the trial
judge&#146;s task and had no place in his reasons.  Those comments
could also cause unnecessary anguish to the Bisoukis family.
[96] Although the trial judge&#146;s references to the family dynamics
and the financial pressure caused by maintaining the large home
were relevant to the issue of Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; damages, as was her
relationship with her family, and it was necessary for the trial
judge to make findings of fact on these matters, a more sensitive
approach to them was desirable.  The sarcasm with which Langdon
J. addressed these, and other matters, is best avoided by judges.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[97]  Langdon  J.  assessed  Mrs. Bisoukis&#146;  general  damages  at
$75,000.   As  the  parties agreed that her loss  of  income  was
$140,369.45,  he  assessed her entire damages in  the  amount  of
$215,369.45, plus pre-judgment interest. In addition, he assessed
Mrs. Bisoukis&#146; damages at $7,500, and those of Sophia Bisoukis at
$5,000.   There is no appeal from the assessment of damages.   As
the  plaintiffs claimed pre-judgment interest in accordance  with
ss. 127 and 128 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, C. 43,
they  are  entitled  to  pre-judgment interest  on  the  assessed
damages,  as well as post-judgment interest under s. 129  of  the
Act.
[98] For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside
the trial judgment, enter judgment for the appellants in the
amounts assessed by the trial judge together with pre-judgment
and post-judgment interest and award the appellants their costs
of the trial and the appeal.
