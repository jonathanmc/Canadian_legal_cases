      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice A. W.
Maloney dated November 16, 1998
</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant Bernard Blank appeals from an order dismissing
his motion for leave to further amend his amended statement of
claim and from two summary judgments dismissing his action
against all respondents and granting 1224850 Ontario Limited
judgment on its counterclaim. The order and the two judgments
were made by Maloney J. on November 16, 1998.
[2]  We do not find it necessary to decide whether the motions
judge erred in refusing to grant the appellant’s motion to
further amend his statement of claim because, in our view, the
appellant’s claim, even if amended as proposed, cannot succeed at
trial. The failure of the appellant to comply with the due
diligence term of the agreement is determinative of the action
and no genuine issue is raised on the issue of due diligence. The
consequences flowing from the appellant’s breach of this term
would not be affected by the proposed amendment to the statement
of claim.
[3]  The appellant’s breach of the due diligence term of the
agreement entitled the respondent corporation to invoke paragraph
5.2 of the agreement. Paragraph 5.2 of the agreement entitled the
respondent corporation to notify the appellant that it did not
wish to proceed with the transaction and to direct the respondent
trustees to return any deposit of $50,000 to it. Paragraph 5.2
also provided that the agreement would be null and void and, as a
result of that provision, the respondent corporation was also
entitled to the return of the initial $10,000 deposit.
[4]  Consequently, it is our view that the motions judge was
correct in granting the two summary judgments and the question of
the amendment of the pleading becomes moot.
[5]  The appeals are dismissed with costs in the amount of $2,000
payable to the corporate respondent and $1,500 to the other
respondents.
