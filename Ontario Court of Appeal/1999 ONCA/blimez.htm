    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of McCombs J. dated May 27, 1997.

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the appellant,
this is not a traditional identification case where the court is
concerned about the identification of the accused by a stranger
with a limited opportunity to observe the accused.
[2]  This case revolved around the credibility of a co-
conspirator who testified in detail as to the nature of the
conspiracy and the involvement of the appellant in it. He had
known the appellant since childhood.
[3]  The impugned evidence of the undercover police officer and a
surveillance officer was supportive of the appellant&#146;s
involvement in the conspiracy. To the extent that there were
frailties in their evidence as to identification, the trial
judge&#146;s charge to the jury was adequate in reminding them of the
problems inherent in identification cases.
[4]  Counsel on appeal raised other objections to the charge but
they were not made at trial. They related to a failure of the
trial judge to follow the instructions of the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 and in R. v. W.
(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) at 397. In our view, there is no
substance to these objections.
[5]  As to sentence, the amount of heroin involved in this
conspiracy was 280 grams. There was evidence to support the trial
judge&#146;s finding that the appellant was the head of the group
involved in this conspiracy. The appellant had been convicted
before in 1993 for the same offence and received a sentence of
fourteen years in addition to pre-trial custody. In our view, the
present sentence of ten years is eminently fit in the
circumstances.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed,
leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal against
sentence is dismissed.
