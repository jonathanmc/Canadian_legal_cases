</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Bell J., dated August 15, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals against his conviction for sexual
assault contrary to s.277(1) of the Criminal Code.  He also
appeals his sentence of 21 months imprisonment but that issue is
moot since he has served his sentence.
[2]  As to the conviction appeal, the appellant submits that the
verdict was unreasonable on two bases: the first that there is no
evidence that the complainant did not consent to having sexual
intercourse with the appellant; the second is that there is ample
evidence to support the defence of honest belief that she did
consent.  However, if the complainant&#146;s evidence is believed, as
it is obvious the trial judge did, the complainant had been
drinking beers and &#147;shooters&#148; prior to joining the appellant and
his brother in the kitchen.  She either fainted or passed out
while drinking an other beer and has no memory of anything until
she awakened to find herself lying prone and half-naked on a bed
in the house with the appellant on top of her having sexual
intercourse.
[3]  While the appellant submits that this evidence amounts to
nothing more than that the complainant had no memory of
consenting, it is obvious that it goes well beyond that.  Even
the appellant admits that &#147;she [the complainant] was out of it&#148;.
It is clear, as the trial judge implicitly found, that she was
incapable of giving her consent and the appellant was well aware
that she was incapable of giving consent.
[4]  In his reasons, the trial judge focused mainly on the second
defence and stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Assuming, without deciding, there is sufficient evidence to
          support the defence of honest belief in consent, I hold that the
          accused did not have an honest belief that he had R.&#146;s
          consent.  Alternatively, I find that the accused had intercourse
          with R. while, in his words, &#147;she was out of it&#148;, reckless as
          to whether he had her consent.  It follows there will be a
          finding of guilt.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</pre>
