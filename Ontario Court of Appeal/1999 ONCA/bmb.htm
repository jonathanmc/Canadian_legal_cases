    <pre>[1]  In our view the trial judge made a fundamental error in her
approach to sentence in this case.
[2]  On the facts it was not a case for a conditional sentence or
for a ninety-day intermittent sentence.
[3]  The issue was whether there was a reason why this case
should not be treated in accordance with the principles set out
by this court in R. v. B. (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307.
[4]  In our view, the factors outlined by the Crown in his
presentation are all significant aggravating factors which
required a penitentiary term. Those factors include: the young
age of the three victims, the significant breach of trust because
of the relationship of the accused to the victims, in one case he
is the father and in the other two he was, in essence, the
stepfather,  the significant impact of his actions on the
victims, the frequency of the assaults, and his previous criminal
record of assaults on his wife and on one of the victims.
[5]  In our view, the trial judge put undue emphasis on the issue
of rehabilitation.  Although the evidence in this case was that
the treatment programmes available to the accused in the
reformatory system are better than in the penitentiary, there was
also evidence that he will get treatment in the penitentiary. The
long-term effectiveness of any of the treatment programmes is a
matter which will depend on many variables and is not, of course,
a matter of any degree of certainty in either case.
[6]  On the facts of this case the sentence was grossly
inadequate.  A penitentiary term was required. In our view, the
appropriate sentence in this case is four years in the
penitentiary.
[7]  The appeal will therefore be allowed, the sentences imposed
set aside and the following sentences imposed to run from the
original sentencing date: on count 2, four years, on count 9,
four years concurrent; and on count 5, one year concurrent.</pre></td>
