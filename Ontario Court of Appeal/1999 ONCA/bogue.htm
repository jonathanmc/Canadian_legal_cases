    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice D. M. Belch dated
October 22, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant, John Bogue, appeals from  the  decision  of
Belch  J.  granting  judgment  in accordance  with  a  settlement
reached  on  December 10, 1996.  The appellant submits  that  the
motions judge erred in concluding that there was a settlement  of
the  issues  in  accordance with the terms as understood  by  the
respondent,  Pauline Bogue.  The principal point of  disagreement
between  the parties concerns an extraordinary repayment  clause,
which  the  appellant  claims was a  fundamental  aspect  of  any
settlement.  The motions judge found that the parties had reached
a  settlement  of  all  issues on December  10th  and  that  this
settlement  included  the  standard  form  of  release,  not  the
extraordinary  clause sought by the appellant.  For  the  reasons
that  follow I would dismiss the appeal.  In my view, the motions
judge made no error of law and there was a reasonable basis  upon
which he could reach the conclusion.
[2]  The appellant based his argument on three submissions.
First he submits that there was no settlement because there was
only an agreement to agree and that important terms of the
contract were to be determined in the future.  In the
alternative, he contends that there was a mutual mistake about a
fundamental issue and, therefore, the settlement is not
enforceable.  Finally, the appellant argues that this court
should exercise its equitable jurisdiction recognized in Scherer
v. Poletta (1966), 2 O.R. 524 (Ont. C.A.) and relieve the
appellant from his lawyer&#146;s inadvertence.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  parties were married in 1981.  A few hours before  the
marriage   ceremony,  the  husband  presented  his  wife&#146;s   then
solicitor  with  a marriage contract.  The wife&#146;s solicitor  made
several  changes to the contract, before it was returned  to  the
husband.   The wedding then proceeded.  The parties separated  in
1993.  In 1995, the wife commenced an action seeking, among other
things, a declaration that the marriage contract was not binding.
She  also  sought  spousal and child support and  a  division  of
property.  In June 1996, in an attempt to settle the action,  the
husband&#146;s  counsel,  not Mr. Power, proposed a  draft  separation
agreement  that included a lump sum payment to the wife  covering
both support and property claims.  The husband was concerned that
because  of  the  court&#146;s inherent power to  set  aside  domestic
contracts,  like  the earlier marriage contract,  the  separation
agreement  should  be as binding as possible.   Accordingly,  the
draft  separation agreement included a clause that  required  the
wife  to  repay the lump sum payment if she at any time attempted
to set aside or vary the agreement.
[4]  The wife did not accept the offer in the draft settlement
agreement and the litigation continued.  In the meantime, the
wife served a notice of motion for interim relief. On December 4,
1996, the parties and their counsel attended for a judicial pre-
trial.  The husband understood from the discussions in the pre-
trial that it was likely that the marriage contract would be set
aside.  Counsel attended in court on December 5th and agreed to
adjourn the motion to December 10th.
[5]  On December 10th the parties and their counsel were all
present and further settlement discussions took place.  As they
seemed to be making progress, the motion was again adjourned.
After three and one-half hours of discussions, the parties
appeared to have settled all of the outstanding issues.  There
was no discussion about the content of release clauses other than
that this would be a final settlement. The husband was present in
the courthouse during the negotiations and was giving
instructions to his counsel.  Neither the husband nor his counsel
raised the need for an unusual release clause as had been
contained in the June proposal.
[6]  The lawyers agreed that the husband&#146;s counsel would provide
a written summary of the agreement.  However, he did not do so.
Instead, after several days he prepared a draft separation
agreement.  In the view of the wife and her counsel, the draft
agreement did not conform in full with the agreement reached on
December 10th.  In particular, it included a term that the wife
agreed that should an application be made for spousal support or
for variation of the terms of the agreement concerning spousal
support, the agreement would be a complete defence to the claim
and the wife would have to forthwith repay the lump sum of
$400,000.
[7]  The wife&#146;s lawyer wrote to the husband&#146;s lawyer setting out
a series of concerns about the contents of the draft agreement.
Most of the comments are by way of clarification of certain of
the terms.  There were two substantive issues raised.  First, the
wife&#146;s lawyer required that the repayment clause be deleted.
Second, the parties had agreed that the payments made to the wife
were to be tax-free.  There was, however, some concern as to how
this was structured in the draft agreement.  The tax issue did
not seem to be a serious concern and on the appeal, Mr. Power
essentially confined his submissions to the repayment clause.
[8]  There was no evidence before the motions judge that the
husband had instructed his counsel at or in preparation for the
December 10th negotiations to insist on the repayment clause.
However, when the wife would not agree to such a clause this
became a &#147;deal breaker&#148; and the husband insisted that it be
included, although he agreed to reduce the penalty to $200,000
rather than the entire lump sum.  The lawyers for the parties
continued to correspond and over the next ten months all of the
concerns seemed to have been dealt with except the penalty
clause.  Finally, in October 1997 counsel for the wife wrote the
husband&#146;s lawyer stating that the wife was adamant that she would
not agree to the penalty clause, that it had not been part of the
original settlement and that she had instructions to bring an
action to enforce the settlement.  In addition, the wife&#146;s
counsel stated that the wife would be seeking full custody of the
child of the marriage.  In the December 10th discussions, the
parties had agreed on joint custody.
[9]  The motion for judgment in accordance with the settlement
was served in early 1998.  The wife did not seek full custody of
the child.</pre>
    <pre>THE REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The motions judge found that there was a settlement reached
on  December  10, 1996, and that its terms were as understood  by
the wife.  He found that a reasonable third person would conclude
that  an  unusual repayment clause was not part of the agreement.
He  found  that  most family law counsel would  expect  that  the
agreement would include a standard release clause and that if the
parties intended an unusual release such as the repayment  clause
it  would have been discussed before reaching a settlement.   The
motions  judge  was  satisfied that a final settlement  had  been
reached.   These were not preliminary discussions.  The husband&#146;s
lawyer  was  to reduce the settlement to writing.  There  was  no
fundamental  mistake.  The husband understood the true  character
of the offer and he intended to accept the terms.
[11] The motions judge therefore granted judgment in accordance
with the terms of the settlement as set out in the wife&#146;s
affidavit.  When the parties were not able to settle on the
wording of the release clauses in the formal court order, the
motions judge drafted them himself and they were incorporated
into the Judgment.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>1.   Agreement to agree</pre>
    <pre>[12] It is an over simplification to say that there cannot be  an
agreement  to  agree.  The true legal position was  explained  by
Robins  J.A. in Bawitko Investments Ltd. v. Kernels Popcorn  Ltd.
(1991), 79 D.L.R. (4th) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at 103-4:

          As a matter of normal business practice, parties planning to
          make a formal written document the expression of their agreement,
          necessarily discuss and negotiate the proposed terms of the
          agreement before they enter into it. They frequently agree upon
          all of the terms to be incorporated into the intended written
          document before it is prepared. Their agreement may be expressed
          orally or by way of memorandum, by exchange of correspondence, or
          other informal writings. The parties may &quot;contract to make a
          contract&quot;, that is to say, they may bind themselves to execute at
          a future date a formal written agreement containing specific
          terms and conditions. When they agree on all of the essential
          provisions to be incorporated in a formal document with the
          intention that their agreement shall thereupon become binding,
          they will have fulfilled all the requisites for the formation of
          a contract. The fact that a formal written document to the same
          effect is to be thereafter prepared and signed does not alter the
          binding validity of the original contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>          However, when the original contract  is
          incomplete   because   essential   provisions
          intended    to    govern   the    contractual
          relationship have not been settled or  agreed
          upon;  or  the  contract is  too  general  or
          uncertain  to  be  valid  in  itself  and  is
          dependent on the making of a formal contract;
          or  the  understanding or  intention  of  the
          parties,  even if there is no uncertainty  as
          to  the  terms  of their agreement,  is  that
          their  legal  obligations are to be  deferred
          until a formal contract has been approved and
          executed,   the   original   or   preliminary
          agreement  cannot constitute  an  enforceable
          contract.   In   other   words,    in    such
          circumstances  the  &quot;contract   to   make   a
          contract&quot;  is  not  a contract  at  all.  The
          execution of the contemplated formal document
          is  not  intended only as a solemn record  or
          memorial  of an already complete and  binding
          contract but is essential to the formation of
          the contract itself&#133; [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>And at p. 105:</pre>
    <pre>          If no agreement in respect to essential terms has
          been reached or the terms have not been agreed to with
          reasonable certainty, it can only be concluded that
          such terms were to be agreed upon at a later date and
          until that time there would be no completed agreement.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Although the motions judge did not hear any oral  evidence,
his findings of fact are entitled to deference on appeal:  Milios
v.  Zagas  (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 218 (C.A.) at 222.  In  my  view,
there  was evidence upon which the motions judge was entitled  to
find  that a final settlement of all the issues had been  reached
on  December 10th and that there was an agreement in  respect  to
the essential terms.  While there was no express discussion about
a  release, the settlement of the action implied an obligation to
furnish  releases:   Fieguth v. Acklands Ltd. (1989),  59  D.L.R.
(4th)  114  (B.C.C.A.).   At the end of those  negotiations,  the
parties had bound themselves to the settlement.  It only remained
for  the lawyers to reduce the terms to a formal document.   This
was not simply an agreement to agree.
[14] As McEachern C.J.B.C. pointed out in Fieguth at p. 123, many
settlements are very complicated and

     the deal is usually struck before the documentation can be
     completed.  In such cases, the settlement will be binding if
     there is agreement on the essential terms.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  Generally speaking, litigation is settled on the basis that
a  final  agreement has been reached which the parties intend  to
record   in  formal  documentation  and  &#147;parties  who  reach   a
settlement should usually be held to their bargains&#148;.1</pre>
    <pre>2.   Mistake</pre>
    <pre>[16] I find it difficult to characterize what occurred here as  a
case  of mutual mistake as that term is understood.  See Fridman,
The  Law of Contract in Canada, 3rd ed. (1994) at pp. 258  &#150;  60.
In  any  event,  the test to be applied is set out  in  Smith  v.
Hughes (1871), L.R. 6 Q.B. 597 at 607:

          If whatever a man&#146;s real intention may be, he so conducts
          himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting
          to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party
          upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus
          conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended
          to agree to the other party&#146;s terms.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Thus  as  Houlden J.A. held for this  court  in  Walton  v.
Landstock  Investments Ltd. (1976), 72 D.L.R. (3d)  195  at  198,
&#147;Mutual  assent  is  not required for the formation  of  a  valid
contract, only a manifestation of mutual assent &#133; Whether or  not
there  is  a  manifestation of mutual assent is to be  determined
from the overt acts of the parties.&#148;  There was abundant evidence
from  which the motions judge could find that this test had  been
met.   In  fact,  there is really no evidence  to  the  contrary.
Neither  the  husband nor his lawyer claimed that  there  was  no
agreement  at the end of the discussions on December  10th.   The
evidence  at  its highest shows that after the fact, the  husband
and  his lawyer realized that there had been no discussion  about
releases and, in particular, a repayment clause.  This then  was,
at most, a case of unilateral mistake.
[18] In cases of unilateral mistake, if the unmistaken party is
ignorant of the other&#146;s mistake the contract is valid in law:
Fridman supra at 261.  Assuming a mistake was made in this case,
in that the husband agreed to the settlement without realizing
that it did not contain a repayment clause, there was no evidence
that the wife or her lawyer were aware of the mistake.
Nevertheless, the husband may be entitled to an equitable remedy
if the wife ought to have known of his mistake:  Stepps
Investments Ltd. et al. v. Security Capital Corp. Ltd. (1976), 73
D.L.R. (3d) 351 (Ont. H.C.J.), at 364.  On this aspect of the
case, the motions judge made the following finding:

          Having observed the repayment clause in a draft proposal six
          months earlier should the wife and her counsel have expected that
          this was the release clause to be included?  Was there anything
          in the husband&#146;s words or conduct to cause the wife to think that
          the repayment clause was still part of his earlier  position?  A
          majority of family law counsel would expect a release clause to
          state that neither party would seek spousal support from the
          other in the future and not the wording of this repayment clause
          which is potentially punitive.  If the parties intended a release
          clause this unusual, I find they would have discussed it in
          detail before reaching a &#147;settlement&#148;.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  I  take  this as a finding that neither the  wife  nor  her
counsel  ought to have known that the husband was still insisting
on  a repayment clause.  In my view, this finding was open on the
evidence and I would not interfere with it.</pre>
    <pre>3.   Discretion to relieve against inadvertence</pre>
    <pre>[20]  In  Scherer v. Paletta, [1966] 2 O.R. 524, this court  held
that  on a motion for judgment in the terms of an accepted  offer
to  settle the motions judge is not required to enforce the terms
of a settlement.  Evans J.A. said at p. 527:

          A solicitor whose retainer is established in the particular
          proceedings may bind his client by a compromise of these
          proceedings unless his client has limited his authority and the
          opposing side has knowledge of the limitation, subject always to
          the discretionary power of the Court, if its intervention by the
          making of an order is required, to inquire into the circumstances
          and grant or withhold its intervention if it sees fit; and,
          subject also to the disability of the client. It follows
          accordingly, that while a solicitor or counsel may have apparent
          authority to bind and contract his client to a particular
          compromise, neither solicitor nor counsel have power to bind the
          Court to act in a particular way, so that, if the compromise is
          one that involves the Court in making an order, the want of
          authority may be brought to the notice of the Court at any time
          before the grant of its intervention is perfected and the Court
          may refuse to permit the order to be perfected. If, however, the
          parties are of full age and capacity, the Court, in practice,
          where there is no dispute as to the fact that a retainer exists,
          and no dispute as to the terms agreed upon between the
          solicitors, does not embark upon any inquiry as to the limitation
          of authority imposed by the client upon the solicitor.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[21] In Scherer v. Paletta, the court applied the usual rule  and
held  that  the  settlement should be enforced notwithstanding  a
dispute between the client and the lawyer as to the terms of  the
retainer.
[22] In Milios v. Zagas, supra at p. 223, which involved a motion
under Rule 49.09 to enforce an accepted offer to settle, this
court held that in determining whether to enforce a settlement
under Rule 40.09 all of the relevant factors disclosed by the
evidence must be taken into account. However, when that is done,
&#147;an appellate court will not generally interfere with the motions
judge&#146;s decision to grant, or not grant, judgment in accordance
with an accepted offer&#148;.  In Milios, the court refused to enforce
the settlement when the client&#146;s wife gave clear but mistaken
instructions to the lawyer to accept an offer from the other
side.  The court chararacterized the case as one of mistake, not
limitation of authority.  I have already held that in this case
there was no mistake that would give the husband a remedy either
in law or equity.
[23] In my view, this case is governed by Scherer v. Paletta and
the court should not refuse to enforce the settlement.  I have
some concern about the delay in bringing the motion to enforce
the settlement and the wife&#146;s former counsel&#146;s tactic of
threatening to reopen the child custody issue.  However, the
delay is largely explained by both counsel's attempts in good
faith to implement the settlement according to each client&#146;s
instructions.  Having reviewed the entire record, it seems
apparent to me that the final threat to reopen child custody was
caused by the wife&#146;s frustration with the long delay and, in any
event, it was never followed through.  This is not a case where
the mistake or inadvertence goes to the very essence of the
agreement as in Milios.  In Milios, the court placed considerable
emphasis on the lack of prejudice to the party attempting to
enforce the settlement.  In this case, the prejudice to the wife
outweighs the prejudice to the husband.  The husband obtained an
agreement that contains the standard form of release.  In effect,
the husband seeks to unwind a comprehensive settlement of complex
litigation, because he did not get a repayment clause, which his
counsel conceded would not necessarily be any more effective than
the standard release.2  There has already been a long delay since
this action was commenced.  If the settlement is not enforced,
there will be further delay and the wife will be required to
again pursue this litigation.  I would not interfere with the
motion judge&#146;s decision to enforce the settlement.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[24] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
