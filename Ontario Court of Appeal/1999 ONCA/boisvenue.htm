    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. RICHARD
               LARRY BOISVENUE (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        OSBORNE A.C.J.O., CATZMAN J.A. and FARLEY J. ad hoc</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Peter Copeland
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Tina Yuen
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from sentence imposed by G.R. Matte J. on February 19, 1996</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Counsel for the Crown and defence at trial jointly submitted
that the appellant receive a conditional discharge for five years
on the general basis that as Crown counsel at trial put it, &#147;I
can see no valid reason from the Crown&#146;s perspective for saddling
Richard with a criminal record as a result of these facts.&#148;
[2]  Instead of accepting this joint submission, the trial judge
suspended the passing of sentence and placed the appellant on
probation for 18 months. The trial judge stated that it would be
against the public interest to grant a discharge, that is to
accept the joint submission. He did not explain in his reasons
why he concluded that a conditional discharge would be contrary
to the public interest.
[3]  In this court, Crown counsel quite appropriately conceded
that a conditional discharge was an appropriate disposition in
the circumstances. However, the Crown submitted that the sentence
imposed by the trial judge was also an appropriate sentence and
that the trial judge was entitled to reject the joint submission.
[4]  In our view, the trial judge erred in not accepting the
joint submission having regard to the somewhat abbreviated record
that was placed before him on the appellant&#146;s plea of guilty.
[5]  Thus, leave is granted. The appeal is allowed. The sentence
imposed below will be set aside and instead a sentence in
accordance with the joint submission, that is a conditional
discharge on the terms set out in the joint submission, will be
imposed.</pre></td>
