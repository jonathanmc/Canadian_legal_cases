               CUSTOMS CONSULTING LTD., WILLIAM CHAPMAN and
               RICHARD DUCHARME (Defendants/Appellants)</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, LABROSSE and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       Daniel J. Leduc, for the appellant Ottawa Customs Consulting Ltd.</pre>
      <pre>               Melody D. Loubert, for the respondent</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Cunningham J. dated October 9, 1998.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
      <pre>[1]  We are all of the view that this court should not entertain
this appeal at this stage of the proceedings.</pre>
      <pre>[2]  The judgment of October 9th, 1998, which the defendants seek
to appeal, directs a reference to take an account of commissions
owing to the plaintiff on the basis of the trial judge’s
interpretation of the agreement between the parties.  The
judgment further provides that the trial judge will remain seized
of the action and that, following the reference, the referee will
report to the trial judge, who will then be attended by counsel
to make their submissions with respect to the disposition of the
action and costs of the action and of the reference.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  In the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that
it would be inappropriate to permit the parties to pursue two
appeals: one, today, that is limited to the trial judge’s
interpretation of their agreement and another, after the
reference, from the account of commissions taken by the referee.
There should not be two appeals, but only one appeal, from the
final judgment in this action.</pre>
      <pre>[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is adjourned sine die. After the
referee has reported and the trial judge has disposed of the
action and costs as contemplated in his judgment of October 9th,
1998, either side shall be at liberty to amend the present appeal
as he or it may be advised and to perfect and bring the appeal on
for hearing for the resolution of all of the issues between the
parties.</pre>
      <pre>[5]  The costs of this day will be to the respondent in the cause
in the appeal.
