    <pre>HEARD:         December 2, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal and cross-appeal from the order of Then J. dated
January 14, 1999, dismissing an application for certiorari with
respect to two counts of a committal and allowing the application
with respect to a third count.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Richard Bond and Caliph Khan were committed to stand trial
on charges of conspiracy to import, importing and possession for
the purpose of trafficking, all with respect to hashish.  They
move to quash the committal and were successful in striking down
the charge of importing.  They appeal from the dismissal of their
motion to quash the other two charges.  The Crown appeals from
the quashing of the committal for trial on the count of
importing.
[2]  In our view, the appeals of Messrs. Bond and Khan must be
dismissed and the appeal of the Crown must succeed.  In so far as
the conspiracy to import is concerned, the test is whether there
was any evidence before the preliminary inquiry judge on the
basis of which acting judicially he could form the opinion that
the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial.  The
evidence in question would have to deal with the questions first,
whether the conspiracy existed and second, whether either accused
was or were members of it.
[3]  Then J. below set out the pertinent evidence in paragraphs 2
to 12 and 35 to 37 of his reasons.  Counsel for Messrs. Bond and
Khan reviewed that evidence on an item by item basis to try to
demonstrate that there was no indication of any connection by
either accused with the shipment until after the importation was
completed.
[4]  In our view, the items listed by Then J. in his paragraph 35
constitute some evidence from which the inference could be drawn
that Bond was connected with the importation.
[5]  Likewise, the items listed in paragraph 36 provide some
evidence from which an inference could be drawn that Khan was
connected to Bond in this enterprise.  The appeal with respect to
count 1 must therefore be dismissed.
[6]  Turning to count 3, it is argued on behalf of Messrs. Bond
and Khan that they could not have possession because the vast
bulk of the drug was removed by the RCMP and the amount actually
received by the accused was obviously insufficient to support a
conclusion that possession was for the purpose of trafficking.
[7]  It is argued that the correct procedure would have been to
split the charge presumably into a charge in Ontario of simple
possession and a charge in British Columbia of attempt to possess
for the purpose of trafficking.
[8]  This, in our view, is speculation.  Then J. concluded that
he was unable to say that there was a complete absence of
material upon which the preliminary enquiry judge could form the
opinion that he did.  We are of the same view.
[9]  The appeal on count 3 is therefor dismissed.
[10] Paragraph 35 of the reasons of Then J. refers to the fact
that at the time of arrest, Mr. Bond was in possession of
documents and other information regarding the shipping process
including the name and address of the exporter in India.  Though
perhaps only a scintilla, this is some evidence linking Mr. Bond
to the importing.  As noted earlier, Mr. Khan was in turn tied to
Mr. Bond.  Although the goods appear to have come from Madras to
Tacoma and thence to Vancouver and Toronto in bond, there is some
evidence tying the transaction to the accused.
[11] The Crown appeal must accordingly succeed and the appeal is
thus allowed to that extent and otherwise dismissed.</pre>
