      <pre>On appeal from the orders of Madam Justice C. J. Robertson dated
March 16, 1999 and April 21, 1999</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The wife appeals the order of Robertson J. dated March  16,
1999, (1) reducing spousal support from $3,360.73 to $950.00  per
month,  not  indexed,  (2) providing for review  of  the  monthly
support when the wife reaches 65 years of age, and (3) rescinding
the  arrears of spousal support.  Item (2) has now been  rendered
moot  as  the  wife has elected to take her Canada  Pension  Plan
benefits.
[2]  The parties were married in 1955 and separated in 1991 after
a 36 year marriage.  The wife was a homemaker throughout the
marriage and was never employed outside the home.  She stayed at
home to care for the children and look after the household.  She
also assisted with the husband's career.
[3]  On October 17, 1994 the parties consented to judgment.  The
parties provided for the division of assets and the wife was to
receive support of $3,200 per month, with annual indexing.  At
the time of the consent judgment, the wife was 57 and the husband
was 60 years of age.  They are now 62 and 66 years of age,
respectively.
[4]  The income of the husband in 1994 was in excess of $115,400
per year.
[5]  The wife has not earned any employment income since the
consent judgment.  She has been involved in volunteer work.
[6]  Following the consent judgment, the husband continued
earning approximately the same annual income.  He retired from
his employment on January 31, 1997 and began receiving an indexed
pension.  In addition, he was paid substantial consulting fees in
1997 and 1998 and began receiving his Canada Pension Plan
benefits in August 1998.
[7]  It has been conceded that there has been a material change
of circumstances.  On a reasonable view of the present situation
it cannot be maintained that there is not a need on the part of
the wife for support and an ability to pay support on the part of
the husband.
[8]  Looking at the total assets of the wife that could be
liquidated, we estimate that she could earn a yearly investment
income of approximately $15,000 (plus Canada Pension Plan
benefits of $3,240).
[9]  In our view, the motions judge made an error in principle in
factoring into her decision an ability on the part of the wife to
earn employment income.  She has not worked outside the home
during the 36-year marriage.  She has no applicable skills and
has been economically disadvantaged.  She is 62 years of age .
It is not a reasonable option for her to seek employment.  There
is a large difference between doing volunteer work and becoming
gainfully employed.
[10] Further, in our view, the amount of the variation allowed by
the motions judge is outside the realm of reasonableness.
[11] Having regard to the financial circumstances of both
parties, including the reduction of the husband's income
following his retirement, we are of the view that the appropriate
result would be to vary the amount of support to $2,000 per month
as of April 1, 1999, the date picked by the motions judge for the
variation to take effect. We see no valid reason why this amount
should not be indexed.
[12] As to the arrears, the amount is uncertain.  However, it
would appear that most of the arrears were incurred while the
husband was earning substantial additional income to his pension.
We see no proper basis to rescind the arrears.
[13] Accordingly, the order of March 16, 1999 is varied in
accordance with these reasons.
[14] We would not disturb the order of costs dated April 21,
1999.
[15] The wife shall have her costs of the appeal fixed at $1,500.
