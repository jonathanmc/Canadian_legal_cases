</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Ferrier J. dated April 20, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  our view this appeal turns on the findings of  fact  at
trial.
[2]  The critical finding of fact was that the contract agreed to
by the parties required that the appellant pay the $40,000 in
order to get the shares. In making this finding the trial judge
accepted Mr. Kennedy&#146;s evidence that this was &#147;the exact deal&#148;.
Given that the finding is supported by this evidence we cannot
interfere, since this precondition was not met. The trial judge
properly concluded that the appellant never became a shareholder.
[3]  On the evidence there is no other basis for an oppression
remedy.
[4]  As to the contempt finding, the breach of the order of
Montgomery J. was admitted. The assessment of penalty is, in our
view, a matter for the discretion of the trial judge. We see no
error in principle in the penalty imposed and we would not
interfere.
[5]  Therefore, in spite of Mr. Leitch&#146;s excellent presentation,
the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre>
