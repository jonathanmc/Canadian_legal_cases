    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant’s action against the respondent group</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability insurer was dismissed on the respondent’s motion under</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rule 21.01(1)(a) to determine a question of law – whether the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the disability policy under which she asserted her claim against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent. The motions judge, Wallace J., found that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitation period applied and that the respondent could rely on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it. She thus dismissed the appellant’s action. In reaching this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conclusion, the motions judge relied on the pleadings and</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the general position that in the circumstances, the respondent</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refer to the limitation period in material concerning the policy</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in which her claim was being considered by the respondent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nothing was said to alert her about the 1 year limitation period.</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  As a result of her employment with Fort Erie Duty Free</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shoppe Limited, the appellant was insured under a group</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability policy issued by the respondent. In 1991, due to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">mental illness, she was unable to work. She applied for and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received weekly disability benefits under the policy from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">September 9, 1991 to January 1, 1992 and monthly disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits from January 2, 1992 to June 30, 1993. The respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated payment of all benefits under the policy on June 30,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1993. It informed the appellant that her benefits had been</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated by a letter to her dated November 25, 1993.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  When the appellant contacted the respondent about appealing</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the termination of her disability benefits, she was told that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could participate in an “in house” appeal procedure that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent provided. She decided to take advantage of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure. On April 21, 1994, the respondent advised the union</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">official representing the appellant that the “appeal process”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would commence once the appellant provided new medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information “... to support the appeal.”

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  On July 12, 1994, over one year after the respondent had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stopped paying benefits, the respondent wrote to the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and explained how its appeal process would unfold. In that letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent advised the appellant that it would require her to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">undergo an independent medical examination.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  On July 21, 1994, the respondent advised the appellant that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it had made an appointment for an independent medical examination</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on July 29, 1994 with Dr. Awad, a Toronto psychiatrist. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent’s July 21st letter stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          On receipt of the results of the independent
          medical examination, we will advise you of
          any change in the status of your claim.
          
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  On September 28, 1994, the respondent told the appellant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appeal process was complete and that no further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disability benefits would be paid. It thus, in effect, confirmed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its earlier decision, effective June 30, 1993, to terminate the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">payment of disability benefits. By way of explanation, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent referred to Dr. Awad’s report, its review of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s file and “additional information” that it had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">obtained.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  In her affidavit the appellant said that, due to ill health,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">she was incapable of “...effectively dealing with” the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent’s decision to terminate her monthly disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits during the winter of 1994-95. She stated that in June,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995 she telephoned Judy Batches, a representative of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent, to ask about the “additional information” referred to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in the respondent’s letter. Ms. Batches told the appellant that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this information was confidential. The appellant then told Ms.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Batches that she had retained a lawyer who had agreed that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was entitled to disability benefits. The appellant admitted that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her statement to Ms. Batches about retaining a lawyer and about</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the lawyer’s opinion was false.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  On August 1, 1995, the appellant contacted a solicitor who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">told her that he did not do the kind of legal work that she</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">required. As a result, she contacted another lawyer who referred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her to the law firm that now represents her in this action. This</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action was started on June 11, 1996.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The limitation period in the group disability policy was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first raised as a discrete issue in a letter to the appellant’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitors from Deborah Pacholka, the respondent’s associate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legal counsel, dated June 29, 1996. In that letter Ms. Pacholka</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said that the respondent would be relying on the policy’s 1 year</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitation period. Until that time the appellant stated in her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">affidavit that she knew nothing about a limitation period in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">policy, 1 year or otherwise. She never saw a copy of the policy,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or any part of it. She did receive a benefits summary from her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">union and a Group Benefits Program Booklet from her employer;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">however, neither made any reference to the policy’s limitation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period. Nor was the appellant advised of the limitation period in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the many contacts she had with representatives of the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after the respondent terminated her benefits under the policy.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The relevant group policy was filed on the respondent’s Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21.01(1)(a) motion. It is a 37 page document. I see no need to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">set out its provisions other than to refer specifically to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitation period which a discerning reader can locate at p. 13</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the policy. This part of the policy provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">

          (60) days after Proof of Loss has been filed
          in accordance with the requirements of this

          the law of the province in which the insured
          Employee resides at the time this Policy is
          issued, then the limitation is hereby
          extended to agree with the minimum period
          permitted by law.1

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] In its statement of defence, the respondent pleaded that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitation period in the policy was a complete bar to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant’s claim. Paragraph 20 of the statement of defence sets</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out the respondent’s limitation period defence in these terms:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          20.  Co-Operators terminated the payment of
          Monthly Benefits under the Policy effective
          June 30, 1993. The plaintiff was advised of
          such termination by letter dated November 25,
          1993. Pursuant to the terms of the Policy
          referred to in paragraph 19 aforesaid, any
          action or proceeding at law or in equity by
          the plaintiff against Co-operators under the
          Policy for payment of Monthly Benefits was
          required to be brought within one year of the
          date on which Co-Operators terminated the
          payment of benefits under the Policy. Such
          action was therefore required to have been
          brought within one year from June 30, 1993
          or, alternatively, within one year from
          November 25, 1993. As the plaintiff did not
          bring this action until June 11, 1996, she
          has failed to bring it within the limitation
          period prescribed by the Policy and the
          action should therefore be dismissed.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to me that the core issue is whether, in these circumstances, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent’s limitation period defence should have been dealt</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with at all on a motion under Rule 21.01(1)(a). In my view, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">answer to that question is “no”. I will now explain how I came to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] To understand the scope of Rule 21, it is important to take</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">into account the difference among Rules 20, 21 and 22, all of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which seek to shorten or eliminate trials and thus reduce the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cost of litigation. These rules are clearly related in their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">function, but they are not randomly interchangeable.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] On a motion under Rule 20 the motions judge must determine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that there is or is not a genuine issue for trial: see Irving</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ungerman Ltd. v. Galanis (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.). That</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determination is based on the evidence filed on the motion. It is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not based on the pleadings, apart from any admissions in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pleadings. Thus, a party responding to a summary judgment motion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cannot sit back and rely on the pleadings. See 1061590 Ontario</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ltd. v. Ontario Jockey Club (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 547 (C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Because of the provisions of Rule 20.04(4), if the only genuine</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue for trial is a question of law, the motions judge may</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determine the question of law and grant judgment accordingly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rule 20.04(4) provides that this will be done only where there</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are no facts in dispute which may give rise to a genuine issue</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for trial.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Motions under Rule 21 and 22 are different from summary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment motions under Rule 20. Motions under Rules 21 and 22</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">focus on questions of law raised by the pleadings (Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21.01(1)(a)), or stated by agreement of the parties (Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22.01(1)). A Rule 22 motion brought by the agreement of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">parties will, as a result of the provisions of Rule 22.04(a), be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accompanied by an agreed statement of fact to the extent that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts are necessary “to enable the court to determine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">question stated.”  Rule 21.01(2) provides that there be no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence on a motion under Rule 21.01(1)(a) “except with leave of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a judge or on consent of the parties.”  Since Rule 21.01(1)(a)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requires that the question of law be raised by the pleadings</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there will generally be no need for evidence on a Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21.01(1)(a) motion. It seems clear to me that it was for this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reason that the drafters of the Rules provided that there should</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be no evidence on a motion under Rule 21.01(1)(a), except for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cases in which leave is granted or there is consent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] I do not think that the issue whether the policy limitation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period is a bar to the appellant’s action is a question of law</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that should have been resolved on a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the motions judge’s endorsement indicates, the application of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">limitation period in this case depends upon findings of fact for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its resolution.  This is also apparent from the appellant’s reply</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the respondent’s statement of defence. In my opinion, whether</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent is entitled to rely on the limitation period in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the policy has a significant factual component and is thus a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matter which should be addressed at trial, not on a Rule</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">21.01(1)(a) motion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Even if leave was granted to permit the parties to file</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence on the motion, I do not think that inferences to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">drawn from the evidence are so clear as to permit the question of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">law in issue to be resolved on a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with costs, set aside</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the order below and dismiss the respondent’s motion with costs.
