</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  With respect to the trial judge, we are of the view that he</pre>
    <pre>committed several errors in principle in sentencing the appellant</pre>
    <pre>to a fine of $3,000.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  First, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the</pre>
    <pre>uniformity principle and in doing so, he failed to pay adequate</pre>
    <pre>attention to the individual offender and the particular facts and</pre>
    <pre>circumstances giving rise to his offence.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In this case, the error was significant because it</pre>
    <pre>effectively removed from the trial judge's consideration the low</pre>
    <pre>level of moral culpability attributable to the appellant. In this</pre>
    <pre>regard, there was ample evidence capable of supporting the</pre>
    <pre>appellant’s position that he honestly, albeit mistakenly, thought</pre>
    <pre>he was not breaking the law. This belief on his part was borne</pre>
    <pre>out by the fact that he was declaring the gaming revenue as</pre>
    <pre>income for tax purposes, as well as the fact that the illegal</pre>
    <pre>gaming was not brought to his attention by the many police</pre>
    <pre>officers and court officials who attended his restaurant on a</pre>
    <pre>regular basis.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Second, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the fact</pre>
    <pre>that this was a large scale operation being carried out by many</pre>
    <pre>people in the area. While that may be true, there is no</pre>
    <pre>suggestion that the appellant was aware of the extent of the</pre>
    <pre>problem or that he participated in any way in the illegal</pre>
    <pre>activity carried on by others.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In view of these errors, we need not show deference to the</pre>
    <pre>sentence imposed by the trial judge.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Bearing in mind the appellant’s prior unblemished background</pre>
    <pre>and history, his plea of guilty and remorse, the small amount of</pre>
    <pre>profit he derived and his degree of moral culpability, we believe</pre>
    <pre>that this was an appropriate case for a discharge.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  At the time of the sentence hearing, we think a conditional</pre>
    <pre>discharge with probation, including among other terms, a</pre>
    <pre>community service order, would have been a fit and just sentence.</pre>
    <pre>Given the passage of time and the fact that the appellant had</pre>
    <pre>been trouble free in the interim (a period of four years), we are</pre>
    <pre>of the view that an absolute discharge is called for.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the</pre>
    <pre>appeal is allowed and an absolute discharge is imposed.</pre></td>
