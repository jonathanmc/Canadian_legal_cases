      <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:
</pre>
      <pre>INTRODUCTION
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The  appellant,  Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers  Ltd.  (“Ritchie
Bros.”), appeals from the judgment of Zelinski J. dated  May  28,
1997.   Following  a  short  trial, Zelinski  J.  held  that  the
plaintiff, George Bowen (“Bowen”),1 had been wrongfully dismissed
from  his  position at Ritchie Bros.  Zelinski J.  awarded  Bowen
damages  of $22,500 plus costs.  This appeal raises issues  about
the  relationship  between  outright dismissal  and  constructive
dismissal, mitigation and the calculation of damages.
</pre>
      <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND
</pre>
      <pre>[2]  Ritchie Bros. is a heavy equipment auctioneer.  George Bowen
was  employed by Ritchie Bros. from 1989 to 1993.  He began as  a
part-time  employee.  In May 1990 he became a full-time employee,
occupying  the  position of yard foreman.  He continued  in  this
position  until 1993.  During this period, he received  generally
positive  reviews. Indeed, Bowen’s supervisor,  Michael  Ritchie,
described him as an “outstanding employee”.
[3]  The auction business of Ritchie Bros. grew substantially
from 1990 to 1993.  Ritchie Bros. decided to split Bowen’s duties
into two positions.  On June 23, 1993 Michael Ritchie spoke to
Bowen about the change in his position.  Bowen was offered a
position at the gatehouse of the company’s property.  His salary
would remain the same.  He was also told that he could meet with
the supervisor of another division in the company to discuss job
possibilities in that division.
[4]  Bowen was unhappy about this prospect.  Ritchie invited
Bowen to take a week off, with pay, to consider the matter.  On
June 30, Bowen returned.  He had sought legal advice during his
week off.  In the meeting on June 30 Bowen informed Ritchie that,
in his opinion, Ritchie Bros. was “constructively dismissing”
him.  Bowen did not return to work at Ritchie Bros.
[5]  Bowen initiated an action against Ritchie Bros. for wrongful
dismissal.  Zelinski J. found in favour of Bowen; he held that
Ritchie Bros.’ conduct constituted both the outright dismissal
and constructive dismissal of Bowen and that Bowen had complied
with his legal duty to mitigate his damages.  Zelinski J. decided
that the proper period for notice in lieu of wages was five
months which resulted in a damages award of $21,200.  He also
awarded $1,000 as a prorated share of an annual bonus Bowen had
received in previous years and $300 to compensate for the flow
through during the notice period of an incremental salary
increase he had received shortly before his termination.
Accordingly, the total damages award for wrongful dismissal was
$22,500.
[6]  Ritchie Bros. appealed from Zelinski J.’s decision on all
points – dismissal, mitigation and calculation of damages.
</pre>
      <pre>B.   LEGAL ISSUES</pre>
      <pre>[7]  The legal issues that must be considered on this appeal are:

    (1)  Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow Ritchie Bros.
        to lead evidence concerning prior alcohol-related incidents
        involving Bowen?
    (2)  Did the trial judge err in finding that Ritchie Bros.’
        conduct amounted to the constructive dismissal of Bowen?
    (3)  Did the trial judge err in finding that Ritchie Bros.’
        conduct amounted to an outright dismissal of Bowen?
    (4)  Did the trial judge err in finding that Bowen had properly
        and adequately mitigated his damages?
    (5)  Did the trial judge err in his calculation of damages?</pre>
      <pre>C.     ANALYSIS</pre>
      <pre>(1)  The evidentiary issue</pre>
      <pre>[8]   During his cross-examination of Bowen, counsel for  Ritchie
Bros.  attempted  to ask questions about Bowen’s  consumption  of
alcohol  on the job.  Bowen’s counsel objected on the basis  that
Ritchie Bros.’ position was that Bowen had simply quit his job on
June  30,  1993, not that Ritchie Bros. had terminated  him  with
cause.   The  trial judge agreed with the objection and  did  not
allow Ritchie Bros.’ counsel to pursue this line of questioning.
[9]  In my view, the trial judge erred in cutting off inquiry
into Bowen’s use of alcohol on the job and Ritchie Bros.’
reaction to it.  Ritchie Bros.’ defence to Bowen’s wrongful
dismissal claim was that it was not trying to force him out;
indeed Ritchie Bros. asserted that he was a valued employee whom
they wanted to retain.  In light of that position, Ritchie Bros.
was entitled to pursue a line of inquiry that might have resulted
in evidence showing that in circumstances where it might have
been able to terminate Bowen with cause, it chose not to do so.
</pre>
      <pre>(2)  Constructive dismissal
</pre>
      <pre>[10]  In  the  context of the factual background of  the  Ritchie
Bros./Bowen relationship, a useful case setting the parameters of
the constructive dismissal analysis is Smith v. Viking Helicopter
Ltd.  (1989),  68 O.R. (2d) 228 (C.A.).  In that case,  Finlayson
J.A. stated, at p. 231:
          In  my  opinion,  a  damage  action  for
          constructive dismissal must  be  founded
          on  conduct  by  the  employer  and  not
          simply on the perception of that conduct
          by  the  employee. The employer must  be
          responsible  for some objective  conduct
          which  constitutes a fundamental  change
          in  employment or a unilateral change of
          a significant term of that employment. A
          decision   to  change  its   manner   of
          conducting  its business or  a  move  to
          another  place  of  business  does   not
          necessarily result in such a fundamental
          breach   of   its  contract   with   its
          employees    as    to    constitute    a
          constructive dismissal.
          
</pre>
      <pre>[11] Ritchie Bros. contends that all it did in June 1993 was  “to
change  its  manner of conducting its business.”   Ritchie  Bros.
points to the fact that Bowen’s new position would have been  the
same  as  his previous position, namely yard foreman.   Moreover,
his  duties would have been similar, although confined to only  a
portion  of  Ritchie  Bros.’ premises.  Finally,  Bowen’s  salary
would have continued unchanged.
[12] There is no doubt that job title, duties and salary are all
relevant factors in a constructive dismissal analysis.  However,
another important factor is conditions of employment.  According
to the trial judge, this was the factor on which Ritchie Bros.
foundered.  His description of the new gate house position which
was offered to Bowen was, at pp. 13-14:
</pre>
      <pre>          The  task  of  the gate person  on  June
          23rd, 1993, was one that had always been
          assigned,  as  indicated,  to  part-time
          persons.    Those   part-time    persons
          circulated on a regular basis.   Changes
          were  always  ongoing in  terms  of  the
          personnel  assigned to  it.   Mr.  Bowen
          indicated, and I accept, that one of the
          reasons  for that was the fact that  the
          facilities provided for the gate  person
          were  inadequate.  This facility  is  an
          eight  by  eight  building  without  any
          meaningful  heat, situated some  two  to
          three   hundred  feet  from   the   main
          building    of   the   employer.     The
          description  of  the  facility,  by   my
          assessment, is something which,  when  I
          was a student, was commonly known as the
          “yard   shack”.   In  any   event,   the
          facilities that had been provided  prior
          to  that  date to Mr. Bowen were  within
          the main building in the shop area.  The
          office that he had at that location  was
          not excessive but adequate and luxurious
          by comparison to what would be available
          to him at the “yard shack”.
          </pre>
      <pre>          In  the gate house building there was no
          heat,  as indicated, or meaningful heat.
          There  was no washroom facility.   There
          was  no meaningful access to Mr. Ritchie
          who  was,  in  the main  building,  some
          thirty   feet  maximum  away  from   the
          location of the office of Mr. Bowen, and
          there   was   no  immediate  access   to
          secretarial staff.
</pre>
      <pre>[13]  Moreover,  the  trial judge concluded that  Ritchie  Bros.’
contention  that  it  was only changing the manner  in  which  it
conducted its business was belied by events subsequent to Bowen’s
departure.  On this point the trial judge stated, at p. 15:
          </pre>
      <pre>          As indicated, I have rejected the notion
          that  a  decision had been made  by  the
          Defendant  that  it  would  change   its
          manner  of  operations in the manner  in
          which  it  conducted  its  business.   I
          stated  subsequent events have indicated
          that no person is in the position of the
          job  function that was alleged to be the
          foundation  for the offer  made  to  Mr.
          Bowen.  There is no full-time person  at
          the  gate  at the present time.   It  is
          still part-time, and none of the two-and-
          a-half  persons who are stated  to  have
          been employed as a result of Mr. Bowen’s
          departure are located in that office.
          
</pre>
      <pre>[14]  I  think that the trial judge’s reasoning on this point  is
unassailable.  The position which Ritchie Bros. offered to  Bowen
was  a  significantly  worse position than the  one  he  occupied
immediately before June 23, 1999.  Indeed, the working conditions
attached to the new position were so unappealing that only  part-
time  employees had been assigned to the ‘yard shack’ before  and
after  Bowen was offered the position.  For an employee  who  had
worked  for  several years in the main office almost adjacent  to
the manager, relegation to a tiny, unheated shed at the periphery
of  the  premises was a clear signal that the company  no  longer
valued Bowen’s services and hoped he would quit.  Accordingly,  I
agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the employer, by its
objective  conduct, facilitated a fundamental change  in  Bowen’s
employment.   Ritchie  Bros.’ conduct  amounted  to  constructive
dismissal of its employee within the definition set out  by  this
court in Smith v. Viking Helicopter Ltd., supra.</pre>
      <pre>(3)  Outright dismissal
</pre>
      <pre>[15]  The  trial judge concluded that Ritchie Bros.’ conduct  was
also  “consistent with outright dismissal” (at p. 19).  The basis
for  this conclusion was that Ritchie Bros. stopped paying  Bowen
on June 27, 1993.
[16] In my view, this conclusion is erroneous.  The events which
led to Bowen’s departure from the company unfolded on June 23.
After that date he never again worked for Ritchie Bros.
Accordingly, the characterization of his departure must be made
as of June 23.  Either Bowen voluntarily quit his position or
Ritchie Bros. constructively dismissed him on that date.  Nothing
Ritchie Bros. did or said to Bowen on June 23 suggested that it
was dismissing him outright.</pre>
      <pre>(4)  Mitigation
</pre>
      <pre>[17]  The  case law establishes that in certain circumstances  an
employee’s  duty  to  mitigate  his  damages  when  he  has  been
dismissed  might require him to accept a position with  the  same
employer.   As  explained by McKinlay J.A. in  the  leading  case
Mifsud v. MacMillan Bathurst Inc. (1977), 70 O.R. (2d) 701 (C.A.)
at 709-10:
          </pre>
      <pre>          If  the employee leaves immediately,  he
          is  required to take reasonable steps to
          mitigate  his  loss  and,  barring   any
          agreement  to the contrary  between  the
          parties, any moneys earned in mitigation
          must be credited against his damages.
          </pre>
      <pre>          Is the situation substantially different
          when  an  employer  does  not  wish   to
          dismiss    an   employee   but,    being
          unsatisfied with his performance, or for
          some other valid reason, wishes to place
          him  in a different position at the same
          salary?  Why should it not be considered
          reasonable for the employee to  mitigate
          his  damages  by working  at  the  other
          position  for  the period of  reasonable
          notice,  or at least until he has  found
          alternative employment which he  accepts
          in mitigation?
          </pre>
      <pre>          The  fact  that the transfer  to  a  new
          position   may  constitute  in   law   a
          constructive    dismissal    does    not
          eliminate the obligation of the employee
          to look at the new position and evaluate
          it as a means of mitigating damages.
          
</pre>
      <pre>[18]  In  contrast to this passage, the trial judge in this  case
said, at p. 22:</pre>
      <pre>          In  my  view, fair-minded persons  might
          conclude   that  almost  any   situation
          where,   by   objective  standards,   an
          employer  makes a fundamental change  of
          an  employees’ employment, or changes  a
          significant  term  of  that   employment
          thereby  meeting the standards necessary
          to  establish constructive dismissal, is
          such  as to reasonably create an  attack
          upon  the  dignity and  stature  of  the
          employee and cause the employee to leave
          rather  than  accept the indignity  that
          would  be  such in the future  relations
          between the employee and the supervisor,
          and    having   the   situation   become
          intolerable.
          
</pre>
      <pre>[19]  In  my view, this equation in “almost any situation”  of  a
fundamental change in an employee’s position with an attack on an
employee’s  dignity  and  stature is  inconsistent  with  Mifsud.
There  may well be situations when such a change raises no  issue
of loss of dignity or stature.
[20] In Mifsud, after stating that the duty to mitigate might
require an employee to accept a different position with the same
employer, McKinlay J.A. went on to set out the factors which
should be considered on this issue.  She said, at p. 710:
          </pre>
      <pre>          Where  the  salary offered is the  same,
          where  the  working conditions  are  not
          substantially  different  or  the   work
          demeaning,   and  where   the   personal
          relationships    involved    are     not
          acrimonious  (as  in this  case)  it  is
          reasonable  to  expect the  employee  to
          accept    the   position   offered    in
          mitigation   of   damages    during    a
          reasonable  notice period, or  until  he
          finds acceptable employment elsewhere.
</pre>
      <pre>[21]  Ritchie Bros. offered Bowen the same salary in the proposed
new  position.  Moreover, the parties agree that Bowen enjoyed  a
good  working  relationship with his supervisors and  co-workers.
So  these factors tell in favour of Ritchie Bros.’ argument  that
Bowen should have accepted the new position in mitigation of  his
damages even if the employer’s conduct amounted to a constructive
dismissal of its employee.
[22] However, McKinlay J.A. also identified the factor of “where
the working conditions are not substantially different or the
work demeaning.”  The trial judge in the present case was alive
to this factor; he specifically referred to “the exception in
Mifsud” (at p. 22) and he engaged in an extensive analysis of the
evidence related to this factor.  He concluded that the location
and conditions of the ‘yard shack’ to which Bowen would be
assigned, especially when compared with the location of, and
amenities attached to, his previous position, constituted working
conditions that “would be both substantially different and
demeaning” (at p. 23).  With respect, I agree with this
conclusion.
[23] The appellant makes a second argument on the mitigation
issue.  It says that there was the possibility of a job in the
Industrial Plant Division of the company and that Bowen had a
duty to explore that possibility.  I disagree. The existence of
positions in the company is uniquely within the knowledge of
management.  If there was a position which the company wanted
Bowen to fill, it should have offered it to him in a clear
fashion.  A long-serving and respected employee, faced with the
loss of the position he has successfully filled, should not have
to wander around the employer’s premises exploring “the
possibility” of a different position.</pre>
      <pre>(5)  Damages
</pre>
      <pre>[24]  The appellant contends that the trial judge’s award of five
months salary in lieu of damages was outside an acceptable  range
and  that three months would be a more appropriate notice period.
I  disagree.   The  trial judge considered the relevant  factors,
including duration of employment, the employee’s age and  skills,
and the job market.  I cannot conclude that he made any error  in
principle  in  concluding  that a five-month  notice  period  was
appropriate.
[25] The appellant submits that Bowen should not have received a
$1,000 award in lieu of a bonus.  It takes the position that
bonuses were available only to employees who worked for the
company for the entire fiscal year.  Again, I disagree.  I see
nothing wrong in the trial judge’s decision to award Bowen a
prorated portion of his likely bonus given that it was the
employer which dismissed him from his position.  If a trial judge
could not make this type of discretionary award, then a looming
bonus entitlement date might serve as an unwarranted factor in
employers’ decisions about the dismissal of its employees.
[26] Finally, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s award of
$300.  It is true that the trial judge said that he was awarding
this amount “arbitrarily”.  However, he did offer a reason for
the amount, namely compensation during the notice period for a
modest salary increase Bowen had received before being
terminated.  Moreover, I note that the $1,000 award in lieu of
bonus was not a true proration of the annual $6,000 bonus Bowen
had received in previous years.  If one combines the almost two
months Bowen actually worked in fiscal year 1993-94 and the five-
month notice period, the prorated bonus award could have been
about $3,500.  Bowen did not cross-appeal on this point.  It
seems trivial that Ritchie Bros. would quarrel with a $300
component of an award.</pre>
      <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
      <pre>[27] I have found that the trial judge made three errors.  First,
he  should have permitted cross-examination of the employee about
job-related alcohol incidents.  However, in my view this was  not
a serious error.  The events which gave rise to Bowen’s departure
from  Ritchie Bros. took place on June 23, 1993 and  centered  on
Ritchie  Bros.’ proposal that Bowen be relocated  from  the  main
office  to  the  ‘yard  shack’.  In light of  the  trial  judge’s
findings about this potential relocation, it is obvious that  the
employer’s  sympathetic consideration of Bowen at earlier  stages
of  his  employment  would not, and should  not,  have  made  any
difference in the conclusion he reached.
[28] Second, the trial judge erroneously concluded that there had
been an outright dismissal of Bowen by Ritchie Bros.  This
conclusion is irrelevant in light of the trial judge’s correct
conclusion that Bowen had been constructively dismissed.
[29] Third, in one passage the trial judge said something
inconsistent with what this court said in Mifsud v. MacMillan
Bathurst Inc., supra.  However, his analysis continued beyond
this passage and he in fact applied Mifsud correctly.
[30] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
