</pre>
    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of second degree murder and
sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for
10 years.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The deceased died from a stab wound in the neck inflicted by
the appellant. It was the theory of the Crown that the deceased
and appellant had lost some cocaine earlier in the evening when
they were trying to make a sale to a third party. Each blamed the
other for the loss. The deceased decided to take some of the
appellant's property as restitution for the lost cocaine. The
appellant objected. They fought and the appellant stabbed the
deceased.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  No one saw the stabbing. Much of the Crown's case rested on
the evidence of the third party to whom the Crown alleged the
deceased and appellant had tried to sell cocaine earlier in the
evening. He testified that he had been with the deceased and
appellant and overheard the beginnings of the altercation which
led to the murder. There were many reasons to doubt this man's
veracity and the trial judge made it clear to the jury that they
should be cautious in acting on his evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant admitted that he stabbed the deceased, but he
contended that he did so in self-defence and without any
intention to apply force to the deceased. According to him, he
awoke early in the morning to find a burglar (the deceased)
removing property from his home. The appellant did not know this
person. The deceased was taking the property to his car parked on
the street. After asking the deceased to leave the home, the
appellant went back up the stairs and retrieved a large kitchen
knife. He kept the knife in his bedroom for protection because
there had been previous break-ins at his residence. The appellant
returned to the stairs and saw the deceased taking a microwave
oven from the house out to the car. The deceased returned to the
house and looked at the appellant on the stairs. When the
appellant asked the deceased to leave, the deceased responded
&quot;fuck you&quot; and attacked the appellant by grabbing him by the
throat. The appellant fell back against the railing of the stairs
and poked out with the knife in one quick jabbing motion. He was
not aware that the knife made contact with the deceased. The
deceased staggered away, stumbled around the living room, left
the residence and returned to his car. The deceased collapsed in
front of the house on his way back from the car. The appellant
went outside to see if he could help. He brought the deceased
back into his house and tried to stop the bleeding. He then
phoned 911.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant's defence rested in large measure on his own
testimony. However, there was independent evidence capable of
supporting his position. The appellant called 911 immediately
after the stabbing. He showed considerable concern for the
deceased and cooperated fully with the police when they arrived.
He made statements at the scene which were entirely consistent
with his evidence at trial. The nature of the lethal wound, a
single, somewhat shallow puncture wound to the neck area, also
offered some support for the appellant's version of events.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant alleges four errors in the instruction to the
jury.</pre>
    <pre>1) The non-direction on the after-the-fact conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge did not present the after-the-fact conduct
of the appellant as a package of circumstantial evidence from
which the jury could infer an absence of an intention to inflict
force or an absence of an intention to commit murder as defined
in s. 229(a). He did tell the jury in general terms that the
&quot;circumstances, the conduct, words, and demeanour of the accused
at and about the material times&quot; were relevant to the question of
intention.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  After-the-fact conduct, whether relied on by the Crown,
defence or both, is a specie of circumstantial evidence. Its
treatment by the judge in the charge to the jury will depend on
the nature of the evidence, the issues raised at trial and the
position of the parties. Considerable deference should be
afforded to the approach to the evidence taken by the trial
judge, particularly where it evokes no objection from counsel at
trial.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge could have presented the after-the-fact
evidence as a package of potentially exculpatory evidence. Had he
done so, he would have been required to present the Crown's
position with respect to that evidence. Depending on the jury's
view of the evidence, that conduct could be seen as consistent
with the conduct of someone who had lost his temper in the course
of an argument over a failed drug deal, stabbed the deceased and
then immediately regretted what he had done. Counsel, no doubt
aware that the trial judge could have dealt with the after-the-
fact conduct in more detail, both from the defence and Crown
perspective, made no objection to the trial judge's treatment of
the evidence. He was satisfied that the jury understood the
defence position on that evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Neither the position taken by counsel at trial nor the
nature of the evidence support the appellant's contention that a
more comprehensive instruction on the evidence was essential to a
fair and proper instruction.</pre>
    <pre>2) The reference to the appellant's failure to retreat in the
self-defence instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In the course of instructing the jury as to the objective
component of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, the trial judge said:</pre>
    <pre>          ... A failure to retreat, if there was an
          opportunity to do so, is only a factor to be
          considered in determining whether the accused
          believed on reasonable grounds that he could
          not otherwise preserve himself from death or
          grievous bodily harm.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Crown counsel had cross-examined the appellant to
demonstrate that the appellant could have taken steps to avoid
the confrontation which led to the homicide. The appellant agreed
that he could have locked the door while the deceased was
carrying the microwave out to the car. He resisted the suggestion
that it would have been appropriate for him to return up the
stairs to his room or flee out the back door while the deceased
was in the house.</pre>
    <pre>[13] It would have been better for the trial judge to avoid the
use of the word &quot;retreat&quot;, which suggests an abandonment of the
appellant's home, and to refer specifically to the other steps
which Crown counsel suggested the appellant could have taken to
avoid the confrontation. It would also have been appropriate for
the trial judge to tell the jury that the appellant's failure to
flee his own residence, unlike his failure to lock the front door
when the deceased was outside, or to move away from the front
door, could not assist the jury in determining whether the
accused's conduct met the objective component of the standard set
down in s. 34(2).</pre>
    <pre>[14] Reference to the word &quot;retreat&quot; was regrettable, but we
would not reverse were this the only shortcoming in the
instruction. The trial judge did not suggest that the possibility
of retreat was a significant consideration in determining whether
to give effect to the self- defence claim. We do not think any
reasonable jury would have held the appellant's failure to flee
his own home against him in deciding whether he acted in self
defence. There was no objection to this part of the instruction.</pre>
    <pre>3) The misdirection with respect to the Crown's obligation to
prove that the appellant intentionally applied force to the
deceased.</pre>
    <pre>[15] To prove that the appellant unlawfully assaulted the
deceased, the Crown had to prove that he intentionally stabbed
the deceased. If, when the knife made contact with the deceased's
throat, the appellant did not intend to apply that force, he
could not be convicted of either murder or manslaughter. The
trial judge referred to this possibility in his instructions,
although he clearly regarded it as a minor aspect of the case.
Unfortunately, he coupled his instruction that the Crown had to
prove that the application of force was intentional with an
instruction that the deceased's consent was irrelevant to the
question of whether the appellant intentionally applied force.
The presence or absence of the deceased's consent had nothing to
do with whether the appellant intentionally applied force with
the knife to the deceased. The question of the deceased's consent
also never arose on this evidence. The coupling of the concepts
of deliberate infliction of force and the consent to the
application of force could only confuse the jury and detract from
this part of the appellant's defence, which was that he did not
intend that the knife make contact with the deceased.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Were this the only error in the charge, we would apply the
curative proviso. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury
that they could convict of murder only if they were satisfied
that the appellant had either of the requisite intents set out in
s. 229(a) of the Criminal Code. The conviction on the charge of
second degree murder demonstrates that the jury were satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had one of those two
intentions when he stabbed the deceased. The existence of an
intention to cause death or an intention to cause bodily harm
that one knows is likely to cause death is entirely inconsistent
with the suggestion that the application of force was
unintentional or accidental.</pre>
    <pre>4) The misdirection as to the included offence of manslaughter.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Assuming the jury rejected self-defence, there were two
distinct and separate bases upon which they could convict of
manslaughter. If the Crown proved that the appellant deliberately
stabbed the deceased, but failed to prove either of the requisite
intents under s. 229(a), the appellant was guilty of manslaughter
(involuntary manslaughter). If the Crown proved all of the
essential elements of murder, but did not negate the defence of
provocation, then the accused was guilty of manslaughter
(voluntary manslaughter).</pre>
    <pre>[18] Unfortunately, the trial judge mingled and confused these
two separate routes to manslaughter in his initial instructions.
He said:</pre>
    <pre>          ... Guilty of manslaughter is the proper
          verdict premised on the following:</pre>
    <pre>          1)   Proof beyond a reasonable doubt that
          Davis was unlawfully killed by the accused by
          stabbing,</pre>
    <pre>          2)   You are not satisfied beyond a
          reasonable doubt that the accused has either
          of the special intents required for the
          murder at the time of inflicting the fatal
          wounds.</pre>
    <pre>          3)   Proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          unlawful act of stabbing was inherently
          dangerous to the extent, that objectively
          viewed, that act had a foreseeable
          consequence of harm which was neither trivial
          nor transitory.</pre>
    <pre>          4)   Proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          accused was not acting in self-defense
          pursuant to section 34(2). I will deal with
          that in a moment.</pre>
    <pre>          5)   The provisions related to provocation
          applies. I will describe them. ...</pre>
    <pre>[19] On this instruction, the jury could convict of manslaughter
only if they were satisfied both that the appellant lacked the
requisite intent and that he acted under provocation.
Furthermore, on this instruction, the jury could not consider
manslaughter if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the appellant had the requisite intent for murder. In
effect, voluntary manslaughter was excluded from the jury's
consideration by this instruction and involuntary manslaughter
was available only if &quot;the provisions related to provocation
applies.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[20] A later passage in the trial judge's instructions to the
jury more accurately described the two bases upon which the jury
could convict of manslaughter. He said:</pre>
    <pre>          You will find the accused guilty of
          manslaughter if you are satisfied beyond a
          reasonable doubt:</pre>
    <pre>          a)   You are satisfied beyond a reasonable
          doubt the accused unlawfully killed Davis,
          but you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable
          doubt the accused had either of those two
          specific intents required for murder at the
          time of inflicting the fatal wound. You are
          satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          unlawful act of the accused in stabbing Davis
          as he did was inherently dangerous to the
          extent that when subjectively viewed it had a
          foreseeable consequence of harm to Davis
          which harm was neither trivial nor
          transitory.</pre>
    <pre>          b)   Even if all the other elements of murder
          have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt,
          but you find the accused was acting under
          provocation, as I have defined, or if you
          have reasonable doubt on that issue.</pre>
    <pre>This instruction clearly implies that (a) and (b) are alternative
routes to a manslaughter conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Counsel for the appellant objected to the first of the two
instructions outlined above. He stressed that the two different
roads to manslaughter should be separated and dealt with
individually. The trial judge indicated &quot;I am not concerned about
that. I have your point.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[22] Perhaps because they had received conflicting instructions
on the constituent elements of manslaughter, the jury sent this
question to the trial judge during their deliberations:</pre>
    <pre>          Clarification of manslaughter versus second
          degree murder.</pre>
    <pre>[23] Counsel for the appellant renewed his earlier objection and
indicated that the jury should be clearly told that there are two
separate ways in which the jury could arrive at a manslaughter
verdict. Crown counsel agreed with this observation and
indicated:</pre>
    <pre>          It's important that the jury realize that you
          can arrive at the offence of manslaughter in
          one of two ways.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge recalled the jury and in the course of his
reinstruction, repeated verbatim the erroneous five point
instruction set out above in paragraph 18. He did not repeat the
correct instruction set out in paragraph 20.</pre>
    <pre>[25] After the jury had retired, counsel for the appellant, for
the third time, objected to the manslaughter instruction. He
pointed out that the trial judge had made the same error he made
in his original charge. Crown counsel agreed.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The trial judge recalled the jury and told them:</pre>
    <pre>          Now with regard to manslaughter, you will
          recall that I read to you what is referred to
          as the unlawful act aspect of it. You can
          come to a conclusion that this was
          manslaughter as a result of the unlawful act
          of the accused. Also, there is a second way
          to approach manslaughter, and that is if you
          are satisfied that the accused was provoked
          and struck out in the fashion that has been
          described. So there are really two ways of
          coming to a conclusion that the included
          offence of manslaughter applies. [Emphasis
          applies.]</pre>
    <pre>[27] After this instruction, defence counsel maintained his
position that the jury had not been adequately instructed as to
the two separate and distinct avenues to manslaughter. No
clarification was offered by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>[28] It is conceded by the Crown that the initial charge and the
initial response to the jury's question were wrong and confused
the two separate routes to manslaughter. The Crown contends,
however, that the ultimate instruction was correct and would have
effectively dispelled the misconceptions or confusion created by
the earlier instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[29] We cannot accept the Crown's submission. The jury was
concerned about the difference between manslaughter and murder.
They had received inaccurate and confusing instructions on that
issue in the initial charge and in the initial response to their
question. To effectively correct the earlier misdirections at
this crucial stage of the proceedings, the trial judge had to
make it clear to the jury that the earlier instructions were
wrong and should be disregarded. He had to make it clear to the
jury that they should take the law as he was now about to give it
to them. The final instructions fall far short of an explicit
correction of the earlier errors. They are open to the
interpretation that the trial judge was not correcting an error,
but was repeating the earlier instruction using different
language. The final instructions also do not offer either a clear
distinction between the two forms of manslaughter or a clear
instruction that manslaughter based on provocation was available
even if the jury were satisfied that the appellant had the intent
necessary for murder.</pre>
    <pre>[30] This misdirection was fatal. It went to an issue which was
apparently at the heart of the jury's deliberations. The evidence
against the appellant was far from overwhelming. It cannot be
said with any confidence that the verdict would necessarily have
been the same had the jury been properly instructed as to the
bases upon which they could return a verdict of manslaughter.</pre>
    <pre>[31] We would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a
new trial on the charge of second degree murder.</pre></td>
