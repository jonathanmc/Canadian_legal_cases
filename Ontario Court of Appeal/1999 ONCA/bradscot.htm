    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    Bradscot  argues  that  because  Bondfield’s  tender   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted 30 seconds after 1:00 p.m. on May 8th, it was submitted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after the tender deadline and could not be accepted by the School</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">“[t]enders  not  received by the time stated above  will  not  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted by the owner.”  The School Board takes the position that</font></pre>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The legal and factual context in which this issue arises  is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">important.  The submission of a tender in compliance with  tender</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructions  creates a unilateral contract between  the  general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractor  and  the  owner.1  This unilateral  contract  imposes</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights  and  obligations on the parties intended to  protect  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">promote  the  integrity  of  the tender  system.  One  obligation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">imposed  on  the owner is a duty of fairness to all tenderers.  A</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">duty of fairness is needed to prevent abuse and to ensure a level</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">playing  field. As Williams J.A. observed in Vachon  Construction</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ltd. v. Cariboo (Regional District)2:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
               On the other side, the tendering process
          is,   and   must  always  be,   a   carefully
          controlled process, since the opportunity for
          abuse  or  distortion is ever present.  While
          that  is not what happened in this case,  the
          process  must nonetheless be, and be seen  to
          be  fair to all bidders. For that reason, the
          process   is  often  attacked  for  technical
          reasons  and the law has accordingly  applied
          strict  rules  for  any  alteration  in   the
          process by both bidder and owner.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A  bid  submitted  after the tender deadline is invalid,  and  an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Last  minute  jockeying for advantage that accompanies  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tendering  process is ripe for abuse. Counsel advised  the  court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  tenders are typically submitted at the last moment  because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">general  contractors often receive price changes from their  sub-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contractors right up to the tender deadline. Usually tenders  are</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  completed and handed in until minutes or seconds before  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deadline.  Representatives of the general contractors  delivering</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">their  tenders often synchronize their watches with  the  owner’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">clock  so  they can monitor the deadline. The representatives  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bradscot and Bondfield monitored the School Board’s clock,  which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had  a minute hand but not a second hand. Bradscot submitted  its</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board’s clock registered 1:01 p.m. The School Board decided  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bondfield’s  tender was not late. I accept that  in  making  this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision  the  School  Board was acting in  good  faith  and  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">attempting to comply with its duty of fairness to all bidders.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]   To prevent abuse and ensure fairness in cases such as  this</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Unfortunately,  the evidence on the application  shows  that  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender  received 30 seconds after a tender deadline of 1:00  p.m.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is  late.  On  the  other side, the Hamilton Bid Depository,  the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Authority3, a judgment of Shaw J. of the British Columbia Supreme</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court, relied on by Bradscot. That case dealt with the timeliness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a tender delivered by Smith Bros. between 11:00 a.m. and 11:01</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a.m.  The  advertisement for the project and the instructions  to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a.m.”  and  “not later than 11:00 a.m.”  Shaw J. held that  Smith</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">considered the tender it would breach its duty of fairness to the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">extend  past 11:00 a.m. until almost 11:01 a.m. … In my  opinion,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">11:00  a.m. describes a precise point in time, not the time  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exists between 11:00 a.m. and 11:01 a.m…”4 He also held that  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact B.C. Hydro’s clock showed the time in hours and minutes  but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not in seconds made no difference.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11]  In the present case Somers J. chose not to follow the Smith</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bros. case, and instead took the opposite view. He concluded that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bondfield’s  tender  was  not invalid because  it  was  submitted</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before the clock reached 1:01 p.m. Somers J. held:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          In  my  opinion when it is stated  that  some
          deed is to be done “at 2:00 p.m.” the time is
          for  that  minute and the act is not  overdue
          until  the minute hand has moved off  the  12
          hand  to the :01 position. The fact that that
          invitation   to   tenderers  and   subsequent
          addenda used other words which could be given
          a stricter interpretation should be viewed in
          light  of two facts – (a) subsequent  addenda
          made   it  clear  that  the  time  they  were
          expressing  using the words  “at  4:00  p.m.”
          (for  example) were expressed as  superseding
          the   earlier  instructions  with  the   more
          stringent  words; (b) In any event the  words
          appear to have been used interchangeably  and
          there  is,  thus, a vagueness or  uncertainty
          which  should  not  permit  the  very  strict
          interpretation to be placed on them as sought
          by  the applicant. I am of the view that  had
          it  been the intention of the Board or of the
          architects   who  drew  the   invitation   to
          tenderers  that  a tender be made  in  strict
          manner suggested by the applicant, they would
          have  expressed the time as 1:00:00 and would
          have    used   the   more   stringent   words
          throughout. It follows from what I have  said
          that  on  the  basis  of  the  submission  of
          Bondfield of its tender at the time  it  did,
          does not render the tender invalid.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Second Issue:  Was  Bondfield’s Tender Invalid Because Its  Price
               Was Uncertain?
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13]  On this ground of appeal, Bradscot submits that Bondfield’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender  was invalid for two reasons. First, Bradscot argues  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bondfield’s tender  price was uncertain because it contained  two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">different amounts for the “basic stipulated sum”. Because of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">uncertainty Bradscot claims that Bondfield’s tender could not  be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accepted  by  the School Board. Second, Bradscot argues  that  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cure   this  uncertainty  the  School  Board  improperly  amended</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bondfield’s  tender  after it was submitted. Somers  J.  rejected</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both  these  arguments and I am not persuaded that  he  erred  in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doing so.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tenderer to set out in words and figures its tender price, called</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that  this sum was not to include the federal goods and  services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tax,  but  instead  that  tax  was to be  calculated  separately.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Paragraph  3 of the tender form provided for the GST calculation.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the amounts in paragraphs 2 and 3 did not match and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">amount  in  paragraph 2 was the tender price. Bondfield confirmed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its position by sending the following fax:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          We    herewith    confirm    our    telephone
          conversation  wherein  we  advised  you  that
          there  was  some  confusion with  the  tender
          amount  submitted today for  the  above-noted
          project.  The bid amount written in words  is
          correct and the bid amount written in numbers

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  amend  Bondfield’s  tender.  The  evidence  of  the  Board’s</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not  influenced by the telephone call or the fax from  Bondfield.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender was the operative  figure and that the different amount in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
                Here,  [in  paragraph 2]  there  is  no
          discrepancy between the printed and numerical
          price. The only problem that arises is in the
          subsequent   calculation   paragraph    which
          appears  to  be  superfluous  and,   on   the
          evidence, was not considered by the owners as
          being the operative part of the tender.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In   my   view,  nothing  turned   upon   the
          arithmetical  calculation required  to  apply
          the  appropriate tax to the contract  figure.
          The  muddling of these amounts occasioned  no
          doubt  by the press of time and the confusion
          witnessed by the deponent Zurkuhl resulted in
          a  clerical  error which should  not,  in  my
          view,  stand  in  the way of the  contracting
          parties   carrying  out  their  contract   to
          construct this project.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a  GST  calculation using the amount set out in paragraph  2.  In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that   sense  paragraph  3,  if  not  superfluous,  is  at  least</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">subordinate to paragraph 2. In my view, the error in paragraph  3</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">does  not disqualify the bid because it does not make Bondfield’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender price uncertain. That price is set out in paragraph 2, the</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alberta6,  but both are distinguishable. In Vachon, one  bid,  by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Can-form Construction, contained a discrepancy between the  price</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stated in words and the price stated in figures. After the tender</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deadline Can-form’s representative was permitted to amend the bid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by  selecting the lower price. This turned out to be  the  lowest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid and Can-form was awarded the contract. The next lowest bidder</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sued  for damages. Its action was dismissed at trial but  allowed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on appeal. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the price was uncertain Can-form’s tender was invalid when it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted;  and that the owner had breached its duty of  fairness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the  other tenderers by permitting Can-form to amend its  bid</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">after  the close of tenders. The case before us differs on  these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">two   points:   Bondfield’s  bid  price  was  not  uncertain  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">therefore no amendment was needed or made.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  figures.  The  owner,  the Alberta government,  accepted  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">tender  and  then took the position that it had  entered  into  a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">binding  contract  with PCL at the lower price.  PCL  brought  an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application  for a declaration that it was not bound.  While  its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application was pending, PCL negotiated a new contract  with  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Alberta government, because even at the higher price its bid  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">still  the  lowest.  This new contract was  subject  to  a  price</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">adjustment  depending on the result of the lawsuit.  The  Alberta</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Court  of  Appeal  held that PCL was not bound  by  its  original</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bid.  The  owner  was  acting unfairly and the  court  would  not</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board  was  acting in good faith and was honestly  attempting  to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          
          It  would  be anomalous indeed if  the  march
          forward  to a construction contract could  be
          halted by a simple omission to insert in  the
          appropriate blank in the contract the  number
          of  weeks already specified by the contractor
          in  its  tender. It would be a simple  matter
          for   the   contractor,  in   executing   the
          prescribed  form  after  having   fixed   the
          contract price and all other terms which were
          directly   dependent  upon  its  tender,   to
          complete  the  form in accordance  with  that
          tender  where  the  proffered  contract   was
          inadequate … I cannot conclude therefore that
          this omission has any bearing upon the rights
          of   the   parties   to   this   appeal   and
          specifically that it stands in the way of the
          owner in its assertion of its right to retain
          the tender deposit.8

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">material to his decision. The trial judge concluded, correctly in</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23]  In  its original notice of application Bradscot  sought  an</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">construction  of  the  project. However, while  this  appeal  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pending,  Bondfield  began construction because  of  the  Board’s</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concern  that the school be built by August 1999. In  this  court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bradscot asked to amend its notice of application to seek against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the School Board a reference or the trial of an issue on damages.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The School Board opposed the amendment. I need not deal with this</font></pre>
