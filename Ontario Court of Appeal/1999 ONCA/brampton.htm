    <pre>MÉTIVIER J.:
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[1]  These two appeals were heard together.  Both appeals involve
a municipality that exercises a right of distress on a
corporation&#146;s chattels for arrears of business taxes, thereby
creating a lien on the chattels by operation of law.  In each
case, before the municipality sells the distrained goods, the
corporation acts to engage the provisions of the Bankruptcy and
Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (&#147;BIA&#148;).  The common issue to
be decided in these appeals is as follows:
       Is a municipality, who exercises a right of distress on the
  goods of a taxpayer in arrears for business taxes, and who thus
  acquires a lien on such goods, a &#147;secured creditor&#148; for purposes
  of the BIA?</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In the Matter of the Proposal of Everingham Brothers
Limited, the City of Brampton (&#147;Brampton&#148;) seized a corporation&#146;s
chattels for arrears of business taxes, as it was entitled to do
under s. 400(2) of the Municipal Act,  R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45.1  As
a result of Brampton&#146;s exercise of this right of distress, it
acquired a lien on the seized goods.  Before the goods were sold,
the corporation filed a Notice of Intent to File a Proposal under
the BIA and a trustee was named.</pre>
    <pre> [3] When Brampton later took steps to proceed with the sale of
the corporation&#146;s goods, a motion was brought by the trustee
before MacKenzie J. for an order declaring that Brampton was
bound by the stay of proceedings under the BIA. 2  On September
24, 1997, MacKenzie J. found that Brampton was not a secured
creditor for the purposes of the BIA.  He held that &#147;the time the
lien comes into force is not determinative of the issue:  it is
the nature of the claim that must be examined having regard to
the operation of Section 136 and the [BIA] as a whole.&#148;  Brampton
appeals against this finding.  The respondent in this appeal is
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (Sun Life).  Sun Life is a
secured creditor of the bankrupt corporation that stands to
benefit if Brampton is denied secured creditor status.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In the Matter of the Bankruptcy of Pinestone Resort and
Conference Centre,  the Township of Dysart (&#147;Dysart&#148;) levied a
constructive distress against the goods of a corporation for
arrears of business taxes.  Before any action was taken with
respect to the goods, a receiving order was made adjudging the
corporation bankrupt and appointing a trustee in bankuptcy (the
&#147;Trustee&#148;).   Dysart filed a proof of claim as a secured creditor
which was disallowed by the Trustee.  Dysart appealed the
Trustee&#146;s disallowance and was successful before the Registrar.
The Trustee then appealed the Registrar&#146;s order before Rosenberg
J.  In a brief endorsement dated September 9, 1997,  Rosenberg J.
held that a municipality that acquires a lien by exercising a
right of distress over certain chattels because of unpaid taxes
is a secured creditor for all purposes, including the BIA.  The
trustee appeals against this finding.</pre>
    <pre>     The BIA</pre>
    <pre>     [5]  Parliament has exclusive power over bankruptcy and
insolvency by virtue of s. 91(21) of the Constitution Act, 1867,
being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1867 (U.K.), 1867, c. 11.
One of the main goals of the BIA is to provide for the orderly
distribution of the property of a bankrupt among his or her
creditors on a pari pasu basis.  The general rule is that all
creditors rank equally.  However, the BIA grants priorities to
certain unsecured creditors.  Specifically, section 136(1) of the
BIA mandates a distribution scheme that provides the order in
which certain unsecured creditors will be paid.  Fifth in that
list of priorities, is the following item:
      (e)  Municipal taxes assessed or levied against the bankrupt
  within the two years immediately preceding his bankruptcy, and
  that do not constitute a preferential lien or charge against the
  real property of the bankrupt, but not exceeding the value of the
  interest of the bankrupt in the property in respect of which the
  taxes were imposed as declared by the Trustee.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The entire list is prefaced by the following important
qualification:
       136. (1) Subject to the rights of secured creditors, the
  proceeds realized from the property of a bankrupt shall be
  applied in priority of payment as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     Positions of Parties</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It is common ground between the parties that provincial
legislation cannot affect the priorities set out in the federal
BIA.  The position of Brampton and Dysart (the &#147;municipalities&#148;)
is that their right to be treated as secured creditors for the
purposes of the BIA arises, not by way of a provincial statutory
lien, but by the operation of law arising from the statutory
right of distress.  As stated above, the provincial Municipal
Act, authorizes the right of distress over goods.  It is well
established that once that right is exercised a lien on those
goods is created:  Leavure v. Port Colborne (City) (1995), 22
O.R. (3d) 44 at 47-48 (C.A.).  The municipalities rely on that
lien for their inclusion in the definition of a &#147;secured
creditor&#148; in s. 2 of the BIA, which includes &#147;lien holders&#148;.
They submit that because the lien arises by operation of law, and
not by statute, the Municipal Act neither alters the priorities
established by the  BIA nor offends the paramountcy of the
federal legislation.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The parties who resist the municipalities&#146; position assert
that the Municipal Act effectively alters the established
priorities under the BIA to the extent that it allows
municipalities to be treated as  secured creditors in a
bankruptcy situation.  They base this submission on the fact that
the BIA has expressly provided that municipalities are to receive
payment for unpaid business taxes in accordance with the scheme
of distribution outlined in s. 136(1).  Moreover, where property
of a bankrupt is under seizure for taxes, the BIA provides that
the property must be turned over to the trustee in bankruptcy
(s.73(4)).  They submit that because the true effect of the
Municipal Act, direct or indirect, is to subvert the scheme of
priorities set out by Parliament, the provincial legislation is
inoperative to the extent that it conflicts with the BIA.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Since a bankrupt may own property in any province in the
country, it is important that the federal BIA be interpreted with
consistency in all of the provinces.  Provincial statutes, which
impinge on the operation of the scheme envisaged by the BIA, have
repeatedly been held to be inapplicable.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  For instance, in 1985, the Supreme Court of Canada, in
Deloitte Haskins and Sells Limited v. The Workers&#146; Compensation
Board, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 785 (&#147;Deloitte&#148;), considered whether a
section of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1973, (Alta.), c. 87,
conflicted with the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-3.
Specifically, the provincial legislation created a charge on an
employer's property for money owed to the Workers&#146; Compensation
Board.  In a bankruptcy situation the Workers&#146; Compensation Board
sought to rely on this charge to render it a secured creditor,
despite the fact that the Board was accorded a specific priority
under s. 107(1) of the Bankruptcy Act [now s. 136(1) of the BIA].</pre>
    <pre>[11] Wilson J., writing for the majority in Deloitte, held that a
claimant in bankruptcy could not claim under a provincial statute
to be a secured creditor for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act
and thereby avoid the priority accorded under s. 107(1).  She
stated at p. 806:
       It was not open to the claimant in bankruptcy to say:  By
  virtue of the applicable provincial legislation I am a secured
  creditor within the meaning of the opening words of s.107(1) of
  the Bankruptcy Act and therefore the priority accorded my claim
  under the relevant paragraph of s.107(1) does not apply to me. .
  . .   [This Position] cannot be supported as a matter of
  statutory interpretation of s.107(1) since, if the section were
  to be read in this way, it would have the effect of permitting
  the provinces to determine priorities on a bankruptcy, a matter
  within exclusive federal jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[12] It is thus clear that a claimant in a bankruptcy cannot, by
virtue of a provincial statute, claim to be a secured creditor
and thus avoid the priorities set out in the BIA.  The question
remains whether this result is any different where a creditor in
bankruptcy claims to be a secured creditor by acquiring a lien
which arises from the exercise of a right in a provincial
statute.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The Supreme Court of Canada recently considered the
relationship between the scheme of distribution under the federal
bankruptcy regime and a provincial statute in Husky Oil
Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R.
453 (&#147;Husky&#148;).   Husky dealt with The Workers Compensation Act,
1979, S.S. 1979, c. W-17.1, as it interacted with the Bankruptcy
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 [now the BIA].  The provincial statute
purported to create a debt to the Workers&#146; Compensation Board
that would survive a bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Gonthier J., writing for the majority, reviewed numerous
cases dealing with the constitutional relationship between the
scheme of distribution under the Bankruptcy Act and various
provincial statutes relating to property. In particular he
reviewed the following &#147;quartet&#148; of  Supreme Court Canada
decisions:
    ·    Québec (Deputy Minister of Revenue) c. Rainville (sub nom.
      Re Bourgault), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 35.
     </pre>
    <pre>    ·    Deloitte, supra.
     </pre>
    <pre>    ·    Québec (Commission de la santé et de la sécurité  du travail
       c. Banque fédérale de développement, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1061
      (&#147;F.B.D.B.&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>    ·    British Columbia v. Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd., [1989] 2
       S.C.R. 24 (&#147;Henfrey&#148;).
     
</pre>
    <pre>[15] In his review of this quartet Gonthier J. referred to
excerpts from  F.B.D.B., supra where Lamer J., speaking for the
court, confirmed that  Re Bourgault, supra and Deloitte, supra
yielded the proposition that:
          &#133;in a bankruptcy matter, it is the Bankruptcy
          Act which must be applied.  If a bankruptcy
          occurs, the order of priority is determined
          by the ranking in s.107 of the Act, and any
          debt mentioned in that provision must
          therefore be given the specified priority.
          [Emphasis added].3</pre>
    <pre>Also highlighted in Gonthier J.&#146;s review of F.B.D.B. are the
following comments by Lamer J. about the effect of provincial
statutes on the scheme of distribution under the Bankruptcy Act:
          As soon as the bankruptcy occurs, the
          Bankruptcy Act will be applied: the mere fact
          that a creditor is mentioned in s.107  of the
          Act suffices for such creditor to be ranked
          as a preferred creditor and in the position
          indicated in that provision.  As provincial
          statutes cannot affect the priorities created
          by the federal statute, consistency in the
          order of priority in bankruptcy situations is
          ensured from one province to another.
          [Emphasis added].4
          
</pre>
    <pre>[16] In Husky, Gonthier J. also quoted McLachlin J.&#146;s judgment in
Henfrey, supra, where the issue was whether a deemed statutory
trust created by provincial legislation was a valid trust for the
purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.  Gonthier J.
emphasized that McLachlin J. was &#147;at pains to stress that the
reality of the property interest created by the province ought to
govern over the form&#148; and quoted the following statement from
McLachlin J. in Henfrey:
          The province . . . argues that it is open to
          it to define &#147;trust&#148; however it pleases,
          property and civil rights being matters
          within provincial competence.  The short
          answer to this submission is that the
          definition of &#147;trust&#148; which is operative for
          purposes of exemption under the Bankruptcy
          Act must be that of the federal Parliament,
          not the provincial legislatures.  The
          provinces may define &#147;trust&#148; as they choose
          for matters within their own legislative
          competence, but they cannot dictate to
          Parliament how it should be defined for
          purposes of the Bankruptcy Act:  Deloitte
          Haskins and Sells Ltd. v. Workers&#146;
          Compensation Board.  [Emphasis added].5
          
</pre>
    <pre>[17] Gonthier J. was of the view that the quartet of cases
reviewed in Husky embodied &#147;. . . a consistent and general
philosophy as to the purposes of the federal system of bankruptcy
and its relation to provincial property arrangements&#148;6.  He
identified a number of related propositions flowing from this
general philosophy.</pre>
    <pre>[18] In particular, he cited with approval four propositions
taken from Andrew J. Roman and M. Jasmine Sweatman in their study
of the quartet,  &#147;The Conflict Between Canadian Provincial
Personal Property Security Acts and the Federal Bankruptcy Act:
The War is Over&#148;, (1992) 71 Can. Bar Rev. 77, at p. 78-79:
 (1)  provinces cannot create priorities between creditors or
      change the scheme of distribution on bankruptcy under s.136(1) of
      the Bankruptcy Act [now the BIA];
          </pre>
    <pre> (2)  while provincial legislation may validly affect priorities
      in a non-bankruptcy situation, once bankruptcy has occurred
      s.136(1) of the Bankruptcy Act determines the status and priority
      of the claims specifically dealt with in that section;</pre>
    <pre> (3)  if the provinces could create their own priorities or affect
      priorities under the Bankruptcy Act this would invite a different
      scheme of distribution on bankruptcy from province to province,
      an unacceptable situation; and</pre>
    <pre> (4)  the definition of terms such as &#147;secured creditor&#148;, if
      defined under the Bankruptcy Act, must be interpreted in
      bankruptcy cases as defined by the federal Parliament, not the
      provincial legislatures.  Provinces cannot affect how such terms
      are defined for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.7</pre>
    <pre>[19] Gonthier J. highlighted the importance of maintaining a
&#147;nationally homogenous system of bankruptcy&#148; and then added his
own propositions, which he felt also emanated from the quartet of
decisions:
          (5)  in determining the relationship between
               provincial legislation and the
               Bankruptcy Act, the form of the
               provincial interest created must not be
               allowed to triumph over its substance.
               The provinces are not entitled to do
               indirectly what they are prohibited from
               doing directly;</pre>
    <pre>          (6)  there need not be any provincial
               intention to intrude into the exclusive
               federal sphere of bankruptcy and to
               conflict with the order of priorities of
               the Bankruptcy Act in order to render
               the provincial law inapplicable.  It is
               sufficient that the effect of provincial
               legislation do so.8</pre>
    <pre>[20] With respect to conflicts between provincial laws and the
order of priorities under the Bankruptcy Act Gonthier J. stated
          . . . [W]hile individual provinces can define
          and rank categories such as &#147;secured
          creditor&#148; and &#147;trust&#148; as they each have their
          own purposes, those provincial laws which
          enter into conflict with the provisions of
          the Bankruptcy Act are simply without
          application in bankruptcy.9</pre>
    <pre>[21] In view of this restatement of the propositions enunciated
by the Supreme Court of Canada in Husky, the reasoning of the
municipalities cannot be accepted.  The argument that  a lien
created by operation of law from the exercise of a provincial
statutory right, is somehow different from a lien created
directly from the provincial statute  must be rejected.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Surely the lien is created indirectly by the statute:
without the statute there would be no right of distress, and
without the distress there would be no lien.  If the lien is not
created indirectly by statute, then the effect of the statute is
certainly to create a lien.  The creation of such a lien engages
the definition of &#147;secured creditor&#148; in the  BIA and thus alters
the priorities set out in s.136(1).  This is precisely the
reasoning that was expressly and repeatedly rejected by the
Supreme Court of Canada, as set out above.</pre>
    <pre>[23] This view is further strengthened by the fact that other
sections of the BIA contemplate the situation where a
municipality has seized goods for arrears of business taxes.  In
particular, s.73(4), directs that property under seizure is to be
delivered to the trustee, with a provision for payment of the
costs of  the distress:
     73.  (4) Any property of a bankrupt under seizure for rent or
  taxes shall on production of a copy of the receiving order or the
  assignment certified by the trustee as a true copy thereof be
  delivered forthwith to the trustee, but the costs of distress are
  a first charge thereon, and, if the property or any part thereof
  has been sold, the money realized therefrom less the costs of
  distress and sale shall be paid to the trustee.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24] In general terms, under s. 136(1), a municipality is given a
preference that is subject to the rights of secured creditors.
However, under s. 73(4) a municipality is given a first charge
that ranks ahead of secured creditors for the costs of the
distress.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[25] A municipality that exercises a statutory right of distress
on a taxpayer in arrears for business taxes, and consequently
acquires a lien is not a secured creditor for the purposes of the
BIA.   The BIA specifically grants municipalities a preferred
claim under s. 136(1) for arrears of business taxes.  The effect
of s. 400(2) of the Municipal Act is to alter the priorities of
distribution provided in s. 136(1) of the BIA.  Given the
paramountcy of the federal legislation and the need to provide
consistency between the provinces in cases of bankruptcy, s.
400(2) of the Municipal Act is inoperative to the extent that it
reorders the priorities of distribution under the BIA.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Accordingly, the appeal In the Matter of the Proposal of
Everingham Brothers Limited is dismissed with costs.  The appeal
In the Matter of the Bankruptcy of Pinestone Resort and
Conference Centre is allowed with costs.  The orders of Rosenberg
J. and of Registrar Ferron are set aside and the Notice of
Disallowance of Claim of the Appellant Trustee is hereby
confirmed.

or until the debtor goes into bankruptcy (s. 69(1)).  The
automatic stay provision does not apply &#147;to prevent a secured
creditor who took possession of secured assets of the insolvent
person for the purpose of realization before the proposal was
filed from dealing with those assets&#148; (s.69(2)).
