    <pre>OVERVIEW

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns the policy of the appellant, Dufferin-
Peel Roman Catholic Separate School Board (&#147;the Board&#148;),
prohibiting the promotion of a group of non-Catholic teachers
(&#147;the Teachers&#148;) hired by the Board.  The Teachers are
represented by the Branch Affiliates, the respondents in this
appeal.


[2]  A grievance submitted by the Teachers alleged in part that
the Board&#146;s promotion policy was unreasonable and contrary to the
collective agreement between the Board and its Teachers. The
teachers alleged that the Board&#146;s promotion policy was
unreasonable because it discriminated against non-Catholics
contrary to the equal employment provisions of s. 5 of the Human
Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H.19 (the Code).  Section 5 of the
Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of creed unless such
discrimination can be defended as a bona fide occupational
requirement pursuant to s. 24 (1)(a) of the Code. For ease of
reference the relevant portion of s. 24 of the Human Rights Code
is reproduced below:
</pre>
    <pre>               The right under section 5 to equal treatment with respect to
          employment is not infringed where,
               a)   a religious &#133; educational &#133;
          organization that is primarily engaged in
          serving the interests of persons identified
          by their &#133; creed &#133; employs only, or gives
          preference in employment to, persons
          similarly identified if the qualification is
          a reasonable and bona fide qualification
          because of the nature of the employment.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In reasons released concurrently in Daly v. The Ontario
Secondary Teachers&#146; Federation, s. 24 has been found by this
court not to be affected by the operation of s. 136 of the
Education Act, R.S.O. c. E.2, as that provision was found to
violate s. 93 of the Constitution Act.  Accordingly, for the
purposes of these reasons, s. 24 is presumed to be unaffected by
the scheme laid out in the Education Act.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The Board of Arbitration before which the grievance was
brought rejected the Teachers&#146; claim.  Before determining whether
the appellants&#146; policy was protected by s. 24 of the Code, the
Board of Arbitration was first required to determine if that
section was itself unconstitutional as a violation of s. 93 of
the Constitution Act, 1867.  The majority of the Board of
Arbitration1 concluded that the right to promote teachers to
positions of responsibility is a right that was enjoyed by Roman
Catholic Boards of Education in Ontario in 1867.  It is part of
the right to hire teachers and to manage schools expressly
granted under pre-Confederation legislation. The majority further
held that the power to manage was linked to the denominational
character of the schools under the Board&#146;s control. By virtue of
s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867 no law may prejudicially
affect any right or privilege that Roman Catholics had by law
concerning separate schools at the time of Confederation.
Therefore, the majority concluded that the application of s. 24
of the Code would prejudicially affect the right enjoyed by the
Board under s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 to manage
schools.  Accordingly, the Board denied the Teachers&#146; the relief
sought in their grievance without deciding whether the policy was
indeed protected by s. 24 of the Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The Teachers applied to the Divisional Court for judicial
review.2 The court held that s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act,
1867 does not absolutely prohibit provinces from legislating in a
way way which affects denominational schools; its reasons are
found at (1995), 128 D.L.R. (4th) 179.  McMurtry C.J.O.C., as he
then was, relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
in Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal v. Attorney
General of Quebec (1989), 57 D.L.R. (4th) 523 in coming to his
conclusion.  This decision holds that it is necessary to
distinguish between those aspects of the pedagogical regime which
are absolutely protected by s. 93(1), and other aspects that are
protected only to the extent necessary to maintain or give effect
to denominational guarantees. He implicitly held that the
promotion policy was protected only to the extent necessary to
maintain the denominational guarantee, stating at p. 183:</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The power to promote teachers in a denominational school
system may very well be related to the maintenance of the
denominational character of the system.  However the question
that must be asked in the circumstances of this matter is whether
a promotion policy based on a requirement for a specific
religious affiliation was necessary to maintain the
denominational character.  On the facts of this matter does the
application of the Human Rights Code in the words of s. 93 (1) of
the Constitution Act 1867 &#147;prejudicially affect any Right or
Privilege with respect to Denominational schools&#148;?

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  McMurtry C.J.O.C. then reviewed the decisions in Re Ontario
Human Rights Code1961-62 and Gore, an unreported decision
released December 7th, 1971, by W.S. Tarnopolsky, Chair of the
Board of Inquiry, and Re Caldwell et al and Stewart et al.(1984),
15 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) which rejected the argument that the
Human Rights Code prejudicially affected the rights held pursuant
to s. 93(1).   McMurtry C.J.O.C. held that the Board of
Arbitration should not simply have stated that the provisions of
the Human Rights Code did not apply to the Board&#146;s promotion
policy.  Rather, he held that the Board should have engaged upon
a determination as to whether the particular promotion policy was
a reasonable and bona fide occupational qualification within the
meaning of s. 24 of the Human Rights Code. Accordingly, he
allowed the Teachers&#146; appeal and e remitted the matter back to a
differently constituted Board of Arbitration.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  For the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that the
Divisional Court was correct. The Board of Arbitration failed to
correctly interpret s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and
thereby exceeded its jurisdiction.  In addition, the Board of
Arbitration erred in law because it failed to apply s. 24 of the
Human Rights Code. I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the
disposition of the Divisional Court.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The Board&#146;s impugned Promotion Policy was passed in March
1991 and provides, in part, as follows:
               1.   Effective September 1991, all persons promoted to the
          positions of responsibility [Principal, Vice Principal,
          Department Head, Assistant Department Head, Coordinator or
          Consultant], with the exception of those described in #4 below,
          must be baptized, practicing Catholics with a demonstrated
          commitment to Catholic education;</pre>
    <pre>               2.   The Board&#146;s hiring policy will be amended to include a
          provision that all candidates being considered for a teaching
          position with the Board will be made expressly aware, at the time
          of hire, that a qualification for promotion to a position of
          responsibility with the Board will be that they be Catholic;</pre>
    <pre>               3.   It is further recommended that candidates acknowledge
          having been informed by signing a prepared statement to that
          effect;</pre>
    <pre>               4.   Recognize that this is a &#147;Catholic&#148; system and a
          Catholic system imbued with a spirit of justice, that those non-
          Catholics currently employed by the Board be allowed to pursue
          their goals in Dufferin-Peel.
</pre>
    <pre>[10] Prior to passing this policy, the practice of the Board had
been to allow all teachers in the Branch Affiliates to apply and
be eligible for promotion.  The fact that a teacher was not a
Catholic, albeit a factor in the promotion process, was not an
automatic impediment to selection.
[11] The Board passed the Promotion Policy during a period of re-
evaluation of the separate school system.  Two factors were
particularly important in leading the Board to this decision:
               (i)  the extension, in 1985, of public funding for Catholic
          secondary schools in Ontario; and
               (ii) the increasing number of non-
          Catholic teachers at Catholic schools,
          resulting from a shortage of qualified Roman
          Catholics.
</pre>
    <pre>[12] In 1988, in response to these factors a task force was
convened to analyse the administrative and educational aspects of
the separate school system in Ontario.3  The task force issued a
report known as the COSS (Completion Office-Separate Schools)
Report.  In addition, the Ontario Separate School Trustees&#146;
Association issued a document entitled &#147;Guidelines for
Incorporating the Faith Dimension in the Teacher Personnel
Policies of Roman Catholic Separate School Boards&#148; (&#147;the
Guidelines&#148;).  Neither the COSS Report nor the Guidelines
explicitly prohibited the promotion of non-Catholics.  The
Guidelines did state leadership activity in the parish and the
local community was important and teaching personnel required a
significant participation in the religious life of the school.
The COSS Report and the Guidelines were one of the roots for the
Board&#146;s policy.
[13] The second root for the Board&#146;s policy was the concern that
an increasing number of non-Catholic teachers would be hired as a
result of the needs created by the extension of public funding to
the Catholic education system.  McMurtry C.J.O.C. stated at p.
181:
               The Board admitted before the Board of Arbitration that &#147;it
          did not do a thorough examination of the number of non-Catholics
          teaching in the system because it regarded the matter as one of
          principle&#148;.  The Board stated in that regard that its decision
          was not based on any hard evidence or statistics but rather as an
          impression and life experience about what was needed to protect
          the Catholicity of the system.  The Board also conceded that with
          respect to the &quot;roots&#148; of the Board&#146;s policy that the number of
          non-Catholics teaching in the system posed no serious threat to
          Catholicity.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[14] The effect of the Board&#146;s policy was to create three
different classes of non-Catholic teachers employed by the Board.
They were as follows:
               1.   non-Catholic teachers hired before September 1991 (when
          the policy was passed) who were not prohibited from reaching
          positions of responsibility because of their religion;
               2.   non-Catholic teachers who had been
          designated under s. 135 of the Education Act
          as teachers being transferred from the public
          school to the separate school system as a
          result of the extension of funding to
          Catholic sigh schools.  The Board was
          prohibited by s. 35(28) of the Education Act
          from discriminating against these persons in
          respect of their employment, advancement and
          promotion by the Board. The Catholic school
          boards did not contest this provision which
          was linked to the extension of funding;
               3.   non-Catholic teachers hired after
          September 1991 who were prohibited from
          positions of responsibility because of their
          religion.
</pre>
    <pre>[15] It is the third group of non-Catholic teachers who are the
subject of this appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[16] This appeal raises the following issues:
               1.   Did the Board of Arbitration fail to correctly
          interpret s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act?
               2.   Did the Board of Arbitration err in
          failing to apply s. 24 of the Human Rights
          Code?
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.        Did the Board of Arbitration fail to properly interpret
     s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act?
</pre>
    <pre>[17] It was conceded before this court that the appropriate
standard of review of the Board of Arbitration&#146;s interpretation
of s. 93(1) is that of correctness.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Section 93 (1) provides:
               In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively
          make Laws in relation to Education subject and according to the
          following Provisions:
               (1) Nothing in any such Law shall
          prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege
          with respect to Denominational Schools which
          any Class of Person have by Law in the
          Province at the Union.
          


</pre>
    <pre>[19] The Board&#146;s position in this appeal is that the right to
manage the schools within its jurisdiction, including the right
to adopt a policy that only Catholics may be promoted, is a right
which is protected by s. 93(1) of the Constitution.  The
imposition of an obligation to justify its policy as a bona fide
occupational requirement pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Human Rights
Code, it says, prejudicially affects this right and cannot stand.
[20] The opening words of s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867
clearly grant to the province the power to make laws in relation
to education.  That basic power is subject to the limitation that
the law cannot violate any right or privilege pertaining to
denominational schools existing at the time of Confederation:
Hirsch v. Protestant Board of School Commissioners of Montreal,
[1928] 1 D.L.R. 1041 (J.C.P.C.) at 1052.  There are two stages to
the constitutional analysis of the interpretation of s. 93(1).
Initially, one must determine whether there was a right or
privilege enjoyed by a particular class of persons by law at the
time of Confederation.  If so, one must go on to the second stage
of the analysis which is to determine whether the legislation at
issue prejudicially affects this right or privilege: Quebec
Association of Protestant School Boards v. Attorney-General of
Quebec (1993), 105 D.L.R. (4th) 266 (S.C.C.) at 306-307. Within
the first stage of the analysis concerning s. 93(1) one must
answer two questions. First, what was the extent of the power of
the Trustees at the time of Confederation?  Second, in what
measure is this power a &#147;Right or Privilege with respect to
Denominational Schools&#148;: Greater Montreal Protestant School Board
v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 377 at 405.
[21] Beginning with the first stage of the analysis, the power of
the Trustees at the time of Confederation is not in issue in this
appeal. It is not disputed that Catholics had, at the time of
Confederation, the right by law to employ teachers and the right
to manage their separate schools and that this right would
include the right to promote teachers. See, for example,
Reference re Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.) (1987), 40
D.L.R. (4th) 18 (S.C.C.) (the Bill 30 Reference). The question
here is the extent to which the power to promote teachers is a
&#147;Right or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools&#148;.
[22] As stated in Greater Montreal Protestant School Board,
supra, at 402, cited with approval by Iacobucci J. in Ontario
Home Builders&#146; Association v. York Region Board of Education
(1996), 137 D.L.R. (4th) 449 (S.C.C.) at 489:
               The approach courts have taken to the interpretation of the
          expression &#147;with respect to Denominational Schools&#148; in cases such
          as [Attorney General of Quebec v. Greater Hull School Board,
          [1984] 2 S.C.R. 575]  &#133;demonstrates that the law in force &#147;at the
          Union&#148; cannot on its own set the content of the constitutional
          rights in s. 93(1).

</pre>
    <pre>[23] The constitutional guarantee in s. 93(1) has both
denominational and non-denominational aspects: Greater Montreal
Protestant School Board, supra, at 410 citing the decision of
Chouinard J. in Attorney General of Quebec v. Greater Hull School
Board supra, at 584. The aim of s. 93(1) was to ensure equality
of educational opportunity for Roman Catholics: Ontario Home
Builders&#146; Association, supra, at 489. At the same time the
ultimate aim of the section is also a religious one: Greater
Montreal Protestant School Board, supra, at 411 citing with
approval the text of Professors Chevrette, Marx and Tremblay, Les
problemes constitutionnels poses par la restructuration scolaire
de l&#146;ile de Montreal (Quebec:  Ministere de l&#146;Educatoin, 1972).
A number of means to ensure that the denominational status of
education is respected are also protected by s. 93(1). The
following translated passage from the text of Professors
Chevrette, Marx and Tremblay was cited with approval by both
Beetz J. in  Greater Montreal Protestant School Board,, supra, at
410-411 and by Gonthier J. in Reference Re: Education Act
(Quebec), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 511 at 541:
               It should be noted that in themselves, and viewed in
          isolation, these means are not necessarily religious in nature,
          for they may include financial powers, the power to hire teachers
          and so on: however, such means should still be related to the
          denominational status of education directly and connected
          directly with maintaining it.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24] In other words one of the means of ensuring the
denominational status of education is through the power to hire
teachers.  In this regard, see the reasons of this Court in Daly
v. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#146; Federation, released
concurrently with these reasons.  The constitutional protection
in s. 93(1) applies to the power to hire teachers and,
inferentially, the power to promote teachers to the extent that
such power is related to maintaining the denominational character
of Catholic schools and education. The power to promote teachers
has been entrenched only in so far as this power is necessary to
maintain the denominational status of education. While the right
and privilege of Catholics to a denominational education in s. 93
obviously includes the means and framework in which the right is
exercised, the means to achieve that end are not themselves
constitutionally guaranteed. Gonthier J. made this clear when he
stated in Reference re: Education Act (Quebec), supra at 541-542
and at 579:
               I note that in G.M.P.S.B., supra, this Court has already
          held that rights of ownership, powers to hire staff and powers to
          use material resources are incidental rights that are only
          protected to the extent that they are necessary to preserve the
          denomination character of education. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[25] The Board of Arbitration ruled that the Board&#146;s promotion
policy was constitutionally protected.  It did so without
considering whether the policy was in fact justified under the
Human Rights Code.  However, in reaching its conclusion the Board
did not consider the second question within the first stage of
the constitutional analysis, namely, the extent to which the
power was a right or privilege with respect to denominational
schools. The Board of Arbitration ought to have considered that
the promotion policy was a means to an end, namely a
denominational system of education. As a means, the promotion
policy is constitutionally protected only insofar as it is
necessary to maintain or achieve that end.  As a result, the
Board of Arbitration failed to correctly interpret s. 93(1) of
the Constitution Act, 1867.</pre>
    <pre>     
     2.        Was the Divisional Court correct in concluding that the
     Board of Arbitration erred because it failed to apply s. 24 of
     the Human Rights Code?
</pre>
    <pre>[26] In the first part of my reasons I concluded that the
Trustees&#146; right to promote teachers was constitutionally
protected only insofar as it was necessary to maintain a
denominational system of education. It is now appropriate to go
on to the second stage of the analysis concerning s. 93(1) and
determine whether s. 24 of the Code prejudicially affects the
rights or privileges guaranteed at the time of Confederation.
[27] The Board of Arbitration held that the right of the Separate
School Board to manage separate schools to preserve their
denominational character was not subject to any review under the
Human Rights Code.  In reaching this conclusion the Board of
Arbitration erred. The province has the power to pass laws and to
regulate certain aspects of Catholic education so long as that
power is exercised in conformity with s. 93(1): Reference re Act
to Amend the Education Act (Ont.) (1987), 40 D.L.R. (4th) 18
(S.C.C.) per Wilson J. at p. 55. It does not follow from the fact
that the power to promote teachers existed at Confederation that
the equality provisions of the Human Rights Code automatically
have no application. The Board should have inquired whether the
application of s. 24 of the Code prejudicially affected a right
or privilege guaranteed by s. 93(1).
[28] As stated in Re Ontario Human Rights Code 1961-62 and Gore,
supra, cited by McMurtry C.J.O.C. with approval, at p. 184 of the
reasons below:
               Section 93(1) could not have been intended, therefore, to
          prevent the legislature from enacting any law which affects the
          rights and powers of Separate School Boards&#133;it could not be
          argued that the province could not today apply, for example,
          collective bargaining or trade union legislation to the separate
          schools merely because in 1867 such legislation did not exist.
          If recognition of trade unions or teachers&#146; associations can now
          be made applicable to school boards, despite the fact that there
          could be an argument that school boards were free to ignore such
          associations in 1867, then surely the province could decide to
          apply the Ontario Human Rights Code to schools unless the
          discrimination practised by the school board is such as can be
          described as being a &#147;reasonable occupational qualification&#148;.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[29]  The appellant Board submits that the application of the
bona fide occupational requirement standard should only be
applied if its right to pursue its promotion policy is not
protected by s. 93(1).  I have already determined that the policy
itself is not protected.  Rather, it is only to the extent that
the policy is necessary to preserve the denominational aspect of
the school that the policy is protected.  Section 24 of the Human
Rights Code provides an objective means by which to measure the
extent to which the policy in this case is necessary to maintain
the denominational aspect.  If the policy is a bona fide
occupational requirement, it surely can be said to be necessary
to the preservation of denominational education. Hence the
application of s. 24 to the policy does not prejudicially affect
the denominational guarantee in s. 93(1); on the contrary, it is
consistent with it.
[30] In Re Caldwell, et al v. Stuart et al. (1984), 15 D.L.R.
(4th) 1 at 17 (S.C.C.), McIntyre J. was dealing with the
application of the equality provision of the Human Rights Code in
the context of a dismissal for denominational cause.  The
contract of a teacher at a Roman Catholic school was not renewed
because she married a divorced person in a civil ceremony.  In
his reasons, McIntyre J. noted that he had had occasion to
consider the nature of a bona fide occupational requirement in
Ontario Human Rights Com&#146;n et al. v. Borough of Etobicoke (1982),
132 D.L.R. (3d) (S.C.C.) 14 under different statutory provisions.
He held, at 16-17, that the test of a bona fide occupational
requirement has two branches.  The first is subjective.  It is
whether the limitation has been imposed honestly and in good
faith.  There is no issue here as to the Board&#146;s good faith.  The
second branch, as adapted to the circumstances of dismissal for
denominational cause, was phrased as follows:
               Is the requirement of religious conformance by Catholic
          teachers, objectively viewed, reasonably necessary to assure the
          accomplishment of the objectives of the Church in operating a
          Catholic school with its distinct characteristics for the
          purposes of providing a Catholic education to its students?
          
</pre>
    <pre>[31] A similar test is appropriate in the present case. The
essence of the test may be phrased in this way: &#147;Is the policy of
prohibiting certain non-Catholic teachers from promotion,
objectively viewed, reasonably necessary to preserve the Catholic
nature of the schools?&#148; If so, the policy would be a reasonable
and bona fide employment qualification within the meaning of s.
24 of the Code.
[32] The Divisional Court was correct in concluding that the
Board of Arbitration erred because it failed to apply s. 24 of
the Human Rights Code. I would accordingly confirm the order of
the Divisional Court remitting the issue to a differently
constituted Board of Arbitration.
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[33] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal with costs
to the respondents and confirm the order of the Divisional Court.

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1 Board member Warren Winkler dissented.  He held that at the
time the School Board entered into the 1990-1992 collective
agreement with the Branch Affiliates it was aware of the
implications of the Constitution in respect to Separate schools
and denominational rights. At that time the practice of the Board
had been to allow all teachers in the Branch Affiliate to apply
and be eligible for promotion.  The fact that a teacher was not a
Catholic was a factor in the selection process but was not an
automatic impediment to selection. As a result he held the Board
could not unilaterally declare its denominational rights to be
prejudicially affected by its own previous practices without
first demonstrating that the change in policy was required and
reasonable.
2 Saunders J. concurred in the decision of McMurtry C.J.O.C.
White J. wrote separate reasons agreeing that the decision of the
Board should be quashed and that the matter should be remitted to
a differently constituted Board. White J. disagreed on the
standard of review to be applied to the Board&#146;s decision.
McMurtry C.J.O.C. held that the decision should not be subject to
judicial review unless the decision was patently unreasonable.
White J. held that insofar as the Board was dealing with rights
that existed at the time of Confederation a standard of
correctness was to be applied. On this appeal it is not in issue
that insofar as s. 93(1) is concerned the Board was required to
be correct.
3 The task force was comprised of the Ontario Separate School
Teachers&#146; Association, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers&#146;
Association, the Ontario Conference of Catholic Bishops, the
Ontario Supervisory Officers&#146; Association, the Ontario Separate
School Business Officials&#146; Association, the Federation of
Catholic Parent-Teacher Associations of Ontario, and the
