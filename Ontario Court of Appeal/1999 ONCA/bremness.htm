               &#150;and&#150; McGEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LIMITED

    <pre>               Geoff R. Hall, for the respondent
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Wilkins J. dated March 3, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We released an endorsement in this matter on February 24,
1999 allowing the appeal &#147;with costs&#148;.  Counsel for the appellant
has asked us to clarify the decision on the issue of the
disposition of the costs below.
[2]  We agree with counsel for the appellant that this is not a
case to which Cameron v. Julien (1957), 9 D.L.R. (2d) 460 is
applicable and that leave to appeal was not required to appeal
from the order for costs made by Wilkins J.
[3]  We further agree with counsel for the appellant that this
court has jurisdiction to clarify or amend the order for costs
made on the disposition of the appeal.
[4]  Having regard to the result in this court, we are all of the
view that the costs of the appeal and of the proceedings that led
to the judgment of Wilkins J. should be assessed on the party-and-
party scale of costs appropriate to the quantum of the
appellant&#146;s ultimate recovery from the respondent, and we direct
that the formal order of this court disposing of this appeal be
amended accordingly.</pre>
