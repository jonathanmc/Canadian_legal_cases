    <pre>OSBORNE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal by Mrs. Brett from the April 17, 1997 judgment
of the Honourable Madam Justice Speigel1 requires the court to
consider four issues:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.    Was the trial judge correct in dismissing Mrs. Brett&#146;s
      claim for retroactive child support?
2.    Did the trial judge err in rejecting Mrs. Brett&#146;s
submission that the equalization payment to which Mr. Brett was
entitled should be less than one-half the difference between the
parties&#146; net family properties?
3.    Did the trial judge err in requiring Mrs. Brett to pay
pre-judgment interest on the equalization payment that she was
required to pay Mr. Brett?
4.    Did the trial judge err in awarding costs of the action
to Mr. Brett?</pre>
    <pre>THE EVIDENCE AND THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Mr. and Mrs. Brett were married in Ireland in 1962. They
emigrated to Canada in 1964. They separated in 1980 and were
divorced in 1995. They have five children who at the time of
trial were age 32, 29, 25, 22 and 18.
[3]  Mrs. Brett commenced this action in 1980. In it she claimed
spousal support, child support and an unequal division of family
and non-family assets under the Family Law Reform Act, S.O. 1978.
In November 1980 Mrs. Brett obtained an order of exclusive
possession of the parties&#146; jointly owned matrimonial home. At
that time the children were 3, 7, 10, 14 and 17. The issue of
interim child support was adjourned sine die. As it turned out,
Mrs. Brett did not pursue her claim for interim child support.
Instead she sought retroactive child support at trial in 1995.
[4]  In 1985, Mr. Brett took custody of one of his five children.
I will refer to that aspect of this matter further when I deal
with Mrs. Brett&#146;s claim for retroactive child support. In 1989,
Mr. Brett was granted leave to file an amended statement of
defence and counter-claim in which he claimed an equalization
payment to be determined in accordance with s. 5(1) of the then
relatively new Family Law Act, S.O. 1986, c. 4. He also claimed
pre-judgment interest on the equalization payment. Examinations
for discovery were held in the Fall of 1991. There followed
motions by both parties to compel financial disclosure and
answers to undertakings.
[5]  Mrs. Brett is a physiotherapist. She registered her first
physiotherapy clinic, the High Park Physiotherapy Clinic, in
1967. In short order, Mrs. Brett owned and operated three
physiotherapy clinics. In 1969, Mr. Brett left his employment
with the Ford Motor Company and began working full time at Mrs.
Brett&#146;s High Park Physiotherapy Clinic. In 1982, he started his
own physiotherapy clinic, Queensway Physiotherapy Centre and in
1991 he established a second clinic, Lakeshore Physiotherapy
Clinic.
[6]  The trial judge found that between 1981 and 1994 Mrs.
Brett&#146;s earned income totalled $8,350,000. She found that Mr.
Brett&#146;s income in the same period was $1,600,000. Mrs. Brett
takes some issue with Mr. Brett&#146;s income; she contends that some
of his income was not included or was understated. That aside,
Mrs. Brett&#146;s income clearly exceeded Mr. Brett&#146;s in the period
identified by the trial judge in her reasons for judgment. It is
clear that both Mr. and Mrs. Brett have been financially
successful.
[7]  Mr. and Mrs. Brett&#146;s income from 1985 through 1993, as found
by the trial judge was:
                                            </pre>
    <pre>Year                       Husband          Wife
1985                       $69,242          $384,558.62
1986                       229,807          266,466.78
1987                        79,119          625,336.70
1988                       131,723          578,691.21
1989                       117,996          742,832.75
1990                       151,543          514,041.92
1991                       142,582          816,516.25
1992                       253,672          980,667.86
1993                       167,706          1,156,173.84
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Manifestly, both Mr. and Mrs. Brett have achieved financial
success since their separation. It is apparent that on a
comparative basis Mrs. Brett has done better than Mr. Brett.
[9]  The trial judge found that Mrs. Brett&#146;s net family property
as of the valuation date was $1,125,041.22. She found that Mr.
Brett&#146;s net family property was $646,583.29. She also found that
Mrs. Brett&#146;s net worth at the time of trial was about $7 million
more than Mr. Brett&#146;s.
[10] No issue is taken with the assets constituting the net
family properties or the value attached to those assets. In
addition, Mr. Brett&#146;s ability to pay retroactive child support is
not in issue. Mrs. Brett&#146;s position is that retroactive child
support should be set off against the equalization payment that
she is required to pay to Mr. Brett. I will thus limit my
references to evidence that is material to Mrs. Brett&#146;s claim for
retroactive child support and her submission that the trial judge
erred in not reducing the equalization payment that she was
required to pay. Evidence material to those issues mainly concern
post-separation events.
[11] For the first two years following separation, Mr. Brett did
not tell Mrs. Brett or his children where he was living. He said
that he was not anxious that his children know about his then
very modest accommodations.  He did, however, maintain contact
with the children. The trial judge found that he spent some
weekends at the matrimonial home, during which he looked after
the children while Mrs. Brett pursued other activities. He was
occasionally invited by Mrs. Brett to join the family for Sunday
dinner.
[12] In 1985, the parties&#146; daughter Deidre, who was then 15,
indicated that she wanted to live with Mr. Brett. Mrs. Brett
opposed this move. As a result, Mr. Brett brought an application
for custody of Deidre. Eventually, Mrs. Brett consented to Deidre
living with Mr. Brett. That arrangement began in the Summer of
1986. In December 1994, Mr. Brett advised Deidre that he planned
to remarry. She did not approve of the proposed marriage and thus
decided to return to live with Mrs. Brett in the Spring of 1995.
[13] After Deidre moved in with him, Mr. Brett assumed almost all
of the responsibility for her child care expenses including the
cost of her university education. Prior to this, Mrs. Brett had
absorbed all of the child care expenses related to Deidre.
[14] Mrs. Brett supported Kieran from the date of separation
until 1991 when Kieran became a student at St. Andrew&#146;s College
in Aurora. At that time Mr. Brett assumed responsibility for all
expenses related to Kieran&#146;s tuition and board and Mrs. Brett
ceased to have any financial responsibility in respect of Kieran.</pre>
    <pre>RETROACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT</pre>
    <pre>[15] On the basis of Mrs. Brett&#146;s calculations, she spent
$760,000 supporting the children during their dependency. At
trial, she sought retroactive child support of $500,000.
[16] Mrs. Brett proffered a 6-part explanation for her failure to
seek interim child support from 1980, when she and Mr. Brett
separated, to 1995 when this action came to trial:
     </pre>
    <pre>       Her energies were totally consumed in the operation of her
        physiotherapy enterprises and raising five children;
     </pre>
    <pre>       She did not want her children to think that their father had
        to be dragged into court to secure child support;
     </pre>
    <pre>       She believed that child support-related litigation would
        upset the children, particularly having regard to the stress to
        which they were exposed by the separation of their mother and
        father. In addition, her son Shane suffered from asthmatic
        episodes when confronted with the prospect the separation of his
        mother and father. Mrs. Brett wished to avoid imposing additional
        stress on him in particular;
     </pre>
    <pre>       She feared Mr. Brett because of his threats and alleged
        Irish Republican Army connections;
   </pre>
    <pre>       Her goal was to settle, not litigate;
     </pre>
    <pre>       She believed that she could deal with the issue of child
        support at the point in the litigation where settlement was
        discussed, or at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[17] By the time Mrs. Brett sought child support (at trial) only
Kieran was a dependant child and Mr. Brett was supporting him.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The trial judge found that Mrs. Brett was not particularly
concerned about dragging Mr. Brett into court to force him to pay
child support, or about the impact that course of action would
have on any of the children. She rejected Mrs. Brett&#146;s evidence
that she feared Mr. Brett because of his threats or his IRA
connections. The trial judge concluded that Mrs. Brett&#146;s wished
to settle the litigation but, only on her terms.   In the end,
the trial judge found that Mrs. Brett proceeded on the basis that
she would not claim interim child support, but would instead
attempt to set off her entitlement to child support against the
equalization payment that she might be required to pay Mr. Brett.
[19] In the circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to
conclude that Mrs. Brett did not need interim child support for
the children and that she chose not to make a claim for interim
child support. She was aware of her rights to pursue a claim for
interim child support. Her best friend was an experienced family
law lawyer and she was represented by another able experienced
family law lawyer throughout the 15 years that elapsed from the
date the action was commenced until it was tried.
[20] The purpose of child support is to assist the custodial
parent in meeting the day-to-day expenses of raising children. It
is often said that children should have the right to support by
the non-custodial parent.  However, where the custodial parent
with full knowledge of that right chooses not to pursue a claim
for interim child support, particularly where the custodial
parent and the children do not need child support in the pre-
trial period, it is open to a trial judge to reject the custodial
parent&#146;s claim for retroactive child support. See Passero v.
Passero, [1991] O.J. No. 406 (Gen. Div.) and Blumenkranz
v.Blumenkranz, [1993] O.J. No. 574 (Gen. Div.). There is no room
for a judge-made rule, for example, that after a particular
number of years a custodial parent&#146;s claim for child support
would be extinguished. This would not be sound policy. Claims for
retroactive child support should be considered on a case-by-case
basis.
[21] There is no evidence that any of the children suffered from
a lack of financial support during the period of their respective
dependencies. Throughout that period Mrs. Brett was financially
able to provide ample support for the children. If a retroactive
child support order were to be made now, as a purely practical
matter, the support paid would have nothing to do with the needs
of the children, or their support. In the circumstances of this
case, having regard to the trial judge&#146;s findings of fact, Mrs.
Brett chose not to make a claim for child support, electing to
deal with that issue to achieve a credit against her obligation
to make an equalization payment to Mr. Brett.
[22] This ground of appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>THE EQUALIZATION PAYMENT</pre>
    <pre>[23] Mrs. Brett submits that it would be unconscionable to award
Mr. Brett one-half the difference between her net family property
and his. At trial, she relied on ss. 5(6)(f) and (h) and on s.
5(7). Section 5(6) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               5. (6)    The court may award a spouse an amount that is
          more or less than half the difference between the net family
          properties if the court is of the opinion that equalizing the net
          family properties would be unconscionable, having regard to,
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  a spouse&#146;s failure to disclose to
                    the other spouse debts or other liabilities
                    existing at the date of the marriage;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  the fact that debts or other
                    liabilities claimed in reduction of
                    a spouse&#146;s net family property were
                    incurred recklessly or in bath
                    faith;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (c)  the part of a spouse&#146;s net
                    family property that consists of
                    gifts made by the other spouse;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (d)  a spouse&#146;s intentional or
                    reckless depletion of his or her
                    net family property;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (e)  the fact that the amount a
                    spouse would otherwise receive
                    under subsection (1), (2) or (3) is
                    disproportionately large in
                    relation to a period of
                    cohabitation that is less than five
                    years;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (f)  the fact that one spouse has
                    incurred a disproportionately
                    larger amount of debts or other
                    liabilities than the other spouse
                    for the support of the family;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (g)  a written agreement between
                    the spouses that is not a domestic
                    contract; or
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (h)  any other circumstance
                    relating to the acquisition,
                    disposition, preservation,
                    maintenance or improvement of
                    property. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[24] Section 5(7) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               5. (7)     The purpose of this section is to recognize that
          child care, household management and financial provision are the
          joint responsibilities of the spouses and that inherent in the
          marital relationship there is equal contribution, whether
          financial or otherwise, by the spouses to the assumption of these
          responsibilities, entitling each spouse to the equalization of
          the net family properties, subject only to the equitable
          considerations set out in subsection (6).
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[25] On her appeal, Mrs. Brett did not rely on s. 5(6).  She did
not pursue the argument that she made at trial that s. 5(6)(f)
and (h) were engaged and could thus provide the statutory basis
upon which the trial judge could find that equalizing the
parties&#146; net family properties would be &#147;unconscionable.&#148;
Instead, Mrs. Brett focused her submissions on this issue
exclusively on s. 5(7). She submitted that since Mr. Brett
before, and particularly after, the date of separation, did not
contribute equally to child care, household management and
financial provision, s. 5(7) provides an independent basis &#150; a
basis separate from s. 5(6) &#150; to find unconscionability and thus
reduce the equalization payment to which Mr. Brett would be
entitled if the scheme set out in s. 5(1) of the Family Law Act
were to be followed.
[26] The trial judge found that Mr. Brett&#146;s contributions to
household management, financial provision and child care,
particularly after the date of separation, were not equal to the
contributions of Mrs. Brett. However, she concluded that &#147;the
lack of equal contribution to the financial provisions of the
children on the part of the husband does not render it
unconscionable for him to receive the equalization payment to
which he is otherwise entitled.&#148;
[27] I see no need to review the trial judge&#146;s findings in any
detail. It will be sufficient to note that she found that after
the separation Mr. Brett did not abdicate his child care
responsibilities. She accepted that after separation Mrs. Brett
&#147;made a life for herself and her children.&#148;  She further found
that although Mr. Brett had some presence in the children&#146;s lives
he was to play a relatively insignificant role. Significantly,
the trial judge found that Mrs. Brett was &#147;quite content&#148; with
the child care arrangements that existed after the separation.
When she dealt with financial contributions for the children&#146;s
benefit, the trial judge noted that Mr. Brett supported Deidre
from 1986 through 1994 and paid for her university education. He
also paid all of the costs of Kieran&#146;s attendance at St. Andrew&#146;s
College from 1991 to the date of trial. This cost was about
$25,000 a year. In addition, as the trial judge noted, Mr. Brett
took the children out for dinner periodically, took them skiing
and on vacation.
[28] The trial judge also considered the financial circumstances
of the parties. She concluded, consistent with the evidence, that
there was a significant difference between the post-separation
income earned by Mr. and Mrs. Brett. The differential in the
period after the date of separation was $6.5 million.
[29] Mrs. Brett submits that the trial judge failed to consider
s. 5(7) in determining whether equalizing the parties&#146; net family
properties would be unconscionable. Mrs. Brett further submitted
that it is only where there is an equal contribution by the
spouses to child care, household management and financial
provision that the spouses&#146; net family properties should be
equalized. Put another way, Mrs. Brett&#146;s submission is that where
there is evidence that there was not an equal sharing of child
care, household management and financial provision
responsibilities, equalizing the parties&#146; net family properties
would be unconscionable.
[30] I do not agree that the trial judge did not consider s. 5(7)
of the Family Law Act and that in proceeding as she did, the
trial judge erred by not taking into any real account the fact
that Mr. Brett did not pay child support for six years following
the separation. She set out the provisions of s. 5(7) in her
reasons and considered the evidence, sometimes conflicting, in
respect of child care and financial provision, particularly as it
related to the children. These are s. 5(7) issues.
[31] Even if I were to accept Mrs. Brett&#146;s submission that a
finding of unconscionability can be made through s. 5(7), I am
satisfied that the trial judge&#146;s findings, including her finding
that equalizing the parties&#146; net family properties would not be
unconscionable, are supported by the evidence. Moreover, her
reasons reveal no misapprehension of the evidence, or other
reviewable error.
[32] I would, however, take it further. In my view, in the
statutory scheme established by the Family Law Act, the issue of
unconscionability must be determined under s. 5(6). Section 5(7)
simply sets out a statement of the purpose of  the equalization
scheme established by Part I of the Family Law Act.
[33] Section 5(7), which as I have said, sets out in statutory
language, the purpose of the Family Law Act&#146;s provisions for the
equalization of the spouses&#146; net family properties, is made
Ssubject only to the equitable considerations&#148; set out in s.
5(6), (a) to (h). It seems to me that the legislature intended
that the equalization of net family properties be varied up or
down only through s. 5(6), that is only if, having regard to the
s. 5(6) factors, the equalization of net family properties would
be unconscionable. That was made clear when s. 5(7), on which
Mrs. Brett relies, was made subject to s. 5(6). It is only s.
5(6) which permits a departure from the basic statutory scheme &#150;
the equalization of net family properties.
[34] None of the factors set out in s. 5(6) (a) to (h) require
the court to examine the spouses&#146; respective contributions to
household management, child care and financial provision. If this
was to be an area of specific inquiry to determine if the
equalization of net family properties would be unconscionable,
the factors listed in s. 5(6) would have been expanded.2   In my
opinion, the Legislature intended to limit those circumstances in
which the spouse&#146;s net family properties would not be equalized.
In establishing the equalization of net family properties in the
Family Law Act, the Legislature did not intend for the courts to
undertake a post-mortem examination of the minutia of the sharing
of responsibilities to determine if equalizing the spouses&#146; net
family properties would be &#147;unconscionable.&#148;
[35] Since it is accepted that there is nothing in s. 5(6) that
would sustain Mrs. Brett&#146;s position with respect to the
equalization payment, this ground of appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST</pre>
    <pre>[36] The trial judge found that the assets which gave rise to the
equalization payment were for the most part liquid, income-
generating assets or assets that appreciated in value over the
relevant period of time. I think that she exercised a discretion
which was open to her when she ordered Mrs. Brett to pay pre-
judgment interest to Mr. Brett from the date when he gave notice
in writing of his claim for an equalization payment &#150; November
22, 1988. She carefully considered this issue and, followed this
court&#146;s judgment in Burgess v. Burgess (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 547.
No issue is taken with the interest rate which the trial judge
determined by roughly calculating the average prime interest rate
over the pre-judgment period. I would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>COSTS</pre>
    <pre>[37] In awarding Mr. Brett party and party costs the trial judge
exercised a discretion that was clearly open to her. There is no
basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s costs order.
I would not grant leave to appeal costs.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[38] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs. I
would deny leave to appeal the order of costs made at trial.
