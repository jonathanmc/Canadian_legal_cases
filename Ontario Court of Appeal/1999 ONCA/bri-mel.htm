               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         September 29, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Madam Justice
MacDonald dated June 1, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants commenced a proceeding (application #1)
seeking an order that certain restrictive covenants were &#147;no
longer binding&#148; by operation of certain notice provisions in the
Registry Act.  They lost at trial and they lost on appeal.
Immediately after their unsuccessful appeal, the appellants
commenced a second proceeding (application #2) seeking an order
discharging the very same covenants on the basis that the
covenants were inadequately identified in the operative deed.
[2]  The respondents moved for a permanent stay of application #2
on the basis of res judicata.  The respondents contended that the
claim advanced in the second proceeding could have and should
have been advanced in the first proceeding.  The motion judge
accepted that submission.  So do we.
[3]  The applicable law is set out in McQuillan v. Native Inter-
Tribal Housing and Co-Operative Inc. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 46 at
50:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; The doctrine of res judicata, in its wider
          application, prevents a person from relying
          on a claim or defence which he or she had the
          opportunity of putting before the court in
          the earlier proceedings but failed to do so.
          This principle was adopted by the Supreme
          Court of Canada in Maynard v. Maynard, [1951]
          S.C.R. 346 at pp. 358-59, [1951] 1 D.L.R. 241
          (citing the often-quoted words of Wigram V.C.
          in Henderson v. Henderson (1843), 67 E.R.
          313, 3 Hare 100 (Eng. V.C.)):
               </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; where a given matter becomes the
               subject of litigation in and of
               adjudication by a court of
               competent jurisdiction, the Court
               requires the parties to that
               litigation to bring forward their
               whole case and will not (except
               under special circumstances) permit
               the same parties to open the same
               subject of litigation in respect of
               matter which might have been
               brought forward as part of the
               subject in contest, but which was
               not brought forward only because
               they have from negligence,
               inadvertence or even accident,
               omitted part of their case. The
               plea of res judicata applies,
               except in special cases, not only
               to points upon which the Court was
               actually required by the parties to
               form an opinion and pronounce a
               judgment, but to every point which
               properly belonged to the subject of
               litigation and which the parties,
               exercising reasonable diligence,
               might have brought forward at the
               time.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In both applications, the appellants sought an order to the
effect that the restrictive covenants did not limit their ability
to deal with their land.  They advanced one argument in support
of that position in the first application, and seek to advance a
second and different argument on this application.  If the
appellants wanted to rely on both arguments, they should have
advanced them on the first application.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
