    <pre>                ENDORSEMENT
                          </pre>
    <pre>[1]      Leave to appeal having been granted, the
appellant appeals from the judgment of the Summary
Conviction Appeal Court dismissing his appeal from
conviction by the Honourable Judge Cole for driving
while impaired.

[2]  The appellant submits that as a matter of law
the trial judge committed reversible error in making
the following observations:</pre>
    <pre>               At the request of Counsel, I watched the video
          tape of most of what happened in the police station,
          as did two of the accused&#146;s friends or at least co-
          workers, Mr. Beshay, who was the manager of the club
          and Mr. McEwen, whom I have all ready referred too.
          They testified that from their observation of the
          video, the accused did not seem to be very different,
          certainly in his walk and on the use of his hands as
          demonstrated on the video. However, I had the
          opportunity, during the course of hearing the accused
          testify in the witness box and compared it with my
          notes and my recollections of what he said about his
          speech on the video tape. To my mind the accused&#146;s
          speech on the video tape is noticeably slurred. He
          responded to questions late. His responses to
          questions was asked of him, things put to him, in my
          opinion, are clearly consistent with someone who had
          been drinking.
          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  It is submitted that this passage violated the admonition by
Sopinka J., in dissent, in R. v. Nikolovski (1996) 111 C.C.C.
(3d) 405 at 425. In our opinion, there was no error on the part
of the trial judge in making his own comparison of
the speech of the appellant as revealed in a police
video with his observations of the appellant when
testifying in the witness box.  A trial judge is not
a mere observer in a criminal trial.  Where, as here,
he is called upon to decide on the weight to be given
to the opinions of an expert and two associates of
the appellant who looked at the video in open court
and gave opinions as to whether the appellant&#146;s speech as
revealed in a police video indicated that he was impaired by
alcohol, he is certainly entitled to bring his own
observations and judgment to bear in determining if
he will accept those opinions.

[4]  There is no suggestion that the trial judge&#146;s
personal observations were pivotal to the
appellant&#146;s conviction of driving while impaired.
The Crown led the evidence of a citizen who
followed the appellant and of the police officers
who followed them both. These two witnesses gave
evidence as to the manner of the appellant&#146;s
driving and as to his state of impairment upon the
vehicle being stopped.

[5]  The trial judge concluded by summarising the
evidence as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>               I also think that I am entitled, the video
          having been presented to me, to examine the whole of
          the accused&#146;s behaviour, his mannerisms, his
          gestures, his movements, his speech on the video tape
          in an attempt to determine whether or not I am
          satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt in all of the
          circumstances that the accused&#146;s ability to drive a
          motor vehicle was impaired at the time of the
          driving. I am so satisfied. I find cumulatively that
          from the initial observations of Mr. Fortin, the
          observations of Officer Hele at the scene when he
          stopped the Cadillac and spoke to the accused, and
          from what I saw on the videotape. I am satisfied
          considering the authorities that the accused&#146;s
          ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and
          find him guilty of that charge.

[6]  The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge committed no
error in law in dismissing the appellant&#146;s appeal against
conviction. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
