    <pre>HEARD:         May 17 and 18, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Mr. Justice Scime, with a jury, on

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  While the appellant raised a number of issues we called upon
Crown counsel to respond to only one of those issues, namely the
cross-examination of the appellant concerning  her failure to
call corroborative evidence.  The appellant was extensively cross-
examined on her failure to produce corroborative evidence in
respect of two critical aspects of the defence case, namely the
existence of Debbie McFarlane and the appellant's own appearance
at the time of the offences.  This cross-examination went beyond
merely testing the strength of the defence case.  Crown counsel
also emphasized  this issue in his closing address.
[2]  In our view, in these circumstances it was incumbent on the
trial judge to give the jury proper limiting instructions as set
out in R. v. Dupuis (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 496.
[3]  This is not a case for the application of the proviso in
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code notwithstanding the
failure of trial counsel to object.  This was a fundamental
matter as it may have impacted on the burden of proof.  The
appellant testified, and the jury was obviously troubled by this
case and by this issue in particular, as disclosed in their
questions during the deliberations.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the convictions set
aside, and a new trial ordered.</pre></td>
