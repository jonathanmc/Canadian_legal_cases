    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice D. M. Belch on
November 6, 1998 and from the sentence imposed
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following his trial on a four-count indictment before Belch
J. sitting without a jury, the appellant was convicted of one
count of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code
and was sentenced to a period of incarceration of two years less
one day. He appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal
his sentence.
[2]  The complainant was 13 years of age at the time of trial.
She testified that, when she was 11 years old, she resided on
Sunnyside Road, in the City of Kingston, between June and October
1996 and that in October 1996, she moved to a residence in
Harrowsmith, Ontario. Two counts on the indictment related to a
single incident alleged to have occurred at the Sunnyside Road
residence. The other two counts related to a number of incidents
alleged to have occurred at the Harrowsmith residence.
[3]  The trial judge convicted the appellant of sexual assault on
the basis of the complainant&#146;s evidence regarding the single
incident at Sunnyside Road. However, he was not satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt of the incidents alleged to have occurred at
the Harrowsmith residence and acquitted the appellant of those
two counts.
[4]  First, the appellant submits that the trial judge
misapprehended the evidence before him as it related to the
Sunnyside Road allegations and that his misapprehension was
central to the verdict of guilt on the one count. Second the
appellant submits that the trial judge erred in relying on the
complainant&#146;s previous consistent statement to the school nurse
as supportive of her evidence and in further relying on certain
aspects of the  appellant&#146;s own testimony as also supportive of
her version of events. The appellant concedes that it was not
necessary for the trial judge to find supportive evidence in
order to support his finding of guilt but argues that, given the
difficulties raised by the complainant&#146;s evidence and the fact
that the trial judge evidently thought it wise to look for
supporting evidence before convicting the appellant, this court
cannot be satisfied that the result would have been the same in
the absence of those findings.
[5]  We would give effect to both grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Misapprehension of evidence
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In considering the testimony of the complainant, the trial
judge considered certain &#147;implausible matters&#148; raised by the
defence. In particular, the trial judge stated that he was
&#147;bothered&#148; by the fact that the complainant had allegedly been
awakened by the appellant calling her or yelling at her to come
to his room and that no one else was awakened. The trial judge
purported to resolve this difficulty by reviewing the
complainant&#146;s evidence on this point. In our view, the
complainant&#146;s testimony does not in any way assist in resolving
this perceived difficulty. We can only conclude that the trial
judge misapprehended her evidence on that point. Given that the
trial judge identified this feature of the complainant&#146;s evidence
as an important one, we accept the appellant&#146;s position that this
misapprehension of evidence appeared central to the verdict.
</pre>
    <pre>          2.   Supportive evidence</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In his reasons, the trial judge specifically inquired
whether there was any &#147;supportive evidence&#133; capable of inducing a
rational belief that the [complainant] is telling the truth.&#148; In
answer to his query, he first found support for the complainant&#146;s
evidence in &#147;the spontaneous flow&#148; of her statement provided to
the school nurse.
[8]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to consider the
manner in which the complainant had first disclosed the
allegations of sexual impropriety in assessing the credibility of
her testimony. Given the trial judge&#146;s specific reference to the
spontaneity of the prior statement as opposed to any of its
contents, we are not satisfied that he erred in considering the
prior consistent statement in the prohibited manner, namely as a
form of self-corroboration.
[9]  The trial judge then went on to consider whether there was
further supportive evidence and concluded that some of the
complainant&#146;s statements were corroborated by the accused
himself. He gave two examples of the consistency in their
evidence: (a)  as to the time of retirement to bed and (b) on the
question whether the complainant&#146;s little brother went into the
appellant&#146;s room at night.
[10] In our view, the first example provides no assistance in
assessing the credibility of the complainant. The time of
retirement to bed is far too remote from the allegations in
question. In so far as the second example is concerned, it is our
view that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence. The
complainant did not provide evidence on this point beyond saying
that she did not know if her little brother went into the
appellant&#146;s room.
[11] In our view, these errors related to matters identified by
the trial judge himself as important to his verdict. It is clear
from the result at trial and from the trial judge&#146;s reasons for
judgment that issues of credibility were central to the
determination of guilt or innocence and that the case was a close
one. Hence we are satisfied that the verdict must be set aside
and a new trial ordered. In view of this result, it is not
necessary to deal with the sentence appeal.</pre>
