    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Lederman J. dated October 16, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  appeal from a judgment of  Lederman  J.,</pre>
    <pre>sitting  as a motions judge, in which he dismissed a  motion</pre>
    <pre>brought  by  the defendant Tony Quintieri seeking  an  order</pre>
    <pre>lifting  a  writ  of  seizure  and  sale  obtained  by   the</pre>
    <pre>plaintiff.

</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The factual background giving rise to this appeal  can</pre>
    <pre>be  briefly  stated.  Quinto Shoes and its  directing  mind,</pre>
    <pre>Tony  Quintieri, leased space for a shoe store in a shopping</pre>
    <pre>mall  owned by the respondent Buland Empire Development Inc.</pre>
    <pre>In  December  1994  the tenants left the  store,  apparently</pre>
    <pre>without  notice.   The  tenants also removed  the  inventory</pre>
    <pre>before  the landlord had an opportunity to distrain  on  the</pre>
    <pre>goods.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The landlord launched an action against the tenants and</pre>
    <pre>brought  a motion for summary judgment.  Marchand J. granted</pre>
    <pre>the  motion;  he wrote a one-page endorsement  in  which  he</pre>
    <pre>stated:</pre>
    <pre>         
         I  am  satisfied that the respondent  has
         failed  to  raise  a  genuine  issue  for
         trial  and am further satisfied  that  he
         has fraudulently removed or caused to  be
         removed  goods  from the  premises  of  a
         value   of   $90,000  contrary   to   the
         provisions  of Sect. 50 of  the  Landlord
         and Tenant Act.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In light of this finding, Marchand J. granted judgment</pre>
    <pre>for liquidated damages of $16,906.96 and punitive damages of</pre>
    <pre>$180,000.   The punitive damages component of the  judgment</pre>
    <pre>flowed  from  s.50 of the Landlord and Tenant  Act,  R.S.O.</pre>
    <pre>1990, c. L.7, which provides:</pre>
    <pre>          
          50.  If a tenant so fraudulently removes, conveys away or
               carries off the tenant&#146;s goods or chattels, or if any person
               wilfully and knowingly aids or assists the tenant in so
               doing, or in concealing them, every person so offending
               shall forfeit and pay to the landlord double the value of
               such goods or chattels, to be recovered by action in any
               court of competent jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   None  of  the  defendants, including  Tony  Quintieri,
appealed  Marchand J.&#146;s judgment.  On January  3,  1997  the
landlord  filed a writ of seizure and sale with the  Sheriff
in  York Region.  On January 6, 1997 Mr. Quintieri filed  an
Assignment  in  Bankruptcy.  He received  a  discharge  from
bankruptcy  nine  months later, on  October  6,  1997.   The
landlord received notice of the discharge hearing but  chose
not  to  oppose the discharge.  The Certificate of Discharge
released Mr. Quintieri &#147;from all debts except those  matters
referred  to  in  subsection 178(1)&#148; of the  Bankruptcy  and
Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The  landlord refused to lift the writ of seizure  and
sale it had obtained.  Accordingly, Mr. Quintieri brought  a
motion  seeking to have it lifted.  Lederman  J.  heard  the
motion  and, in a short endorsement released on October  16,
1998,  refused to grant the relief sought by Mr.  Quintieri.
Lederman J. stated:</pre>
    <pre>          The  Defendant has argued that the  debt
          arising from the operation of Section 50
          of  the Landlord and Tenant Act has been
          discharged  by  his bankruptcy  and  his
          discharge    from    bankruptcy,     and
          accordingly the Plaintiff is  no  longer
          entitled to collect on its judgment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The    Plaintiff   relies   on   Section
          178(1)(e)  of  the BIA  (Bankruptcy  and
          Insolvency  Act)  and submits  that  the
          Defendant&#146;s  discharge  from  bankruptcy
          does not release the Defendant from &#147;any
          debt or liability for obtaining property
          by   false   pretences   or   fraudulent
          misrepresentation.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  Defendant submits that although the
          judgment against him has made a  finding
          of  fraud, it relates to the removal  of
          his   own  goods  and  chattels  whereas
          Section   178(1)(e)   relates   to   the
          obtaining of property of the creditor by
          false     pretences    or     fraudulent
          misrepresentation.    I   believe   that
          Section 178(1)(e) must be given a  broad
          interpretation   as   it   is   remedial
          legislation and is sufficiently wide  to
          encompass  a  situation where  a  tenant
          fraudulently  removes his  own  property
          for   the   purpose  of   avoiding   the
          possibility  of the landlord distraining
          upon   those   goods.    But   for   his
          fraudulent conduct, those goods could be
          distrained  by the landlord  and  become
          the   landlord&#146;s   property.    In   the
          circumstances that would constitute  the
          obtaining  of property by the tenant  by
          false pretences.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Mr. Quintieri appeals from Lederman J.&#146;s decision.

</pre>
    <pre>B.   Legal Issues</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The appellant&#146;s Notice of Appeal identifies a single</pre>
    <pre>legal issue.  It is expressed as follows:
</pre>
    <pre>        1.   The learned motions judge erred in law in finding that
           a judgment in favour of the Plaintiff against the Defendant,
           Tony Quintieri has not been discharged under Section 178(2)
           of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act by virtue of the
           application of Section 178(1)(e).
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   In  its factum, the respondent raises a second issue.</pre>
    <pre>The respondent asserts that if Lederman J. was incorrect in</pre>
    <pre>his  interpretation  of s.178(1)(e) of the  Bankruptcy  and</pre>
    <pre>Insolvency  Act,  (&#147;BIA&#148;) the same result could  have  been</pre>
    <pre>reached by virtue of s.178(1)(a) of the same statute.   The</pre>
    <pre>respondent did not make this argument before Lederman J.  In</pre>
    <pre>spite  of  this,  the  appellant does not  object  to  this</pre>
    <pre>argument  being raised for the first time on  this  appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Accordingly, the interpretation of s.178(1)(a) of the BIA is</pre>
    <pre>a second legal issue on the appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[10] It will be recalled that the appellant&#146;s Certificate of</pre>
    <pre>Discharge  from  bankruptcy released him  &#147;from  all  debts</pre>
    <pre>except those referred to in subsection 178(1)&#148; of the  BIA.</pre>
    <pre>The  respondent asserts that the debt owed  to  it  by  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant  pursuant to Marchand J.&#146;s judgment continues  in</pre>
    <pre>existence because it comes within two paragraphs, namely (a)</pre>
    <pre>and (e), of s.178(1).

</pre>
    <pre>[11] Section 178(1) provides, in relevant parts:</pre>
    <pre>          
          178(I)   An order of discharge does  not
          release the bankrupt from
          </pre>
    <pre>            (a)  any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order
               similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order,
               imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt
               arising out of recognizance or bail;
</pre>
    <pre>&#133;..</pre>
    <pre>            (e)  any debt or liability for obtaining property by false
               pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.
</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Since  the  only  issue before Lederman  J.  was  the</pre>
    <pre>interpretation of s.178(1)(e) of the BIA, we will deal with</pre>
    <pre>that  issue  first.  Then we will consider the  s.178(I)(a)</pre>
    <pre>issue.

</pre>
    <pre>(a)  Section 178(1)(e) of the BIA</pre>
    <pre>[13] In his judgment, Lederman J. equated fraudulent removal
by  a  tenant  of his own property with false pretences  or
fraudulent  misrepresentation.  The appellant asserts  that
this conclusion is wrong because the removal of goods is an
entirely  different activity than the making of statements.
We agree with this submission.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) defines the</pre>
    <pre>verb  &#145;misrepresent&#146; as &#147;give a false or misleading account</pre>
    <pre>of  the  nature of&#148;.  The noun &#145;pretence&#146; is defied as  &#147;an</pre>
    <pre>attempt to make something that is not the case appear to be</pre>
    <pre>true.&#148;   It is clear from these definitions that  the  core</pre>
    <pre>content  of  the phrases &#145;false pretences&#146; and  &#145;fraudulent</pre>
    <pre>misrepresentation&#146; is deceitful statements.

</pre>
    <pre>[15]  There is nothing in the record before either Marchand</pre>
    <pre>J. or Lederman J. to establish that the appellant ever said</pre>
    <pre>anything about the removal of goods from the store.  Indeed,</pre>
    <pre>the Statement of Claim prepared by the landlord asserts that</pre>
    <pre>the tenants engaged in unlawful conduct, namely, failing to</pre>
    <pre>pay rent, vacating the premises and removing stock.  One can</pre>
    <pre>sympathize with Lederman J.&#146;s desire to give s.178(1)(e) &#147;a</pre>
    <pre>broad   interpretation  as  it  is  remedial  legislation&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>However,  such  an interpretation must be anchored  in  the</pre>
    <pre>conduct proscribed by the provision.  That conduct is false</pre>
    <pre>statements which the landlord did not claim, and Marchand J.</pre>
    <pre>did not find, had been made by the tenants.

</pre>
    <pre>(b)  Section 178(1)(a) of the BIA</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Marchand  J.&#146;s  judgment in the  action  between  the</pre>
    <pre>parties was in favour of the landlord for liquidated damages</pre>
    <pre>of $16,906.96 and punitive damages of $180,000.  The latter</pre>
    <pre>amount  was  imposed pursuant to s.50 of the  Landlord  and</pre>
    <pre>Tenant  Act  (&#147;LTA&#148;), which permits a landlord  to  recover</pre>
    <pre>double  the  value of any goods fraudulently  removed  from</pre>
    <pre>leased premises by a tenant.  The respondent contends  that</pre>
    <pre>this   portion   of  the  appellant&#146;s  debt  survives   the</pre>
    <pre>appellant&#146;s  discharge  from bankruptcy  because  it  comes</pre>
    <pre>within s.178(1)(a) of the BIA.  For convenience, I set  out</pre>
    <pre>again the relevant portion of this provision:</pre>
    <pre>          
          178(1)  An order of discharge  does  not
          release the bankrupt from
          </pre>
    <pre>            (a)  any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order
               similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order,
               imposed by a court in respect of an offence &#133;.
</pre>
    <pre>[17] The respondent submits that the punitive damages award</pre>
    <pre>of $180,000 is an order similar in nature to a penalty, that</pre>
    <pre>it  was  imposed  by a court, and that  it  relates  to  an</pre>
    <pre>offence.  In our view, the respondent fails on the first and</pre>
    <pre>third of these propositions.
</pre>
    <pre>[18]  The  nature  of the penalties which  will  survive  a</pre>
    <pre>discharge from bankruptcy was considered by this  court  in</pre>
    <pre>Simone  v. Daley (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 215 (Ont.  C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>Blair J. (ad hoc) stated, at pp 227-28:</pre>
    <pre>          An   analysis   of  the  provisions   of
          subsection 178(I) shows that  the  types
          of  debt which survive a bankruptcy  may
          be divided into four overall categories,
          namely,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (1)  Those which have been imposed by a court in the form of
             a fine or some other penalty for an offence against the
             state (paragraph (a)); &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  Jerrard  v.  Peacock, supra,  Master
          Funduk  &#150;  an  experienced  official  in
          matters   of  this  nature  &#150;  subjected
          section  178 to the following  analysis,
          which in my opinion is an accurate  one.
          At pp. 62-63 he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               
               Considering   the   new   start
               object  ingrained in  the  Act,
               the  logical interpretation  of
               the two subsections in question
               is  that subs. (2) creates  the
               general   principle  (being   a
               release  from all  debts)  with
               subs. (1) being an exception to
               the      general     principle.
               Subsection      (2)       [sic]
               establishes exceptions, not the
               principle, and must  be  viewed
               in that light. &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>               All  of  the exceptions in  the
               section are based on what might
               be  classed  as  an  overriding
               social policy.  In other words,
               they  are  the kinds of  claims
               which   society  (through   the
               legislators) considers to be of
               a  quality which outweighs  any
               possible benefit to society  in
               the bankrupt being released  of
               these obligations.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Paragraph (a) is essentially an
               administra-tion   of    justice
               concept. The liabilities caught
               by  it  will be in relation  to
               criminal    or   quasi-criminal
               matters.
               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>See  also:  B. (S.M.A.) v. H. (J.N.), [1994] 4  W.W.R.  281
(B.C.S.C.).</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[19] The underlined passages from the judgments of Blair J.</pre>
    <pre>(ad  hoc)  and  Master Funduk establish that  the  type  of</pre>
    <pre>penalty covered by s.178(1)(a) of the BIA is one imposed for</pre>
    <pre>an offence against the state, in either a criminal or quasi-</pre>
    <pre>criminal  context.  Section 50 of LTA is not that  type  of</pre>
    <pre>penalty.  It is a penalty, admittedly a harsh one,  imposed</pre>
    <pre>in a civil action.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Additionally, the penalty imposed by s.50 of the LTA is</pre>
    <pre>not an offence under that Act.  Section 122 creates offences</pre>
    <pre>and penalties of fines for violation of several sections of</pre>
    <pre>the Act.  The sections of the Act relating to the fraudulent</pre>
    <pre>removal of goods by the tenant are not included in s.122.

</pre>
    <pre>[21]  For  these reasons, s.178(1)(a) of the BIA  does  not</pre>
    <pre>immunize  the  &#145;double penalty&#146; component of Marchand  J.&#146;s</pre>
    <pre>judgment from the appellant&#146;s discharge from bankruptcy.

</pre>
    <pre>Disposition

</pre>
    <pre>[22] The appeal is allowed. The appellant is entitled to his</pre>
    <pre>costs of the appeal and in the court below.
