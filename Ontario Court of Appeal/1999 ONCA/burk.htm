    <pre>On appeal from the acquittal of the respondent by DeKoning J. on
July 23, 1998.

</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent, Orlie James Burk, was charged with sexual
interference, invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault
with respect to the four-year-old complainant. He was acquitted
on all counts after a two-day trial before DeKoning J. in the
Ontario Court (Provincial Division).  In his reasons, the trial
judge held that while he did not disbelieve the complainant, he
was left with a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
respondent.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The Crown appeals the acquittal and alleges two errors in
law:          </pre>
    <pre>               1)  the trial  judge erred in curtailing Crown counsel&#146;s re-
          examination of the complainant&#146;s grandmother in relation to the
          circumstances of the complainant&#146;s recantation to her; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)  the trial judge erred in refusing to
          admit into evidence the complainant&#146;s
          videotaped statement.</pre>
    <pre>The proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[3]  There were a series of evidentiary rulings by the trial
judge.  They followed an extensive voir dire in which he heard from
the four-year-old complainant and her grandmother. The first that
concerns this court was a ruling under s.16(1) of the Canada
Evidence Act directed to determining whether the complainant
understood the nature of her oath and whether she was able to
communicate her evidence.  After extensive reasons, the trial
judge held that while the complainant was able to communicate her
evidence, she did not understand what a promise to tell the truth
was and it is &#147;questionable at this stage whether she understands
what truth is and what lies are&#148;. He therefore ruled that he
could not receive her evidence.  During the course of his
reasons, he found:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I think the overriding consideration in dealing with this
          little girl  child is that this is a very bright little child
          who&#146;s extremely suggestive, she can be led very very easily.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  This ruling concluded that portion of the voir dire wherein
the Crown sought to introduce under the provisions of s.715.1 of
the Criminal Code a video tape of a statement made by the
complainant on November 27,1997 to an O.P.P officer, Cathy Joan
Niven, described as an Abuse Issues Coordinator.  The focus of
the voir dire then turned to whether the video tape was
nevertheless admissible under the umbrella of R. v. Khan (1990),
59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.), in which the Supreme Court held that
hearsay evidence of a child&#146;s statement may be received where
reception of the statement is necessary and where the evidence is
reliable.  The voir dire also embraced an earlier oral statement
made by the complainant to her grandmother that led to this
matter being reported to the police.   Both statements were held
to meet the standards of necessity and reliability, but in the
case of the interview by Cst. Niven, the trial judge ruled that
the tape itself was inadmissible as constituting inadmissible
hearsay because it was not hearsay and therefore did not qualify
under the exception set out by Khan, but that he would permit the
oral utterances made by the complainant to the officer as
transcribed from the video tape to be read in as part of the
Crown&#146;s case.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge gave
extensive reasons and found that the respondent was entitled to
the benefit of a reasonable doubt and acquitted him.  The
following comments are noteworthy:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; The Crown quite properly points out that the initial
          complaint made to grandmother was spontaneous and I would agree
          that it was.  However, the initial recantation made to the same
          grandmother was also spontaneous.  Grandmother&#146;s evidence which
          was elicited in cross-examination was that the little child one
          day, after the police investigation had commenced, simply told
          her that what she had said before didn&#146;t happen, without any
          prompting whatsoever.  So her recantation to the same person,
          this loving grandmother whom she has trust and confidence in
          implicitly, this recantation was just as spontaneous as was the
          original complaint.  Moreover she did repeat and elaborate on her
          complaint to Officer Niven, but after that, after she went home,
          at some time after the police investigation had concluded or at
          least some time later, what did she do with her own mother?  She
          told her own mother that what she hashad  said earlier was not
          true.  Now what mother did upon the child volunteering that to
          her, I think, is very important here.  Mother testified, and she
          stated that when her little girl said that to her, she said, &#147;But
          you told the police something else.&#148;  Or words to that effect and
          she even threatened to punish her because she was changing her
          story.  Now the only evidence before me is that mother took that
          tact.  I think that was good parenting, because the mother wanted
          to get to the truth, and the mother said to her that she could be
          punished or she might be punished because she&#146;s changing her
          story.  Well it seems to me that the pressure that mother placed
          upon the child, if it was directed in any way at all, was
          directed towards getting her to confirm what she had said to the
          police before and getting her to confirm what she complained to
          her other grandmother about.  So this is not a case where
          mother&#146;s conduct could be interpreted as an effort to try to get
          the child to exonerate Mr. Burk.  The only evidence I have points
          in exactly the opposite direction.  But what did the child do?
          The child stuck to her recantation.  She did not go back and say,
          &#147;Well, yes mum, I was telling the truth when I told grandmother
          and when I told Officer Niven.&#148;  The child stuck to her
          recantation.  Moreover, the only evidence before me indicates
          that that recantation, which she expressed to her mother, was
          spontaneous.  There is no evidence that her mother coerced her or
          prompted her or in any way led her to the point of recantation &#133;
          As I stated at the outset, the defence does not have to prove
          innocence.  This is a contest between the state, Her Majesty&#146;s
          government so to speak.  The state headed by Her Majesty the
          Queen against the individual Mr. Burk in which he doesn&#146;t have to
          prove anything.  The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a
          reasonable doubt.  I certainly have a reasonable doubt in my mind
          in this particular case.  It&#146;s not that I disbelieve the child,
          not at all.  The point is that the tests which apply in our
          criminal justice system have not been met in this case.  So I
          must make a finding of not guilty on all three counts.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>Issue 1.  Curtailment of the Crown&#146;s re-examination of the complainant&#146;s 
grandmother.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The Crown called the complainant&#146;s grandmother who testified
as to what constituted a complaint by the complainant the
complainant had told her about the respondent&#146;s conduct.  In
cross-examination, defence counsel brought out that the
complainant had repudiated her complaint to the witness shortly
after the matter was reported to the police.  In  re-examination
the Crown sought to ask the following question:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  Just about that conversation in the washroom where she
          told you it didn&#146;t happen, did you ask her anything else or have
          any other discussion with her?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Defence counsel objected and was initially overruled, the
trial judge assuming that the Crown had been caught by surprise
about the recantation.  When it was conceded that the Crown was
fully aware of the recantation, he the trial judge changed his
ruling and stated that she the Crown should have brought the
matter up in her examination-in- chief.
[8]  The Crown sought to proffer fresh evidence on appeal on this
issue.  It is neither fresh nor is it evidence, but it is neither
fresh nor evidence.  It is no more than an explanation by the
Crown at trial attorney who conducted the trial as to what she
proposed to elicit from the grandmother based on some will say
statements that she had.  The thrust of this evidence was that
the respondent had played a role in the recantation.  This all To
the extent to which this could be considered a justification for
withholding the fact of the recantation from the trial  judge, it
should have been presented below in the form of a submission, in
the absence of the witness if that was thought to be necessary.
[9]  When asked on appeal why the suggestion of the respondent&#146;s
involvement in the recantation was not brought out in chief, the
Crown on appeal said that the Crown at trial  thought that the
fact of the recantation might not have come out at all because
defence counsel might well have decided that it was not in the
respondent&#146;s interest to mention it. Her thinking, obviously, was
that if the defence did not bring out the fact of the
recantation, this omission would bolster the complainant&#146;s
reliability and if the defence did bring it out, she would
reexamine and establish that the recantation was tainted by the
involvement of the respondent.  In the second circumstance, the
defence would have no opportunity to cross-examine on this
critical and most prejudicial point.
[10] This tactical decision by the Crown impresses me as too
clever by half.  The fact that it backfired hardly justifies this
court in interfering with the exercise of discretion by the trial
judge who was of the opinion that the Crown, which had the burden
of establishing the reliability of the statements it sought to
introduce, should have disclosed the fact of the recantation in
leading the evidence of the grandmother. We are not dealing here
with re-examination concerning the statements of adult witnesses
for whom the Crown is not obliged to vouch as in R. v. Evans
(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 226 338 (S.C.C.) per Cory J. at p. 349 or
R. v. Moore (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. C.A.) per Martin
J.A. at p.568. In that situation, the Crown may have been able to
re-examine the witness to expand on the details of the
recantation.  But This this was is the a case of involving the
statements of a four-year-old child whom the trial judge had
ruled was unable to testify and was incapable of adopting her own
video-taped statement as required by s.715.1 of the Code.  The
Crown was now trying to reintroduce the tape under the principles
established in Khan along with another oral utterance to the
grandmother that constituted the original complaint.  The burden
was on the Crown to establish the necessity and reliability of
this hearsay evidence. The fact that the child had recanted both
statements was a matter that very much affected her reliability.
The trial judge had already expressed his concerns about the
ability of this very young complainant to understand the need to
tell the truth and I would not criticize him on this record for
feeling that he was entitled to full disclosure by the Crown as
to all the circumstances that were relevant to the admissibility
of both statements.  Full disclosure to the trial judge should
not have taken a back seat to a purely strategic consideration.
His The trial judge&#146;s decision  not to permit the Crown to split
its examination of this witness does not justify a new trial. I
would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2.  Failure to admit the video tape itself into evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge&#146;s concern about the admissibility of the
videotape is understandable given the fact that the conditions in
s.715.1 of the Code were not included.  However, the videotaped
statements in this case, as out-of-court statements offered for
their truth, are hearsay.  R. v. F.(C.C.) (1997), 120 C.C.C.(3d)
225 (S.C.C.)  He is  The trial judge was correct that s.715.1 of
the Code is the necessary statutory authority for admitting this
particular type of hearsayprovides a statutory exception to the
admissibility of this particular type of hearsay evidence, but
there is also a caselaw exception which provides for the
admissibility of hearsay evidence if it is necessary and
reliable. but tThe Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. K.G.B.
(1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 has expanded the Khan decision to
include video taped statements applied the principled approach of
the Khan decision to the admission of videotaped hearsay
evidence.  In the context of dealing with prior inconsistent
statements, the Court held in K.G.B. that the fact that a prior
out-of-court statement was videotaped was an important factor in
establishing the reliability criteria for the admission of
hearsay evidence.  Lamer C.J.O., speaking for the Court said at
p.293:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   In addition to an oath or solemn affirmation and
          warning, the then, a complete video tape record of the type
          described above, or one which duplicates the experience of
          observing a witness in the court-room to the same extent, is
          another of the other important indicium of reliability which will
          satisfy the principled basis for the admission of hearsay
          evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Accordingly, the trial judge was in error in not admitting
the video tape itself as an exhibit and treating it as another
exception to the hearsay rule. However, the failure to do so
caused no prejudice to the Crown in this particular case.
[13] Parts of the tape were shown in this court and it is evident
that viewing the tape and following along by reading the written
transcript is a more effective presentation than either viewing
the tape or reading the transcript alone.  However, the video
highlights the concern about leading questions that the trial
judge expressed after he listened to a reading of the transcript,
and does not assist the Crown with respect to his the trial
judge&#146;s  fundamental concern about the recantations by the
complainant.
[14] The questions put to the complainant by the experienced
police officer were leading.  The trial judge noted this at the
outset of his ruling on the Khan motion and set out a number of
examples. After dealing with the last one, he concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Again a leading question which somewhat detracts from the
          weight that one would ordinarily place on this evidence. These
          Those leading questions have caused the court some concern.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The trial judge reverted again to the observation he had
about the child&#146;s response to leading questions in general in his
ruling against permitting her to testify:
          </pre>
    <pre>               She is a bright little child and speaks well, speaks
          clearly, but she seems to me to be a very vulnerable child in the
          sense that she can be very easily led.  I noted that when leading
          questions were posed to her by cross-examining counsel, she
          seemed willing to agree to whatever it was the adult person
          questioning her seemed to want her to say.</pre>
    <pre>[16] More significantly, the video tape, as opposed to a
transcript of the tape, does not address the concerns of the
trial judge set out above respecting the oral testimony of the
two recantations made by the complainant to her grandmother and
to her mother, one before the video tape and the other after.
The Crown seems to be of the view that the video tape itself, as
opposed to its contents, has intrinsically more credibility than
the other statements admitted under the Khan exception.  It might
well have, in the particular case, but here the answers given to
the leading questions in the tape contrasted sharply with the
spontaneity of the little girl&#146;s statements to her grandmother,
the similar spontaneity of her recantations and, in the case of
the recantation to her mother, her refusal to retract the
recantation.  This was explicitly noted by the trial judge in his
reasons for judgment.  Additionally, the trial judge, who had the
benefit of having seen and heard the complainant on the s.16 voir
dire, was entitled to consider that the statement to the officer
was of diminished weight because the complainant was unable to
testify and adopt its contents pursuant to s.715.1.   In the last
analysis, he preferred the spontaneous recantations of the little
girl to the answers elicited by the police officer from leading
questions in giving the respondent the benefit of the doubt and
acquitting him.  The Crown has therefore not demonstrated that
the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the
videotape been admitted.
[17] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the
appeal.</pre>
