</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The principal ground of appeal against conviction is that
the trial judge failed to adequately relate the theory of the
defence in the evidence in support of the defence. The theory of
the defence was simple. The appellant and his brother claimed
that they were invited into the complainant's home and that he
then attacked them. The appellant claimed he was either simply
responding to a consensual fight or acting in self-defence. The
trial judge adequately explained the elements of the offences and
the defence of self-defence. In the course of that explanation,
the trial judge referred to the evidence of the witnesses and
made the burden of proof clear.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in
failing to give a limiting instruction with respect to his
brother's guilty plea. The appellant's brother made it clear in
his evidence that his plea related to his own actions. There was
no risk in this case that the jury would take the brother's
guilty plea as evidence of the appellant's guilt. It is therefore
not surprising that trial counsel (not Ms. Lavine) did not
request such a direction.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We are also satisfied that this case was not one where the
failure to give a direction as to the use of the somewhat vague
propensity evidence constituted misdirection. Again, we note that
trial counsel did not request such a direction.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As to sentence, there were grounds to distinguish between
the sentence imposed on the appellant and the sentence imposed on
his brother primarily because of the appellant's much more
serious criminal record. However, on this record their roles in
the offences were identical. The disparity between the four
months, which was imposed on the brother, and over three years
(taking into account pre-trial custody), which was imposed on the
appellant, was unjustifiable and would give the appellant a sense
of injustice.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It was conceded that the trial judge erred in making the
lifetime weapons prohibition order under s. 109 of the Criminal
Code, which was not in force at the time. It is conceded that a
prohibition order under s. 100 for a period of ten years should
be substituted.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
sentence of imprisonment reduced to two years, and a prohibition
order under s. 100 for a period of ten years substituted.</pre></td>
