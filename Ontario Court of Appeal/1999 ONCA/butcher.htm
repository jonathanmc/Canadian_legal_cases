COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            LEROY BUTCHER  (Plaintiff/Appellant) v. GOVERNMENT
               OF ST. LUCIA (Defendant/Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        MORDEN, LASKIN and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Leroy Butcher In Person
               Appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Charles T. Hackland
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Aitken J. dated May 13, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  With respect to the motion for the admission of fresh
evidence, the plaintiff submitted that the evidence did not add
anything new to the case but that it emphasized what was in the
materials before the motions judge.  This, clearly, does not
qualify the evidence for admission on appeal. Further, we do not
think that the evidence assists the appellant&#146;s case.  The motion
is dismissed.

[2]  On the appeal itself, we agree with the motions judge&#146;s
analysis and conclusion respecting the application of s. 5 of the
State Immunity Act to this case.  With respect, her reasons
relating to s. 6 of this Act are not clear (it may well have been
that they merely responded to the submission which had been made
to her on s. 6) but, in any event, on all of the materials before
us, we do not think that this section has any application to this
case.

[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
