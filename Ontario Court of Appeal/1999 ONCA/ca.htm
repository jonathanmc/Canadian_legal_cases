</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The Charge</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge made it clear in his charge that:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In your deliberations you must consider each charge
          separately. You must keep the evidence relating to each charge
          separate. When you ultimately consider whether the Crown has
          proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. You
          must put out of your mind the fact which you already know that
          other persons have made other allegations against the accused on
          the same day.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[2]  We thus would not give effect to the submission that the
trial judge failed to tell the jury that, in looking for evidence
that was capable of supporting the complainant&#146;s evidence, the
jury could not look at the evidence of the other complainants
concerning the sexual assaults allegedly perpetrated on them.
[3]  Even if the trial judge did err in his review of the
complainant R.F.&#146;s evidence, he clearly told the jury that it was
for them, not him, to determine the facts. There was no objection
to the trial judge&#146;s review of R.F.&#146;s evidence and, in our view,
if the trial judge erred the error would not have affected the
verdict.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   The Section 16 Inquiry</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In our view, the s. 16 inquiry was adequate and we note that
the appellant&#146;s counsel (not Ms. Fuerst) took no objection  to
it. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>  3. Unreasonable Verdict</pre>
    <pre>[5]  There was ample evidence to support the jury verdict. There
is no merit in this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>  4. Dangerous Offender Finding</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant submitted that the predicate offence (sexual
interference) did not constitute a serious personal injury
offence because it did not involve violence and that there was no
evidence upon which the trial judge was entitled to conclude that
there was severe psychological damage. In our view, in this case,
the predicate offence did involve physical violence (s.
752(a)(i)). The appellant forcibly removed some of the
complainant&#146;s clothing. The complainant screamed for assistance
and the appellant continued to force himself upon her. Thus, we
see no merit in the submission that the predicate offence did not
meet the requirements of s. 752.</pre>
    <pre>  5. The Indeterminate Sentence</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge carefully considered the appropriate
sentence to be imposed upon the appellant. In our opinion, it was
open to him to impose an indeterminate sentence particularly in
light of the experts&#146; evidence. This sentence is not demonstrably
unfit. Accordingly, appeal against the dangerous offender finding
and sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
