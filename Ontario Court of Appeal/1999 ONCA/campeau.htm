    <pre>HEARD:         June 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from the judgment of Zuber J., sitting with  a  jury,
conviction dated, June 19, 1998 and sentence dated June 26, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>CONVICTION APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant has raised a number of grounds of appeal.  The
first  was  that the trial judge interrupted counsel  in  such  a
fashion as to betray a bias or to obstruct counsel in the conduct
of  the  case.  The record has been examined for our  benefit  by
both  counsel.  We are not persuaded that there is merit in  this
ground of appeal.

[2]  The second ground, failure to charge on motive, is more
troublesome.  The conduct of the accused was, to say the least,
bizarre.  Defence counsel [not Ms. Fuerst] led evidence to
support the contention that the appellant had no motive to light
the fire.  In her address to the jury, she relied on that
evidence.  Crown counsel, on the other hand, while not conceding
that there was no evidence of motive, suggested to the jury that
they could consider the bizarre conduct demonstrated towards his
neighbours and his anger as indicating a motive.  This was
rationally hard to sustain.

[3]  In his charge, the trial judge reminded the jury of the
detailed addresses given by counsel and he made it clear that in
reviewing their respective positions, he &#147;did not intend to track
the same detail.&#148;  The complaint is now made, for the first time
on appeal, that the trial judge should have charged the jury on
the proved absence of motive as circumstantial evidence relevant
to the issue of the appellant&#146;s intent.

[4]  There is no doubt that there is an obligation on the trial
judge to be sure that the jury understands the evidence as it
relates to the issues in the case.  This is particularly
important in the context of the jury understanding the defences
raised.  That said, in  this case, the question of the
appellant&#146;s intent did not rest solely or even primarily upon
inferences to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence.  Here,
there was an eye witness who testified that she saw the appellant
pour gasoline on the porch and light it.  This was the pivotal
evidence in the case.  If the jury believed that evidence, the
element of intent was established.

[5]  It follows, in our view, that while it would have been
preferable had the trial judge charged the jury on the proved
absence of motive, having regard to the eyewitness testimony and
counsel&#146;s lack of objection, we are not persuaded that his
failure to do so was fatal.    Accordingly, we would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.

[6]  The next issue is whether the charge to the jury was
adequate in light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
in R. v. W. (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397.  In our view, it
was.  Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the appellant,
the jury was not left with the impression that the rejection of
the evidence of the appellant could be relied upon as a positive
factor in concluding that the appellant was guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt.

[7]  Finally, the appellant complained that evidence had been
admitted which was hearsay and self-serving.  Most of that
evidence went to the question of identity which was not in issue.
To the extent that it went to the critical issue of whether the
eyewitness had seen the appellant pour the gasoline and had told
a police officer of this at the scene, it was admissible to rebut
the allegation of recent fabrication.  (see  R. v. Campbell
(1997), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.).

[8]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  appellant  seeks leave to appeal the  sentence  of  18
months.   He  submits that the trial judge erred in  refusing  to
impose  a conditional sentence and, in the alternative, that  the
sentence  of  18 months was manifestly excessive and  beyond  the
usual range of sentences imposed in similar circumstances.

[10] With respect, we see no merit in either submission.  The
trial judge&#146;s reasons disclose no error in principle and he was
justified, under the circumstances, in refusing to impose a
conditional sentence. We are also of the view that the sentence
was fit and within the appropriate range.

[11] The offence of arson endangering life is the most serious of
the arson offences.  It is punishable by a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment.  The appellant&#146;s conduct was deliberate and
required some planning.  He went out on the porch twice and
poured gasoline over it before lighting the fire.  The porch was
attached to a house in which three adults and two children were
sleeping.  The appellant&#146;s conduct placed a number of lives at
risk.  According to the fire investigator, had the fire not been
contained so quickly, it would have been much more serious.

[12] We note as well that the appellant is not a first offender
and he has shown no remorse or contrition for the offence.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is  granted  but  the
appeal is dismissed.
