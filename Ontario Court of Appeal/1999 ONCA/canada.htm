COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            CANADA TRUSTCO MORTGAGE COMPANY (Plaintiff
               (Respondent)) v. 976608 ONTARIO INC., JEFFERY
               McCORD and CLIFFORD GURNSEY (Defendants (Appellants))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, AUSTIN AND SHARPE JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       John S. Curtis
               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Natalie Marconi
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         September 3, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of MacLeod J. dated January 14, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Although the plaintiff&#146;s evidence alleges conflicting
default dates, it is apparent that the mortgage was in arrears
and thus in default at all relevant times.  As a consequence, the
mortgagor was not entitled to change to the alternative interest
basis set out in paragraph 8 of the amending agreement.
[2]  It appears from the amounts involved that it would have
disadvantageous to do so in any event.  The evidence clearly
supports the conclusion that the mortgagor was seeking renewal on
the basis of a 15-year amortization period and not as provided in
the agreement it had signed.
[3]  The defendants did not take advantage of the right to cross-
examine on the material the plaintiff put forward in support of
the motion.  Accordingly, we see no reason to order any further
accounting.
[4]  We are not persuaded that there is any basis for the counter-
claim and the parties are agreed that, in the circumstances, the
rate of post-judgment interest should remain at 8.25 per cent.
[5]  The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs on a
solicitor and client basis as stipulated in the mortgages.
[6]  The failure of the judge of first instance to give any
reasons for her decision is regrettable and deprived this court
of the benefit of any analysis of the issues.  The statement
that:  &#147;I am satisfied after giving all the facts of this case a
&#145;good hard look&#146;, that there are no genuine issues for trial&#148;
meets neither the implied requirements of Rule 20 nor the
reasonable expectations of the parties, particularly the losing
parties.
