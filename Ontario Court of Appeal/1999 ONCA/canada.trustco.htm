      <pre>On appeal from the final order of Mr. Justice Somers dated
February 1, 1999</pre>
      <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  This appeal turns on whether an accounting firm can claim an
equitable  set-off against monies held in its capital account  to
the  credit of two of its bankrupt partners, for payment made  by
the  firm,  after  the  bankruptcy of the  two  partners,  to  an
unsecured creditor of the two bankrupts.
[2]  The dispute over the monies is between the appellant, Canada
Trustco Mortgage Company (“Trustco”), and the respondent, the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”).  Trustco is a
creditor of the bankrupts who obtained an order under s.38 of the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“BIA”)
authorizing it to bring an action against the accounting firm,
Schwartz, Levitsky and Feldman (“SLF”) for recovery of monies
held in its capital account to the credit of the two bankrupt
partners at the time of the bankruptcy.  The CIBC is an unsecured
creditor of the bankrupts who obtained the monies from SLF after
the bankruptcy. SLF paid the CIBC in fulfillment of its
undertaking to pay the bankrupts’ loan upon the happening of
certain events. In return for the payment, the CIBC agreed to
indemnify SLF against any resulting liability to Trustco.
[3]  Trustco brought a motion for summary judgment in this action
against SLF and, in turn, SLF brought a motion for summary
judgment against the third party, the CIBC. At the hearing, it
was common ground between the parties that Trustco stood in the
shoes of the trustee in bankruptcy and the contest was therefore
essentially between the trustee in bankruptcy and one unsecured
creditor, the CIBC.  Somers J. resolved the contest in favour of
the CIBC on the ground that SLF was entitled to set off the
payments made to the CIBC against the monies held in its capital
account to the credit of the bankrupts. Consequently, he
dismissed Trustco’s motion and its action against SLF and, in
light of this conclusion, found it unnecessary to deal with SLF’s
motion for judgment against the CIBC. Trustco appeals from this
decision.
[4]  It is my view that the trustee in bankruptcy, represented by
Trustco in this proceeding, has priority over the monies. The
monies held in SLF’s capital account to the credit of the two
bankrupt partners vested in the trustee in bankruptcy at the time
of bankruptcy. At that time, there was no debt owed by the
bankrupts to SLF that could give rise to a claim by SLF to a
right of set-off against those monies in priority to the rights
of the trustee in bankruptcy.  Further, SLF’s obligation to repay
the bankrupts’ loan to the CIBC pursuant to its undertaking to do
so does not, in the circumstances of this case, give rise to a
claim for equitable set-off. Finally, whatever agreement SLF
entered into with the CIBC after the bankruptcy cannot affect
Trustco’s priority over the monies.</pre>
      <pre>2.   The Facts</pre>
      <pre>[5]   The  two  bankrupts, David Donald Sugarman and  Stacy  Brad
Mitchell, were chartered accountants. They practised together  in
partnership  until February 1994 when they merged their  practice
with that of SLF. Upon joining SLF, they were required by SLF  to
inject  capital into the firm. They each borrowed  $100,000  from
the CIBC for that purpose.
[6]  At the time Sugarman and Mitchell joined SLF, they signed a
partnership entry agreement and the existing SLF partnership
agreement. The partnership entry agreement provided for SLF to
assist Sugarman and Mitchell with respect to the capital loans in
these terms:
          </pre>
      <pre>               2.3  Provisions Relating to Capital Loans.
          </pre>
      <pre>                The  Partnership shall assist  Sugarman
          and Mitchell in arranging bank financing,  if
          required,  for  the  purposes  of  subsection
          2.2(b)  in the amount of One Hundred Thousand
          ($100,000)  Dollars  each,  with  a  Canadian
          chartered bank or other lender.  So  long  as
          such  loan  is  outstanding, the  Partnership
          shall   make   all   payments   of   interest
          attributable to it, directly to the financial
          institution  making  such  loan  advance   to
          Sugarman  or  Mitchell.  In  the  event  that
          either  Sugarman or Mitchell ceases to  be  a
          Partner, the Partnership shall repay from the
          capital  account of Sugarman or  Mitchell  as
          applicable,   all  principal   and   interest
          attributable to such loan, to the  extent  of
          such    capital   account.     The    parties
          acknowledge   that  at  no  time   will   the
          principal  amount of any loan advanced  by  a
          financial institution to Sugarman or Mitchell
          pursuant  to  the provisions of this  section
          exceed  the  capital account of  Sugarman  or
          Mitchell, as applicable. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[7]   SLF  did  accounting  work for the  CIBC  and  had  a  good
relationship  with  the bank. At the request  of  the  CIBC,  SLF
signed two letters of undertaking, one on behalf of Sugarman  and
one on behalf of Mitchell. The text in both letters is identical.
The letter concerning Sugarman’s loan reads as follows:

          </pre>
      <pre>                In  consideration of the bank advancing
          the  sum  of  $100,000 for the purpose  of  a

          to the amount outstanding of the Capital Loan
          maintained  by  the Bank  on  behalf  of  the
          subject.
          </pre>
      <pre>                2.    In  the  event of  the  subject's
          death,  withdrawal  from  the  Firm  or   the
          dissolution  of  the Firm  or  withdrawal  of
          Capital  from  the Firm for any other  reason
          the  Bank will be paid an amount equal to the
          amount of the Capital Loan outstanding in the
          name   of   the  subject  including   accrued
          interest and other charges. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
      <pre>               Dated at Toronto this 22nd day of
          February, 1994.

      <pre>          </pre>
      <pre>[8]   Paragraph 12.01 of the SLF partnership agreement  also  has
some  bearing on this appeal in that it gives SLF a right of set-
off  against the value of any withdrawing partner’s interest  for
sums owing by the partner to the partnership:
          </pre>
      <pre>               In the event of the withdrawal … of a partner, that such
          partner shall cease to be a member of the partnership, his
          partnership interest will terminate and the partnership will pay
          to such partner the value of his partnership interest as
          determined in accordance with Article 11.00 of this agreement and
          as hereinafter provided, minus the amount of any sums owing by
          the partner in question to the partnership and not already
          accounted for in the valuation of his partnership interest.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[9]   Sugarman and Mitchell suffered a serious financial reversal
as  a  result  of a real estate transaction and, in the  fall  of
1995,  each of them filed a proposal under the BIA. The proposals
were  rejected  by their creditors and they were deemed  to  have
made  an  assignment in bankruptcy as of October 27,  1995.  Upon
their  personal bankruptcy, both Sugarman and Mitchell lost their
C.A.  designation. Consequently, they were also  deemed  to  have
withdrawn from their partnership in SLF as of the same date.
[10] Upon the bankrupts making their proposal, the CIBC filed
proofs of claim with the trustee in bankruptcy for the amounts of
the loans as an unsecured creditor and demanded payment from SLF
pursuant to the letters of undertaking. The trustee in bankruptcy
also demanded that SLF pay the assets of each capital account of
Sugarman and Mitchell to the estate. On September 19, 1996, SLF,
faced with these competing claims, entered into a settlement
agreement with the CIBC.  Under the terms of this agreement,
repayment of the loans was made to the CIBC by SLF, in return for
which the CIBC agreed to indemnify SLF in the event any judgment
or order was made against SLF with respect to this repayment. It
was also agreed that SLF would take the position that it was
entitled to set off the amount of the payments to the CIBC as
against the bankrupts’ capital accounts.</pre>
      <pre>3.  Analysis</pre>
      <pre>[11]  Upon the rejection of a proposal pursuant to the  BIA,  the
insolvent  person  is  deemed  to  have  made  an  assignment  in
bankruptcy and all property belonging to the bankrupt  passes  to
and vests in the trustee in bankruptcy: s. 57(a) and s. 71(2)  of
the BIA. Hence, any monies held by SLF in its capital account  to
the  credit  of  Sugarman and Mitchell vested in the  trustee  in
bankruptcy  as  of October 27, 1995. It is common ground  between
the  parties  that  there was the total sum of  $200,000  in  the
capital  account  at the time of bankruptcy. In this  proceeding,
Trustco  stands  in  the  shoes of  the  trustee  in  bankruptcy.
Consequently,  it  is prima facie entitled to judgment  for  that
amount.
[12] However, in certain circumstances, the trustee in bankruptcy
will take the property of the bankrupts subject to certain
equities. In this case, the respondent takes the position that
the monies in the capital account were subject to SLF’s right of
set-off. The law of set-off is expressly preserved by s.97(3) of
the BIA:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The law of set-off applies to all claims made against the
          estate of the bankrupt and also to all actions instituted by the
          trustee for the recovery of debts due to the bankrupt in the same
          manner and to the same extent as if the bankrupt were plaintiff
          or defendant, as the case may be, except in so far as any claim
          for set-off is affected by the provisions of the Act respecting
          frauds or fraudulent preferences.</pre>
      <pre>[13] In this case, Trustco, standing in the shoes of the trustee,
is seeking recovery of monies due to the bankrupts by SLF, namely
the monies in the capital account to the credit of each bankrupt,
and  this claim may be subject to a set-off by SLF against  these
monies. The question becomes whether SLF has any valid claim  for
set-off.
[14] A right of set-off may arise by agreement, at law, or in
equity: Telford v. Holt (1987), 41 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.).
          </pre>
      <pre>          (a)   set-off by agreement</pre>
      <pre>[15]  In  this  case, the agreement between SLF and Sugarman  and
Mitchell  expressly  provided for a right of  set-off.  As  noted
earlier,  paragraph  12.01 of the partnership agreement  provided
that,  in  the  event  of the withdrawal of a  partner,  SLF  was
obliged  to  pay  to  the partner the value  of  his  partnership
interest  (which,  by definition in the agreement,  included  the
amount  credited  to  the partner’s capital  account)  minus  the
amount  of  any  sums  owing by the partner to  the  partnership.
However, there were no moneys owed to the firm by either Sugarman
or Mitchell at the time of their bankruptcy and, therefore, it is
not alleged that any right of set-off arose  by agreement.
          </pre>
      <pre>          (b)   legal set-off</pre>
      <pre>[16]  A  legal  right of set-off exists if both  obligations  are
debts  (as  opposed to unliquidated claims for damages)  and  are
mutual cross-obligations, although not necessarily connected. The
requirement of mutuality can sometimes be difficult to understand
from  the cases, particularly in situations where an issue arises
as  to whether the assignment of a debt has destroyed mutuality.1
However,  in  this case, it is clear that there is no  mutuality.
The  cross-claims are not owed between the original parties,  SLF
and  Sugarman and Mitchell. Rather, SLF is asserting a  right  to
set  off  a debt that it owes to a third party, the CIBC, against
the  debt owed by the firm to the bankrupt estate. The respondent
concedes that there is no right of legal set-off at law  in  this
case. Rather, the respondent relies on equitable principles.
          </pre>
      <pre>          (c)   equitable set-off</pre>
      <pre>[17]  Equitable  set-off may be available in circumstances  where
the strict requirements of legal set-off cannot be met. Kelly  R.
Palmer,  in  The  Law  of Set-Off in Canada (1993),  reviews  the
different  rationales for allowing equitable set-off  as  it  has
evolved over the years, from the need to prevent the harshness of
imprisonment for non-payment of debts, to more modern  exigencies
such  as  reducing the number of actions and avoiding  circuitous
claims.  Whatever the rationale, it would appear from  the  cases
that  the remedy is firmly rooted in the need to achieve fairness
between the parties.
[18] One of the main differences between legal set-off and
equitable set-off is that, in the latter case, the claims between
the parties do not need to be liquidated. Hence, claims for
damages are available for equitable set-off. This difference does
not matter in this case. Another important difference, and one
that is of relevance here, lies in the fact that the  requirement
for mutuality is relaxed. Hence, equitable set-off may be
available even though the situation is not strictly one where A
seeks to set off his debt to B against the debt B owes to A.
However, for equitable set-off to be available, the cross-claims
must be closely connected. It is logical to conclude that this
latter requirement arises because mutuality is not strictly
insisted upon. After all, it is difficult to imagine why, in the
interests of fairness, the courts would allow A to reduce his
debt to B by the amount A owes to C, unless it was because of the
close connection between the claims. Finally, it is important to
note that, just because cross-claims are closely connected to one
another, it does not mean that set-off will necessarily follow.
Not only must the connection be sufficiently close to warrant an
exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the court, the remedy
must not result in any form of inequity.
[19] In order to determine whether equitable set-off should be
allowed in this case, it is therefore necessary to look at the
connection between the claims and also to consider the effect the
remedy would have on the equities between the parties.
[20] It is the respondent’s position, as set out in its factum,
that the right of set-off claimed by SLF “arises out of the
contractual obligation to repay the personal loans to CIBC out of
the capital accounts, in accordance with Article 2.3 of the
Partnership Entry Agreement between the bankrupts and SLF, as
well as the written Undertakings given by SLF to CIBC for the
benefit of the bankrupts”. The respondent submits that the claims
are so connected that it would be unfair to require SLF to pay
the monies in the capital account to the trustee in bankruptcy
without allowing SLF to offset its obligation to repay the very
loan that provided the capital sum in the first place.
[21] In my view, although superficially attractive, this argument
cannot hold. I find the argument unconvincing because it ignores
the important fact that there has been an intervening bankruptcy
in this case. This is not simply a case, for example, where
Sugarman and Mitchell would decide to go back to practising on
their own and would seek payment of the monies held to their
credit in the firm’s capital account, leaving SLF behind to pay
the loan to the CIBC pursuant to its undertaking. If this were
the case, I have no doubt that equity would intervene to allow
SLF a right to set off its obligation to the CIBC against the
debt to Sugarman and Mitchell, even in the absence of an
indemnity agreement between SLF and the two withdrawing partners.
[22] In this case, because of the intervening bankruptcy, the
equities are no longer just between SLF and Sugarman and Mitchell
or even between SLF and the CIBC. The rights of others have come
into play. These rights cannot simply be ignored on the basis
that the CIBC lent the money that created the capital account in
question. If the respondent’s argument was accepted, the
unsecured creditor who lent the bankrupt money to buy a car would
be able to claim priority over the car based on that fact alone
and in the absence of any secured interest in the car. Such a
result would be contrary to the scheme of distribution under the
BIA. It would result in an unfair preference of one unsecured
creditor over other unsecured creditors. Similarly, in this case,
the resulting unfairness to SLF, if any, must be assessed in the
context of the bankruptcy where other unsecured creditors may
stand to lose.
[23] In my view, at the time of bankruptcy, SLF stood in no
different position than any other unsecured creditor in the
bankrupt’s estate.2 At the time SLF gave its undertaking to the
bank to repay the loan, it could have obtained some form of
security from Sugarman and Mitchell. SLF chose not to do so. SLF
is an accounting firm, not an unsophisticated creditor.
Obviously, it suited its own purposes to give the undertaking to
the CIBC. Indeed, the evidence shows that SLF was receiving two
new partners, an injection of $200,000 in the firm’s capital
account and ongoing accounting business from the CIBC. There is
really no reason why SLF should be treated any differently than
others who stand to lose as a result of the two partners’
bankruptcy.
[24] Further, the ultimate result of granting the remedy of
equitable set-off cannot simply be ignored. Given the indemnity
it received from the CIBC, SLF does not lose any money. The claim
of equitable set-off is made for the CIBC’s benefit. Granting
relief in this case would be akin to elevating the CIBC’s status
in the bankruptcy from unsecured to secured creditor to the
detriment of other unsecured creditors. There is no justification
in this case to so interfere with the scheme of distribution
under the BIA.
[25] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
order of Somers J. and grant judgment to the appellant against
Schwartz, Levitsky &amp; Feldman for $200,000 plus interests and
costs of the motion, the action and the appeal.</pre>
