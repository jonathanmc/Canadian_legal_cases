    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge, Walters J., granted judgment in favour of
the respondent, The Canada Trust Company, on a guarantee to a
mortgage given by the appellants Cecil and Audrey Henry. A first
guarantee was signed in July 1990 at the time the mortgage was
executed and a second in October 1991 on the renewal of the
mortgage. The appellants appeal against the judgment on several
grounds including non-disclosure, misrepresentation, material
variation, unconscionability, undue influence and non est factum.

[2]  With respect to the guarantee given at the time of the
execution of the mortgage in July 1990, the trial judge found
that the appellants were aware of what they were signing and that
they signed freely.  She stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that Mr. Solnik [a solicitor] explained to Mr. and
          Mrs. Henry the nature of the documents they originally signed.
          Mr. Henry read the documents.  Mr. Henry understood he was
          guaranteeing a second mortgage and signed the second mortgage and
          the guarantee.  Mr. Henry understood that if his brother
          defaulted he is responsible.  I also find that Mrs. Henry
          understood that she was responsible if her brother-in-law and
          sister-in-law didn’t pay.  In fact the Henrys were called on one
          occasion when a payment was missed.</pre>
    <pre>     With respect to the second guarantee the
trial judge also stated :
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that Mr. Crum-Ewing [a solicitor] explained to all
          defendants the nature of the documents they were signing.  The
          Defendants have failed to established the defence of non est
          factum.  All defendants had full capacity and if they chose not
          to read all the documentation fully, they cannot now say they
          didn’t understand.  I am satisfied that all three defendants
          [including a third guarantor not a party to this appeal] were
          fully aware that without their signatures their brother [one of
          the mortgagors] would lose his home. They wanted to assist Keith
          and Ninette [the mortgagors].  I also accept the evidence of Mr.
          Crum-Ewing that he explained all the documents [which included a
          detailed statement of disbursements] and their effect.  All
          parties signed voluntarily.  Although the Henrys say they were
          forced to sign I find that they drove across the City of Toronto
          of their own free will, attended at the solicitor’s home and
          signed the documents in question.</pre>
    <pre>
[3]       The findings of fact of the trial judge are all
supported by the evidence.  She had the distinct advantage of
seeing and hearing the witnesses and this court cannot disturb
these findings.

[4]       In our view, the findings of the trial judge are
determinative of all the issues raised by the appellants. Based
on her findings of fact, the trial judge correctly rejected the
plea of non est factum. Given those same findings, there is no
basis for the defences of non-disclosure, misrepresentation and
material variation. Finally, it is our view that the evidence
does not support the defences of undue influence and
unconscionability argued on appeal.

[5]       Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
