    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Mr. Justice Roger E.
Salhany on January 26, 1996</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>                                  I
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of manslaughter on the basis
that her criminally negligent conduct contributed to the death of
her two year-old daughter.  She was sentenced to one year in
jail.  The appellant appeals conviction only.  Her sentence has
been served.</pre>
    <pre>     II</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This is a tragic and bizarre case.  The deceased, Kira, was
the two year-old daughter of the appellant.  She died of
asphyxiation caused by airway obstruction and compression of the
neck complicated by aspiration, which occurred during an exorcism
performed by her grandmother.
[3]  Kira&#146;s grandmother, the appellant&#146;s mother,  believed that
she could communicate directly with angels and spirits and could
detect evil spirits dwelling inside other people.  She also
believed that she could expel those evil spirits by a combination
of prayer and the forced ingestion of water until the person
vomited and expelled the evil spirits.  The grandmother came to
believe that the appellant&#146;s boyfriend was possessed by evil
spirits and that those spirits had been transmitted to Kira.
[4]  On the day Kira died, the appellant, Kira and her
grandmother were at the home of the Aguiars.  The Aguiars were
friends of the grandmother and shared her beliefs.  During the
evening, the grandmother decided to expel the evil spirits from
Kira.  She took her into the kitchen and began to pray and force
water down Kira&#146;s throat.  Kira resisted, kicking strenuously and
screaming.  Daniel Aguiar held Kira&#146;s legs.  Eventually, Kira
fell silent.  She was placed on the kitchen floor where she died.
Her body remained in the home for two days until the appellant
and the grandmother took the body to the hospital.1
[5]  The post-mortem examination of Kira revealed numerous
injuries to her face and neck, abrasions on her chin and neck,
and bruising to some of her internal organs.  The injuries were
consistent with the use of substantial force during efforts to
force Kira to drink enough water so that she would vomit.  Her
inability to breathe, combined with aspiration of the water,
caused Kira&#146;s death.
[6]  It was the Crown&#146;s case that the appellant was present
during part of the attempt to expel the evil spirits and that she
was in the immediately adjacent room the rest of the time.  The
Crown contended that the appellant knew what the grandmother was
doing and could hear her daughter screaming and resisting her
grandmother&#146;s efforts to force water down her throat.
[7]  The Crown contended that the appellant was guilty of
criminal negligence either because her involvement in the efforts
to expel the evil spirits demonstrated a wanton and reckless
disregard for Kira&#146;s life or safety, or because, as Kira&#146;s
mother, she had failed to intercede when it became apparent to
her that Kira was in danger.  The Crown argued that the appellant
was under a legal obligation to come to her daughter&#146;s aid and
that her failure to do so demonstrated a wanton and reckless
disregard for the life or safety of Kira.
[8]  The appellant did not testify and did not call a defence.
It was the position of the defence that the evidence did not
establish that the appellant was in the kitchen during the
attempted exorcism.  It was further the position of the defence
that the appellant did not know of the risk posed to her daughter
by the grandmother&#146;s actions.  The defence contended that the
grandmother had performed a similar procedure a day earlier and
that no harm had come to the child.  There was evidence that Kira
was generally well cared for by the appellant.  It was not part
of the defence at trial that the appellant was incapable of
appreciating the risk posed to Kira.  Nor was the appellant&#146;s
mental state put in issue at trial.</pre>
    <pre>     III</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge, in careful reasons, made the following
finding of fact:
          </pre>
    <pre>   On the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
   that both Maria [the appellant] and Daniel were present during
   some of the force feeding of Kira by Anna Maria [the
   grandmother], provided her with water and held Kira&#146;s feet to
   restrain her from kicking to avoid being force fed.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge had &#147;no hesitation&#148; in finding that the
appellant knew or ought to have known that what the grandmother
was doing to Kira was capable of putting Kira&#146;s life or safety at
risk.  The trial judge then said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; I am convinced that she was capable
	  of distinguishing between the child&#146;s crying
	  caused by discomfort and the child&#146;s crying 
	  and struggling and kicking while attempting
	  to fight for her life.  However, what is clear
	  to me on the evidence is that Maria was so
	  convinced that her child was possessed by evil
          spirits, of her mother&#146;s ability to rid the
	  child&#146;s body of those spirits by forced feeding
	  and of the critical importance of doing so that
	  her concern for Kira&#146;s health or safety was secondary.
          Her video statement to the police contains numerous
 	  references to her belief that evil spirits will
	  invade the body, to the belief that her mother
	  has the ability to exorcise those evil spirits
          and her belief in the necessity of doing so.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Mr. Marentette [defence counsel] relied
          upon those passages as indicative of her
          honest belief that her mother would not hurt
          Kira.  What they indicate to me is that she
          was so caught up in her religious beliefs, in
          the existence of evil spirits and the
          necessity that they be exorcised, that, as I
          have already said, they were secondary to
          Kira&#146;s physical well being.  This is not a
          case where she was incapable of appreciating
          the risks because of her youth, experience or
          education.  It was because of her religious
          beliefs.  I see no difference between this
          case and one where a parent deliberately
          withholds insulin from a diabetic child
          because of the belief, no matter how honestly
          held, that the child has been cured by
          prayer.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[11] Two of the arguments advanced by the appellant arise out of
the trial judge&#146;s findings of fact.  She submits that the
evidence of her participation in the forced feeding of Kira
depends on the evidence of Steven Aguiar, the 14 year-old son of
the Aguiars.  The appellant contends that Steven&#146;s evidence was
so thoroughly unreliable that the trial judge erred in relying on
his evidence.  There are two answers to this submission.  First,
Steven Aguiar&#146;s evidence was not the only evidence of the
appellant&#146;s participation in the events in the kitchen.  Her
videotaped statement to the police could reasonably be
interpreted as an admission by her of some participation in the
events which occurred in the kitchen.  Second, while there can be
no doubt that Steven Aguiar was an unreliable witness, the trial
judge was not foreclosed from accepting his evidence.  He was
aware of the frailties in Aguiar&#146;s evidence and ultimately chose
to accept part of it.  He was well within his province in doing
so.
[12] The appellant also argues that the trial judge improperly
drew an inference that the appellant knew that Kira was in real
distress based on the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that, as Kira&#146;s
mother, the appellant could distinguish between crying which
suggested discomfort and crying which suggested a much more
serious problem.  There was ample evidence that the appellant
could hear Kira screaming for some time.  I see nothing wrong
with the common sense inference that, as Kira&#146;s mother, the
appellant could tell the extent of Kira&#146;s distress based on those
screams.</pre>
    <pre>     IV</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant&#146;s third ground of appeal accepts and indeed
relies on a finding of fact made by the trial judge.  The trial
judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   This is not a case where she was incapable of appreciating
   the risks because of her youth, experience or education.  It was
   because of her religious beliefs.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits that the trial judge found that the
appellant was incapable of appreciating the risk because of her
religious beliefs and that because of that incapacity she should
have been acquitted.
[15] An incapacity to appreciate the risk flowing from one&#146;s
conduct does negative the fault element required for crimes of
negligence:  R. v. Creighton (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 346 at 387
(S.C.C.).  The passage relied on by the appellant, if read in
isolation, lends some credence to the submission.  It must,
however, be read in the context of the rest of the reasons and
the issues raised at trial.  It was never contended at trial that
the appellant was incapable of appreciating the risk to her child
because of her religious beliefs.  It was the position of the
defence that the appellant was unaware of the harm being done to
her child.
[16] Viewed in their entirety, the reasons demonstrate that the
trial judge did not find that the appellant was incapable of
appreciating the risks.  To the  contrary, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   I have no hesitation in concluding that Maria [the
   appellant] knew or ought to have known that what her mother was
   doing to Kira was capable of putting her child&#146;s life or safety
   at risk.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The trial judge also dealt directly with the role played by
the appellant&#146;s religious beliefs:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; However, what is clear to me on the evidence is that Maria
   [the appellant] was so convinced that her child was possessed by
   evil spirits, of her mother&#146;s ability to rid the child&#146;s body of
   those spirits by force feeding and of the critical importance of
   doing so that her concern for Kira&#146;s health or safety was
   secondary.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Read in their entirety, the reasons negate any suggestion
that the trial judge found that the appellant was incapable of
appreciating the risk to Kira on account of her religious
beliefs.  As Crown counsel put it in her factum, the trial judge
saw this &#147;not as a case of incapacity but as a case of
subjugating awareness of risk to religious beliefs.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>     V</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant&#146;s fourth submission is a legal one.  Mr.
Harris, for the appellant, seeks to distinguish between crimes of
criminal negligence arising out of acts and crimes of criminal
negligence based on a failure to act where there is a duty to do
so.  Mr. Harris submits that the fault component of crimes of
criminal negligence must vary depending on whether liability
arises out of conduct or an omission.
[20] In R. v. Creighton, supra, at 387-91, McLachlin J., for the
five-person majority, held that criminal culpability for crimes
of negligence was to be measured by reference to a uniform
objective standard.  Fault was determined by asking whether the
conduct constituted a marked departure from that expected of a
reasonable person in the circumstances.  Personal frailties and
shortcomings of the accused were irrelevant unless they rendered
the accused incapable of appreciating the risk or conforming to
the reasonable person standard.
[21] Lamer C.J.C., for the other four members of the court,
concurred in the result but fashioned a different test for
determining culpability for crimes of negligence.  He favoured a
qualified objective test which measured the accused&#146;s conduct
against &#147;a reasonable person who possesses all of the accused&#146;s
limitations.&#148;  By limitations, the Chief Justice meant
characteristics &#147;which the accused could not manage or otherwise
control&#148; (p.363).
[22] Mr. Harris submits that when liability rests in a failure to
act where there is a duty to act, the qualified objective
approach preferred by Lamer C.J.C. should be applied.  Mr. Harris
sees this as a case where the appellant&#146;s liability rests
exclusively in her failure to rescue her child from the
grandmother when, as Mr. Harris acknowledges, the appellant had a
legal duty to attempt to do so.  He contends that had the trial
judge used the qualified objective approach, he would have been
obliged to consider the appellant&#146;s personal characteristics (eg.
her limited intelligence and her fear of her mother) in deciding
whether the appellant&#146;s failure to come to Kira&#146;s assistance
constituted a wanton and reckless disregard for the life or
safety of Kira.
[23] Apart entirely from the legal merits of this submission, it
fails on the facts as found by the trial judge.  The appellant&#146;s
liability did not rest solely on her failure to act.  While it is
true that the trial judge emphasized her failure to act in coming
to his conclusion, he also found that the appellant participated
to some degree in the activity that caused Kira&#146;s death.  The
appellant&#146;s liability arose out of a course of conduct that
included but was not limited to her failure to come to Kira&#146;s
assistance.
[24] I will, however, address the merits of the appellant&#146;s
submission.  Mr. Harris does not suggest that the distinction he
urges is established in the case law.  He turns to first
principles and asserts that the criminal law has recognized that
a person who fails to act to avert a harm is less culpable than
one whose actions caused the risk of harm:  e.g. see E. Colvin,
Principles of Criminal Law, 2d ed. (1991) at p. 75.  He argues
that a subjective mens rea requirement is consistent with the
view that a failure to act is less culpable than an action which
creates a risk.  On his submission, a failure to act becomes
criminal only when accompanied by an actual appreciation of the
risk.
[25] The distinction relied on by the appellant was made by this
court in R. v. Tutton (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 328 at 345-48.
Dubin J.A. applied a purely subjective test in determining
whether the appellants&#146; failure to provide necessaries to their
child amounted to criminal negligence causing death.  In doing
so, he held that fault for conduct-based allegations of criminal
negligence should be determined on an objective basis while fault
for omission-based allegations of criminal negligence should be
determined subjectively.
[26] Unfortunately for the appellant, the distinction between
acts and omissions drawn by this court in R. v. Tutton, supra,
found no supporters in the Supreme Court of Canada.  McIntyre J.,
for three members of the six-person court, expressly rejected the
distinction and favoured an objective assessment of fault for all
allegations of criminal negligence:  R. v. Tutton (1989), 48
C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 139 (S.C.C.).  Wilson J., for the other three
members of the court, also drew no distinction between acts and
omissions.  She would have employed a subjective assessment of
fault for all allegations of criminal negligence causing death.
[27] The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Tutton,
supra, does not close the door on the appellant&#146;s submission as a
matter of stare decisis.  It is, however, formidable authority
against that submission.  The subsequent criminal negligence
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada also tells against
the appellant&#146;s submission.
[28] In R. v. Creighton, supra, McLachlin J. spoke in terms of
carrying out an activity in a dangerous fashion.  This is hardly
surprising since on the facts in Creighton, liability rested on
the accused&#146;s actions (the administration of cocaine to the
victim).  By framing her reasons in terms which corresponded to
the facts of the case before her, I do not think McLachlin J. can
be taken as having intended to draw any distinction between acts
and omissions.  To the contrary, her description of conduct-based
fault (objective mens rea) and her conclusion that subjective
characteristics short of incapacity were irrelevant to the
determination of culpability where fault was conduct-based apply
with equal force to acts and to omissions.
[29] In describing the nature of the fault element in crimes of
negligence, she wrote, at p. 382:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Objective mens rea, on the other hand, is not concerned with
   what the accused intended or knew.  Rather, the mental fault lies
   in failure to direct the mind to a risk which the reasonable
   person would have appreciated.  Objective mens rea is not
   concerned with what was actually in the accused&#146;s mind, but with
   what should have been there, had the accused proceeded
   reasonably.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[30] In addressing the merits of a single legal standard for the
determination of criminal liability based on negligent conduct,
she said, at pp. 388-89:
          </pre>
    <pre>   These considerations suggest that the practical as well as
   the theoretical concerns of the criminal law in the field of
   penal negligence are best served by insisting on a uniform
   standard of conduct for everyone, subject to cases where the
   accused was not capable of recognizing and avoiding the risk
   attendant on the activity in question.  Beyond this, the standard
   should not be individualized by reason of the peculiar  personal
   characteristics of the accused.  The purpose of Parliament in
   creating an offence of objective foresight, as in manslaughter,
   is to stipulate a minimum standard which people engaged in the
   activity in question are expected to meet.  If the standard is
   lowered by reason of the lack of experience, education, or the
   presence of some other &#147;personal characteristic&#148; of the accused,
   the minimum standard which the law imposes on those engaging in
   the activity in question will be eroded.  The objective test
   inevitably is transformed into a subjective test, violating the
   wise admonition in R. v. Hundal, supra, [(1993) 79 C.C.C. (3d) 97
   (S.C.C.)] that there should be a clear distinction in the law
   between subjective and objective standards, and negating the
   legislative goal of a minimum standard of care for all those who
   choose to engage in criminally dangerous conduct&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[31] The determination of fault based on a failure to direct
one&#146;s mind to a risk can be applied equally to acts and
omissions.  The need for a uniform standard for the determination
of criminal culpability is as important where the law imposes a
duty to act and no action is taken, as it is in cases where a
person engages in conduct which creates that same risk.  It would
run contrary to the principle of uniformity and the values
underlying that principle if the criminal law were to distinguish
between a parent who chooses not to administer a life saving drug
to his child, thereby risking the life of that child, and a
parent who actually removes the needle containing the drug from
the arm of the child, thereby creating the very same risk.
[32] The nature of culpability where fault is conduct-based and
the rationale underlying the objective approach to crimes of
negligence support the view expressed by McIntyre J. in R. v.
Tutton, supra.  The fault element for crimes of criminal
negligence should be the same, regardless of whether liability
arises out of a failure to act where there was a duty to act or
out of actions which create a risk.
[33] I do not, however, suggest that the distinction between
omissions and actions may not be important in a particular case.
As McLachlin J. observed in R. v. Creighton, supra, at pp. 391-
92, criminal negligence is determined by an application of a
uniform legal standard of care to the specific activity and
circumstances arising in each case.  In some situations it may be
that a failure to act where there is a duty to do so, will not
fall below the requisite standard whereas actions which actually
create a risk will fall below the standard.
[34] Apart from the case law, the language of s. 219 of the
Criminal Code denies the distinction between acts and omissions
which the appellant seeks to establish.  Section 219 defines
criminal negligence in terms of actions (s. 219(1)(a)) and
omissions where there is a duty to act (s. 219(1)(b)).  It
provides that either actions or omissions constitute criminal
negligence where they show a wanton or reckless disregard for the
lives or safety of others.  The language of the Criminal Code,
the primary source to be examined when determining the elements
of a crime, suggests no difference between the fault element of
criminally negligent conduct and the fault element of a
criminally negligent failure to act where there is a duty to act.
[35] I also regard the attempt to distinguish between acts and
omissions as a fruitless exercise in many situations.  Human
activity involves a course of conduct.  It is artificial to
dissect that conduct into its component parts and label one part
action and another part omission.  The scope of criminal
liability should not depend on semantics.  The facts of this case
make the point. Counsel for the appellant, in describing the
appellant&#146;s conduct, submits that she did not &#147;engage directly in
dangerous risk creating activity.&#148;  He further submits that she
did not &#147;voluntarily or willingly choose to embark on the
dangerous activity.&#148;  I can accept that characterization.
However, I think the appellant&#146;s conduct could equally be
characterized as activity.  She heard Kira screaming and chose to
remain where she was rather than going to her assistance.  In my
view, it could be said, without straining the meaning of the
words, that the appellant, by choosing to stay where she was,
chose to embark on a dangerous activity which enhanced the risk
to her daughter&#146;s life or safety.
[36] The appellant also submits that R. v. Hibbert (1995), 99
C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 227-28  (S.C.C.) supports her position that
the fault component cannot be purely objective where liability
rests on a failure to act where the law imposes a duty to act.
In Hibbert, supra, the court held that the objective standard set
down in R. v. Creighton, supra, was not applicable in assessing
reasonableness within the context of the defence of duress.
[37] I do not think that Hibbert has any application to the
appellant&#146;s submission.  The defence of duress is advanced as an
excuse for having engaged in criminal conduct.  An accused who
pleads duress accepts that he or she performed the actus reus of
the crime with the necessary mens rea, but argues that the
circumstances are such as to excuse the commission of the crime.
Where duress is advanced, one is not concerned with establishing
the standard against which criminal liability is to be measured,
but rather with determining whether a particular accused should
be excused from conforming with that standard.  As an excuse
based defence is a personal plea for exemption from the generally
applicable criminal law of conduct, it must be judged in part by
reference to the characteristics of the individual which are
relevant to the availability of that defence.  The objective
standard set down in Creighton, supra, is concerned with drawing
the line between conduct which is criminally negligent and
conduct which is not criminally negligent.  It is not concerned
with personal exemptions from compliance with the standards of
the criminal law.
[38] The appellant did not admit that she engaged in criminally
negligent conduct and seek to rely on her personal
characteristics as a basis for excusing that criminal conduct.
Rather, she insists that her personal characteristics should be
relevant to the determination of whether her conduct crossed the
boundary between criminal and non-criminal conduct.
Consequently, R. v. Creighton, supra, and not R. v. Hibbert,
supra, is the controlling authority.
[39] I have read with interest the academic commentaries relied
on by the appellant in support of his contention that the fault
requirement for criminal negligence should be different where the
actus reus of the offence is an omission.  Those commentators and
others make the point that the criminal law is reluctant to hold
that omissions can constitute the actus reus of a crime.  That
reluctance, however, rests on concerns about the kinds of
omissions that should be criminally culpable and does not suggest
that all omissions are somehow less culpable than actions.  If
the duty to act is clear and well established and the risk to
others flowing from the failure to act is real, the criminal law
has not been reluctant to impose liability.  I would adopt the
comments of Professor Ashworth in Principles of Criminal Law, 2d
ed. (1995), at pp. 110-11:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Thus the fragility of the act &#150; omission distinction and the
   vagaries of the English language suggest that omissions liability
   should not be opposed in principle.  There are some clear cases
   of omission in which it is desirable to have criminal liability,
   such as the parent who neglects to feed her or his child or
   neglects to protect it from abuse.  Omissions can be involuntary
   or not, in the same way as acts;  and, it is submitted, omissions
   can also be causes.  Omissions liability may therefore satisfy
   the principle that no one should be held liable for bodily
   movements that he or she did not and could not direct.  It may
   also satisfy the principle that no person should be held liable
   for conduct or consequences that he or she did not cause.  The
   precise point of the act requirement is to exclude liability for
   mere thoughts that do not result in some bodily movement.
   Omissions liability does not require any bodily movement;
   instead, it is premised on failure to fulfil a duty.  A parent
   may realize that it is her or his duty to feed a child, but may
   take no steps to do so.  Omissions liability can only be said to
   uphold the rationale of the act requirement, while departing from
   its terms, in so far as the relevant duty is widely publicized
   and widely known.  In those circumstances there can be no
   fairness objection to holding a person liable, provided that he
   or she is capable of taking some steps to carry out the duty.

    <pre>     VI</pre>
    <pre>[40] The last submission advanced by the appellant depends on the
admissibility of &#147;fresh&#148; evidence tendered by the appellant on
the appeal.  That evidence consists of a report prepared by Dr.
Isabelle Coté, a psychiatrist, and her testimony during the
sentencing phase of the appellant&#146;s trial.
[41] The report of Dr. Coté was prepared at trial counsel&#146;s
request and was available to him well before the trial.  He chose
not to call Dr. Coté and to instead advance a defence which
rested entirely on the Crown&#146;s failure to establish that the
appellant knew that Kira was at risk as a result of her
grandmother&#146;s conduct.  He tendered the report and Dr. Coté&#146;s
evidence on sentencing to establish the appellant&#146;s mental state
and the dynamics of the relationship between the appellant and
her mother.  Trial counsel contended that both were mitigating
factors on sentence and the trial judge agreed.
[42] The psychiatric evidence tendered on appeal is hardly
&#147;fresh&#148; evidence.  It was available at trial.  It is argued that
the evidence is nonetheless admissible on appeal either because
counsel&#146;s failure to adduce it at trial constitutes ineffective
representation and resulted in a miscarriage of justice, or
because the interests of justice demand that this court receive
the evidence even though it was available at trial.  In support
of the second submission, the appellant relies on the well
established principle that fresh evidence can be admitted on
appeal in criminal cases where its admission is necessary to
avoid a miscarriage of justice even though the evidence was
available at trial:  R. v. M.(P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 at
410 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Price, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 633;  R. v.
Warsing (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 259, per Major J., at 284, per
L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J., in dissent, on another ground, at pp. 273-74
(S.C.C.).
[43] In submitting that counsel&#146;s failure to lead the psychiatric
evidence at trial amounted to ineffective representation, Mr.
Harris fully complied with his professional obligations.  The
court was provided with trial counsel&#146;s affidavit and his cross-
examination on that affidavit by Crown counsel.  Trial counsel
gave a detailed explanation for his decision.  It was counsel&#146;s
considered opinion that the appellant&#146;s best defence was that she
had no reason to believe that Kira&#146;s life or safety was at risk.
He believed that if he introduced the psychiatric evidence, it
would of necessity include statements made by the appellant which
would destroy that defence.  Counsel also believed, based on his
assessment of the case, that the psychiatric evidence would be of
little assistance without evidence from the appellant.  Based on
his interviews with the appellant, trial counsel was satisfied
that her evidence would not support the psychiatric opinions
advanced by Dr. Coté.  Finally, counsel was very concerned that
the evidence could raise the issue of whether the appellant was
incapable on account of mental disorder of appreciating the
nature and quality of her acts.  If that issue was raised, it
could lead to a finding of not criminally responsible on account
of mental disorder (NCR).  Counsel was of the view that an NCR
finding would not be in the appellant&#146;s best interests.
[44] I am entirely satisfied that trial counsel made a reasonable
assessment of the situation.  His decision not to tender the
psychiatric evidence at trial does not demonstrate incompetence.
To the contrary, it reflects a carefully considered assessment of
a difficult situation.
[45] I am also of the view that the interests of justice do not
warrant the admission of the psychiatric evidence on appeal.  In
coming to that conclusion, I assess the relevance of the evidence
on the basis on which counsel tenders it.  He submits that the
evidence is relevant to the appellant&#146;s capacity to appreciate
the risk to Kira.  At the same time, however, he disavows any
reliance on s. 16 of the Criminal Code.  Like counsel at trial,
he does not suggest that the appellant was incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of her acts on account of
mental disorder.  He firmly opposes any attempt to put the
appellant&#146;s &#147;sanity&#148; in issue.
[46] As I read the psychiatric evidence, its only possible
relevance is to the question of whether the appellant was
incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of her acts on
account of mental disorder.  I do not suggest that the evidence
would necessarily be relevant to that issue.  The potential
relevance of the evidence to that issue cannot be meaningfully
assessed as it was not tendered on that basis, is not focused on
that issue and has not been tested.  I mean only to say that the
evidence has no possible relevance apart from a claim that the
appellant was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of
her acts on account of mental disorder.  As the appellant
emphatically does not tender the evidence on that issue, it
follows that it has no relevance and cannot be received on
appeal.
[47] In so concluding, I observe that neither counsel for the
appellant nor counsel for the Crown suggests that this is one of
those rare cases where the court, on its own initiative, should
explore the question of whether an accused is not criminally
responsible on account of mental disorder.  It is not suggested
by counsel for the Crown or the appellant that there is any
reason to believe that the appellant was not capable of
appreciating the nature and consequences of her actions on
account of mental disorder, or that she poses any ongoing danger
to the community.</pre>
