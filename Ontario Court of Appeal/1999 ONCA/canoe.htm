    <pre>On appeal from the order of Divisional Court (Farley, Chapnik and
Karam JJ.) dated June 2, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This appeal was heard on October 20 and 22, 1999.   It  was
dismissed  from  the  bench with reasons  to  follow,  which  are
provided here.
[2]  The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 31 (&quot;FOI&quot;) provides a broad right of access to
information under the control of government institutions.  The
legislation also creates exemptions from this general disclosure
obligation, including in circumstances where disclosure could
reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the personal safety of
an individual.  This appeal requires the court to assess whether
the Divisional Court applied the appropriate principles of
judicial review to a decision of an Inquiry Officer appointed
under the FOI who was asked to determine the applicability of the
personal safety exemption provisions in the legislation.</pre>
    <pre>Factual Background

[3]  An individual (&#147;Requester&#148;) made a request under the FOI  to
the  Office  of the Worker Advisor of the respondent Minister  of
Labour  (&quot;Ministry&quot;)  for  access  to  all  records  relating  to
himself.   The Office of the Worker Advisor (&quot;OWA&quot;) is an  agency
of  the  Ministry established to represent workers in proceedings
under  the Workers' Compensation Act (&quot;WCA&quot;).  The Requester  was
seeking records held by the OWA in furtherance of an injury claim
he  was pursuing under the WCA.   The OWA had refused to continue
to represent him in these proceedings.
[4]  In a letter to the Requester dated July 3, 1997, the
Ministry granted access to all of the records responsive to his
request except for three brief internal memoranda totalling four
pages.  It withheld these records, citing the exemptions to
disclosure found in ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 of the FOI.1  These
provisions state:
     14.(1)  A  head  may refuse to disclose a record  where  the
     disclosure could reasonably be expected to,
     </pre>
    <pre>         (e)  endanger  the life or physical  safety  of  a  law
         enforcement officer or any other person
                            &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>     20.  A  head  may  refuse to disclose  a  record  where  the
     disclosure   could  reasonably  be  expected  to   seriously
     threaten the safety or health of an individual.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   This  was  the  first occasion on which  the  Ministry  had
claimed an exemption from disclosure under either ss. 14(1)(e) or
20.   At  the  time of this refusal, the Ministry  had  processed
almost 6000 requests under the FOI.
[6]  The Requester appealed the Ministry&#146;s decision to the
Information and Privacy Commissioner.  The Ministry provided a
two-page affidavit in support of its position that the records
were exempt from disclosure because the deponent could reasonably
be expected to be threatened or endangered thereby.
[7]  The three records in issue are between employees of the OWA
and discuss disturbing contacts with the Requester as well as
strategies for dealing with future contacts with that individual.
The deponent of the affidavit was the author of two of the three
memos and the recipient of the third.  He/She deposed that the
Requester had used threatening and profane language in past
dealings with staff of the OWA and the Workers' Compensation
Board (&quot;WCB&quot;).  He/She also deposed that psychiatric and medical
reports in the Requester's WCB file (which had been returned to
the Requester) expressed concern that the Requester would act out
past threats of violence against WCB staff.  The deponent further
swore that he/she had &quot;&#133;real concern that disclosure of the three
records that have been withheld would inflame [the Requester's]
relationship with this office and, in particular, with me
personally. &#133; I feel that I have good reason to think that
disclosure of these documents could reasonably be expected to
threaten my personal safety.&quot;
[8]  In a decision dated January 5, 1998 (Order P-1510), the
Inquiry Officer of the Office of the Information and Privacy
Commissioner, Holly Big Canoe, ordered the Ministry to disclose
the three records to the Requester.  She interpreted ss. 14(1)(e)
and 20 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Without discounting the real and valid concerns many public
          officials may have concerning their personal safety which may
          result from their employment, both sections 14(1)(e) and 20 of
          the Act require me to objectively assess the connection between
          the disclosure of the records at issue and the endangerment or
          threat that is contemplated.  The Act requires me to determine if
          the disclosure of the record could reasonably be expected to
          endanger the life or safety of a person in the case of section
          14(1)(e) or in the case of section 20 to seriously threaten the
          health or safety of the individual.





</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The Inquiry Officer then concluded as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               Having considered the Ministry's representations and the
          other circumstances of this appeal, including the nature of these
          particular records, I am not convinced that there is a reasonable
          expectation of probable harm to the individuals whom the Ministry
          has identified as being at risk.
</pre>
    <pre>She  thus  determined  that  the  records  did  not  qualify  for
exemption.
[10] The Ministry sought judicial review of the Inquiry Officer's
order  directing  disclosure of the records.   In  an  unreported
endorsement  dated June 2, 1998, the Divisional Court unanimously
allowed  the  Ministry's application and quashed the  order.  The
court  held  that, contrary to the Inquiry Officer's  conclusion,
there  need  not be evidence of probable harm for the  exemptions
from disclosure in ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 to apply:</pre>
    <pre>          
               There was direct knowledge affidavit evidence put forward to
          the Officer on a sealed basis as to the psychiatric and other
          medical reports concerning the Requester (which reports are in
          the possession of the Requester) which express concern that the
          Requester would act out his threats of violence against Ministry
          staff.  Endangerment or the serious threatening as to the safety
          of a person does not mean that there must be probable harm.  As
          well, a reasonable expectation in the context of these two
          sections does not import a requirement that there is likely to be
          a &#147;bad result&#148; based on a balance of probabilities.  Even
          considering the French version of the relevant provisions (which
          must be viewed on an overall basis for comparison with the
          English and not on a word for word basis), the test used by the
          Officer of a &quot;reasonable expectation of probable harm&quot; does not
          in our view conform to the purposes of the sections, their
          substance or the overall context of the Act.
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The court concluded that the Inquiry Officer had interpreted
ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 in a patently unreasonable manner:</pre>
    <pre>          
               To interpret the provisions of these two sections as the
          Officer has, is in our view at least patently unreasonable.  Thus
          it is not necessary to deal with the specific standard of review.
          It would seem to us that the reports referred to above are a
          sufficient and rational basis to found a reasonable expectation
          of endangerment to or a serious threatening as to the safety of
          staff at the Applicant.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] The Inquiry Officer sought and received leave to appeal  the
Divisional Court's decision overturning her order to this court.

Issues

</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The  appellant received leave to appeal  on  the  following
issues:
</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Did  the  Divisional  Court err in applying  the  wrong
          standard of review by substituting its own view of  the
          interpretation and application of the Act  and  of  the
          evidence  in place of the Inquiry Officer&#146;s  reasonable
          determinations?
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Did  the  Divisional  Court err  in  finding  that  the
          Inquiry   Officer   was   patently   unreasonable    in
          interpreting  the words &#147;could reasonably  be  expected
          to&#148; in sections 14(1)(e) and 20 as requiring proof of a
          reasonable expectation of probable harm?
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   Did  the  Divisional  Court err  in  finding  that  the
          Inquiry  Officer  misapplied the  exemptions  and  that
          medical reports not before the Inquiry Officer  were  a
          &#147;sufficient  and rational basis&#148; on which  to  conclude
          that sections 14(1)(e) and 20 of the Act applied?

</pre>
    <pre>[14]  These issues overlap to a significant degree.  They may  be
reduced  to  the  following questions: what  standard  of  review
applies  to the Inquiry Officer's decision, and does the  Inquiry
Officer's  interpretation of the safety exemption  provisions  in
the FOI satisfy that standard?</pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>a)  What is the applicable standard of review?

[15] This court has held that the standard of review that applies
to  the Assistant Information and Privacy Commissioner's decision
on  the  availability of exemptions from disclosure  under  subs.
17(1)  and  (2)  of  the FOI is &quot;simple reasonableness&quot;:  Ontario
(Workers'  Compensation Board) v. Ontario (Assistant  Information
and  Privacy Commissioner) (1998), 104 D.L.R. (4th)  129  at  139
(Ont.  C.A.).2   Subsection  17(1)  of  the  FOI  protects   from
disclosure  a  record  that reveals a trade  secret,  scientific,
technical,  commercial,  financial or labour  relations  material
that is supplied in confidence, where disclosure might reasonably
be  expected to prejudice an individual's competitive position or
cause  undue  loss  or  gain.   Subsection  17(2)  exempts   from
disclosure  information gathered for the purpose  of  determining
tax liability or tax collection.
[16] In that case, Labrosse J.A., speaking for the court,
balanced the factors for and against applying either of the two
extremes of the correctness or the patent unreasonableness
standards of review.  Factors in favour of limited deference
identified by Labrosse J.A. included the absence of a privative
or finality clause in the FOI, the limited fact-finding function
of the Commissioner and the absence of a policy-making function
on the part of the Commissioner.  The factors identified as
tending towards greater deference were the absence of a right of
appeal and the fact that the Commissioner was applying expertise
in balancing the need for access and the right to protection of
privacy in interpreting the exemption provisions at issue.
Taking these factors together, the court concluded that the
intermediate standard of reasonableness simpliciter should be
applied to the Commissioner's decision.
[17] In the present case, the Divisional Court chose not to
decide the issue of the specific standard of review, concluding
that the Inquiry Officer's decision was patently unreasonable.
The court gave its decision prior to the release of Ontario
(Workers' Compensation Board), supra.  Counsel for the Inquiry
Officer argued that the appropriate standard of review is simple
reasonableness, invoking Ontario (Workers' Compensation Board) in
support of this argument.  In contrast, counsel for the
respondent Ministry seeks to distinguish this decision on the
theory that a question involving the ordinary meaning of words of
common usage such as those in ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 does not engage
the Commission's specialized expertise.  According to counsel for
the respondent, the appropriate standard of review is
correctness.
[18] The submission on behalf of the respondent is not
persuasive.  The Inquiry Officer's specialized expertise was
engaged by the question raised before her in the sense described
by this court in Ontario (Workers' Compensation Board).  In
determining whether the records at issue came within ss. 14(1)(e)
and 20, the Inquiry Officer was called upon to apply her
expertise in balancing the need for access and the right to
protection of privacy.  In addition, the determination of the
applicability of the statutory exemptions was a question squarely
within her jurisdiction as conferred by the FOI.   This case is
thus distinguishable from Simcoe Court Reporting (Barrie) Inc. v.
Donald Hale, an unreported decision of this court dated November
1, 1999.  O'Connor J.A. for the court held that an Inquiry
Officer's decision on whether a record was &quot;under the control&quot; of
a provincial government institution within the meaning of s. 10
of the FOI was reviewable on a correctness standard.  This
question went to jurisdiction in the sense that records under the
control of an institution are subject to the FOI whereas those
that are not fall outside the Act.   In contrast, in the instant
case there was no issue that the documents in question were
subject to the provisions of the FOI.</pre>
    <pre>b)  Is  the  Inquiry Officer's interpretation  of  the  exemption
provisions in ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 of the FOI reasonable?
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  As  noted, the Divisional Court concluded that the  Inquiry
Officer's  decision  was patently unreasonable.   In  determining
whether  the Divisional Court's decision overturning the  Inquiry
Officer's order should be upheld, this court will apply the  less
deferential standard of reasonableness simpliciter to the Inquiry
Officer's decision.
[20] In defining the content of the reasonableness simpliciter
standard, the court in Ontario (Workers' Compensation Board),
supra, stated at p. 142 that, &quot;&#133; to conclude that a decision is
unreasonable the court must find that it is irrational or not in
accordance with reason.  It need not find that the decision is
clearly irrational or patently unreasonable.&quot;  The Supreme Court
of Canada in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 228 recently
described the reasonableness simpliciter standard in terms of the
following language of Iacobucci J. in Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748
at 776:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [a]n unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not
          supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing
          examination.  Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the
          reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons
          support it.  The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in
          the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by
          which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it.

</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The Inquiry Officer concluded that ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 were
inapplicable  because  she was not convinced  that  there  was  a
reasonable  expectation  of  probable  harm  to  the  individuals
identified  as  being  at  risk.  The reasonable  expectation  of
probable  harm test was developed by the Federal Court of  Appeal
in  Canada  Packers  Inc.  v.  Canada (Minister  of  Agriculture)
(1988),   53   D.L.R.   (4th)  246.   That  case   involved   the
interpretation of an exemption from disclosure provision  in  the
federal freedom of information legislation.  The court noted that
the  purpose of the federal legislation set out in s.  2  of  the
Access  to  Information  Act,  R.S.C.  1985,  c.  A-1,  is   that
government information should be made available to the public and
exemptions  from  that  right of access  should  be  limited  and
specific.   Having regard to this legislative purpose, the  court
concluded at p. 255 that the phrase &quot;could reasonably be expected
to&quot;  should  be  interpreted  as imposing  a  requirement  of  an
expectation of probable rather than possible harm.  See  also  Re
Saint  John  Shipbuilding Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Supply  and
Services (1990), 67 D.L.R. (4th) 315 (F.C.A.).
[22] Like s. 2 of the federal Access to Information Act, the
purpose provision in s. 1 of the provincial FOI states that the
right of access to information should be in accordance with the
principles that information should be available to the public and
that exemptions from the right of access should be limited and
specific.
[23] To date, there is no reported judicial authority on the
proper interpretation of  ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 of the FOI.  The
Divisional Court in this case concluded that endangerment or the
serious threatening of the safety of a person does not mean that
there must be probable harm to an individual in the context of
ss. 14(1)(e) and 20.   The court held that the Inquiry Officer's
construction of the provisions as requiring a &quot;reasonable
expectation of probable harm&quot; does not conform to the purposes of
the sections or the FOI as a whole.
[24] I agree with the Divisional Court's conclusion that harm to
an individual need not be probable for a government institution
to successfully rely on the exemption provisions in ss. 14(1)(e)
and 20 of the FOI.  The expectation of probable harm test was
developed in a context where personal safety was not in issue.
Canada Packers, supra, involved the interpretation of a provision
exempting disclosure of the requested information in
circumstances where disclosure could reasonably be expected to
result in material financial loss or interfere with contractual
negotiations.   The interests at stake in that case were less
compelling than those of personal safety and bodily integrity. It
is unreasonable to require a government institution to show an
expectation of probable harm to an individual in order to rely on
the personal safety exemption provisions in the FOI.
[25] The expectation of harm must be reasonable, but it need not
be probable.  Section 14(1)(e) requires a determination of
whether there is a reasonable basis for concluding that
disclosure could be expected to endanger the life or physical
safety of a person.  In other words, the party resisting
disclosure must demonstrate that the reason for resisting
disclosure is not a frivolous or exaggerated expectation of
endangerment to safety.  Similarly, s. 20 calls for a
demonstration that disclosure could reasonably be expected to
seriously threaten the safety or health of an individual, as
opposed to there being a groundless or exaggerated expectation of
a threat to safety.  Introducing the element of probability in
this assessment is not appropriate considering the interests that
are at stake, particularly the very significant interest of
bodily integrity.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to
establish as a matter of probabilities that a person's life or
safety will be endangered by the release of a potentially
inflammatory record. Where there is a reasonable basis for
believing that a person's safety will be endangered by disclosing
a record, the holder of that record properly invokes ss. 14(1)(e)
or 20 to refuse disclosure.
[26] The Divisional Court did not err in concluding that the
Inquiry Officer's construction of ss. 14(1)(e) and 20 was
unreasonable.  In addition to articulating the wrong test for the
applicability of ss. 14(1)(e) and 20, the Inquiry Officer failed
to provide reasons for concluding that the Ministry had not
demonstrated a reasonable concern for the safety of the
identified individual in the circumstances.  The exemption
claimed by the Ministry was in respect of three brief internal
memoranda that were of no relevance to the Requester's claim
before the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal.  Moreover,
this was the first time in almost 6000 requests that the Ministry
had claimed an exemption from disclosure under either ss.
14(1)(e) or 20 of the FOI. The Ministry provided a sworn
affidavit indicating that the Requester had threatened persons in
the OWA, including the deponent, and that the Requester had been
legally restrained from entering certain premises of the WCB.
The deponent was also familiar with the medical portion of the
Requester's WCB file, which included reports expressing concern
that the Requester would act out his/her threats of violence
against WCB staff.  The evidence provided by the Ministry was
uncontroverted.
[27] Having considered the uncontradicted evidence proffered by
the Ministry, the Inquiry Officer concluded that she was not
convinced that there was a reasonable expectation of harm to the
individuals identified at risk.  She did not explain why she
dismissed the Ministry's concerns.  The important principle of
judicial deference to decisions of administrative bodies does not
protect the Inquiry Officer's conclusion that the exemption
provisions of the FOI were inapplicable where the evidence
pointed towards the opposite result and where there was no
explanation of how or why she came to her conclusion.  The words
of Strayer J.A. in Williams v. Canada, [1997] 2 F.C. 646 at 673
(Fed. C.A.) are germane in this regard:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In such cases the tribunal decision is set aside not because
          of a lack of reasons per se but because in the absence of reasons
          it is not possible to overcome the inference of perversity or
          error derived from the result or the surrounding circumstances of
          the decision.
     

</pre>
    <pre>[28]   The  applicable  standard  of  review  in  this  case   is
reasonableness  simpliciter.   The  Inquiry  Officer's   decision
cannot  be  said  to be reasonable where it is not  supported  by
either  reasons  or by the evidence and where the  basis  of  the
decision is not evident from the circumstances:  Baker v. Canada,
supra, at p. 228.

</pre>
    <pre>Disposition

</pre>
    <pre>[28]  The  appeal  is dismissed.  The parties agreed  that  there
should be no order concerning costs.

1The Ministry also indicated that s. 21(1) applied to one record
and that s.13(1) applied to a second record; however, it did not
rely on these grounds of exemption before the Divisional Court
and does not invoke them in this appeal.
