    <pre>BY THE COURT:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appeal turns on whether the exclusionary clause,
contained in the Agreements of Purchase and Sale of unfinished
condominium units, is sufficiently clear to exclude the common
law warranty of construction implied by law in the sale of
uncompleted housing property.
[2]  Forget J., on a motion brought pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a)
of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the determination of certain
questions of law, held that the clause was sufficiently wide to
exclude the common law implied warranty. Consequently, he held
that the appellant, Carleton Condominium Corporation No. 32
(&#147;C.C.C. No. 32&#148;), did not have the benefit of the common law
implied warranty of construction with respect to common elements
in its action against the respondent developer and builder,
Camdev Corporation, for damages for defects in construction of
the common elements.
[3]  We agree with this conclusion. In light of this finding, it
was not necessary for the motions judge to determine the question
of duration of any liability under an implied common law warranty
and we do not propose to deal with this additional issue. We also
find it unnecessary to determine the second question of law
raised on the motion as to whether C.C.C. No. 32 could assert the
common law implied warranty with respect to all units, including
those to which the warranty did not extend because the units were
completed when sold, so as to allow for full recovery of damages
to the common elements.
[4]  It is clear there is no implied warranty of fitness for
human habitation upon the purchase of housing property that is
already completed at the time of sale. The common law doctrine of
caveat emptor governs with respect to the sale of real property
and the purchaser must generally seek protection either by
express warranty or by independent examination of the premises.
However, in the case of unfinished premises, the common law
implies a warranty of construction since there is no opportunity
for inspection of the finished premises at the time of sale. See
Fraser-Reid v. Droumtsekas, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 720.
[5]  The parties to an agreement of purchase and sale of
unfinished housing property are nonetheless free to make their
own bargain. Hence, they are at liberty to exclude the
application of any common law implied warranty by the terms of
their contract. And, as stated by this court in Fraser Jewellers
(1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co. (1997), 34 O.R.
(3d) 1 at 10, an exclusionary clause should prima facie be
enforced according to its true meaning, with relief being granted
only if the test in Hunter Engineering Company Inc. v. Syncrude,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 427 is met:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Relief should be granted only if the clause, seen in the
          light of the entire agreement, can be said, on Dickson C.J.C.&#146;s
          test to be &#147;unconscionable&#148; or, on Wilson J.&#146;s test, to be
          &#147;unfair or unreasonable&#148;. The difference in practice between
          these alternatives, as Professor Waddams has observed, &#147;is
          unlikely to be large&#148;: Waddams, The Law of Contract 3rd. (1993),
          at p.323</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In this case, the agreement of purchase and sale contained
the following clause:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is hereby expressly understood and agreed that other than
          a written one-year guarantee to be issued by the Vendor to the
          Purchaser, which guarantee shall be personal to the Purchaser and
          shall be non-assignable to any subsequent Purchaser, there are no
          warranties or conditions either oral or written save those
          expressed in this Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In performance of this clause, a written one-year guarantee
was delivered to the purchasers on closing. It contained, amongst
other provisions, the following clause:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This is the only guarantee made or authorized with respect
          to your home and is in lieu of all other guarantees expressed or
          implied and of all other obligations and liabilities on part
          whether with respect to materials or workmanship in the home,
          damages suffered by the purchaser or others or to his or their
          effects or otherwise. No guarantee is made beyond the time
          limited above even though the claimed defect does not become
          apparent within such period.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant argues that the clause contained in the
agreement of purchase and sale is not wide enough to exclude the
common law implied warranty since it refers only to &#147;oral&#148; or
&#147;written&#148; warranties. While it is conceded that the further
written warranty delivered on closing is wide enough to exclude
&#147;implied&#148; warranties, it is argued that this clause is
unenforceable against the purchasers since it was given
unilaterally by the vendor without consideration.
[9]  We see no merit to the appellant&#146;s latter argument. In our
view, it is clear under the terms of the Agreement of Purchase
and Sale that the parties agreed that the only warranty given by
the vendor was the written one-year guarantee to be issued by the
vendor. The written guarantee in question was issued in
accordance with the terms of the agreement and accepted by the
purchasers upon closing the transaction. Indeed, claims were made
under this guarantee. Hence the written guarantee forms part of
the bargain between the parties and, by its terms, it clearly
excludes any implied warranty of construction.
[10] Finally, we agree with the motions judge that there is no
reason why the exclusionary clause in the written guarantee
should not be enforced according to its plain meaning. It is not
unconscionable, unfair or unreasonable.
[11] We would dismiss the appeal, confirm the motions judge&#146;s
answer to the first question of law, and make no comment on the
second question.
[12] On consent of the parties, the costs of the motion and the
appeal (including airfare) are in the cause.
