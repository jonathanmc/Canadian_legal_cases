    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

               CARLSON-WILSON and SHELBEY CARLSON-WILSON by their

               (Appellants))  v.  BRUCE G.  PETERS,  CANADA  LIFE
               CASUALTY  INSURANCE COMPANY and  HER  MAJESTY  THE
               QUEEN  IN  RIGHTS  OF  THE  PROVINCE  OF  ONTARIO,
               REPRESENTED BY THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION  FOR
               THE  PROVINCE OF ONTARIO and MURRAY N. ELLIES  and
               ROBERT DINNEN (Defendants (Respondents))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ABELLA, LASKIN and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       H. Michael Kelly
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Stuart D. Forbes
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         September 17, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice D. Lissaman dated August
25, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   We  are not persuaded that the defendant has satisfied  his
onus  of showing that there is no genuine issue for trial.  While
the  evidence  may  be thin, there remains  an  issue  about  the
respondent  being  distracted and not keeping a proper  look-out,
and  whether  his  failure to do so may have contributed  to  the
appellant&#146;s injuries.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appeal is allowed, the order of Justice Lissaman is set
aside, and the motion for summary judgment is dismissed with
costs here and on the motion.</pre></td>
