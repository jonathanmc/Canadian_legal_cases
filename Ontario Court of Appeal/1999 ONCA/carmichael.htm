</pre>
    <pre>[1]   I am asked to award and fix the costs of the appeal and  of
the  proceedings in the motion court.  The appellants  brought  a
motion  to  compel  the  respondent, their former  solicitor,  to
release  their  file  to  them.  That  motion  was  dismissed  in
February  1994  and an appeal from that order to this  court  was
dismissed in February of this year.
[2]  Ferrier J., who heard the motion, made no order as to costs.
He adjourned that issue directing that either party could bring a
motion for costs on 10 days&#146; notice.  Neither party did so.  I
will not become involved in making what amounts to an initial
costs order with respect to proceedings on the motion.  Those
costs should be determined by that court.  I also doubt whether I
have any authority to make a costs order relating to the costs of
the motion when the only order of this court is one dismissing an
appeal from the order dismissing the motion.  I will make no
order with respect to the costs at the motion, but will deal only
with the costs on the appeal.
[3]  This appeal was commenced early in 1994.  It would seem that
nothing was done to perfect the appeal until the appellants were
given notice by the Registrar that their appeal would be
dismissed for non-perfection.  The appeal was subsequently
perfected and scheduled for June 1997, but had to be adjourned
when counsel for the appellants provided the respondent with a
factum raising new issues shortly before the appeal.  As a term
of that adjournment, the court ordered that the appellants pay to
the respondent $1,500.00 in costs thrown away.  That amount was
eventually paid.  In oral argument, the respondent acknowledged
that my primary concern on this appeal was with the costs
incurred after June 1997.  In view of the disposition I propose
to make on this motion,  I must also distinguish between the
costs referable to the appeal and motions relating to the appeal
and costs referable to this motion for costs.
[4]  There were several motions brought in connection with this
appeal before it was eventually dismissed on consent in February
of this year. The following motions were brought:
</pre>
    <pre>¨     A motion before McKinlay J.A. for directions;

¨      A  motion before Abella J.A. for security for costs.  That
  motion was adjourned and Abella J.A. made a cost order in favour
  of the respondent.

¨     A  motion  before  Finlayson J.A. for security  for  costs.
  Finlayson J.A. made an order requiring that the appellants post
  security  and  directing that the appeal be  dismissed  if  the
  security was not posted in compliance with his order.

¨     A  motion before Morden J.A. seeking the dismissal  of  the
  appeal.  Morden J.A. adjourned the motion;

¨     A  motion before Rosenberg J.A. for an order dismissing the
  appeal.  Rosenberg J.A. adjourned the motion, directed that the
  appellants&#146; appeal be delisted and directed that the appellants&#146;
  appeal from the order of Finlayson J.A. proceed on a set date;

¨     A  motion  before  a panel of this court seeking  an  order
  setting  aside  the  order of Finlayson J.A.   The  motion  was
  dismissed;

¨     A  motion before me for an order dismissing the appeal  for
  non-compliance with the order of Finlayson J.A. and for an order
  fixing costs against the appellants and their solicitors.   The
  appeal  was  ordered  dismissed and  the  issue  of  costs  was
  adjourned.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]   When the motion was brought before me in February 1999, the
appellants agreed that the appeal should be dismissed and further
acknowledged  their liability for costs but on a  party-and-party
basis.   The  respondent, however, sought costs on a  client-and-
solicitor  basis  and also indicated that he  was  seeking  costs
against the appellants&#146; solicitors personally.  Mr. Wysocky acted
for  the  appellants until the spring of 1998.   Mr.  Fulton  has
acted for the appellants since that time.  The respondent had put
both  solicitors on notice of his intention to seek costs against
them personally. The motion for costs was adjourned to allow  the
parties to file material.
[6]  The parties disagree on almost everything, but they do agree
that I should fix costs rather than direct an assessment.  While
the respondent, who is a solicitor, acted for himself in these
proceedings, no issue was raised by the appellants or their
former solicitors as to the respondent&#146;s right to claim his
costs.
[7]  I will deal first with the claim that Mr. Fulton should be
personally reasonable for all or some of the costs awarded to the
respondent.  Mr. Fulton became involved in this appeal in the
spring of 1998 after Mr. Wysocky was suspended from the practice
of law.  I think it is fair to say that Mr. Fulton stepped into a
situation in which Mr. Wysocky and the respondent had developed a
strong person animosity towards each other.  The respondent
appears to have immediately equated Mr. Fulton with Mr. Wysocky
and the same antipathy infected their relationship.
[8]  The respondent contends that Mr. Fulton should be personally
liable for costs because he took a frivolous appeal from the
order of Finlayson J.A. and because Mr. Fulton &#147;used a false
affidavit.&#148;  I can find nothing in the material to support the
allegation that Mr. Fulton knowingly used a false affidavit.  Nor
on this material would I be prepared to find that the affidavit
in question was false.  It may or may not have been false.  I
simply cannot say on the basis of the material placed before me.
[9]  I also cannot accept the respondent&#146;s submission that the
appeal from the order of Finlayson J.A. was frivolous and taken
for some ulterior purpose.  Furthermore, I would not order costs
against a solicitor personally solely on the basis that the
solicitor took an appeal which I regarded as frivolous.  While
the respondent&#146;s association of Mr. Fulton with what he regards
as the sins of Mr. Wysocky is perhaps understandable from his
perspective, I cannot impute Mr. Wysocky&#146;s conduct to Mr. Fulton.
I will make no order against Mr. Fulton personally.
[10] With respect to the claim against Mr. Wysocky personally, I
am troubled by his truculent and somewhat obstructionist attitude
as displayed during his cross-examination on an affidavit filed
on one of the motions.  Mr. Wysocky also demonstrated little, if
any, appreciation for the substance or purpose of the rules
governing the perfection of appeal in this court.
[11] In support of his claim that Mr. Wysocky should be
personally liable for the costs, the respondent submitted that
this appeal was devoid of merit and that Mr. Wysocky must have
realized that the appeal had no merit from the outset.  While the
manner in which the appeal was prosecuted raises suspicion, I
cannot, based on the material filed before me, judge the merits
of the appeal.  The fact that the appellants eventually agreed to
the dismissal of the appeal may reflect on the merits of their
appeal, or it may simply reflect the fact that they could not, or
would not comply with the security for costs order made by
Finlayson J.A.
[12] The respondent also made serious allegations of misconduct
against Mr. Wysocky in the course of his oral submissions and in
his factum.  I must accept Mr. Wysocky&#146;s submission that these
allegations cannot be given weight absent any evidence to support
them.  While judges often rely on the submissions of counsel as
opposed to evidence in determining costs orders, I do not think
it is appropriate to rely on submissions to make serious findings
of misconduct against a person.  The respondent chose not to file
any affidavit material to support those allegations and absent
any such evidence, I will not make findings of misconduct against
Mr. Wysocky.
[13] The respondent also placed reliance on the many offers to
settle he made and the failure of the appellants to respond to
those offers.  In my view, that failure cannot be brought home to
Mr. Wysocky who was presumably acting on the instructions of the
appellants.  It was up to them to decide whether to accept the
offers to settle.  There is also some force to the contention
that the offers to settle, which all contained a requirement that
the appellants release all claims they might have against the
respondent, were not realistic offers to settle.  The appellants
wanted the file in part to determine whether they had any claim
in negligence against the respondent.  That purpose would be
entirely defeated if they were required to provide a release to
the respondent before obtaining the file.
[14] The respondent also submitted that Mr. Wysocky was
conducting and pursuing the appeal without the proper authority
from his clients, the appellants.  The respondent relied on a
remark attributed to one of the appellants.  That remark is not
in affidavit form and, in my view, can be given little, if any,
weight.  Certainly, it is not enough to cause me to find that it
was Mr. Wysocky and not the appellant who were &#147;driving&#148; this
appeal.
[15] Bearing in mind the extreme caution which should be
exercised before awarding costs personally against a solicitor, I
am not satisfied that the respondent has made out a case for
ordering costs personally against Mr. Wysocky:  Young v. Young,
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 3.  In my view, the caution expressed in Young v.
Young, supra, applies to applications for costs orders made under
Rule 57.07, just as it does to applications for costs orders made
under the inherent jurisdiction of the court.
[16] The appellants acknowledged that an award as to costs should
be made against them.  The scale and quantum of those costs is at
issue.  I see no basis in the material tendered by the respondent
for an order awarding costs on a solicitor-and-client basis.  In
my view, the costs should be awarded on a party-and-party basis.
[17] I have reviewed the bill of costs submitted by the
respondent and I have also considered the sums generally given
for costs when this court fixes costs on motions such as those
which have been brought on this appeal after June 1997.  I also
distinguish between proceedings brought before February of this
year and the proceedings brought after February. The proceedings
brought after February were primarily concerned with the
respondent&#146;s entitlement to costs against the two lawyers
personally.  Given my determination of those issues, I order that
Mr. Fulton is entitled to his costs of the proceedings before me
and that the respondent is entitled to his costs against the
appellant in relation to these proceedings.  Although the
appellants acknowledge their liability for costs, the proceedings
were necessary to fix those costs.  There should be no costs
ordered in the case of Mr. Wysocky.  As I understand it, Mr.
Wysocky is not presently practising law and I doubt whether he
would be entitled to any costs.  Furthermore, I think his overall
conduct disentitles him to any claim for costs.  Indeed, I did
not understand him to request costs.
[18]  I  would  fix  the costs payable by the appellants  to  the
respondent  at $9,000.00.  I would fix the costs payable  by  the
respondent  to  Mr. Fulton at $1,500.00.  I would further  direct
that  the respondent is entitled to set-off the costs payable  to
Mr.  Fulton  against those payable to him by the  appellants.   I
would make that order as the conduct of the appellants, for  whom
Mr.  Fulton  continues to act is the primary cause of  the  costs
which have been incurred in connection with this appeal.  In  the
net result, the respondent is entitled to costs payable forthwith
by the appellants in the amount of $7,500.00.</pre></td>
