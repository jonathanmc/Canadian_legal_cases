    <pre>HEARD:         November 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice C. B. Noble on
July 15, 1997 and from the sentence imposed on July 22, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The issue in this case, which involved a bank robbery,  was
identification.
[2]  Although the appellant generally matched the description of
the bank robber, the identification evidence was flawed and could
not support a conviction.  The trial judge recognized that it
would be dangerous to convict the accused on this evidence alone.
However, there was other compelling evidence that implicated the
appellant in the robbery, which included:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>The week before the robbery the appellant stated that if he
ever robbed a bank, it would be the bank in question;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>immediately following the robbery, the appellant, who was
unemployed, went on a cash spending spree far beyond his means;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>bait money was located at three different establishments
where the appellant had spent money after the robbery;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>a large sum of money was located in the appellant's bedroom;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>the total money spent by the appellant and located in his
bedroom approximates the money stolen; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>the appellant provided three different explanations for his
sudden financial windfall.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[3]   The  trial judge properly charged himself on the  issue  of
circumstantial evidence.
[4]  Although each aspect of the evidence was to some extent
imperfect, the trial judge, on the totality of the evidence,
concluded that the Crown had met the required burden of proof and
that the appellant had committed the robbery.  The appellant
called no evidence.
[5]  We see no error.  The verdict was one that a properly
instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.
[6]  The appellant has also appealed his conviction of failing to
comply with a condition of a recognizance to keep the peace and
be of good behaviour.  This issue was not addressed in the
appellant's factum or during oral argument.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
