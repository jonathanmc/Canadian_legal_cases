    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks a stay of the order of Manton J. dated
June 29, 1999 pending disposition of his appeal.  Pursuant to the
terms of The Hague Convention, Manton J. ordered that the two
children be returned to their mother at her residence in Mexico
forthwith.  One of the issues on the appeal is whether Manton J.
erred in finding that the appellant had not successfully
demonstrated that the exception under article 13(b) applied,
namely that the return of the children was not mandated because
there is a grave risk that their return would expose them to
physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them &#147;in an
intolerable situation&#148;.  The mother admits that her boyfriend
Horacio Rosas was the perpetrator of &#147;mild molestation of the
daughter Ana&#148; in paragraphs 14 to 16 of her affidavit.  The
mother also admits that she is still involved with this same
boyfriend.  The children, aged 10 and 12 years, have expressed a
desire to remain with their father.
[2]  In my view, the stay should be granted.  The appeal raises a
serious issue as to whether Manton J. gave appropriate weight to
the factors concerning the grounds for an exception under article
13(b).  In addition, the appeal raises a serious question of law
as to whether Manton J. erred by determining that the children
were wrongfully removed from Mexico given the evidence that under
Mexican law the father has the right to determine the residence
of the children.  If the stay is not granted, the appeal will be
rendered nugatory.  On the other hand, the appeal can be heard
expeditiously.  Counsel advise me that the material filed on this
motion will, in essence, be the material filed on appeal.  The
balance of convenience favours the appellant.
[3]  The respondent argued that the more stringent test of &#147;a
strong prima facie case&#148; should be applied before granting a stay
having regard to the spirit and exigency contained in the wording
of The Hague Convention.  I am of the opinion that a more
stringent test is not required in order for the nature of the
proceeding to be encompassed as a consideration.
[4]  Costs of the application reserved to the panel hearing the
appeal.
