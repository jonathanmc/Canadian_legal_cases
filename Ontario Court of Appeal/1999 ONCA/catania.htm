    <pre>On appeal from the order of Marshall J. dated June 30, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The question on this appeal is whether an Ontario court has
jurisdiction to declare void a deed executed in Ontario,
transferring title to foreign land.
[2]  By the deed, Eugenio Catania transferred property in Italy
to his two daughters, the appellants Angelina Giannattasio and
Nicolina Maiuri. The respondent, Verniere Catania, the brother of
the appellants, brought an application to declare the deed &#147;null
and void&#148; on the ground that his father was mentally incompetent
when he signed it. On a preliminary motion brought by the
appellants, Marshall J. held that an Ontario court had
jurisdiction to decide the application. The appellants appeal
from his decision.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellants and the respondent live in Ontario. They are
the only children of Eugenio Catania, who died on January 17,
1993.
[4]  By the terms of the deed, called a &#147;Deed of Gift and
Acceptance&#148;, Mr. Catania gifted a house and a parcel of land in
Salerno, Italy to the appellants. The deed, which was written in
Italian, was signed in Ontario by Mr. Catania and the appellants
on April 2, 1990. The respondent is not a party to the deed.
[5]  Earlier, in 1983, Mr. Catania had made a holograph will in
which he bequeathed the same house and parcel of land to the
appellants. The will, unlike the deed, provides for a right-of-
way over the property around the house in favour of all three
children and a right of first refusal in favour of the
respondent&#146;s son on any sale of the house.
[6]  After his father died, the respondent began proceedings in
Italy to determine the validity of his father&#146;s holograph will
and to have his father&#146;s property dealt with according to Italian
succession law. Those proceedings are still unresolved.
[7]  In March 1997, the appellants registered the deed in the
land registry office in Italy. In May 1997, the appellants asked
the respondent whether he wished to buy the house and parcel of
land. Otherwise, the appellants said that they intended to sell
both properties. The respondent replied by bringing an
application to the Ontario Court (General Division) in which he
challenged the validity of the deed, alleging that his father was
mentally incapacitated when he signed the deed and therefore did
not understand the nature of the document. Marshall J. did not
give any written reasons for deciding that an Ontario court has
jurisdiction to determine the validity of the deed.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Although in their factums both counsel addressed the
question whether the order under appeal was final or
interlocutory, neither counsel raised the point in oral argument.
We did not rule on the question and heard the appeal on the
footing that the order of Marshall J. was a final order.
[9]  I doubt whether the respondent has standing to attack the
validity of the deed. He is not a party to it and he does not
claim to be either the administrator or executor of his father&#146;s
estate. He argues, however, that he has standing because he is a
beneficiary under his father&#146;s will. Even if being a beneficiary
gives him standing to challenge the validity of the deed, he
cannot do so in an Ontario court.
[10] The deed transfers title to land in Italy. The general rule
is that Canadian courts have no jurisdiction to determine title
to or an interest in foreign land. This rule, long recognized in
Anglo-Canadian law, was applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Duke v. Andler1, in which Smith J. wrote at 738 and 741:  &#147;The
general rule that the courts of any country have no jurisdiction
to adjudicate on the right and title to lands not situate in such
country is not disputed&#133; The title to real property therefore
must be determined by the standard of the laws relating to it of
the country where it is situated&#148;.
[11] This general rule has been criticized but may be justified
by its underlying policy2. The courts of most countries insist on
the exclusive right to decide disputes over their own lands.
Thus, ordinarily a judgment by a Canadian court on a disputed
title to foreign land would be ineffective. If Canadian courts
cannot grant an effective judgment or an enforceable remedy
concerning land in a foreign country, they should decline
jurisdiction to decide these disputes. The respondent submits,
however, that the Ontario courts do have jurisdiction to decide
the validity of the deed. He argues that, although the
declaration he seeks affects title to the properties in Italy, he
is only asking for what amounts to equitable relief against two
Ontario residents.
[12] I do not accept this argument. Admittedly, as Smith J.
points out in Duke v. Andler3, a long line of authorities has
held that Canadian courts have jurisdiction to enforce rights
affecting land in foreign countries if these rights are based on
contract,</pre>
    <pre>trust or equity and the defendant resides in Canada. In
exercising this jurisdiction, Canadian courts are enforcing a
personal obligation between the parties. In other words, they are
exercising an in personam jurisdiction. This in personam
jurisdiction is an exception to the general rule that Canadian
courts have no jurisdiction to decide title to foreign land. The
exception recognizes that some claims may have both a proprietary
aspect and a contractual aspect. Canadian courts, however, will
exercise this exceptional in personam jurisdiction only if four
criteria are met. These four criteria, of which the second is
central to this appeal, are discussed by McLeod4:
          </pre>
    <pre>             In order to ensure that only effective in personam
        jurisdiction is exercised pursuant to the exception, the courts
        have insisted on four prerequisites:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)   The  court must have  in  personam
               jurisdiction  over  the  defendant.  The
               plaintiff must accordingly be able to serve
               the defendant with originating process, or
               the defendant must submit to the jurisdiction
               of the court.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)    There   must  be  some   personal
               obligation running between the  parties.
               The  jurisdiction  cannot  be  exercised
               against   strangers  to  the  obligation
               unless   they  have  become   personally
               affected by it&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                     An  equity between the parties may
               arise in various contexts. In all cases,
               however,  the relationship  between  the
               parties   must   be   such   that    the
               defendant&#146;s conscience would be affected
               if  he  insisted  on  his  strict  legal
               rights&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)    The   jurisdiction   cannot    be
               exercised  if  the  local  court  cannot
               supervise the execution of the judgment&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)    Finally,  the  court   will   not
          exercise  jurisdiction  if  the  order  would
               be  of no effect in the situs&#133;. The mere
               fact,  however, that the lex situs would
               not  recognize  the personal  obligation
               upon  which  jurisdiction is based  will
               not  be  a  bar to the granting  of  the
               order.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellants submit &#150; and I agree with them &#150; that the
respondent does not meet the second criterion. The deed created
an obligation on the father, and now his estate, to transfer the
two properties to the appellants. It does not create any
contractual or other legal obligation between the respondent and
the appellants. The respondent is a &#147;stranger&#148; to the deed and
nothing in the record suggests that he is personally affected by
his father&#146;s obligation to the appellants. Moreover, I find no
equities between the children that would affect the conscience of
the appellants if they insisted on their rights under the deed.
For these reasons, the respondent cannot invoke the exceptional
in personam jurisdiction of the Ontario courts. Any dispute over
title to the two properties, including any dispute over the
validity of the deed and its terms, should be decided by the
Italian courts.
[14] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Marshall J.
and dismiss the application with costs. The appellants are also
entitled to their costs of the appeal.</pre>
