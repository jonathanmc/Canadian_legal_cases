      <pre>On appeal from the convictions by Hoilett J. with a jury dated
February 13, 1997 and sentences dated June 24, 1997</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  On February 13, 1997, the appellants were convicted of
trafficking in about 4 kilograms of hashish by the verdict of a
jury at a trial presided over by the Honourable Mr. Justice
Hoilett.  On June 24, 1997, both appellants were sentenced to
imprisonment for 15 months.  They appeal their convictions and
their sentences.</pre>
      <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
      <pre>[2]  The appellants’ drug trafficking activities were revealed as
a result of a police undercover investigation during which a
suspected drug trafficker was subject to police surveillance.
[3]  In the end, the extensive police surveillance evidence
showed that the appellants were in possession of a bag which they
delivered to the target of the police investigation and his
associate.  That bag, seized by the police a short time later,
contained almost 9 pounds of hashish.
[4]  The appellants denied being involved in the trafficking of
hashish.  They claimed that they met with the target of the
police investigation to complete a transaction involving the sale
of low grade emeralds, not hashish.  The credibility of the
appellants’ explanation for their conduct, much of which was
observed at short range by undercover police surveillance
officers, was the critical factual issue before the jury.
[5]  The appellants sensibly filed a joint factum, although they
were separately represented, raising four grounds of appeal
against their convictions.  They are:
     </pre>
      <pre>1.        the trial judge erred in his charge on party liability
by directing the jury on s. 21(2), and not on s. 21(1) of the
Criminal Code;
2.        Crown counsel’s jury address was improper in that Crown
counsel submitted that the appellants, having reviewed the police
will-say statements given to them as part of the Crown’s
disclosure documentation, manipulated their evidence so that it
would conform with the evidence of police surveillance officers;
3.        the trial judge failed to adequately outline the
position of the defence in his charge to the jury; and
4.        the verdicts are unreasonable.</pre>
      <pre>[6]  We called upon Crown Counsel to respond only to the first
two grounds of appeal.  We do not think that it is necessary to
address those grounds of appeal on which we did not call upon
Crown Counsel, beyond noting that, in our view, that part of the
charge dealing with the position of the defence was adequate.  In
addition, there was ample evidence to support the verdicts.  We
see no merit in the submission that either verdict was
unreasonable.
[7]  We see no need to review the extensive surveillance evidence
in detail.  A summary of it will suffice.</pre>
      <pre>THE EVIDENCE</pre>
      <pre>[8]  In August 1993, the police were investigating one George
Yurkiv who was suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.
On August 19 and 20, 1993, Yurkiv was the subject of an extensive
police surveillance operation.  The surveillance revealed that at
about 9:34 p.m. on August 19, 1993, Yurkiv and his apparent
associate, Marchese, attended at Ashbridges Bay Park in the
Beaches area of Toronto.  Throughout the period of surveillance
Yurkiv and Marchese used a blue Toyota Tercel for transportation
purposes.  As Yurkiv and Marchese waited outside a restaurant
known as the Boardwalk Café, the appellants arrived in the
appellant Cavan’s Corvette.  They parked two parking spaces away
from Yurkiv’s Tercel and then began to talk with Yurkiv and
Marchese.  While the four were talking a male person who arrived
in a grey Buick walked over to the Tercel and placed a brown bag
under the driver’s seat.  Shortly after that occurred, the
appellants and Yurkiv and Marchese got into their respective cars
and departed.
[9]  At about 2:35 p.m. on August 20, 1993, Yurkiv and Marchese
were again seen at Ashbridges Bay Park where the appellants were
waiting for them.  All four entered the Boardwalk Café.  After
about 10 minutes Marchese and the appellant Cavan left the
restaurant and went to Cavan’s Corvette and Yurkiv’s Tercel which
were parked side-by-side.  Cavan entered the Corvette and rolled
down the passenger window.  Marchese retrieved a dark travel bag
from the Tercel and put it onto the passenger seat of the
Corvette.  At that point Cavan drove off and Marchese returned to
the restaurant.
[10] Cavan drove to a Canadian Tire store located in the east end
of Toronto and walked around the parking lot a few times,  He
then returned to his Corvette and backed up beside the grey Buick
that the police had seen the night before. After a short time,
the driver of Buick walked past the passenger side of the
Corvette, and the appellant Cavan handed him a brown package
which the driver of the Buick put into the Buick’s trunk. Cavan
then drove off.  Surveillance continued on the Buick.
[11] The police followed the Buick to Shopper’s World plaza in
Toronto, where they saw Cavan’s Corvette parked in the parking
lot.  The Buick drove out of the plaza lot without stopping and
the police lost it in traffic.  When the police surveillance
officers lost the Buick in traffic, they returned to the plaza
and found Cavan’s Corvette was still there.  Within a short time
they saw Cavan return to his Corvette and place a small plastic
bag in his car.  He then walked around the parking lot and
appeared to use a pay phone.  The police kept him under
surveillance until about 5:25 p.m.  He was not subject to police
surveillance between 5:25 p.m. and 6:33 p.m. on August 20th.
[12] At 6:15 p.m. the surveillance officers at Ashbridges Bay saw
the Buick arrive there.  The driver of the Buick parked it two
spaces from Yurkiv’s Tercel. At 6:33 p.m. Cavan’s Corvette
returned to Ashbridges Bay.  Within a short time, the Corvette,
followed by the Buick, left the parking lot and proceeded to the
marina parking lot.  At the marina parking lot the driver of the
Buick got out and pulled out a small package and a bag that
appeared to be empty and dropped both items into the passenger
side of Cavan’s Corvette.  He walked back to the Buick after a
brief conversation with the driver of the Corvette.  The Corvette
and the Buick then left the parking lot.  The bag that was left
in Cavan’s Corvette was consistent in its appearance with the bag
containing 4 kilograms of hashish which the police later seized.
[13] At 6:50 p.m., Cavan drove his Corvette into the Boardwalk
Café parking lot and parked beside a police surveillance van. The
Corvette was about 3½ feet from the van.  Constable Yano, who was
in the van, observed Cavan get out the Corvette, lock it and
enter the restaurant. Constable Yano observed a dark coloured
travel bag on the passenger seat of the Corvette.  He said that
the bag containing the hashish seized from Yurkiv’s car later
that evening looked like the bag that he saw on the passenger
seat of the appellant’s Corvette.
[14] In about five minutes Cavan came out of the restaurant with
Scott.  Cavan entered the driver’s side and Scott entered the
passenger side of the Corvette.  Cavan unzipped the bag and
removed what Constable Yano said appeared to be a typical one-
half kilo block of hashish wrapped in red cellophane.  He handed
the block to Scott who looked at it, and then returned it to
Cavan who put it back in the bag.  About two minutes later Cavan
and Scott got out of the car and headed back toward the Boardwalk
Café.  They met Yurkiv and Marchese who were on their way out of
the restaurant. Cavan gave the travel bag to Marchese who looked
into it and showed it to Yurkiv.  The four then shook hands, got
into their vehicles and left.
[15] At about 9:10 p.m. that night Constable Magnus removed the
bag to which we have referred from the trunk of Yurkiv’s Tercel.
It contained eight one-half kilo bricks of hashish, each wrapped
in red cellophane and enclosed in a zip-locked bag.  At 9:40 p.m.
Yurkiv, Marchese and a third man came out of the restaurant.
Yurkiv looked in the trunk and appeared to be angry.
[16] Both appellants testified in their own defence.  They denied
any involvement with hashish.  Both testified about the purpose
of their meetings with Yurkiv and Marchese on August 19 and 20,
1993.  In their evidence, they gave two explanations for meeting
with Yurkiv and Marchese on August 19 and 20, 1993.  First, they
testified that Scott had some connections in the mortgage
business and that Marchese was seeking a mortgage.  No mortgage
was ever arranged because Marchese could not establish an
acceptable income level.  Second, both appellants testified that
as a sideline they acted as middlemen for the sale of low-grade
emeralds.  They had been involved in a number of deals in which
they sold Yurkiv’s emeralds to a third party purchaser.  They
explained that they thought at material times that the bag
containing hashish, in fact contained emeralds.
[17] In his evidence, Cavan explained a number of aspects of the
surveillance evidence in this way:
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    nothing happened on August 19, 1993 because Yurkiv arrived
          without any emeralds and Marchese arrived without any mortgage
          documents;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    the man in the grey Buick was a courier sent by a man who
          was supposed to be the ultimate purchaser of the emeralds;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    the bag that the police saw Marchese placing in Cavan’s
          Corvette on August 20, 1993 was a bag containing gems;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    Cavan went to the Canadian Tire Store as a halfway point to
          meet the courier, the driver of the Buick, because he had some
          other errands in that area of Toronto;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    Cavan later received a message from the supposed purchaser
          of the gems saying that he was sending back the gems because they
          were too small to be of any value to him; and
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    when Cavan and Scott returned to Cavan’s Corvette outside
          the Boardwalk Café, while the police observed the events from a
          distance of about three and a half feet, Cavan showed Scott the
          emeralds to demonstrate how small they were.  He then returned
          the bag of emeralds to Marchese outside the Boardwalk Café.</pre>
      <pre>[18] Scott’s evidence supported Cavan’s with respect to the two
purposes for their meetings with Yurkiv and Marchese.</pre>
      <pre>The references to the disclosure materials provided by the Crown</pre>
      <pre>[19] The appellants take particular issue with the Crown’s
closing address in which Crown counsel suggested that the
appellants had tailored their evidence to “jibe” with the
disclosure materials (the police will-say statements) provided by
the Crown before the trial.  This ground of appeal requires
consideration of Cavan’s cross-examination, Crown counsel’s jury
address and the trial judge’s charge as related to the
appellants’ access to the Crown disclosure materials,
particularly the police will-say statements.  The police “will-
says” set out the details of the observations of the police in
the course of their surveillance activities on August 19 and 20,
1993.</pre>
      <pre>The cross-examination of the appellant Cavan</pre>
      <pre>[20] The appellants both acknowledged being in contact with
Yurkiv and Marchese on August 19 and 20, 1993.  As we have said,
the crux of their evidence was that their dealings with Yurkiv
and Marchese concerned emeralds, not drugs.  They said that once
they learned that Yurkiv and Marchese were involved in drug
trafficking they had no further dealings with them.  In the
circumstances, the appellants’ credibility, that is whether their
explanation for their conduct as observed by the police was true,
or when considered with all of the evidence raised a reasonable
doubt, was the central issue at trial.
[21] In Cavan’s cross-examination, Crown counsel contrasted
Cavan’s ability to recall the events of August 19 and 20, 1993
which were the subject of police surveillance with  his inability
to recall later events and what happened on August 20th,  when he
was not under police surveillance.  For example, in cross-
examination Crown counsel asked Cavan whether he had testified on
Marchese’s behalf at Marchese’s trial in 1995.  Cavan testified
that he could not recall whether he had, or had not, testified at
that trial.  Cavan was also cross-examined on his inability to
recall what happened on August 20th when he was not under police
surveillance.  In explaining how his recollection of some events
was detailed, Cavan referred to the police “will-say” statements:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Approximately when, though, because you do have a fairly
          good memory of each event as it transpired?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  When we found out George had
          emeralds with him I had phoned Larry just
          shortly after that to have his courier come
          down and pickup the emeralds.  He says to me
          at that point that he can’t go direct to
          Ashbridges Bay, I’ll have to meet him
          probably somewhere else, and I said where is
          he going, and he said Canadian Tire, and I
          said that’s pretty good because it’s half way
          between the Boardwalk Café and where I have
          to go which is Victoria Park and Danforth,
          which is indicated in the police transcripts
          that it’s Shoppers World.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Police transcripts? What do you
          mean?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Not transcripts, sorry, the police
          information, the will says of the police.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Well, did you read those?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  I don’t know, but we heard them on
          the stand.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  No you heard testimony, so that’s a
          very specific phrase – “will say”.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Oh, testimony, I am sorry, then.  I
          am not familiar with the court terminology,
          so it does get confused at times, but from
          what the police stated.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  But just go back to that for a
          second, that’s a fairly specific phrase
          that’s used by people who know the police
          force.  It’s a short form.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  I am not a police officer for sure.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  I am curious as to how you used that
          phrase.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  It was in the details that the
          lawyers provide for us.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  So you read the “will says” of the
          police officers?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Some of them, not all.  A few of
          them.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  That’s not what you said the first
          time, and in my understanding you said “no”.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  I may have misunderstood your
          question, I am sorry.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Because you said testimony, so you
          did read what the police officers were
          saying.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  A couple of their notes I read, but
          I didn’t get to see all the notes.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Just a couple?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  And when was that, sir?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  When was that.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  When did you read the “will says”?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Oh, since we’ve been arrested, I
          guess.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Over the three year period?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Did you have them in your
          possession?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Do I?
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Did you have these “will says” in
          your possession?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Momentarily.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[22] Later in his cross-examination, Crown counsel asked Cavan
what he did on August 20, 1993 during the one and one-half hour
period during which he was not under police surveillance.  Cavan
said that he could not recall.  In this part of his cross-
examination Cavan again referred to the police “will-says”:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.  Where did you go?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Well, number 1, I was stopped by the
          police for a few minutes, but an hour and a
          half, I couldn’t account for my time.  I
          don’t remember everything that happened that
          day.  I am trying to remember to the best of
          my ability what happened that day.  It’s a
          long time.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q. Well, you have remembered the places
          you stopped, the people that you actually
          called, with almost minute detail.
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.  Granted, some of the things that I
          do remember to refresh my memory is some of
          the police notations that have been made so I
          do recall that.  Maybe they can explain where
          I’ve been for an hour and a half.  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
      <pre>[23] It is apparent from Cavan’s testimony that he, not Crown
counsel, first referred to the fact that he had been given access
to police “will say” statements.  He did so to buttress his
explanation for having a detailed recall of certain events.
Later in his cross-examination he referred to the disclosure
statements implicitly to explain why his memory of certain events
was somewhat obscure.</pre>
      <pre>The Crown’s jury address</pre>
      <pre>[24] Unfortunately, the transcript of the Crown’s jury address is
not available.  Counsel accepted Crown counsel’s notes of his
closing submissions for purposes of the appeal.  In those notes
the following reference to the appellant Cavan’s possession of
the police “will say” statements appears:
          </pre>
      <pre>               They [the events of August 19 and 20, 1993] are so clear
          that Cavan and Scott realize that they cannot deny many of the
          events of the day.  The photographs put them at Ashbridges Bay
          Park together with Yurkiv and Marchese.  The police surveillance
          tracks their steps for hours at a time without significant
          interruption.  They could not deny what I suggest to you are
          unusual behaviour and acts, so instead they came up with an
          answer for every single curious act.  And you will recall, Mr.
          Cavan told you that they even had occasional possession of police
          notes over those three years.  Now the fact that they reviewed
          the notes is not improper in any way, however, I submit to you
          that the reference to those notes was important because Mr. Cavan
          had to make certain that his intricate and detailed story jibed
          with the observations of the police. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[25] As is apparent from the above, Crown counsel made it plain
in his jury address that there was nothing improper about the
fact that the appellants reviewed the police notes, that is the
disclosure material.  The point Crown counsel sought to emphasize
was that the appellant’s actions on August 20, 1993 were observed
by the police and documented.  Thus, the Crown submitted that the
appellants had to ensure that their stories “jibed” with the
observations of the police.</pre>
      <pre>The Charge</pre>
      <pre>[26] In his charge to the jury the trial judge summarized the
Crown and defence positions.  When he dealt with the Crown’s
position he said:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The Crown submits that the accused, with the benefit of the
          police surveillance evidence, were unable to deny the police
          observations or the surveillance that they conducted, but armed
          with the benefit of that, came up with a carefully crafted
          explanation for all their conduct or activities. … Members of the
          jury, the Crown submits that Mr. Cavan’s pretended recall of
          details is suspect and contrived, as well as being conveniently
          forgetful in certain respects on issues that might tend to
          incriminate him.  He says especially significant is the inability
          of the accused, Cavan, to recall anything or any of the events of
          an hour and a half, and those hours are roughly from just after
          five o’clock on the afternoon of the 20th of August to 6:39, or
          thereabouts, that period of time when he was not under
          surveillance by the police.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[27] When he dealt with the defence position, the trial judge
stated that the appellants had proffered innocent explanations
for all of the allegedly sinister activities upon which the Crown
relied.  He reminded the jury that the defence asked the jury to
accept those explanations as being true, or at least to view them
as explanations which raised a reasonable doubt, in light of all
of the evidence.</pre>
      <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
      <pre>1.  Crown counsel’s references to disclosure materials</pre>
      <pre>[28] The appellants attack the various references to the
disclosure documentation from a variety of angles.  They submit
that, in his jury address, Crown counsel should not have referred
to the fact that the appellants possessed “will say” statements
and that the trial judge erred in not making it plain to the jury
that there was nothing untoward about the fact that the
appellants had and had read, at least in part, some disclosure
documents, including the police “will say” statements.
[29] The appellants submit that one of the dangers of suggesting
that an accused’s evidence has been concocted (as the Crown did
here, in part by reference to the appellant’s uneven ability to
recall as referred to above) is that the jury may turn disbelief
of an accused’s evidence into a piece of circumstantial evidence
pointing to guilt.  See R. v. Coutts (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545
(Ont. C.A.).  The appellants also contend that where the Crown
alleges that the accused’s evidence has been recently fabricated,
(for example when the Crown suggests that the accused’s testimony
has been tailored to accommodate Crown disclosure material)
jurors may ask themselves why the appellants did not tell their
version of events to the police immediately upon their arrest.
This tempting approach, the appellants argue, would seriously
compromise their right to remain silent.  See Commonwealth v.
Jones (July 29, 1998, Mass. C.A.).
[30] The appellants rely on this court’s decision in R. v. Peavoy
(1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 in support of their submission that
the Crown’s reference to the appellants having access to the
Crown’s case through pre-trial disclosure was improper and
prejudicial to them.
[31] In Peavoy, the appellant was charged with second-degree
murder.  He admitted to having stabbed the victim, but claimed he
did so in self-defence.  During his jury address, Crown counsel
made numerous statements to which the appellant objected.  These
statements included references to the appellant’s access to Crown
disclosure material.  On that issue Crown counsel said:
          </pre>
      <pre>               So defence has full knowledge of everything that they are
          going to hear from the Crown.  There are no surprises, there can
          be no surprises to the defence.  In addition, and because of
          that, Mr. Peavoy knows that there is nobody in these proceedings
          that can contradict him on the very central issue of what took
          place in that apartment.</pre>
      <pre>[32] Weiler J.A. characterized these statements as “improper and
unfair.”  She said, at p. 234:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The comments of the Crown were part of a theory which, in a
          general way, suggested that the appellant had concocted his
          evidence after he had received the prosecution’s disclosure.  The
          Crown led no evidence during the trial to substantiate this
          suggestion that, after receiving disclosure, the appellant had
          tailored his evidence to conform to the disclosure.  In addition
          to be unfounded on the evidence, the Crown’s comments were
          improper in that they suggested that there was something suspect
          about the appellant’s evidence because the defence position had
          not been revealed in the intervening months prior to trial.
          </pre>
      <pre>               In my view, Crown counsel’s submissions
          were improper and unfair in that the Crown’s
          concoction theory was raised for the first
          time in his closing address.  The appellant
          had no opportunity to respond to the Crown’s
          improper suggestion that he had tailored his
          evidence after receiving disclosure and the
          Crown’s editorial comments as to when the
          defence of self-defence was put forward.
          Moreover, the comments made a trap of the
          appellant's constitutional right to
          disclosure and suggested that his evidence
          was inherently suspect because the defence
          position was disclosed only in the course of
          the appellant’s testimony.</pre>
      <pre>[33] Weiler J.A. concluded that Crown counsel’s comments, and
several misleading statements made by Crown counsel in his jury
address, were sufficiently prejudicial as to require the trial
judge to make reference to them in the charge so that the
position of the defence was fairly put to the jury.
[34] The prejudice arising from Crown counsel’s comments in
Peavoy was the result of several related factors:
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    there was no evidence that the appellant had access to the
          Crown’s disclosure material.  Thus, there was no evidentiary
          foundation for the Crown’s references in his jury address to the
          appellants’ possession of the disclosure material;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    since the issues of the appellant’s access to the Crown’s
          disclosure material and his opportunity to tailor his evidence
          were not raised in cross-examination, the appellant had no
          opportunity to respond to the position that Crown counsel
          asserted for the first time in his jury address;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    Crown counsel made repeated references to the fact that the
          appellant possessed and reviewed the disclosure material;
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    in his jury address Crown counsel implied that there was
          something suspect or sinister in the appellant having possession
          of and reviewing the disclosure material that the Crown was
          required to make available to him;  and
     </pre>
      <pre>     ·    Crown counsel further implied that the appellant had somehow
          acted improperly in failing to disclose the details of his
          defence to the Crown before the trial.1</pre>
      <pre>[35] Peavoy was considered by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Kahn, [1998] B.C.J. 1450 (B.C.C.A.).  In that
case, the accused was charged with murder.  He testified in his
examination-in-chief about his whereabouts at the time of the
killing.  In short, he stated that he was not there when the
deceased, his daughter-in-law, was killed. He was cross-examined
extensively about that part of his evidence.  In his jury
address, Crown counsel submitted that the accused’s evidence was
self-serving, non-responsive and that his evidence should not be
accepted.  Crown counsel then went on to refer to the appellant’s
possession of Crown disclosure documents:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Now, every accused person is entitled to full disclosure of
          the particulars of the case against him by the Crown.  And I am
          certainly not criticizing, that’s the way our system has to work,
          for every accused to fairly defend himself.  But what that does
          allow is an unscrupulous accused to take what he knows you are
          going to hear and then weave into that  fabric a series of lies
          to try and make up a story that holds some water before you.
          It’s much, much easier to do that than to try and make up a story
          from scratch.</pre>
      <pre>[36] In Kahn, the appellant relied on Peavoy in support of his
submission that Crown counsel at his trial acted improperly in
raising the issue of the appellant’s access to the disclosure
material as he did.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant’s appeal.  The court concluded that since
the appellant raised an alibi defence it was open to the Crown to
rely on the appellant’s failure to disclose the particulars of
that defence before he gave evidence and that the Crown’s
“relatively fleeting and factual reference to the disclosure
material could not have jeopardized the appellant’s right to a
fair trial.”
[37] Problems attendant upon reference to the accused’s access to
pre-trial disclosure materials were further examined by this
court in R. v. White (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 373.  In White, the
issue was whether Crown counsel’s cross-examination of the
appellant was improper in six identified respects, one of which
was the suggestion, said to be implicit in Crown counsel’s cross-
examination of the appellant, that the appellant’s evidence
should be discounted because he had received full disclosure of
the Crown’s case before trial.  This issue was a product of
Crown’s counsel’s cross-examination of the appellant during which
the appellant admitted that before the trial began he had seen
“every witness’s statement.”  He also acknowledged that he had
seen and heard all but three Crown witnesses give evidence at the
preliminary inquiry.  In response to defence counsel’s objection
the trial judge told the jury that the Crown was required by law
to provide the appellant with pre-trial disclosure and that it do
so in the form of the disclosure “book” that Crown counsel showed
the appellant during his cross-examination.  The trial judge also
told the jury that the Crown makes disclosure to the accused “…
in every trial in Ontario that is criminal … .”
[38] Crown counsel then moved to another area of cross-
examination of the appellant.  He asked the appellant if the then
ongoing cross-examination represented the first occasion on which
the appellant had been cross-examined.  When defence counsel
again objected, the trial judge instructed the jury that the
appellant had the right to remain silent and that the jury should
not draw an adverse inference from the fact that the appellant
first gave evidence and was cross-examined at his trial.
[39] Doherty J.A. viewed as improper the suggestion that the
appellant’s evidence was somehow suspect because he had received
full disclosure of the Crown’s case.  He said at p. 382:
          </pre>
      <pre>               As a matter of common sense, there may be considerable force
          to the suggestion that a person who gets full advance notice of
          the other side’s evidence and testifies last is in a position to
          tailor his or her evidence to fit the disclosure.  The inference,
          no matter how logical, cannot be drawn without turning
          fundamental constitutional rights into a trap for accused
          persons.  Where any such suggestion seeps into the cross-
          examination of an accused, it must be eradicated by the trial
          judge.  [Footnote omitted.]</pre>
      <pre>[40] However, Doherty J.A. rejected the notion that any reference
to disclosure material in the cross-examination of an accused
would be improper.  He said, at pp. 382-383:
          </pre>
      <pre>               I do not intend to suggest that every line of cross-
          examination involving reference to disclosure is improper.
          Sometimes, it will be necessary for the Crown to establish that
          an accused received disclosure as a step in a legitimate line of
          cross-examination.  For example, the appellant had referred to
          telephone calls between himself and the complainant in the course
          of his examination-in-chief.  He had used those phone calls to
          assist him in placing the times and dates of certain meetings
          with the complainant.  In cross-examination, Crown counsel
          brought out the fact that the appellant had full access to those
          records before he testified.  This was proper cross-examination
          intended to show that the appellant was aware of the contents of
          the phone records before giving his evidence and that any
          suggestion that the records confirmed his testimony should be
          considered in that light.
          </pre>
      <pre>               While questions concerning disclosure
          are appropriate in some situations, they are
          always potentially dangerous.  I think the
          prudent course whenever Crown counsel wish to
          cross-examine on matters relating to
          disclosure is to vet the proposed line of
          questioning with the trial judge in the
          absence of the jury. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[41] When Peavoy and White are read together, it is apparent that
the issue whether a particular cross-examination or reference in
submissions by Crown counsel to the accused having reviewed the
Crown’s disclosure material is improper must be considered on a
case by case basis, having regard to the concerns expressed by
Weiler J.A. in Peavoy and Doherty J.A.’s observations in White
that there will be occasions where the cross-examination of an
accused on his access to Crown disclosure documents is not
improper.
[42] As we have noted, the credibility of the appellants’
explanation for their actions on August 19 and 20, 1993 was the
central factual issue in this case. During his cross-examination
Cavan, not Crown counsel, referred to the “police transcripts”
and to the “will says of the police.” In these circumstances, it
was, in our view, open to the Crown to cross-examine the
appellant about how much of the police surveillance information
he had reviewed before he testified.  Crown counsel’s reference
in Cavan’s cross-examination to the appellants’ access to
disclosure materials did not constitute a “trap” as referred to
by Doherty J.A. in White.
[43] In his cross-examination, Cavan acknowledged that his recall
of events of August 20, 1993 was aided by the “police notations.”
Moreover, Cavan agreed that his recall of the events in August
1993 was better than his recall of some more recent events, such
as whether he did, or did not, testify at Marchese’s trial in
1995.  Crown counsel’s cross-examination, including his limited
reference to the disclosure documents, represented a reasonable
line of cross-examination going to the issue of Cavan’s
credibility.
[44] Crown counsel’s oblique attempt to contrast Cavan’s ability
to recall his activities on August 19 and 20, 1993 in detail when
he had the police “notes” to help him with his inability to
recall what he did on August 20th, and even two years later in
1995, when he did not have the police notes to help him was, in
our view, appropriate.
[45] By way of summary, we think that this case differs to a
substantial degree from Peavoy.  Here, as we have said, Cavan,
not Crown counsel, first referred to the fact that he had seen
some of the police will-say statements.  He did so, in part, to
explain how he recalled the events of August 19th and 20th in
such detail, and later to explain why he could not recall what he
did during the approximately one and one-half hour period on
August 20th when he and Scott were not subject to police
surveillance and the documentation of their activities.  In our
opinion, Crown counsel did not act improperly in cross-examining
Cavan as he did about his review of the police will-say
statements once Cavan raised the issue.
[46] Nor do we think that the single reference in the Crown’s
jury address to the appellants’ possession of the “police notes”
was improper.  The Crown was entitled to submit that the
appellants’ explanation for their actions on August 19 and 20,
1993 should not be believed and that since the appellants’
activities were observed at close range and documented, they
could not deny what the Crown not unreasonably submitted was
their “unusual behaviour and acts.”  The Crown was entitled to
pursue its attack on the appellants’ credibility by submitting
that, in the circumstances, the appellants’ testimony had to both
jibe with, and respond to, the police surveillance evidence and
that (as Cavan admitted), the appellants used the police will-say
statements in that regard.  In addition, in his jury address
Crown counsel made it clear that “the fact that they [the
appellants] reviewed the notes is not improper in any way.”
[47] It would have been better had the trial judge told the jury
that there was nothing unusual or improper about the appellants
having and reading Crown disclosure documents.  However, we do
not think that the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on
this issue gives rise to a miscarriage of justice, since
reference to this issue was brief and Crown counsel made it clear
in his jury address that the fact that the appellants had
reviewed the disclosure material was not improper.  To the
limited extent that the appellants’ access to the Crown
disclosure documents was part of the Crown’s position at trial,
we think that the trial judge set out that position fairly and
adequately in his charge.
[48] Although it is not determinative, we think it is significant
that the appellants’ counsel at trial did not object to the
reference to Cavan’s access to the police “will-says” when Cavan
was cross-examined, when the Crown referred to the appellant’s
access to the disclosure documents in his jury address, or in the
course of objections to the trial judge’s charge to the jury.
[49] For these reasons, we would not give effect to this ground
of appeal.</pre>
      <pre>2.  Charge to jury on party liability</pre>
      <pre>[50] The other ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in
the portion of his charge dealing with party liability.  The
legal basis for this ground of appeal is set out in the two
Notices of Appeal in identical language:</pre>
      <pre>     a)   That the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury on the
     issue of party liability misled the jury.  In particular, the
     learned trial judge erred in putting section 21(2) of the
     Criminal Code to the jury, since the unlawful purpose under
     section 21(2) was the same as the offence charged.  In putting
     section 21(2) to the jury, the learned trial judge erred in
     extending the accused's liability to an unlawful purpose beyond
     the offence charged and in introducing a lesser degree of mens
     rea which was inapplicable to this case.</pre>
      <pre>[51] Although this ground of appeal is advanced by both
appellants, at a factual level the only practical beneficiary is
the appellant Scott.  Trial counsel for Scott was obviously
concerned that the jury might find Scott guilty merely as a
result of his association with Cavan.  Therefore she requested
that the trial judge explain to the jury the theory of party
liability.
[52] The trial judge did include a party liability component in
his jury charge.  Unfortunately, he erroneously charged the jury
on the common intention provisions of s. 21(2) of the Criminal
Code.
[53] The appellants contend that the trial judge’s error was
fatal.  With respect, we disagree.  In our view, this is a clear
case for the application of the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of
the Code.  While the trial judge should not have instructed the
jury regarding s. 21(2) of the Code, because the unlawful purpose
in question (to commit the offence of trafficking) was in
relation to the very offence with which the accused were charged
(trafficking), this instruction did not affect the result.  There
was a great deal of evidence before the jury upon which it could
find that both accused participated in the commission of the
crime of trafficking and that they formed a common intention to
do so.
[54] Moreover, the absence of a correct charge grounded in s.
21(1)(b) of the Code was, in our view, overcome by the contents
of the trial judge’s charge based on s. 21(2).  He told the jury:
          </pre>
      <pre>               You will recall the evidence indicates that Mr. Cavan had
          the bag in his lap, opened it up, took out a package, which some
          evidence indicates was hashish, or appeared to be hashish.  He
          gave it to Mr. Scott, Mr. Scott flipped it over, looked at it,
          there was a brief comment, nobody hears what was said, and it was
          returned to Mr. Cavan.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Now, if that were the sole evidence that
          connected Mr. Scott to all that took place
          where the drugs were concerned, it would, in
          my view, be dangerous to convict Mr. Scott of
          the offence with which he is charged.  I am
          not suggesting what view you should take of
          the evidence.  I am simply saying that if
          that were the only evidence that connected
          him with the offence, I think it would be
          dangerous in law to convict Mr. Scott of the
          offence.
          </pre>
      <pre>               What you have to do, members of the
          jury, is to consider all the evidence; what
          took place in the cafe, what took place on
          the evening before, which is the l9th of
          August, what took place when the parties
          appeared to have consummated either a deal,
          or had come to the end of a frustrated deal,
          again depending on what view you take of the
          evidence, when they all met in front of the
          cafe, shook hands and went their separate
          ways.
          </pre>
      <pre>               You have to take all that evidence into
          consideration, and if it is your view that
          Mr. Scott and Mr. Cavan were acting based on
          a common objective, then that may tend to
          give a different character to what took place
          in the car.  That is wholly for you to
          determine, as I have said, but in isolation,
          again I say it would be dangerous to convict
          Mr. Scott of the offence if that's the only
          thing that can give the character of the
          trafficking or being involved in trafficking,
          if, indeed, that is what it is.  It would
          have to be based on all the other
          circumstances, depending, as I have said,
          what interpretation you put on those
          circumstances, and what interpretation you
          place on all these events is wholly your
          judgment, and it is not one on which I intend
          to make any comments.</pre>
      <pre>[55] It is clear from this passage that the trial judge directed
the jury to consider the conduct of the two accused in relation
to the crime of trafficking.  He specifically warned the jury, in
clear language, about the danger of convicting Scott on the basis
of his association with Cavan.
[56] Finally, we note that the judge informed trial counsel
before his charge that he would include a s. 21(2) component in
his charge. Trial counsel made no objection to this statement by
the judge; nor did she object to this portion of the charge after
it was delivered.
[57] For these reasons, although we agree with the appellants
that the trial judge chose the wrong provision for the component
of his charge relating to party liability, we are satisfied that
this error did not affect the result of the trial.
     </pre>
      <pre>3.   Sentence appeal</pre>
      <pre>[58] The appellants were sentenced to a period of 15 months.
Each appellant was married, had three children, and was active in
the community. Cavan was 50 at the time of sentencing and had no
criminal record.  Scott was 48, and although he had a conviction
in 1989 for attempted fraud, the trial judge indicated that he
would treat Scott as having no criminal record.
[59] The appellants challenge the sentence imposed by the trial
judge on four bases – first, that he erred in principle by
failing to provide reasons for not imposing a conditional
sentence; second, that there is an improper disparity between the
sentences imposed on Cavan and Scott and the sentence imposed on
Yurkiv who was involved in the same drug operation; third, that
the trial judge erred by treating the absence of remorse as an
aggravating factor; and fourth, that a conditional sentence is a
reasonable sentence in all of the circumstances of this case.
[60] In our view, there is no merit in any of these submissions.
The trial judge was alive to the leading decisions of this court
respecting conditional sentences. He stated clearly that the
quantity and value of the drug established that the accused were
“engaged in an operation well above street level”.  The shorter
sentence imposed by another judge on Yurkiv reflected, in part,
such factors as his early guilty plea and his health.  The trial
judge’s comment about “no indication of remorse on the part of
either accused” was not labelled by him as an aggravating factor;
rather it is consistent with a view that there was no expression
of remorse which might have been a mitigating factor on
sentencing.  Finally, in light of the factual findings by the
judge about the quantity and value of drugs involved, and his
conclusion that the offence was “a purely commercial venture”, we
agree with the trial judge that this was not an appropriate case
for the imposition of a conditional sentence.
[61] In conclusion, although we would grant leave to appeal
sentence, we see no reason to interfere with the sentences
imposed by the trial judge.</pre>
      <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
      <pre>[62] The appeal from the two convictions is dismissed.  Leave to
appeal the sentences is granted; the appeal from the sentences is
dismissed.
