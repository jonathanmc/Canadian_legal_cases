    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks to raise the defence of extreme
intoxication to the general intent offence of sexual assault for
the first time on this appeal. The appellant&#146;s trial was
completed shortly before the Supreme Court of Canada delivered
its decision in R. v. Daviault (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 21 in which
it recognized the defence the appellant now seeks to assert.
[2]  There is a general rule that bars appellants from raising
issues for the first time on appeal. The appellant relies on an
exception to this rule that provides that an appellant may raise
a change in the law that has occurred between the time of trial
and the hearing of the appeal if that change is a fundamental
restatement of law that overrules established authority.
[3]  In R. v. R. (R.) (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.),
Doherty J.A. expressed the principle at p. 203:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...not every development in the law will permit counsel to
          raise a new issue on appeal. Our law, particularly its common law
          component, is in constant metamorphosis. One must distinguish
          between incremental developments in the law which occur on an
          ongoing basis, usually at the initiative of counsel, as legal
          principles are applied to particular fact situations, and
          fundamental restatements of the law which overrule established
          authority and send the law in a new direction. Only the latter
          gives cause to make an exception to the general principle that
          new issues cannot be raised on appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  In R. v. Brown (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 129, the majority of
the Supreme Court of Canada approved the statement of this same
principle by Harradence J.A. in the Alberta Court of Appeal
reported at (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 481. In Brown, after the
appellant had been convicted at trial, the Supreme Court of
Canada delivered its decision in R. v. Hebert (1990), 57 C.C.C.
(3d) 1, in which it held that statements obtained by an
undercover police officer from an accused who is a detainee were
not admissible because of the resulting contravention of s. 7 of
the Charter. Harradence J.A. held that at the time of the trial,
the appellant&#146;s counsel could not reasonably have been expected
to foresee the Supreme Court&#146;s decision in Hebert. He described
Hebert as a dramatic shift in the law surrounding statements to
undercover cellmates and as a result he was of the view that the
appellant who was still &#147;in the system&#148; should be entitled to
rely upon Hebert as a ground of appeal. In the course of his
reasons he said, at p. 491:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Having said that, it is well established that where the law
          recognizes a defence at the time of appeal which it did not
          recognize at the time of trial, an accused is to have the benefit
          of the later law. The one qualification to this is that the
          accused must still be &#147;in the system&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  The same principle has been applied in other cases in which
the Supreme Court of Canada has overruled an earlier decision
between the time of trial and appeal. See Wigman v. The Queen
(1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) and the decision of this court
in R. v. Orrico, delivered November 8, 1991, [1991] o.j. 1971.
[6]  The line between a fundamental restatement of the law on the
one hand and an incremental development in the law on the other
may not always be clear. In drawing that line, it is helpful to
note that the exception to the general rule strikes a balance
between fairness to an accused who could not have been expected
to raise the changed law at the time of trial and the importance
of parties putting their best foot forward at trial and not
raising new and different defences or arguments on appeal.
[7]  With these principles in mind, we turn to the situation in
this appeal. In Daviault the Supreme Court held that the common-
law rule, developed before the enactment of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms, and enunciated in Leary v. The Queen
(1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 473 (S.C.C.), that voluntary intoxication
is not a defence to a general intent offence such as sexual
assault, violates the guarantees in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the
Charter. The court in Daviault fashioned an alternative common-
law rule which recognized extreme intoxication akin to automatism
as a defence to general intent offences, provided the accused
establishes that extreme state on a balance of probabilities.
[8]  The decision in Daviault was not unexpected. After the
Charter there continued to be decisions of many courts applying
the common-law defence as limited by Leary. However, by the time
of the appellant&#146;s trial in 1994, there were clear signals from
the Supreme Court of Canada and from this court that, in light of
the Charter, a defence of extreme intoxication may be available
in cases of  general intent offences.
[9]  In R. v. Penno (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 344 (S.C.C.) at p.
352, Lamer C.J.C. said, &#147;the question is still open as to whether
intoxication giving rise to a state of insanity or automatism&#148; is
a defence to a general intent offence.
[10] Similarly Doherty J.A. in R. v. R.T. (1992), 58 O.A.C. 81 at
89 said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Self-induced intoxication may afford a &#147;defence&#148; to the
          charges faced by the appellant: R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
          833; 90 N.R. 321; 45 C.C.C. (3d) 1. If it does provide a
          &#147;defence&#148;, it will do so only in cases of extreme intoxication
          &#147;involving an absence of awareness akin to a state of insanity or
          automatism&#148; (per Wilson J., in R v. Bernard, supra, at p. 887
          S.C.R., p. 42 C.C.C.). Evidence that an accused  was &#147;very drunk&#148;
          will not suffice to raise the &#147;defence&#148; of &#147;drunkenness&#148; to
          assault and related crimes: R. v. Quin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 825 at
          831; 90 N.R. 389; 44 C.C.C. (3d) 570 at 575.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[11] Further, before the trial in this case a number of trial
courts had accepted the defence of extreme intoxication for
general intent offences. See R. v. McIntyre (1992), 100 Nfld. &amp;
P.E.I.R. 144 (P.E.I.S.C.); R. v. Finlayson, a judgment of the
Ontario District Court, delivered March 19, 1990, [1990] o.j.
422; R. v. Edgar (1991), 10 C.R. (4th) 67 (B.C. Prov. Ct.) and R.
v. Saulnier (1992), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 58 (N.S.C.A.).
[12] In our view, this is not a case in which the appellant
should be permitted to raise the defence of extreme intoxication
for the first time on appeal. In reaching this conclusion we take
three factors into account. First, although the decision in
Daviault was the first occasion upon which the Supreme Court
recognized the defence of extreme intoxication, Daviault was to a
large extent the conclusion of what can fairly be described as
the normal evolution of a common-law principle. At the time of
the appellant&#146;s trial, it would not have been unreasonable to
expect a trial counsel, defending a case with a genuine issue of
extreme intoxication, to have relied on that defence. There were
serious indications that the defence would be accepted and it
would have been reasonable and appropriate to raise that defence
on the proper facts. Indeed, by that time, Daviault had been
argued before the Supreme Court and the court&#146;s judgment was
under reserve.
[13] Second, we have considered the evidence at trial together
with the proposed new evidence relating to intoxication presented
on this appeal. In our view, there is little possibility that the
appellant could establish, on a balance of probabilities, the
defence of extreme intoxication at a new trial. In particular,
his actions both before and after the offence and his memory of
those events appear to be inconsistent with the defence
recognized in Daviault.
[14] Finally, approximately a year after the decision in
Daviault, the Criminal Code was amended by adding s. 33.1 which
eliminated the defence of extreme intoxication for offences
involving elements of assault or any other interference or threat
of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another
person. Although the amendment does not operate retrospectively
to apply to the appellant&#146;s case, the amendment is relevant to
the issue of fairness. The defence the appellant seeks to raise
for the first time on appeal has not been part of the criminal
law in Canada, for the offence of which the appellant was
convicted, since 1995. The appellant is not being denied the
opportunity of asserting a defence that is based on fundamental
or core values underlying the criminal law in this area.
[15] After the argument of this appeal, counsel for the appellant
referred us to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Warsing (released December 17, 1998). The factors which led
the majority to permit the respondent to raise a new defence on
appeal in Warsing were peculiar to the specific defence of not
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and, in our
view, do not assist the appellant in this case.
[16] For these reasons, we are not prepared to permit the
appellant to raise the defence of extreme intoxication in this
appeal. In addition, we are of the view that the appellant has
failed to meet the test for introducing new evidence on appeal
set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. The appeal
from conviction is therefore dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[17] We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in imposing
a sentence of three and one-half years. The trial judge found the
appellant&#146;s conduct to be intentional, callous and cruel. The
appellant had sexually abused the complainant in the past. The
trial judge found that he showed no remorse. The offence involved
a serious breach of trust. We see no error in principle, nor can
it be said that the sentence exceeds the appropriate range for
this type of offence.
[18] Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal against
sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
