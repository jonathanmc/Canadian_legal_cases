    <pre>HEARD:         May 10, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sharpe dated November 28,
1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondents (Lloyd&#146;s) insured an armoured car company
called National Armoured Ltd. (National Armoured) against
liability for losses incurred by National Armoured in the
operation of its armoured car business. The appellants were
customers of National Armoured.  In November 1992, National
Armoured was robbed and over $8 million belonging to the
appellants was stolen.  Lloyd&#146;s investigated the robbery and
eventually denied coverage claiming that National Armoured had
made several material misrepresentations that Lloyd&#146;s relied on
in issuing and renewing the policies.  The trial judge found that
National Armoured had indeed made several material
misrepresentations and that Lloyd&#146;s was entitled to a declaration
as against National Armoured that the policies were void.  That
finding is not challenged on appeal.
[2]  The extensive and careful reasons of Sharpe J. are reported
at (1996), 142 D.L.R. (4th) 506.  His detailed review of the
evidence and his unchallenged findings of fact allow us to
proceed directly to the issues raised by the appellants.</pre>
    <pre>     The Contract Claim</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellants submit that they were unnamed insureds under
the policies and are, therefore, entitled to recover from Lloyd&#146;s
under the policies despite the material misrepresentations made
by National Armoured.  Counsel for the appellants carefully took
us through the same arguments canvassed and rejected by Sharpe J.
at pp. 551-53.  We agree with the conclusions of Sharpe J.  The
terms of the policies considered in their entirety cannot be read
as describing the appellants as an identifiable class whom
Lloyd&#146;s and National Armoured intended to include as insured
under the policies.  As the policies cannot be so read, there is
no need to consider the possible application of the contra
proferendum rule or the conduct of the appellants, the
respondents and National Armoured in order to properly interpret
the policies.  We would add, however, that to the extent that
conduct is relevant, it strongly suggests that the appellants
were not unnamed insureds under the policy.  Lloyd&#146;s is not
liable to the appellants under the policy.</pre>
    <pre>     The Tort Claim</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellants submit that they relied on the fact that
National Armoured was insured in placing their business with
National Armoured.  They further submit that Lloyd&#146;s was well
aware of that reliance.  The appellants contend that Lloyd&#146;s had
a duty to them to exercise due diligence in issuing the policies
to National Armoured.  Due diligence, in this context, is said to
require an independent investigation by Lloyd&#146;s of the
information supplied to it by National Armoured.  Counsel for the
appellants submits that this obligation to investigate arose
because the material supplied to Lloyd&#146;s raised or ought
reasonably to have raised suspicions as to the accuracy of
material parts of the information provided to Lloyd&#146;s by National
Armoured.  Counsel for the appellants argues that the combination
of their reliance on the existence of insurance and the
reasonable cause for suspicion as to the accuracy of material
information supplied by National Armoured obligated Lloyd&#146;s to
conduct its own investigation of the accuracy of the information
supplied by National Armoured.
[5]  Counsel for the appellants contends that Lloyd&#146;s potential
liability to the customers in tort flows from generally accepted
tort principles, although he acknowledges that to date those
principles have not been applied in Canada to render an insurer
directly liable in tort to customers of an insured whose policy
has been rendered void by the insured&#146;s misrepresentations.
[6]  The contention that an insurer may, in some circumstances,
be liable in tort to parties other than the insured for a failure
to adequately investigate information provided by an insured
raises difficult questions of both law and policy.  It does not
appear that the potential liability of Lloyd&#146;s in tort to the
appellants was raised before Sharpe J., although some of the same
issues were canvassed in the context of his assessment of Lloyd&#146;s
claim that the policy was voided by National Armoured&#146;s
misrepresentations (pp. 544-47).
[7]  We do not think that this is an appropriate case to decide
the difficult legal and policy questions raised by this
submission.  Assuming the appellants&#146; submission is sound in law,
it must fail on the facts of this case.  The appellants argued
that National Armoured advised Lloyd&#146;s that one Bill Whyte was
only a consultant with National Armoured when in fact he was the
prime mover in the company.  It was acknowledged by Lloyd&#146;s that
Mr. Whyte&#146;s involvement with National Armoured was a material
fact in the determination of whether coverage should be extended
to National Armoured.  It was also Lloyd&#146;s position that Whyte&#146;s
role had been concealed from them and that he was indeed the
central figure in National Armoured&#146;s operation.  Sharpe J. found
that National Armoured had deliberately misrepresented Mr.
Whyte&#146;s role in the company.
[8]  The appellants maintain that the material supplied to
Lloyd&#146;s (the August 21, 1991 letter) raised or should have raised
real suspicions as to the accuracy of the representation made by
National Armoured that Bill Whyte was only a consultant.  The
appellants submit that given this suspicion, Lloyd&#146;s was
obligated to conduct its own investigation of Mr. Whyte&#146;s role in
National Armoured and that had Lloyd&#146;s done so, it would have
readily determined that he was the prime mover of the company and
would not have insured National Armoured.  It follows, they say,
that they would not have placed their funds with National
Armoured.
[9]  The August 21, 1991 letter written by the broker to Lloyd&#146;s
certainly raised the question of Mr. Whyte&#146;s involvement in
National Armoured.  The letter indicates that a previous insurer
had suspicions as to whether Mr. Whyte&#146;s involvement was
accurately described as that of a consultant.  The letter goes on
to indicate, however, that those suspicions had been investigated
by two and possibly three individuals, including the author of
the letter, and had not been substantiated.  The investigations
had been conducted by individuals familiar with the industry in
general, the operation of National Armoured, and the connection
of Mr. Whyte to the principal owner of National Armoured.  When
the information provided in the letter is considered in its
entirety, we do not think it can be said that Lloyd&#146;s either was
suspicious or should have been suspicious as to the accuracy of
the representation that Mr. Whyte was a consultant to National
Armoured.  As the duty contended for by the appellants would
arise only in cases where it was reasonable to suspect the
accuracy of material information supplied to an insurer by an
insured, it follows that no such duty arose on the facts of this
case.
[10] The appellants&#146; tort claim cannot succeed.</pre>
    <pre>     The Additional Grounds of Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[11] Brief reference should be made to two additional arguments
advanced by the appellants.  First, it was contended that as
Lloyd&#146;s acted carelessly in approving the policy, it should bear
any loss suffered by the appellants as their conduct was
blameless.  As we reject the submission that Lloyd&#146;s acted
carelessly in accepting National Armoured&#146;s representations as to
Whyte&#146;s involvement in the company, this argument must fail.
Furthermore, we reject, as unsound in law, the submission that
the relative carelessness of two parties who have suffered injury
at the hands of a third party can in and of itself form a basis
for ordering recovery by the less careless against the more
careless.  We do not read Marvco Colour Research Ltd. v. Harris
(1982), 141 D.L.R. (3d) 577 (S.C.C.) as creating a distinct cause
of action triggered by a finding that as between two innocent
parties the more innocent has a right of action against the other
party.  That case decides that a party cannot successfully raise
a non est factum defence against an innocent third party where
the defence arises out of the carelessness of the party seeking
to rely on it.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The appellants also submitted that Lloyd&#146;s had constructive
knowledge of the inaccuracy of the representation made by
National Armoured concerning Mr. Whyte&#146;s involvement with that
company.  Nothing in the material provided to Lloyd&#146;s, the
information generally available to it, or otherwise notorious
facts, placed Lloyd&#146;s in a position where it could be deemed to
know that the representations made by National Armoured were
inaccurate.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appeal is dismissed with costs.
