    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Wilkins J. dated November 25, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>AUSTIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue in this appeal is whether a purchaser of real
property who fails to close the transaction can avoid a claim for
damages where the agreement contains a non-alienation provision.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In June, 1989 the defendant, Mr. Foo, entered into a
contract with Cedarland, a developer, to buy a house.  Cedarland
was to build the house and to give vacant possession on the date
of closing which was to be November 5, 1990.  The purchase price
was $414,900 payable $2,000 as a deposit with the offer, further
deposits of $5,000 each on August 24 and September 24, 1989, a
vendor take-back mortgage of $311,175 and the balance by cash or
certified cheque on closing.
[3]  Some time after the agreement was made, Mr. Foo was
contacted by Cedarland and attended at the latter&#146;s premises to
select bricks, colour, paint and other finishes for the house.
[4]  From time to time Mr. Foo visited the Cedarland site to
check on the progress of work.  His last visit was around the end
of September 1990.  The trial judge found that it was Mr. Foo&#146;s
opinion at that time that the building could not be completed
until some time well after November 5 and that there would, in
all probability, be a request by Cedarland to extend the closing
date.  Mr. Foo had been a quantity surveyor or estimator in the
construction business for 35 years.
[5]  Mr. Foo&#146;s estimate of the time required for completion was
wrong.  The trial judge found that the premises were satisfactory
for interim occupancy and for closing in accordance with the
terms of the agreement of purchase and sale on November 5, 1990.
Part of the evidence supporting this finding was an interim
occupancy certificate issued by the municipality on November 2,
1990.
[6]  Apart from choosing finishes and visiting the site, Mr. Foo
took no steps to complete the transaction.  Specifically, he did
not retain a solicitor to search the title or take any of the
steps necessary to close.
[7]  To meet this contingency, the agreement of purchase and sale
provided that the vendor could  send to the purchaser by
registered mail the materials necessary for closing.  The trial
judge found that Cedarland met its contractual obligations in
this regard and that the required documents were delivered in the
prescribed manner on November 1, 1990.
[8]  According to Mr. Foo&#146;s evidence, he did not pick up his mail
until November 9 or 10.  In the meantime, Cedarland had carried
out a form of tender in the Registry Office as expressly
permitted by the terms of the agreement of purchase and sale and
had terminated the agreement, also as provided in the agreement.
As a result, when Mr. Foo picked up the closing documents on
November 9 or 10, he also received a letter dated November 6 from
Cedarland advising him of the attempt to tender, the termination
of the agreement of purchase and sale, the taking of the deposit
money by Cedarland as forfeited and Cedarland&#146;s reservation of
any additional claims it might wish to make.
[9]  When the sale did not close on November 5, Cedarland
immediately put the house back on the market.  That market had
fallen appreciably since June 1989 and despite Cedarland&#146;s
efforts, which the trial judge found to be reasonable, the
property was not resold until October 1992 and then at a price of
$259,000.
[10] Cedarland had already commenced action against Mr. Foo for
any loss it might suffer on the resale.  The damages, including
carrying costs, were assessed at $159,314.44 plus pre-judgment
interest at 12.9% per year from November 6, 1990, for a total of
$324,922.15.  Judgment was given against Mr. Foo after trial for
that amount plus costs.
[11] If nothing else, Mr. Foo was consistent.  When he received
the materials noted earlier on November 9 or 10, 1990 he did
nothing.  That appears to have been the case until this action
was brought in April 1991.</pre>
    <pre>THE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[12] In its factum and in oral argument, Mr. Foo raised two
matters:  the weight to be given to the evidence of tender and
the effect to be given to a non-alienation provision in the
agreement.  We saw no merit in the former and called on the
respondent only with regard to the non-alienation provision.</pre>
    <pre>THE NON-ALIENATION PROVISION</pre>
    <pre>[13] Clauses 6(g) and 17 of the agreement of purchase and sale
read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               6(g) the Purchaser will not sell, transfer
  	  or otherwise dispose of any interest in the Real
	  Property or this Agreement until all the dwelling
	  units in the project of which the Dwelling is
	  included have been sold by the Vendor.  A clause
	  to this effect may, at the option of the Vendor,
	  be included in the Deed/Transfer.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                17   The Purchaser covenants and agrees
          that  all covenants herein given by him shall
          not  merge on the closing of this transaction
          but  shall  remain in full force and  effect.
          The  Purchaser shall give to the  Vendor  any
          further  written assurance as may be required
          by the Vendor to give effect to this covenant
          either before or after closing.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The draft deed did not contain anything in any way referable
to either of these provisions.
[15] The original statement of defence and counterclaim is dated
May 23, 1991 and amendments were made to it to and including
September 9, 1998.  No reference was made in this pleading to the
non-alienation provision.  The matter must, however, have been
raised at trial as the trial judge had this to say about it:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It was further raised before me that there was
	  a clause in the agreement being 6(g), that
	  constituted a restraint on the availability of
	  the land.  The clause does purport to provide a
          restriction in which the purchaser is contractually
	  obligated not to sell or transfer or otherwise
	  dispose of any interest in the real property
	  until all the dwelling units in the project in
          which this dwelling is included have been sold
	  by the Vendor.  It goes on to set out that a
	  clause to this effect may at, the option of
	  Vendor, be included in the deed of transfer.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  draft  transfer was  sent  to  the
          Defendant in the correspondence registered on
          the  29th  of October.  There is no  term  or
          provision  of  restraint  contained  in  that
          draft  transfer  and  as  such  I  can   only
          conclude that there was no intention  on  the
          part  of  the Vendor to rely on clause  6(g),
          and  in  fact, the failure to place any  such
          clause  in that transfer would, in  my  view,
          constitute  evidence of  the  intent  of  the
          Vendor to waive that clause.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The clause is one solely for the benefit
          of  the Vendor.  They waived such benefit  as
          might  have  been  in their interest.   Aside
          from  that,  even  if the clause  was  for  a
          mutual  benefit  the  failure  to  have  that
          clause in the deed in my view would not  make
          it  a clause that constituted a restraint  on
          alienation, as contained in the Agreement  of
          Purchase and Sale, it is simply a contractual
          term  and not something that was binding upon
          or  running  with  the land.   So  I  am  not
          satisfied  that there was any such  restraint
          on alienation contained in the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[16] According to appellant&#146;s counsel, Cedarland referred to the
language in issue as an &#147;anti-inflation clause&#148;.  As is apparent
from the evidence of market conditions during the period June
1989 to November 1990, the residential market was relatively
volatile.  According to Cedarland&#146;s counsel, Cedarland was
looking for persons who would actually live in its houses and was
attempting to avoid &#147;investors&#148; who would buy properties only to
&#147;flip&#148; them when the market went up.
[17] Mr. Foo&#146;s position was that the provision in question was a
restraint of trade, a limitation on his right to sell his
property, indefinite in duration and that as a consequence the
entire agreement was void and thus unenforceable.
[18] In my view, at worst, the provision is void and
unenforceable but severable, the main agreement remaining valid
and enforceable.  In order to provide any relief to Mr. Foo, the
clause in issue would have to:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   be a condition of the contract, as
	  opposed to a mere covenant which is personal
	  to the appellant;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   run with the land as opposed to
          being personal to Mr. Foo;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   be of such significance in the
          context of the agreement that it could not be
          severed from it; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   constitute such a restraint on
          alienation as to render the entire agreement
          void.</pre>
    <pre>In all probability, the clause in issue fails to meet any of
these standards.  It is not necessary, however, to deal with each
and every one of them.  It is sufficient to deal with
severability.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Waddams, The Law of Contracts, 4th ed. (1999), on the issue
of severance of illegal terms, says there is no simple test of
severability.  At pp. 421 and 422, the following is suggested:
          </pre>
    <pre>      A more useful test, it is suggested, is whether the legal
      parts of the transaction are so closely tied in with the illegal
      parts that enforcement of the former will tend to subvert the
      policies underlying the rule of illegality.  A significant factor
      is the seriousness of the illegality.  Where an agreement is
      highly objectionable the courts are unlikely to favour a plea for
      partial enforcement.  But where, as in the case of a covenant in
      restraint of trade, the agreement offends only by slightly
      overstepping the mark of what is permissible, severance is more
      readily made.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Here it is clear that the main purpose of the contract was
the purchase and sale of a house.  The clause in question is
relatively insignificant in the context of the whole agreement.
If the provision were put to the test and found reasonable, Mr.
Foo could be precluded from re-selling for a relatively brief
period.  More probably, a sale would not be enjoined but
Cedarland would be awarded damages only.  If found unreasonable,
it would be severed from the main agreement and that would be the
end of it.
[21] The net result is that Mr. Foo has no defence to the
Cedarland&#146;s claim.  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
