COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
      <pre>RE:            WILLIAM CELLINI, RUTH ANNE CELLINI, CHRISTINA ANNE
               CELLINI, and JOHN EDWARD CELLINI
               (Appellants/Plaintiffs) and THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
               FOR ONTARIO, (THE DURHAM REGIONAL POLICE
               DEPARTMENT, and SUSAN THIBIDEAU)
               (Respondent/Defendant</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, BORINS AND SHARPE JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       J.P. Fletcher, for the appellants</pre>
      <pre>               W.J. Manuel and J.W. Smith, for the respondent</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         October 15, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Howden J. dated September 2, 1998.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   In  our view, Howden J. was correct in concluding that  the
respondent had demonstrated there was no genuine issue for  trial
with  respect to the malice of the respondent and the absence  of
reasonable  and  probable  grounds  in  the  prosecution  of  the
appellant,  William Cellini.  As well, we are not persuaded  that
Howden  J., in refusing an adjournment to the appellant to permit
him   to  examine  a  witness  under  rule  39.03  exercised  his
discretion on improper principles.
[2]  Therefore, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
