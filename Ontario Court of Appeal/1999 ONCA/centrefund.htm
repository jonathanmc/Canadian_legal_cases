[1]      It  is obvious from Bi-Way&#146;s August 8, 1996 letter  that
the  parties were not entering a new lease and did not intend  to
do  so  since Bi-Way states: &#147;Response to your letter dated  July
16,  1996  regarding our renewal term for Stanley Park Mall  ...&#148;
(emphasis  added). Thus the 1996 documents, an informal  exchange
of  letters, provide a renewal extension from January 31, 1997 to
January 31, 1998. The February 1, 1995 Assignment, Assumption and
Amending  Agreement (&#147;AAAA&#148;) provided that the term of  the  1990
Letter  Agreement was to expire January 31, 1997. In  the  result
the  1996  documents are not a new lease agreement but merely  an
extension of term of the 1990 Letter Agreement as extended by the
AAAA.  The 1996 documents also deleted the Renewal Option Feature
previously  found  in  the  lease documents  for  anything  after
January  31, 1997. Thus the reference in paragraph 5 of the  AAAA
to  &#147;without having validly exercised its Renewal Options&#148;  is  a
redundancy post January 31, 1997. Thus paragraph 5 with the  1996
amendment added in should be read as:

          5.  &#133;  Furthermore, if the Tenant remains  in
          possession  of the Premises after the  expiry
          of  the  New  Term [term ending  January  31,
          1998],  &#133;  there is no tacit renewal  of  the
          Letter   Agreement  despite   any   statutory
          provisions  or  legal  presumption   to   the
          contrary. The Tenant will occupy the Premises
          as  a  Tenant  from month  to  month  at  the
          monthly  Minimum  Rent, Percentage  Rent  and
          common   area  maintenance  charges   payable
          pursuant   to  the  Letter  Agreement   dated
          February 21, 1990.
     </pre>
    <pre>[2]      The  Respondent, having overheld after January 31,  1998
should  thereby be required to pay Minimum Rent, Percentage  Rent
and  common  area maintenance charges on a month to  month  basis
starting February 1, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>[3]     With  respect  it  appears that the motions  court  judge
misconstrued the documentation in coming to his decision.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]      The  appeal is granted with fixed costs to the appellant
as to the hearing below of $4,000 and here before us of $4,000.
