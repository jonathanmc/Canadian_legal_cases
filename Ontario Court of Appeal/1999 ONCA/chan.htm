    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, AUSTIN and BORINS JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       The appellant Yu-Sze Chan in person</pre>
    <pre>               William D. Black, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 21, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Herold J., dated July 30, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appeal is from a summary judgment dismissing the action
in negligence against the respondent pursuant to Rule 20.01(3) of
the Rules of Civil Procedure.
[2]  The motions judge proceeded on the assumption that, in the
particular circumstances of this case, the respondent had a duty
of care to the appellants.  This assumption was not in issue on
this appeal and we make no comment with respect to it.
[3]  The only issue in the appeal is whether the motions judge
erred in his finding that there was no evidence before him that
the respondent, a pathologist, was negligent in his performance
and reporting of a post-mortem pathological investigation.  Based
on his finding that there was no such evidence, the motions judge
concluded that there was no genuine issue for trial.
[4]  There was no dispute on the material facts before the
motions judge as to the cause of death as determined by the
respondent.  In his report dated July 16, 1993, the respondent
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Death in this 71 year old female with underlying rheumatic
          and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is attributable to
          left ventricular rupture occurring as a complication of mital
          valve replacement surgery.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The substance of the complaint made by the appellants is
that the respondent failed to comment on whether there was some
surgical misadventure during the course of this surgery.
However, there was no evidence in this record that the
examination and report of the respondent fell below the standard
required of him and was in some way misleading.  Indeed, if
anything, the evidence of the appellant&#146;s expert is to the
contrary.
[6]  We are not prepared to interfere with the findings of the
motions judge.  The appeal is dismissed without costs.</pre>
