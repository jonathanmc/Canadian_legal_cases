    <pre>HEARD:         July 8, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of His Honour Judge Paris dated December
22, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of possession of crack cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking.  He submits that the verdict is
unreasonable on the general basis that there was no evidence to
support a finding that he was in possession of the drugs at the
material times.
[2]  We see no merit in this submission.  In our view, there was
evidence upon which a finder of fact, acting judicially, could
convict the appellant of possession for the purpose of
trafficking.  The evidence of possession to which we refer is set
out in paragraph 30 of the Crown&#146;s factum.  Furthermore, it was
open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant or his
wife, a co-accused, was in possession of the drugs.  The
appellant&#146;s wife gave evidence (the appellant did not) denying
any connection with or knowledge of the drugs and the scales
found in the master bedroom where the appellant slept on
occasion.  The trial judge accepted the appellant&#146;s wife&#146;s
evidence and in the end concluded that the Crown had established
that the appellant had possession of the drugs beyond any
reasonable doubt.  We see no basis upon which to interfere with
that conclusion.
[3]  The appellant moved for a directed verdict at the conclusion
of the Crown&#146;s case.  Although the record is not entirely clear,
it does not seem that the motion was pursued after it was
adjourned to permit defence counsel (not Mr. Slocombe) to check
some law concerning consciousness of guilt based on the
appellant&#146;s flight.  Instead, defence counsel, when the trial
resumed, simply advised the court that the appellant would not
call any evidence.  The fact that the trial judge suggested
during the directed verdict submissions that the appellant&#146;s
flight might afford some evidence of possession does not in the
particular circumstances entitle the appellant to a mistrial on
the basis that in giving reasons for conviction the trial judge
changed his mind on this issue.
[4]  With respect to the issue of flight, in the final analysis
in convicting the appellant, the trial judge did not use the
evidence of the appellant&#146;s flight as circumstantial evidence of
his guilt.  Manifestly, the trial judge was entitled to
reconsider this issue.
[5]  Accordingly, for these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
