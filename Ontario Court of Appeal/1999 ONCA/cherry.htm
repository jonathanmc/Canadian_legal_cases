COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and JOHN
               CHERRY (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, GOUDGE and O'CONNOR JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Howard Borenstein, for the appellant
               Christine Bartlett-Hughes, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         January 29, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  We saw no merit in Mr. Borenstein's submissions relating to
unreasonable verdict, reversal of onus or the corroborative
effect of the evidence of the complainant's bruising and black
eyes, and did not call upon Ms. Bartlett-Hughes to respond to
them. We did, however, call on her to respond to the issue of
ineffective assistance of counsel as it related to the failure to
call a number of witnesses who, it was suggested, would have
testified that they did not see or hear evidence of the
appellant's alleged abuse of the complainant during the time in
which she and the appellant lived together.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In dismissing the motion, made after the appellant's
conviction and on the date scheduled for his sentencing, to
reopen the trial to call such witnesses, the trial judge
commented that the proposed evidence, taken together with all of
the other evidence adduced at the trial, would not have affected
the verdict he rendered. That observation, made by a trier of
fact  who had heard five days of evidence, is entitled to
considerable  deference in responding to the appellant's
submission. In the light of that observation, the third component
of the approach described in R. v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C.
(3d) 35, at page 59, cannot be said to be established.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.</pre></td>
