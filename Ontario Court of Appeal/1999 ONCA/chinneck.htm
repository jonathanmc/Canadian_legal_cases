[1]  In our view, the settlement advanced in these proceedings
was alleged to have been reached with legal advice during the
pendency of court proceedings.  It concerned financial issues
which were germane to those proceedings.  It falls well within
the principle in Geropoulous v. Geropoulous.

[2]  Secondly, the motion before Haines J. heard on October 15,
1997 did not, in his view, put in play the issue on which he
directed the trial of an issue.  This is a reasonable conclusion
with which we would not interfere.  Res judicata does not arise
from the earlier order.  Given the matters in dispute, it was
appropriate in our view for a trial of an issue to be directed.

[3]  Both appeals are dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
