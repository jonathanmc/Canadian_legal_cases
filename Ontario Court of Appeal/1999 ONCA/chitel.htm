      <pre>Appeal from the Order of Spence J. dated December 3, 1998.

</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the order of Spence
J. granting summary judgment to Philip and Deborah Brent on their
cross-claim and from that part of Spence J’s order narrowing  the
issues to be tried with respect to the plaintiff’s claims against
the  Bank of Montreal, Anglo York Industries Limited and the Paul
Estate.
[2]  In addition, Spence J. dismissed the plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment against Philip Brent, Anglo York, the Paul
Estate and the Bank and the Bank’s cross-motion for summary
judgment against the plaintiff.  The plaintiff and the Bank
appealed from the dismissal of their motions.  However, as those
appeals are from interlocutory orders, they are not properly
before this court: Albert v. Spiegel (1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 90
(Ont. C.A.).
[3]  The claims arose from a Joint Venture Agreement between the
plaintiff and Anglo York, through its principal, Mr. Paul, in
respect of a parcel of land on Highway 401 near Bowmanville. Each
of the joint venture partners mortgaged its undivided one-half
interest in the property. The plaintiff’s mortgage went into
default, and her half of the land was eventually sold by the Bank
under power of sale to the defendant, Anglo York, for $200,000,
leaving a deficiency. The entire parcel was sold by Anglo Yo+rk
about 2 years later for $3,894,500. Anglo York refused to share
the profit with the plaintiff. Mr. Brent was a director and the
solicitor for Anglo York and was involved in the dealings with
the Bank with respect to the plaintiff’s interest in the lands.
Deborah Brent is also a solicitor and his law partner.
[4]  The plaintiff sued the defendants Anglo York, the estate of
Mr. Paul, Brent and the Bank for breach of trust, breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of their duty to act in good faith, breach
of their duty not to make secret profits, conspiracy to defraud,
conversion, and fraud, as well as breach of contract as against
Anglo York. The plaintiff also sued the Bank for improvident sale
of the lands.  The plaintiff’s claim against Mr. Brent is that he
knowingly assisted Anglo York in the breach of its fiduciary
duty, and other duties which it owed to her.  Mrs. Brent’s
liability is based on the allegation that she was her husband’s
law partner.
[5]  The plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment was procedurally
flawed. This court was told that as the record of the evidence
for the motion demonstrated that there were many factual issues
in dispute, counsel for the plaintiff took the course of
abandoning certain factual positions of the plaintiff for the
purpose of the motion, in order to eliminate factual disputes and
to clean up the record so that the motion could proceed, which it
did.
[6]  That strategy proved to be disastrous for the plaintiff as
at least one of the facts that was conceded formed the basis of
the legal conclusion of the motions judge that the plaintiff had
no case with respect to the majority of her claims. He not only
denied the plaintiff summary judgment on those claims, but he in
effect granted summary judgment to the defendants on those claims
by removing them from the matters to be litigated at trial. He
also granted summary judgment to the Brents.
[7]  Not only was the plaintiff’s procedure strategically
misguided, it is unavailable under Rule 20 except in very limited
circumstances. (For example, this procedure was used in the case
of Guarantee Company of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.,
[1999] S.C.J. No. 60 without adverse comment by the court.)  In
any case where it is left open to the motions judge on the
summary judgment motion to narrow the issues for trial or to
grant partial summary judgment to any party, then any agreement
on the facts must be for the purposes of the entire proceeding.
[8]  The plaintiff’s sworn evidence on the motion was that she
had obtained the consent of Mr. Paul to mortgage her half-
interest in the property, as required by the joint venture
agreement. For the purpose of the motion, however, counsel
conceded that no consent was obtained. On that basis the motions
judge found that the failure to obtain consent amounted to a
repudiation of the joint venture agreement and was fatal to the
plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, fraud and the other equitable grounds on which her claim
was based, as well as to her claim against Mr. Brent. As a
result, the motions judge not only dismissed the summary judgment
motion on those claims, but used rule 20.05(1) to eliminate those
issues from the issues to be litigated at the trial. It must not
have been made clear to the motions judge that because the
factual concession made by the plaintiff was for the purpose of
the motion only, it would not be appropriate for him to make any
determinations affecting the outcome of the trial, once he
determined that summary judgment would not go in favour of the
plaintiff.
[9]  The action was left to proceed against Anglo York and the
Paul Estate but only on the issue of whether Mr. Paul had told
Mrs. Chitel that he would look after her problem with the Bank
concerning the default in her mortgage. This highlights the
problem created by the procedure adopted by the plaintiff. As the
issue for trial will clearly involve findings of credibility of
those two parties, their previous dealings, including whether
consent to the mortgage was given, could well be explored. If
Mrs. Chitel were to maintain her sworn evidence given before the
concession made on the motion, faced with the clear statement in
the reasons of the motions judge that no consent was given, the
trial judge would be in a very difficult position, as would the
plaintiff.
[10] Besides this problem, it is unclear from the record and the
reasons, what facts  were found not to be in dispute in order to
form the basis for the legal conclusions reached by the motions
judge. Rather, it appears that many important facts, as well as
inferences from the facts, are very much in dispute in this case
and that they are part of a complete story which must be told in
its entirety at the trial. Furthermore, because the entire legal
analysis was based on, and flowed from, at least one of the facts
conceded for the motion only, it is not possible to say that any
of the legal results would survive a revision of the facts.
[11] This is not a case for partial summary judgment eliminating
any of the claims. Both the facts and the legal issues are
complex and require a trial where they can be considered as a
whole by one judge who will apply the law to the facts as
ultimately found. Nor was it appropriate to dismiss the action as
against the Brents, as that action only fell when the equitable
claims against the Anglo York defendants fell. The same result
applies for the Bank.
</pre>
      <pre>RESULT

[12]  The  order of Spence J., insofar as it granted judgment  to
the  Brents  on  their  cross-motion  for  summary  judgment  and
narrowed  the  issues for trial of the action against  the  other
defendants, is set aside. The balance of the order dismissing the
summary judgment motion of the plaintiff and the solicitor-client
costs  consequent to that dismissal are not the subject  of  this
appeal.</pre>
      <pre>[13] On the issue of costs of the motions by and against the
Brents and the Bank, as the motions for summary judgment in each
case failed, there will be no costs of those motions.
[14] Although the appellant was successful on the appeal, her
motion for summary judgment was ill-conceived and should not have
been brought. Her appeal was successful because this was not a
case for summary judgment in whole or in part.  Therefore, the
costs of the appeal shall be in the cause.
