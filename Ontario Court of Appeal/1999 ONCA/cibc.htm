    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Day dated June 17, 1999</pre>

    <pre>[1]   We  need not decide whether the view Grossberg Co.  Ct.  J.
took  in Shiner et al. v. Varadeff et al. (1975) 7 O.R. (2d)  684
as  to  the  effect of a discharge was correct  at  the  time  or
whether it still applies in light of the Land Registration Reform
Act R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4.
[2]  The parties agree that there is no other evidence that is
relevant to resolve the issues raised in this case.  Assuming
there was an agreement in the exchange of letters in
December 1990, that was only an agreement that Firstline could
seek recovery of the deficiency.  When Firstline provided the
discharge in May 1992 it also released the documents, including
the mortgage, and closed its file.  We agree with the appellants
that the only interpretation of this course of conduct is that
Firstline agreed to accept the proceeds of the sale in full
satisfaction of the debt as permitted by s. 16 of the Mercantile
Law Amendment Act, c. M.10.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of Day J. is
set aside, and the action is dismissed with costs.  The
appellants shall also have their costs of the appeal.
