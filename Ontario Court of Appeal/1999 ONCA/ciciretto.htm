      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hoilett J. dated September 21, 1998.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from a trial conducted under the
simplified procedure rules.
[2]  The appellant’s first argument was that the trial judge
erred in refusing to permit the appellant to call a witness who
was not on the witness list and whose testimony, it is said,
would impeach the credibility of the respondent.  On the record,
we can find no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s
exercise of discretion on this issue.  There was no explanation
given to the trial judge as to why the identity of the witness
had not been disclosed to the respondent earlier and there was no
explanation given to the trial judge or to this court as to the
nature or substance of her evidence and why it was so critical.
[3]  As to the remainder of the appeal, we are concerned that
what would appear to us as the jurisprudential issue – namely,
does the doctrine of constructive dismissal apply to an hourly-
rated employee – was not raised below nor was it sought to be
raised in this court.  Rather, the complaint is that the term of
the notice awarded was fifteen months, whereas it is now said it
ought to be ten to thirteen months.  This court will not involve
itself in fine tuning of this nature.
[4]  The appellant pointed out that the judgment had significance
to the labour bar but, in our view, having regard to the manner
in which the case was handled at trial, it has no precedential
value whatsoever.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
