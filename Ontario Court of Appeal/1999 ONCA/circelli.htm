</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant mother wife appeals the order of  Hockin  J.
granting  custody of the two infant children of the  marriage  to
the respondent father.
[2]  By notice of motion brought within the appellant&#146;s action
seeking a divorce and other related relief, the respondent sought
orders for the custody of the two children, for child support and
for disclosure of certain financial information. The notice of
motion did not specify whether the custody order sought was
interim or permanent.
[3]  The appellant, who was unrepresented throughout the
proceedings in the court below, filed an affidavit opposing the
motion and in that affidavit she sought an order for sole and
permanent custody of the two children.
[4]  The motion was argued on the basis of the affidavits of the
parties and the written report of a court-appointed custody and
access assessor. There were no cross-examinations on the
affidavits and there was no viva voce evidence. However, the
motions judge did hear directly from the appellant in the course
of her oral submissions. Mr. Eberlie, on behalf of the
respondent, fairly conceded that the parties proceeded with the
motion on the understanding that the custody order being sought
by the respondent was an interim, not a permanent order for
custody.
[5]  In his endorsement, the motions judge attached weight to the
written report of the assessor which recommended that the two
children &#147;remain in their father&#146;s day-to-day care at the present
time.&#148;  The motions judge concluded that because the material
facts in the report were not really in dispute he could decide
the issue of custody without the necessity of a trial. The
parties have interpreted his order granting custody to the
respondent as a final, not interim, custody order. The motions
judge adjourned the other relief sought in the notice of motion,
together with the issue of access, to a later date. The trial of
the appellant&#146;s action has not yet taken place.
[6]  The appellant&#146;s primary argument is that the motions judge
erred in granting an order of permanent custody on affidavit
evidence, that is without having conducted a trial of that issue.
We agree with this submission.
[7]  In the normal course, the issue of permanent custody is best
determined after a trial at which the court has an opportunity of
observing and assessing the parties by hearing their evidence in-
chief and hearing that evidence tested on cross-examination.
[8]  Having said this, we recognize that there will be unusual
cases where the circumstances are such that nothing will be added
to the decision-making process by requiring a trial.
[9]  In this case, the respondent correctly points out that
neither party asked the motions judge for a trial of the custody
issue. However, that failure is understandable given that the
parties were proceeding on the premise that the order being
sought was for interim not permanent custody.
[10] A determination to grant permanent custody will often
involve different legal and factual issues than those that are
addressed on a motion for interim custody. Because of this, it
was important for the motions judge to have made it clear to the
parties, during the course of the motion, that he was considering
making an order for permanent custody in order that they might
address specific issues applicable to that relief and also to
give them an opportunity to ask for a trial of the issue if they
thought that to be necessary. We are advised that this was not
done. For that reason alone, the order of the motions judge must
be set aside.
[11] Moreover, in our view, it is preferable in this case for the
judge determining the issue of permanent custody to have the
advantage of a trial. Because there will be a trial, we will not
comment on the evidence.
[12] We would, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the
custody order made by the motions judge.
[13] That done, it is our view that it would have been
appropriate for the motions judge to have made an order granting
interim custody to the respondent. The motions judge found that
the children&#146;s best interests would be served by the
predictability and reliability of the care provided by the
respondent. We agree with that finding in so far as it applied to
the upcoming school year at the time the matter was before the
motions judge. The long term best interests of the children may
raise different factors that can be canvassed and determined on a
trial. In the meantime, we think that pending the trial of the
issue of custody, or further order of the trial court, the
existing arrangements for custody and access should continue.
[14] We were advised by counsel that if we allowed the appeal, a
trial of the custody issue could be heard in London within the
next several months. We see merit in having the issue of
permanent custody dealt with before the commencement of the next
school year in September 1999 and ask that counsel co-operate in
arranging the scheduling of the trial to accomplish this
objective. We were not advised of any reason why the present
custodial arrangement should not continue until the trial.
[15] The appeal is therefore allowed and the order below is set
aside. This court orders that the respondent Salvatore Circelli
be granted interim custody of the two children of the marriage.
There shall be no order as to the costs of the appeal.</pre></td>
