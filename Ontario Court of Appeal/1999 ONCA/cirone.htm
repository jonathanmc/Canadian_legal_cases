    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The course of these proceedings shows many occasions on
which the appellants have sought to delay.  The motion before us
was served almost two months ago.  The appellants' request made
today for the first time to further adjourn the matter is denied.
[2]  Much of the order sought to be appealed was made on consent.
No leave has been sought to appeal those parts of the order.
[3]  The notice of appeal raises essentially two grounds of
appeal.  The first is an alleged denial of natural justice.  In
our view this cannot possibly succeed.  The course of the
proceedings below gave the appellants ample opportunity to retain
counsel and file material and they chose not to do so.
[4]  The second is that the judge below should not have granted
summary judgment.  This is also without merit.  The moving party
filed ample material to provide a sound basis for the order made,
including admissions of most of the essential facts.  There was
nothing before the motions judge to contradict this material.
[5]  In all, this appeal cannot possibly succeed.  The motion is
therefore allowed and there will be an order quashing the appeal
with costs.</pre></td>
