    <pre>RE:            PETER CIVIERO and PETGINO INVESTMENTS LIMITED
               (Applicants/Respondents by Counter-application,
               Appellants in Appeal) &#150; and &#150; PHYLLIS MAY FERRIER
               (Respondent/Applicant by Counter-application, 
	       Respondent in Appeal)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        GOUDGE, BORINS and MacPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Douglas G. Loucks,
               for the appellants</pre>
    <pre>               Peter T. Fallis,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         August 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Maloney dated October
28, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants have not persuaded us that the material
before us demonstrates the creation of the trust on which they
rely with the sufficient certainty of intention, subject-matter,
and object.  The registered ownership of the land continues to
unequivocally show Mr. Civiero as the beneficial owner of the
property to the extent of twenty-five per cent.
[2]  In light of this conclusion it is unnecessary for us to deal
with the issue of whether the respondent can rely on the Statute
of Frauds.
[3]  The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
