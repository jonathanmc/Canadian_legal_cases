    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Borkovich J. with a jury dated
December 17, 1997 and January 30, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT</pre>
    <pre>A.   BACKGROUND AND APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged with 8 counts of indecent assault,
1 count of statutory rape, 1 count of rape and 1 count of sexual
assault.  The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on the
count of statutory rape, but left the included offence of
attempted rape to the jury.  The jury convicted the appellant of
attempted rape and of all other counts.  The trial judge imposed
a total sentence of 8.5 years&#146; imprisonment.  The appellant
appeals both the convictions and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>B.   FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The charges against the appellant concerned events involving
various family members over a period from 1953 to 1990.  The
complainants were three of the appellant&#146;s sisters-in-law, four
of his nieces, and two of his daughters.  Many alleged that when
they were young women, at ages ranging from 9 to 18, the
appellant committed various indecent assaults.  There were
allegations of non-consensual sexual intercourse, which gave rise
to the charges of rape and sexual assault; of incidents of French
kissing; of fondling the complainants&#146; breasts and vaginal areas;
and of forced touching of  the appellant&#146;s penis.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The position of the defence at trial was that many of the
incidents simply did not occur; that, in others, the physical
contact was accidental or innocent; and that one of the incidents
of sexual intercourse was consensual.</pre>
    <pre>C.   CONVICTION</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Mr. Greenspan advanced several arguments in support of the
appellant&#146;s appeal against conviction.  We did not call upon the
Crown to respond to the submission regarding deficiencies in the
trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence as it related to the theory
of the defence.  We deal below with the remaining issues.
          </pre>
    <pre>1.        Single Transaction Rule</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The &#147;single transaction rule&#148; is set out in section 581(1)
of the Criminal Code:
          </pre>
    <pre>        581.(1) Each count in an indictment shall in general apply
        to a single transaction and shall contain in substance a
        statement that the accused or defendant committed an offence
        therein specified.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant&#146;s first ground of appeal is that several of
the counts in the indictment violate the single transaction rule.
Mr. Greenspan argues that the evidence led in support of the
impugned counts revealed multiple incidents which could not
properly be treated as a single transaction.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  A &#147;single transaction&#148; is not synonymous with a single
incident, occurrence or offence:  R. v. Selles (1997), 34 O.R.
(3d) 332 (C.A.).  The mere fact that a count in an indictment
refers to several acts, each of which may constitute a separate
offence, does not necessarily violate the single transaction
rule:  R. v. Hulan, [1969] 2 O.R. 283 (C.A.).  However, even
though a count in an indictment might on its face comply with the
single transaction rule, evidence led in support of that count
may violate the single transaction rule by disclosing more than
one transaction.  In such circumstances, it is necessary to
determine whether the evidence was admissible in respect of the
single transaction that was the subject of that count in the
indictment:  R. v. Selles, supra.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In Hulan, the indictment charged that the appellant had
sexual intercourse over a period of several months with a female
under the age of fourteen.  The evidence established that
intercourse occurred on various dates within the period covered
by the indictment.  This court held that, even though the count
covered several incidents during the specified time period, the
count related to a single transaction.  Kelly J.A., speaking for
the court, said, at p. 292:
          </pre>
    <pre>        &#133; Each act concerning which evidence was given took place in
        the home and followed a similar pattern of conduct.  The
        relationship of the complainant and her age enabled the prisoner
        to exert influence over her so that once having accomplished his
        original intention to subject her to his indecent acts,
        subsequent acts were an extension, prolongation or continuation
        of his original intention.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[9]  In Selles, this court found that, while the indictment
complied with the single transaction requirement on its face, the
evidence led in support of the indictment violated the
requirement.  The accused was charged in a single count
indictment with sexual assault causing bodily harm.  The evidence
adduced disclosed six separate incidents, occurring at different
times and involving different persons and places.  The court
found that the incidents could not be treated as a single
transaction.  Unlike as in Hulan, there was a lack of continuity
in the nature of the sexual offence and the incidents involved
different parties on succeeding occasions.</pre>
    <pre>[10] In our view, the present case is closer to Hulan than to
Selles.  Unlike Selles, each count in the indictment concerned
the same parties.  The fact that each count concerned more than
one incident does not constitute a violation of the single
transaction rule.  The incidents may be regarded as constituting
an ongoing transaction, and subsequent acts as an extension or
continuation of the original incident.  The indictment does not
offend the single transaction rule.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Defence counsel raised no objection to the indictment at
trial.  While not fatal, the lack of any objection may be taken
as demonstrating that the indictment occasioned no prejudice to
the appellant.
          </pre>
    <pre>2.        Use of Evidence on Each Count</pre>
    <pre>[12] Mr. Greenspan&#146;s second ground of appeal was that the trial
judge failed to provide an adequate limiting instruction with
respect to the use of evidence on each count.  Although the trial
judge instructed the jury to consider each count separately, and
to decide each count on the evidence relating to that count, the
appellant submits that the language used by the trial judge fell
short of the requirements set out by this court in R. v. M.(B.)
(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.).
[13] While we agree that the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury
with regard to the use of evidence on each count was not perfect,
we are of the view that it was sufficient in the circumstances of
the case.  At the beginning of his charge, the trial judge
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>        Before dealing with the law that applies to the offences, I
        must instruct you that your decision with respect to each count
        must be made on the evidence that relates to that count and
        independent of the other counts.</pre>
    <pre>Towards the end of his charge, the trial judge gave a similar
instruction:
          </pre>
    <pre>       Before I advise you of the verdicts which are open to you,
       let me once again remind you, you must decide each count on the
       evidence that relates to that count, and independent of the other
       counts.</pre>
    <pre>He thus clearly instructed the jury that they should not consider
evidence led in support of other counts to conclude that the
appellant committed the offence charged in any particular count.
We are satisfied that any deficiency with respect to the charge
to the jury on this issue had no bearing upon the result of the
trial.  Again, while it is not dispositive of this ground of
appeal, we note that defence counsel approved of the trial
judge&#146;s proposed instructions to the jury on to this issue and
made no objection on this issue to the jury charge.
          </pre>
    <pre>3.        Evidence of Bad Character</pre>
    <pre>[14] Mr. Greenspan&#146;s third ground of appeal is that the Crown led
evidence of bad character, which the trial judge ought to have
cautioned the jury to disregard, and that other evidence adduced
by the Crown, while properly admitted, tended to show the
appellant as being of disreputable character and warranted a
limiting instruction to the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[15] We agree with Ms. Chapman&#146;s submissions in response to this
issue.  The appellant put his character at issue during the
course of the trial.  The evidence in question was properly
admissible, apart from the appellant putting his character at
issue, as relevant to a material issue.  Much of it constituted
an admission of the actus reus of the offences charged.  No
limiting instruction was warranted.  Again, we note that defence
counsel made no objection to the admissibility of this evidence
at trial.</pre>
    <pre>D.   SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[16] With regards to the appeal from sentence, Mr. Greenspan
submits that the trial judge erred in giving insufficient weight
to the evidence of the appellant&#146;s otherwise good character; in
holding that the jury&#146;s verdict represented a finding that the
appellant was a liar, and in considering this as an aggravating
factor; in failing to give sufficient regard to the principle of
totality; and in failing to consider the appellant&#146;s age and the
state of his health.</pre>
    <pre>[17] We see no basis upon which to interfere with the sentence
imposed.  Having regard to the gravity of the offences, the
number of victims, the number of years over which the abuse was
perpetrated and the impact of the offences on the family, the
total sentence imposed was not unfit. The trial judge expressly
considered all of the relevant factors and correctly emphasized
the need for general deterrence, specific deterrence, and
denunciation.</pre>
    <pre>E.   DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal
sentence is granted, but the appeal against sentence is
dismissed.
