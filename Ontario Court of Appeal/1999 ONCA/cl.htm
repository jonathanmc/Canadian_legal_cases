    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) V.  C.L. (Appellant)
               </pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        OSBORNE A.C.J.O., CATZMAN J.A. AND FARLEY J. (ad hoc)</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       James Lockyer
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               W. Graeme Cameron
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 18, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Gotlib J. and a jury on November 23, 1995.

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted on all three counts of sexually
related &#147;historical&#148; offences against his wife&#146;s sister, the
complainant. It was alleged that as a result of his sexual
intercourse with her in 1980 when she was under 14, she became
pregnant and had an abortion. The appellant appeals against his
conviction and requests a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in
directing the jury that &#147;there is some factual statement in [the
medical records filed at trial] which I caution you is hearsay
and is not evidence which you can consider if you take the
trouble to read the material&#148;. This reference was to an April 3,
1980 letter from Dr. Cowell at the Hospital for Sick Children
(where the complainant was taken by her mother once her condition
was known) to the Therapeutic Abortion Committee at Toronto
General Hospital. The first paragraph of the letter in support of
the abortion being performed at Toronto General states:

          [The complainant] is a 13 year old single
          girl who is at present in Grade VII. She
          presented to H.S.C. Teenage Pregnancy
          Counseling Service for consideration of
          termination of pregnancy resulting from a
          relationship with a 15 year old male of two
          years duration. (emphasis added)</pre>
    <pre>Given the appellant&#146;s age of 26, this reference would implicate
someone other than him. The appellant&#146;s trial counsel (not
counsel on appeal) has sworn that he did not read the contents of
the medical records, of which he had no disclosure prior to their
being entered as a trial exhibit by the trial Crown, and
therefore he did not raise or develop this potentially helpful
item at trial. The appellant contends that this failure amounted
to ineffective representation.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Given the passage of time, it appears that records at the
hospital relating to the pregnancy and abortion have become
untraceable, despite diligent effort. The appellant therefore
submits that it is appropriate to allow fresh evidence now
obtained to supplement and explain the context of Dr. Cowell&#146;s
letter. Lastly, the appellant submits that it is in the interest
of justice that this letter and the further evidence related to
it be admitted on appeal for the truth of their contents.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The complainant testified that she had been a virgin before
the appellant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
commencing less than a year before the abortion. She also stated
that when she advised her mother that she was pregnant, her
mother did not believe her when she identified the appellant as
the father. According to the complainant, her mother accompanied
her to the hospital and &#147;took care of everything&#148;. The
complainant stated that she told the hospital staff that the
appellant was the father because she felt guilty about it being
advanced at the clinic that &#147;it was like it was my fault.&#148; She
said that she made this revelation notwithstanding her mother&#146;s
instruction that she not identify the appellant as the father on
the basis that this would spoil his chance of staying in Canada
as an immigrant. In examination-in-chief the complainant
testified as follows:

          Q.   And did you explain at all who C.L. was as or was the matter &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I was told to leave the room and then my mother stayed in
               the room and then I was told to come back in.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Who told you to leave the room?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   My mother and everybody. When I told them it was C.L., they
               just looked at each other and I was sent out of the room. I don&#146;t
               know who told me, but I was told to leave the room.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Was the matter addressed again when you returned to the
               room?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   No, we just talked about what was going to happen.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The complainant&#146;s mother testified that she had no knowledge
of the abortion until after it was performed and that she had not
signed any hospital documents notwithstanding their face.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In her charge to the jury, the judge stated:

          There is in the hospital documents a letter
          to the Therapeutic Abortion Committee from
          one of the doctors asking permission to do a
          therapeutic abortion on this child. She was
          then 13. There is some factual statement in
          there which I caution you is hearsay and it
          is not evidence which you can consider if you
          take the trouble to read the material. If you
          do not, that is fine because there is
          nothing else in there to trouble you. We know
          she had an abortion. The issue is who
          fathered the fetus and that is what we are
          here to decide today. (emphasis added)</pre>
    <pre>There was no further reference in the charge to this letter.
Counsel did not raise the subject in commenting upon the charge.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In cross-examination the defence suggested to the
complainant that her stepfather may have caused her pregnancy.
          Q.   I&#146;m suggesting to you that it wasn&#146;t C.L. and it could have
               been someone else.
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   It couldn&#146;t have been anyone else. He was the only one who
               was &#150; who had intercourse with me.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Appellant&#146;s trial counsel has sworn that if he had been
alert, he:
          &#133; would have taken steps to put it before the
          jury in an admissible form by calling Dr.
          Cowell as a witness. I would also have argued
          that the record itself was admissible, as a
          business record, for the truth of its
          contents whether or not I was able to locate
          Dr. Cowell. I likely would have requested
          that the complainant be re-called for the
          purpose of cross-examining her on the
          information contained in the letter.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Dr. Cowell has been cross-examined on her affidavit. She
explained the procedure which the complainant would have
encountered in 1980 when she attended the Hospital for Sick
Children to obtain an abortion. She advised that attendance at
the Teen Clinic would involve multiple interviews by nurses and a
doctor in an intense process. She indicated:

          These kids, at that age, would raise a
          certain amount of concern. And I can say for
          sure that they got a tremendous amount of
          supportive therapy, as well as extracting
          information and looking into any of the
          social factors of importance. (emphasis
          added)</pre>
    <pre>Further, Dr. Cowell noted that the complainant would have been
separated from any accompanying adult because
          &#133; if you want the truth, that&#146;s the only way
          you&#146;ll really get at it, to separate the
          parent and the child, if it&#146;s a touchy
          situation. (emphasis added).</pre>
    <pre>[10] As to her April 3, 1980 letter, Dr. Cowell stated that she
might or might not have had direct dealings with the complainant.
With the passage of almost two decades and the missing records,
her advice is not surprising; what would have been surprising is
if she had been able to recall in such circumstances. She stated
that the author of such a letter may review the notes made in the
records by the professional interviewers and then condense these
notes into a &#147;one-liner&#148;. However, she acknowledged that she
&#147;really wouldn&#146;t care whether the mother said it or the daughter
said it, because that&#146;s the information I&#146;m given and I accept
it&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In her 1998 interview with police, the contents of Dr.
Cowell&#146;s letter were raised and the complainant stated that she
had no idea where this information came from as to her pregnancy
resulting from her having a two year relationship with a 15 year
old boy and that she had not been sleeping with any boys. The
interview contained the following:

          Complainant:     &#133; my mother took me to Sick
                      Kids Hospital. We went through
                      Admission and then went up and I
                      had to give blood and urine test
                      and stuff. Then we spoke to a
                      doctor. I assumed it was a
                      doctor. She asked me what
                      happened. I broke down and
                      started crying and I told her
                      that C., my sister&#146;s husband had
                      gotten me pregnant.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Police Officer:  Was your mother present
                      during this meeting?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Complainant:     Yes, yes, she was. Um. My
                      mom became a little upset and she
                      need to speak to the doctor
                      alone, so I went out of the room.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      I assume they spoke.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Then I was called back into the
                      room. The doctor then told me
                      what they, what was going to
                      happen to me and that the &#150; to
                      make sure that these kind of
                      things don&#146;t happen to me again.
                      And I spoke to the doctor alone
                      also and she asked me exactly
                      what had happened. And I told her
                      about C.L. and that we were not
                      supposed to let anyone know
                      because he had to get landed and
                      he was P.&#146;s husband and stuff
                      like that.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      And then after that, after the
                      appointment with the doctor we
                      came back to the Toronto General
                      Hospital with my mom one morning.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>[Referring to an appointment at the Hospital for Sick Children
after the abortion]</pre>
    <pre>          Complainant:     And she just wanted to make
                      sure that I wasn&#146;t still having
                      contact around C.. I told her I
                      was staying away from them.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Police Officer:  Did you tell them that it
                      was in fact C.L. who got you
                      pregnant?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Complainant:     Yes I did and um they just
                      wanted to be sure that I wasn&#146;t
                      around them any more.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Police Officer:  When you attended Toronto
                      Sick Kids Hospital they only
                      spoke to their in regards to it
                      and their concern was?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Complainant:     That I wasn&#146;t around C.L. any
                      longer.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Police Officer:  Everyone was aware who C.L.
                      was?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Complainant:     Yes. I had told them it was
                      my sister&#146;s husband.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[12] Dr. Cowell in cross-examination advised that, if in any
interview the complainant had mentioned the appellant as being
the father, this would have been a reportable serious offence
with an encumbent duty upon the interviewer to report it to the
appropriate authorities including the police.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The Crown&#146;s position in this appeal is that there is a
narrow issue as to whether the failure of the appellant&#146;s trial
counsel to avert to the contents of Dr. Cowell&#146;s letter
occasioned a miscarriage of justice. He states that the appellant
is obliged to satisfy two essential preconditions:

     (a)  that Dr. Cowell&#146;s letter contains admissible evidence; and
     (b)  that defence counsel&#146;s lapse was of sufficient magnitude in
          the context of this case that there is a real or reasonable
          probability that the jury&#146;s verdict would have been different.

As Doherty J.A. stated at p.64 of R. v. Joanisse (1995), 102
C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont.C.A.):

          A reasonable probability lies somewhere
          between a mere possibility and a likelihood.
          (In this context, I make no distinction
          between a &#147;reasonable probability&#148; and a
          &#147;reasonable possibility&#148;: see R. v. Garofoli,
          supra at p.152). A reasonable probability is
          established when the reviewing court is
          satisfied that because of counsel&#146;s
          incompetence, the verdict cannot be taken as
          a reliable assessment of the appellant&#146;s
          culpability.</pre>
    <pre>[14] We are of the view that the hospital records, including Dr.
Cowell&#146;s letter, were admissible as business records made in the
ordinary course of the hospital&#146;s business by those charged with
the responsibility for making such records: see s.30 Canada
Evidence Act. See also R. v. Monkhouse (1987), 61 C.R. (3d) 343
(Alta. C.A.) where the Court stated at pp.350-1:</pre>
    <pre>          An even earlier modification of the common
          law rules may be seen in a decision in the
          Supreme Court of Canada in Can. Atl. Ry Co.
          v. Moxley (1889), 15 S.C.R. 145. That case
          held that the person originally recording the
          event need not himself have direct personal
          knowledge of the event recorded. It was held
          to be sufficient if the person who has a duty
          to do and record the act. &#147;causes&#148; a record
          to be made by an agent. This case, too, was
          cited by Mr. Justice Hall in Ares v. Venner.
                              &#133;
          These hearsay records are not to be accepted
          in evidence merely to avoid the inconvenience
          of identifying a witness or because many
          witnesses would be involved, or even because
          otherwise no evidence would be available.
          Rather, they can be admitted only if they
          have come into existence under circumstances
          which make them inherently trustworthy. Where
          an established system in a business or other
          organization produces records which are
          regarded as reliable and customarily accepted
          by those affected by them, they should be
          admitted as prima facie evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
Given the evidence of Dr. Cowell in cross-examination on her
affidavit, it appears reasonable to conclude that it would be
likely that the complainant would have been interviewed
separately from her mother as to the identify of the father,
especially when the interviewers were under a duty to report a
case of this nature if the father were not indicated to be a 15
year old youth. The separate interview was corroborated by the
complainant in her 1998 police interview. However, it is
unfortunate there is no longer available the original notes on
which Dr. Cowell relied to make her statement that the
complainant&#146;s &#147;pregnancy result[ed] from a relationship with a 15
year old male of two years duration&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Even if Dr. Cowell&#146;s letter is not regarded as a business
record, hearsay evidence is admissible if the criteria of
necessity and reliability have been met: See R. v. Khan (1990),
59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.); R. v. Smith (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d)
257 (S.C.C.); R. v. Hawkins (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.);
R. v. B (K.G.) (1993), 19 C.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). We are of the
view that it would be unrealistic to expect hospital personnel to
recall the specific event in question, given that they would deal
with teenage pregnancies and abortion requests on a daily basis
and therefore the criterion of necessity is met. As a result of
interviews, it appears that it was recorded (as distilled by Dr.
Cowell in her ordinary course of business procedure in reviewing
such records to provide the responsible committee at the
performing hospital with the background information and reasons
in support of the abortion) that a 15 year old boyfriend had been
the father. No one on the interview team would have any reason
not to faithfully record what had been said; further no reason
for anything contrary to that was conjectured. Falsely recorded
information would be cause for disciplinary action and even
possible criminal compliant. It would appear to us that the
distillation of those records into a &#147;one-liner&#148;, given
Dr. Cowell&#146;s responsibilities in writing such a letter, would be
reliable.</pre>
    <pre>[16] We are of the view that if appellant&#146;s trial counsel had
been alert to the contents of Dr. Cowell&#146;s letter which would be
of exculpatory assistance to the appellant, then counsel would
have been justified in requesting an adjournment to interview Dr.
Cowell and to obtain further information of the sort now sought
to be introduced as fresh evidence. That he did not do so appears
to be pure inadvertence as opposed to any tactical decision on
the part of the defence. This difficulty was compounded by the
trial Crown not giving disclosure of this letter well prior to
trial and in fact by her merely putting it in as an exhibit with
other hospital records at trial, plus the trial judge, without
any debate by counsel, declaring to the jury that &#147;some factual
statement&#148; in the letter was hearsay and should be ignored. While
the trial judge appropriately drew the jury&#146;s attention to: &#147;The
issue is who fathered the fetus and that is what we are here to
decide today&#148; she closed off a material avenue of exploration. It
appears that she ignored what a valuable tool that letter and its
reference to the pregnancy being as a result of an extended
relationship with a mid-teenager would be for the defence not
only as a base for effective cross examination but for the
searching out of cogent evidence of clinic procedures to present
the basis of a reasonable doubt. Given the nature of the charges
and their apparent interrelationship, together with the effect
pro (without the letter and other evidence) and con (with such
evidence) upon the complainant&#146;s credibility and vice versa for
the appellant&#146;s credibility, we are of the view that the
appellant was prejudiced on all three counts by lack of effective
counsel. Under these circumstances, while ordinarily the fresh
evidence would have been available for the appellant to make use
of at trial, his lack of effective counsel prevented that end. We
are therefore of the view that the fresh evidence may be
introduced as it is relevant to the issues at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[17] This fresh evidence, when taken with the evidence available
but deemed inadmissible at trial, could reasonably be expected to
have affected the result when credibility was obviously the main
issue at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[18] While the trial judge did tell the jury that the burden
rested with the Crown to prove the appellant&#146;s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt and that if they had a reasonable doubt, they
should acquit him, she did not charge the jury with either the
suggested wording at p.409 of R. v. W (D) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d)
397 (S.C.C.) nor did she give anything approximating its
equivalent. To this must be added the concern that the trial
judge spoke in terms of the two sides of the family being
polarized. In context this would reasonably appear to be a
reference to their testimony being in conflict, with direct
ramifications for credibility of both the complainant and the
appellant leading to a &#147;who do you believe&#148; analysis.</pre>
    <pre>[19] With respect to the appellant&#146;s issue that he was left to be
portrayed as a person of bad character, we would conclude that
objectively the appellant appears to be the author of his own
misfortune. That is not to endorse the treatment in the charge as
a model.  However he testified in such a way as to invite the
cross examination he received. It appears that he was consciously
