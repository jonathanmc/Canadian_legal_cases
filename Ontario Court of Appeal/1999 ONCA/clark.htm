    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  It is conceded that the trial judge erred in admitting the
statement of the witness Venneri to the police and in relying
upon it as proof of the truth of all of its contents. However,
the uncontested evidence conclusively established the elements of
the offence and the identification of the appellant as a
participant. In the circumstances, we will not interfere.

[2]  The appeal is therefore dismissed.

[3]  The appeal from sentence is dismissed as abandoned.</pre></td>
