               CORPORATION (Defendants/Cary Solomon, Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, GOUDGE and MacPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Maureen Whelton
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Glenn E. Cohen
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Cullity dated December
29, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge made three important findings:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the conduct of the appellant gave rise to an agency by
  estoppel as between the appellant and Carl Solomon thereby
  clothing Mr. Solomon with the apparent authority to act on the
  behalf of the appellant in the mortgage transaction;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the apparent authority extended to the authority to agree to
  the change in the term of the mortgage from five years to three
  years on December 14, 1992;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the approval of the variation on the mortgage term given by
  Mr. Solomon on December 14th to the lender extended to both the
  commitment letter and the mortgage documents and authorized
  changing both to provide for a term of three years instead of
  five.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[2]  Counsel submits that where a third party relies on agency by
estoppel to attribute the conduct of a solicitor to another, the
third party must establish an actual client-solicitor
relationship between the solicitor and the other person as
evinced by a formal retainer.
[3]  We disagree.  The doctrine depends, not on the actual
relationship which exists between the parties, but on the way the
relationship is represented to third parties.  Agency by estoppel
does not create obligations as between the &#147;principal&#148; and
&#147;agent.&#148;  In this case, the appellant could not rely on the
doctrine to impose solicitor-like obligations on Mr. Solomon.
Agency by estoppel serves only to prevent the &#147;principal&#148; (the
appellant) from denying the agency relationship where his conduct
has reasonably led the third party (the respondents) to believe
that the relationship existed.  The doctrine runs between the
&#147;principal&#148; and third parties and not between the &#147;principal&#148; and
the person found to have apparent authority to act on behalf of
the &#147;principal.&#148;
[4]  The evidence supported the findings made by the trial judge.
There was ample evidence to support his conclusion that Mr.
Solomon&#146;s apparent authority extended to authorizing the change
in the term of the mortgage.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
