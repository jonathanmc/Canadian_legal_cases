    <pre>               M. David Lepofsky, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Forestell J., sitting
with a jury, dated February 20, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his convictions for sexual assault,
sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching.  He makes
three submissions in support of his appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>1) The trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury that
   the evidence of &#147;mooning&#148; and &#147;nude swimming&#148; was
   evidence of propensity and could   not be used to convict
   the appellant</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We are not persuaded that the absence of a charge on this
evidence prejudiced the appellant.  The evidence came on the
first day of trial.  Defence counsel did not ask for a mistrial
and then declined the trial judge&#146;s offer to instruct the jury
not to use the evidence.  Moreover, defence counsel conceded that
the evidence of mooning was innocuous and made a tactical
decision to use the evidence of nude swimming to attack the
credibility of one of the complainants.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Further, at the end of the trial, the defence did not
request that the jury be charged on this evidence, presumably so
not to highlight it.  And the defence did not object to the
failure of the trial judge to refer to this evidence in his
instructions to the jury.  This ground of appeal fails.
</pre>
    <pre>2) The trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury on
   reasonable doubt
     </pre>
    <pre>[4]  In one passage of his charge, the trial judge erred in his
instruction on reasonable doubt.  His charge at p. 384 of the
transcript did not accord with R. v. W.D., [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.
Earlier in his charge, however, he had given a correct
instruction on reasonable doubt.  Moreover, following the
erroneous instruction and immediately after a specific review of
the evidence, the trial judge gave a generally correct W.D.
charge.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  After the jury had deliberated for some time, they asked for
assistance on the meaning of reasonable doubt.  The trial judge
then recharged the jury in terms that the appellant acknowledges
met the requirements of W.D.  If the jury had any confusion on
reasonable doubt, we think that this recharge would have cleared
up the confusion.  Looking at the charge as a whole, therefore,
we are not persuaded that the jury was misled on the burden or
standard of proof.  This ground of appeal also fails.
</pre>
    <pre>3)   The trial judge erred in his charge on similar fact evidence
     </pre>
    <pre>[6]  The Crown had strong similar fact evidence because, as the
appellant acknowledges, there was no evidence or even allegation
of collaboration or collusion among the five complainants.  In
that context, although the trial judge&#146;s charge on similar fact
evidence was not as clear as it might have been, we think it was
adequate.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge conveyed to the jury that they could use
this evidence solely for credibility and not for propensity, and
that they could only use the evidence on one count as evidence on
another if it met the test of &#147;substantial similarity&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  No argument was addressed to the use of the phrase
&#147;substantial similarity&#148; and we make no comment on its
appropriateness.  We decide this ground of appeal on the basis
the appellant did not complain about the use of the phrase.  He
does, however, argue that the trial judge did not give the jury
any guidance on what is meant by &#147;substantial similarity&#148;.
Although the trial judge did not clarify the term, he did at
least give some examples of pieces of evidence and invited the
jury to consider whether they were substantially similar.
Moreover, we note that defence counsel did not object to this
part of the trial judge&#146;s charge.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant also attacks another aspect of the trial
judge&#146;s charge on similar fact evidence.  In part of his charge,
the trial judge appeared to focus on the use of similar fact
evidence on the issue of the identity of the offender instead of
whether the individual counts had been proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Identity was not in issue and the appellant submits that
the jury may have been confused that this was an &#147;all or nothing&#148;
case, in other words, that they were required to convict on all
counts or acquit on all counts.

[10] The jury&#146;s actual verdict belies this submission because the
jury could not reach a verdict on two of the counts.  Moreover,
the trial judge correctly instructed the jury: &#147;You will consider
the evidence of each of the complainants in regard to the charges
that are alleged to have been committed against him.&#148;  The trial
judge then instructed the jury that they could not use evidence
on one count as similar fact evidence on another until they had
decided that the Crown had proved the one count beyond a
reasonable doubt.  This instruction was more favourable to the
defence than what is called for by the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s
subsequent decision in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321
(S.C.C.) but, for the purpose of this appeal, it shows that the
jury was told to consider each count separately.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Therefore, on balance, we think that the charge on similar
fact evidence was adequate.  However, we would, if required,
apply the proviso to any inadequacies because of the strength of
the Crown&#146;s case and the absence of any evidence of collusion.
Accordingly, we would not give effect to this third ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[12] For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed.  The non-publication ban shall remain in effect.</pre>
