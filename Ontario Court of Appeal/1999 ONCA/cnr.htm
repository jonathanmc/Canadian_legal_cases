    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc., appeals from the
judgment of MacFarland J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated
August 6, 1998.  MacFarland J. dismissed the appellant&#146;s motion
for an order (i) referring its dispute with the respondents
Canadian National Railway Company (&#147;CNR&#148;) and Grand Trunk Western
Railroad Incorporated (&#147;GTW&#148;), to arbitration pursuant to article
8 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
Arbitration, being a schedule to the International Commercial
Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.9 (the &#147;ICAA&#148;), and (ii)
staying this action in whole or in part pursuant to s.8 of the
ICAA.</pre>
    <pre>Facts
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The parties agreed on the facts for the purposes of the
motion before MacFarland J. The appellant is a corporation
engaged in the design, construction and supply of tunnel
equipment, with its head office in Etobicoke, Ontario. The
respondent CNR is a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of
Canada and carries on business in the Province of Ontario as a
railway.  The respondent GTW is a company incorporated pursuant
to the laws of the State of Delaware.    The two remaining
respondents are wholly owned subsidiaries of CNR and were
incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Michigan.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  By contract dated March 13, 1992, the respondents CNR and
GTW entered into an agreement with the appellant for the purchase
of a soft ground earth pressure balance tunnel boring machine
(the &#147;TBM&#148;).  The TBM was used in the construction of a railway
tunnel under the St. Clair river.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The contract:
     (a)  provides that the parties may refer any disputes under
     the contract to arbitration (s.11);
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  excludes all warranties, express or implied, except the
     warranties contained in the contract (s.25); and
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  contains an entire agreement clause providing that the
     contract comprises the entire contract and merges and supersedes
     all prior understandings and representations between the parties
     concerning the subject matter of the contract (s.27).</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Section 11 of the contract states as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.  DISPUTES
          </pre>
    <pre>               The parties may refer any dispute under
          this Agreement to arbitration, in accordance
          with Arbitration Act of Ontario [sic].
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[6]  On July 15, 1997, the respondents commenced this action
seeking $27,000,000 in damages from the appellant.  The statement
of claim alleges improper design, construction and manufacture of
the TBM, that the appellant breached the express and implied
terms of the contract, and it alleges negligence in relation to
the design, construction and manufacture of the TBM.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  By letter dated September 22, 1997, counsel for the
appellant wrote to counsel for the respondents advising that the
appellant elects to refer the dispute to arbitration in
accordance with the contract and asking if the respondents would
agree to that process or if it would be necessary to bring a
motion to stay the action.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Counsel for the respondents advised counsel for the
appellant that the respondents did not so agree and a motion was
therefore necessary.  As a result, the parties agreed that the
defendant should bring a motion on an agreed set of facts to have
the court determine whether the action should be stayed.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The respondents have also commenced actions arising out of
essentially the same facts, against insurers under two policies
of insurance.  The two actions arise out of a builders risk
policy (Superior Court of Ontario File No. 95-CU-91438) and a
subscription policy (Superior Court of Ontario File No. 94-CU-
81889).  Productions have not yet been exchanged in those actions
and discoveries have not yet commenced.</pre>
    <pre>[10]   There are additional entities that were involved in the
construction of the tunnel that may be added as parties to the
action between the respondents and the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>Issues
[11] The only issue on this appeal is whether the appellant was
and is entitled to a stay of this action, and an order referring
the matter to arbitration, by virtue of the dispute resolution
clause contained in the contract with the respondents CNR and
GTW. While the respondents in their factum submit that if there
is to be an arbitration it is governed by the Arbitration Act,
1991, S.O. 1991, c.17, and not the ICCA as submitted by the
appellant, it concedes that this is of no consequence to this
appeal because the effect of the relevant provisions of each of
the statutes is the same.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[12] It appears to me that the plain meaning of section 11 of the
contract is that either party to the contract may elect to have a
matter in dispute that is covered by the contract referred to
arbitration.  In this case, since the respondents had initiated
proceedings in the courts, the appellant was presented with a
choice between electing binding arbitration or acquiescing in the
respondents&#146; decision to resort to the courts.</pre>
    <pre>[13] To suggest otherwise is to render the clause surplusage.  As
the appellant points out, the parties to a dispute can always
refer the matter to arbitration if they can agree between
themselves to do so.  The respondents, on the other hand, submit
that the court would have to read &#147;may&#148; as &#147;shall&#148; to obtain the
result sought by the appellant.  However, this interpretation
would remove all choice.  The parties would be restricted to one
avenue of dispute resolution that might not in every case be to
the advantage of either.</pre>
    <pre>[14] In my view, the correct interpretation of the clause is that
&#147;parties&#148; means &#147;either party&#148;.  Thus either party may refer a
dispute to binding arbitration and arbitration then becomes
mandatory.  Failing such an election by one of the parties, the
matters in dispute can be resolved in the courts.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The respondents rely upon a decision of this court, Re
McNamara Construction of Ontario Ltd. and Brock University
(1970), 11 D.L.R. (3d) 513.  In that case, the construction
contract contained the following arbitration clause:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Article 44.  Arbitration
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the case of any dispute arising
          between the owner (or the architect acting on
          his behalf) and the contractor as to their
          respective rights and obligations under the
          contract, either party hereto shall be
          entitled to give to the other notice of such
          dispute and to request arbitration thereof;
          and the parties may with respect to the
          particular matters then in dispute agree to
          submit the same to arbitration in accordance
          with the applicable law of the place of
          building.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[16] At trial, Wright J. held that the clause provides a right to
give notice, but the parties must agree before the matter will be
submitted to arbitration.  Arbitration was not mandatory.  At p.
516, Wright J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I come back, then, to art. 44.  In my interpretation of it,
          all that it seems to do is to confer on either party the right to
          give notice.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The right to give notice is no right at
          all.  In free countries, enjoying free
          speech, every person has the right to give
          notice of anything he has in mind to anyone
          he cares to give it to, unless, of course,
          there be some specific law which clamps his
          mouth shut and denies the right.  Thus it is
          difficult to know what right the Master
          Builders of the Canadian Standard Form of
          Construction Contract were seeking to create
          in art. 44 of the general conditions with
          regard to notice.  If it has significant
          substance at all, it is a right to include
          arbitration of a dispute as something to
          consider, an item for an agenda, a timely
          reminder.
          </pre>
    <pre>               When the right to give notice is
          exercised, what practical effect has it?
          Article 44 says, after a pause for the
          mysterious semi-colon, that the parties with
          respect to the matters then in dispute &#147;may
          agree to submit the same to arbitration&#148;, but
          the parties are free to do this at any time
          and in any event and with regard to any
          disputed matter.  Although Mr. Kelsey did not
          put the well-meaning, ineffective character
          of art. 44 in this way, he, in opening,
          submitted that if the view of the respondent
          was right, art. 44 was void.  I do not think
          it is, although I have little respect for its
          power.  I think its function is merely to set
          the stage for the one-act play of arbitration
          for those who unite to prefer the homely
          intimacy of the private room and the
          &#147;friendly neighbourhood arbitrator&#148; to the
          dignity of the open Court and the detached
          Judge.  I cannot believe that the Master
          Builders of the Canadian Standard Form of
          Construction Contract intended that if only
          one of the parties wished arbitration about
          anything in connection with the contract,
          they could by virtue of art. 44 force it on
          an unwilling party.  Nor do I believe that
          these particular signatories gave, each to
          the other, an irrevocable right to
          arbitration by that section and that
          language.  All they sought to provide was a
          pathway to arbitration if both wanted it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[17] This court dismissed the appeal from the judgment of Wright
J.  At p. 518, Jessup J.A. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Reading arts. 11, 17, 24, 26, 39 and 44 of the agreement
          together, I think they evidence a design or scheme to induce the
          parties to, first of all, negotiate differences arising between
          them and, failing agreement on that level, to encourage them to
          negotiate with a view to expeditiously disposing of their dispute
          by arbitration; but in my view, viewing those clauses together,
          the parties have carefully avoided foreclosing the option of
          recourse to the Courts failing agreement at the two levels of
          negotiation which, as I see it, the contract contemplates.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[18] The language is quite different from that in the case in
appeal in that it was obligatory for the parties in McNamara to
serve notice of arbitration but permissive for them to agree to
proceed.  This was certainly the view of this court on appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The respondent takes the position that the parties to the
contract in appeal have set out the second part of the formula
and have treated the obligation to arbitrate as something to be
agreed upon in the event that either party raised the issue.  I
cannot agree.  I think the omission of the first step in McNamara
made clear that arbitration was not mandatory but elective on the
part of either of the parties. There is an abundance of English
authority where language that is less precise than what we are
dealing with here has been held to constitute an agreement to
submit disputes to binding arbitration.  See Hobbs Padgett &amp; Co.
(Reinsurance), Ltd. v. J.C. Kirkland, Ltd., [1969] 2 Lloyd&#146;s Rep.
547 (C.A.); Tritonia Shipping Inc. v. South Nelson Forest
Products Corporation, [1966] 1 Lloyd&#146;s Rep. 114 (C.A.); and
Mangistaumunaigaz Oil Production Association v. United World
Trade Inc., [1995] 1 Lloyd&#146;s Rep. 617 (Q.B. (Com. Ct.)).</pre>
    <pre>[20] In any event, there has been a significant change since 1970
and McNamara in the attitude of the courts and the legislature as
to the desirability of encouraging the resolution of disputes
between the parties other than by resort to the courts.  In Onex
Corp. v. Ball Corp. (1994), 12 B.L.R. (2d) 151 (Ont. Gen. Div.),
the issue was whether a dispute between the parties as to
rectification of a contractual term should be submitted to
arbitration or to the courts.  I endorse what was said by Blair
J. at p.158:
          </pre>
    <pre>               That law [the law of the Province of Ontario] also includes
          a relatively recent, and clear, shift in policy towards
          encouraging parties to submit their differences to consensual
          dispute resolution mechanisms outside of the regular court
          stream: see, Ontario Hydro, supra [Ontario Hydro v. Denison Mines
          Ltd., [1993] O.J. No. 2948 (Gen. Div.)]; Boart Sweden AB v. NYA
          Stromnes AB (1988), 41 B.L.R. 295 (Ont. H.C.); Rio Algom Ltd. v.
          Sammi Steel Co. (1991), 47 C.P.C. (2d) 251 (Ont. Gen. Div.); the
          Model Law [ICAA], art. 8; and the Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O.
          1991, c. 17.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I see nothing in the Agreement which
          excludes rectification from the arbitration
          process as a matter of principle or law.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Blair J. said further at p.160:
          </pre>
    <pre>               At the very least, where the language of the arbitration
          clause is capable of bearing two interpretations, and on one of
          those interpretations fairly provides for arbitration, the courts
          should lean towards honouring that option, given the recent
          developments in the law in this regard to which I have earlier
          referred: see also, Gulf Canada Resources Ltd./Ressources Gulf
          Canada Ltée v. Arochem International Ltd. (1992), 66 B.C.L.R.
          (2d) 113, 43 C.P.R. (3d) 390 (C.A.), at pp. 120-121.</pre>
    <pre>[22] The respondents also submit that we should not interfere
with the exercise of discretion by the motions judge in declining
to stay the action herein and cites the fact that there are other
parties that have a stake in the resolution of this dispute.  So
far as the exercise of discretion is concerned, in my opinion it
was exercised on a misreading of the arbitration clause.  There
may well be disputes between the respondent CNR, its subsidiaries
and the respondent GTW and further issues involving the
respective insurers of those parties.  However, they have nothing
to do with the liability if any of the appellant to the
signatories to its contract.  The fact that there are disputes as
to how any loss is to be born by third parties unrelated to the
appellant is yet another reason why the appellant should be
entitled to have its relatively discrete issue determined by
arbitration.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[23] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal is allowed,
the order of MacFarland J. is set aside and an order is made
referring this dispute as between the appellant and the
respondents CNR and GTW to arbitration pursuant to the
Arbitration Act and staying this action as provided in the
relevant provisions of that Act.  The appellant is entitled to
its costs here and below.</pre>
