    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellant, Angelina Codina, was tried in January
1997 before Mr. Justice Hoilett and a jury on an indictment
alleging that she:
          between the 1st day of March 1987, and the
          31st day of March 1987, both days inclusive,
          at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto,
          in the Province of Ontario, knowingly
          attempted to induce, aid, or abet Marguerida
          Borges to contravene a provision of the
          Immigration Act, S.C. 76-77, c. 52, as
          amended, to wit: Section 95(b) of the said
          Act, by telling the said Marguerida Borges to
          misrepresent a material fact to immigration
          officials, to wit: her status as a person
          applying to come into or remain in Canada, by
          counselling the said Marguerida Borges to
          falsely state that she had no remaining
          relatives in Portugal, her country of origin,
          thereby committing an offence contrary to
          section 95(m) of the said Act.</pre>
    <pre>[2]       On January 14, 1997, at the opening of trial, the
appellant unsuccessfully moved to quash the indictment as
disclosing no offence known to law.</pre>
    <pre>[3]       At the close of the Crown's case, the appellant moved
for a directed verdict and again was unsuccessful.</pre>
    <pre>[4]       On January 24, 1997, the jury found the appellant
guilty as charged. Subsequently, she was sentenced to a fine of
$5,000. The appellant appeals from her conviction and, if leave
is granted, from her sentence.</pre>
    <pre>[5]       This matter has a convoluted history. It stems from an
incident which occurred in March 1987. The appellant was
originally charged on an information virtually identical to the
indictment quoted above. She brought a motion before the
preliminary inquiry judge to quash the information as disclosing
no offence known to law. When this motion was dismissed, the
appellant moved before Farley J. in the Ontario Supreme Court to
prohibit the Crown from proceeding with charge. This, too, was
unsuccessful and a further appeal to this court was dismissed as
being without merit. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada was denied.</pre>
    <pre>[6]       When the preliminary inquiry commenced on June 4, 1992,
the appellant applied to stay the proceedings as an abuse of
process. This application was dismissed by the preliminary
inquiry judge and the appellant then applied to the Ontario Court
(General Division) for an order of prohibition. This was
dismissed by Campbell J. on July 20, 1992. The appeal from this
decision was rendered moot when the Crown obtained a direct
indictment on September 14, 1992 pursuant to s. 577 of the
Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[7]       Commencing on March 29, 1993, the appellant was tried
before Mr. Justice Whealy and a jury. She was convicted and
sentenced to six months' imprisonment.</pre>
    <pre>[8]       On January 3, 1995, this court allowed her appeal and
ordered a new trial. This decision is reported: R. v. Codina
(1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 311 (Ont. C.A.). The Crown's motion for
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. The
resulting new trial gave rise to the conviction and sentence
which the appellant now brings to this court.</pre>
    <pre>[9]       The basic facts relevant to this appeal are
straightforward. In 1987 the appellant was a lawyer whose
practice included immigration law. In mid-January of that year,
the appellant had a meeting in her office with her client
Marguerida Borges and her client's brother, Antonio Borges.
Ms. Borges was a citizen of Portugal but was in Canada on a
visitor's visa, visiting her brother who was a Canadian citizen.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Mr. Borges brought his sister to see the appellant to get
advice on how she might apply for permanent resident status in
Canada. At the meeting it was made clear that Ms. Borges had four
siblings remaining in Portugal, all of whom were married. It was
also made clear that her parents were deceased.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The core of the Crown's case against the appellant was the
allegation that she urged Ms. Borges not to tell immigration
authorities about the existence of her married siblings in
Portugal but to simply tell them that there were no remaining
family members there. The Crown further alleged that the
appellant knew that the information about the married siblings
was material to Ms. Borges' application to stay in Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The core of the appellant's defence was that she had not
done this but rather had advised Mr. Borges that his sister might
apply for permanent resident status pursuant to a policy of
Immigration Canada known as the &quot;Last Remaining Single Family
Member&quot; program.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Paragraph 3(a)(iii) of that policy reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          3).   Last Remaining Single Family Members
             </pre>
    <pre>             a)Special consideration on humanitarian and
             compassionate  grounds will be granted in all
             instances to the following last remaining
             family members:
             </pre>
    <pre>             iii)       a last remaining single brother
                 or sister, who meets statutory
                 requirements (health and background) and
                 whose parents are both deceased, and who
                 has a sibling or siblings residing
                 permanently in Canada;</pre>
    <pre>[14] In the appellant's view Ms. Borges qualified under this
policy because she was the only single, or unmarried, sibling
remaining in Portugal.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Against this backdrop the appellant makes a number of
arguments. I will deal briefly with these in the order in which
they were argued, save for the issue of materiality which I will
address last and at greater length.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Quash the Indictment as Disclosing no Offence Known to
Law</pre>
    <pre>[16] The appellant argues that the offence charged attempts to
combine the inchoate offences of attempt and inducing, aiding or
abetting thereby impermissibly extending the scope of criminal
liability. I disagree. The relevant subsections of the
Immigration Act, 1976, S.C.1976-77, c. 52 are as follows:
          95.  Every person who
               </pre>
    <pre>               (b)       comes into Canada or remains
               therein by use of a false or improperly
               obtained passport, visa or other
               document pertaining to his admission or
               by reason of any fraudulent or improper
               means or misrepresentation of any
               material fact;
               </pre>
    <pre>               (m)       knowingly induces, aids or
               abets or attempts to induce, aid or abet
               any person to contravene any provision
               of this Act or the regulations,
               </pre>
    <pre>               is guilty of an offence….</pre>
    <pre>[17] The indictment does no more than track the language of the
statute. In common parlance, the offence charged is that of
trying to persuade Ms. Borges to lie to immigration officials
about a material fact. Once this attempt occurs, the offence is
complete whether or not Ms. Borges acted upon the advice. I would
not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Direct a Verdict</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
dismissing her motion for a directed verdict because there was no
evidence of the essential elements of the offence charged. I
disagree. There was evidence on which a properly instructed jury
acting reasonably could convict. In particular, there was
evidence that the appellant instructed the Borges to lie to
immigration officials about their married siblings remaining in
Portugal and further, there was evidence from which it could be
concluded that this was a material fact for the application to
Ms. Borges of the Last Remaining Single Family Member policy.
This ground of appeal fails.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Instruct on the Issue of Counselling</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant argues that the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that counselling involves more than mere
passive communication of one's intention to have the offence
carried out and that this does not constitute an offence even if
its purpose is to have someone commit the offence.</pre>
    <pre>[20] I disagree. The Crown's theory was that the appellant, as
the lawyer for Ms. Borges, counselled her to lie to immigration
officials. There was no suggestion that the appellant passively
communicated this thought to her client. Rather, the defence was
that no such advice was given at all. The charge made clear to
the jury that to convict they must conclude that Ms. Borges was
instructed to make a false statement. It was entirely adequate in
this regard.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Instruct on Reliability and General Credibility</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellant argues that, given that the offence took place
over ten years prior to the trial and that the time lapse between
the offence and the initial statements taken by the police was
more than two years, a stronger cautionary instruction was
necessary. In my view, although it was done in the context of
putting the position of the defence, the charge adequately
directed the jury's attention to these factors and their impact
on both the reliability of witnesses and their general
credibility. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Review Evidence which Assisted the Defence</pre>
    <pre>[22] The appellant argues that the charge should have
specifically indicated that evidence from a lawyer associated
with the appellant tended to corroborate her evidence concerning
her interpretation of the immigration policy in issue. In my
view, this was not necessary. The evidence was indeed referred to
in the charge, albeit in the context of its minimal probative
value concerning what was said to the Borges. Taking the charge
as a whole, it left the jury with a sufficient understanding of
the facts as they related to the relevant issues.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Charge Correctly as to the Purpose of the Attendance
at the Immigration Office</pre>
    <pre>[23] Subsequent to meeting with the appellant, Mr. Borges was to
attend at the immigration office. The appellant argues that the
trial judge erred in describing the reasons for his attendance. I
disagree but in any event, given that the offence alleged was
complete at the conclusion of the meeting in the appellant's
office, Mr. Borges' subsequent conduct is of no moment. This
ground of appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>Unreasonable Verdict</pre>
    <pre>[24] This ground of appeal must also fail. It was open for this
jury, acting reasonably, to conclude on the evidence as it did.
Particularly, it was open to the jury to find that neither the
appellant's account of the meeting with the Borges nor any other
evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to the Crown's evidence
that the appellant counselled Ms. Borges to lie to immigration
officials about a material fact.</pre>
    <pre>Failure to Properly Instruct the Jury on whether the Alleged
False Statement was Material</pre>
    <pre>[25] The appellant argues that the trial judge fell into serious
error in his charge concerning the materiality of the alleged
misrepresentation. For the reasons that follow, I agree.</pre>
    <pre>[26] As I have indicated, the Crown's allegation was that the
appellant instructed Ms. Borges to lie to immigration officials
about the existence of her married siblings in Portugal, by
saying that she had no siblings remaining there. Hence, as part
of the actus reus of the offence the Crown was required to prove
that the existence of married siblings in Portugal was a material
fact for immigration officials in the processing of Ms. Borges'
application for permanent residence in Canada. Otherwise, the
appellant did not attempt to get Ms. Borges to lie about a fact
that was material. In addition, the Crown was required to prove
that the appellant knew this fact to be material, to satisfy the
mens rea needed for the offence.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The trial judge was properly alive to the materiality
requirement when, at the beginning of his description of the
issues, he charged the jury in general terms as follows:
               Members of the jury, the Crown has the
          burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt,
          as I earlier defined that term, each and
          every element of the indictment or the
          allegations contained in the indictment and
          the following are the particulars. The Crown
          has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable
          doubt that the accused counselled Ms. Borges
          to represent falsely to Immigration officials
          that she had no remaining relatives in
          Portugal, her country of origin. The Crown is
          also obliged to prove beyond a reasonable
          doubt that the fact relating to the existence
          of relatives in Portugal was a material fact.
          That the accused knew that the representation
          she counselled Ms. Borges to make was false
          and that when she so counselled Ms. Borges,
          it was her intention that the Immigration
          officials be misled. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28] The materiality of married siblings in Portugal required a
determination of the meaning to be given to the Last Remaining
Family Member program, particularly para. 3(a)(iii), in the
processing by immigration officials of the applications for
permanent residence of people such as Ms. Borges. Since the
program is neither a law nor a regulation, its interpretation is
not a question of law but rather one of fact for the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[29] The Crown tendered the program document in evidence but
called no evidence as to the meaning given to the policy by
immigration officials or the common understanding of the policy
in the legal profession. The appellant testified that in her view
an application under para. 3(a)(iii) of this program required
only that Ms. Borges have no remaining siblings in Portugal who
are unmarried. Hence, the existence of married siblings would be
immaterial. The Crown elicited evidence from a lawyer associated
with the appellant on the same subject. His interpretation was
that the policy required that the applicant be the last remaining
sibling in Portugal and also that the applicant be single. On
this reading, the existence of married siblings in Portugal would
be material.</pre>
    <pre>[30] In the appellant's first trial, her counsel appeared to
concede the materiality of the existence of married siblings in
Portugal. No such concession was made in her second trial or
before us.</pre>
    <pre>[31] On the appeal from the first conviction, this court had
occasion to make reference to this issue, albeit in the context
of its discussion of the state of mind required of the appellant
for conviction. In R. v. Codina, supra at 324-327, this court
made clear that the Crown was required to demonstrate that the
appellant knew that the misrepresentation which she was
counselling was a material fact. In the course of this
discussion, this court spoke of the actus reus required for this
element of the offence in the following language at 325:
               The appellant denied that she counselled
          Marguerida Borges to say that she had no
          relatives in Portugal. She also testified
          that, in her view of the policy, it was
          sufficient if the applicant had no remaining
          siblings in Portugal who were unmarried. We
          observe, with respect, that this is a
          reasonable reading of para. (3)(a)(iii) of
          the policy. Indeed, some might consider this
          to be its &quot;plain meaning&quot;.
          . . .
               If the policy had the meaning which,
          according to her evidence, the appellant
          thought that it had, the existence of married
          siblings in Portugal would not be material.
          Accordingly, there was a case to be made that
          it would not be a misrepresentation of a
          material fact to say that there were no
          relatives in Portugal.</pre>
    <pre>[32] In my opinion, it was essential that the charge make clear
that to convict the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that the existence of married siblings in Portugal was a
fact material to the processing of Ms. Borges' application under
the Last Remaining Family Member program and that the proper
meaning to be attached to para. (3)(a)(iii) of that program is
that contended for by the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The very general instruction on materiality quoted earlier
was followed by a specific charge in the context of the facts of
this case, where the trial judge said:
               It is common ground, members of the
          jury, that family reunification was the very
          essence of the Immigration policy under which
          the application was being submitted and as
          such the number of family members as well as
          their marital status may be viewed as an
          important fact concerning which those making
          decisions would need to be informed. That,
          however, members of the jury, is not decisive
          of the matter. What is important is the
          accused's state of mind and in that regard if
          the policy had the meaning, which according
          to her evidence, the accused thought that it
          had, then the existence of married siblings
          in Portugal would not be a material fact.</pre>
    <pre>[34] In my respectful opinion, this charge is erroneous in three
respects.</pre>
    <pre>[35] First, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the
materiality of the existence of married siblings in Portugal was
a matter of common ground. While the appellant resiled somewhat
in cross-examination from her assertion in chief that the
existence of married siblings in Portugal was not material, her
position through counsel was always that her interpretation of
the program document given in chief was the correct one. Unlike
the first trial, no concession was made as to materiality and,
indeed, as I have said, the trial judge in beginning his charge
indicated that the jury would have to address this issue.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Second, the charge does not assist the jury by setting out
the competing meanings of the program. Nor does it clearly
indicate to the jury that to convict it must be satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt that the existence of married siblings in
Portugal was a fact material to the application of Ms. Borges for
permanent resident status pursuant to this immigration policy.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Third, the charge is in error in suggesting that the
appellant's state of mind is important to the issue of
materiality. The latter speaks to the actus reus required for the
offence: was the existence of married siblings in Portugal in
fact material?  The former is relevant to the mens rea required
for the offence: did the appellant know that this was a material
fact?  The charge appears to have confused the two.</pre>
    <pre>[38] In my view, the charge in this regard constitutes a serious
misdirection on a crucial issue required to be decided by the
jury. The conviction must therefore be set aside.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The event giving rise to the charge took place well over
eleven years ago. The appellant has been prosecuted twice without
success. The charge, while important, is not among the most
serious. In the circumstances, it is appropriate that these
proceedings be stayed and I would so order.</pre>
