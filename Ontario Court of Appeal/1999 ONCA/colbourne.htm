    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Michael G. Bolan dated
November 10, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant (&#147;MTC&#148;) appeals the decision of Bolan J. in
which he found the respondents Ticknovich and MTC 75% and 25% at
fault respectively for damages for injuries sustained by the
respondent Colbourne in a motor vehicle accident.
[2]  The accident took place during a period of inclement weather
involving rain, freezing rain and snow.  The trial judge found
that a state of non-repair existed on the highway at the relevant
time.  He further found that MTC breached its statutory duty to
keep the highway in repair in that it failed to take steps to
eliminate the danger of ice on the highway which MTC knew or
ought to have known existed.
[3]  Numerous witnesses testified with respect to the dangerous
condition of the highway, difficulties experienced by drivers,
other accidents and as to the records and conduct of the
employees of MTC.  The conclusions of the trial judge that a
state of non-repair existed and that MTC was negligent in failing
to rectify this situation are reasonable and well supported by
the evidence.
[4]  The trial judge was consistent in his description of the
highway at the relevant time.   In the context of this case, the
trial judge found that the statutory duties of MTC and the
Ontario Provincial Police (&quot;O.P.P.&quot;) create different
obligations.  We agree.  The duty on MTC to inspect and sand as
found by the trial judge was amply anchored in the evidence.  We
see no basis to interfere with the conclusion  of the trial judge
that MTC was liable while dismissing the third party action
against the O.P.P.
[5]  The appellant also appeals the award of damages with respect
to the hourly rate used by the trial judge to calculate the loss
of income.  In our view, the amount used by the trial judge is
reasonable and supported by the evidence adduced at trial to the
effect that the respondent Dennis Colbourne would likely have
been promoted by his employer.
[6]  Essentially, this appeal is with respect to findings of fact
made by the trial judge.  We see no palpable and overriding error
which affected the trial judge&#146;s assessment of the facts.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
