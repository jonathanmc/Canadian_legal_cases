COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and CARL COLE
               (Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>COUNSEL:       Howard Borenstein, for the appellant
               D.D. Graham Reynolds, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 7, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of Grossi J., dated May 6, 1997 and
on appeal against the sentence imposed by Grossi J., dated June
17, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and
having in his possession the proceeds of crime.  He appeals
conviction and sentence.
[2]  There were a number of grounds of appeal raised but we
propose to deal with only one that in our view is dispositive of
the appeal in favour of the appellant. It relates to his
complaint as to the quality and kind of cross-examination that he
was subjected to by the Crown.
[3]  The appellant testified and, in his examination-in-chief,
denied that he was involved in the drug transaction that was the
subject matter of the charges against him. He explained that the
marked money found in his possession that was alleged to be the
proceeds of crime was given to him by his wife in order to permit
him buy baby clothes for his unborn child. However suspect this
explanation was, it did not call for the extended and repetitive
cross-examination by the Crown counsel at trial in which the
appellant was driven to state that the various Crown witnesses
who had testified in chief were lying.  Again he was asked as to
why his counsel did not put certain questions to the police
officers with respect to complaints which he made in the witness
box with respect to their treatment of him.
[4]  This was not an overwhelming case for the Crown by any
means. The cross-examination was too extended to have been
spontaneous and was clearly directed to calling on the appellant
to either accept the evidence of the police officers or
stigmatise them as liars.  There is n such onus on an accused
person. The prejudice and appearance of unfairness that is
engendered by this type of cross-examination, which this court
has consistently condemned, may well have tipped the balance
against the appellant.
[5]  We find it necessary to repeat again what was said by this
court in R. v. Arthur F., (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 470 at 471:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant also argues that the cross-examination of the
          appellant and other defence witnesses was improper and abusive
          and resulted in an unfair trial. We agree. The cross-examination
          of the appellant and his wife by Crown counsel was replete with
          improper questions. Both the appellant and his wife were asked
          time and again why the complainant would fabricate the
          allegations and were called upon to comment on the credibility of
          the complainant. These questions were not isolated instances but
          part of an obvious strategy that was both considered and
          deliberate. The prejudice to the appellant is obvious. Such
          questions put the parents of the complainant in the invidious
          position of having to call their own daughter a liar. More
          importantly, these questions suggested that there was some onus
          on the appellant and his witnesses to provide a motive for the
          complainant&#146;s testimony. This kind of examination undermines the
          fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence. This court
          has repeatedly held that this type of cross-examination is
          improper. We think it is unfortunate that Crown counsel persist
          in this kind of unfair questioning in the fact of the many
          judgments of this court that such questioning is improper.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               Unless and until Crown counsel stop this
          kind of improper and prejudicial cross-
          examination, this court will regrettably have
          to remit difficult and sensitive cases of
          this nature back for a new trial at great
          expense to the emotional well-being of the
          parties, not to mention the added burden to
          the administration of justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  It is not necessary under the circumstances for us to deal
with the appellant&#146;s complaints about the reasons of the trial
judge nor to deal with the Charter argument which on a new trial
may raise different factual issues from those in this record.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction below
is quashed and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
