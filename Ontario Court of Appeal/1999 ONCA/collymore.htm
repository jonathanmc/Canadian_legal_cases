    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of P.T. Matlow J. dated April 24, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>OSBORNE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondents were charged with conspiracy to import
cocaine, trafficking in cocaine and possession for the purpose of
trafficking in cocaine. On April 24, 1996 they were acquitted by
the Honourable Mr. Justice Matlow, sitting without a jury. Their
acquittal followed the trial judge&#146;s ruling on a voir dire which
generally concerned the admissibility of evidence (cocaine)
seized by Canada Customs. The Crown has appealed.</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The Crown contended that the respondents were part of an
agreement with an associate in Trinidad to receive envelopes from
Trinidad which were represented to contain documents, but in fact
contained cocaine. The respondent Collymore provided fictitious
names and addresses for the stated Canadian recipients of the
envelopes.
[3]  The role of the respondents Gayle and Nugent was to receive,
or pick up, the envelopes and give them to Collymore who was, in
turn, to transfer them to a person who he referred to as Larry.
None of Collymore, Gayle or Nugent claimed an ownership interest
in the envelopes or their contents. Nor did they profess to know
that the envelopes contained cocaine.
[4]  As it turned out, Canadian Customs cleared six 8-1/2 x 11
inch envelopes from Trinidad through Customs and a local courier
attempted to deliver them to the names and addresses indicated on
them. Since the names and addresses were fictitious, delivery
presented a problem. Thus, an employee of the courier company,
who was attempting to deliver one of the envelopes, opened the
outside courier envelope to see if the inner envelope revealed a
correct address. In doing so, the employee became suspicious and
revealed her suspicions to his superior who, in short order,
contacted Canada Customs. In the result, that envelope and five
other similar envelopes were returned to Customs, where on the
basis of information to which I will refer in more detail
shortly, Customs opened the envelopes. All envelopes contained
cocaine. In opening the envelopes, Customs&#146; employees purported
to act under a statutory authority provided by s. 99(1) of the
Customs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1.
[5]  At the beginning of the trial, the respondents sought to
exclude the evidence of the contents of the six envelopes that
Customs opened. They contended that Customs had breached their
constitutional right, found in s. 8 of the Charter, to be
protected from unreasonable search and seizure. After a voir
dire, the trial judge concluded that the respondents&#146; s. 8
Charter rights had been breached and that the admission of the
evidence (cocaine) would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. Thus, he excluded the evidence. The Crown proffered no
further evidence and the respondents were acquitted.</pre>
    <pre>     The Agreed Facts</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The s. 8 voir dire proceeded on the basis of an Agreed
Statement of Facts and viva voce evidence which generally
concerned the actions of the courier company and Canada Customs
employees. The significant facts are set out below.
[7]  On March 14, 1994, six 8-1/2 x 11 inch envelopes from
Trinidad were delivered by international courier to Canadian
Customs at Pearson International Airport. The envelopes cleared
Customs as &#147;documents.&#148;  They were to be delivered to the
addresses indicated on the envelopes by Elite Link International,
an Oakville courier company.
[8]  On March 14, 1994, an Elite driver tried to deliver one of
the envelopes.  He was unsuccessful in delivering the envelope
because the company listed on the air waybill was not at the
address indicated on the package. Consequently, he returned the
undelivered envelope to Elite&#146;s business premises.1
[9]  When the envelope was returned to Elite&#146;s office, Caroline
Haynes, an Elite employee, attempted to locate the addressee
company. She was not able to find a listing for either the
company or the name indicated on the envelope. She then partly
opened the envelope in an attempt to find another address inside.
She found no useful address related information. However, she
noticed that the envelope&#146;s inner contents were wrapped in sheets
of carbon paper. This aroused her suspicions.  In her evidence in-
chief, she put it in this way:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Usually with shipments or a pouch, there&#146;s an envelope
          inside, and in this case there was no envelope. It was just
          sheets of paper wrapped in carbon paper, and that&#146;s when I called
          Hugo to come, because my suspicion was aroused when it was
          wrapped in carbon paper. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               I had learned or heard from carbon
          paper, if something was wrapped in carbon
          paper, it would void an x-ray machine from
          seeing inside a parcel.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] Ms. Haynes reported her findings to Hugo Kamerling, the
President of Elite, who conducted his own inspection of the
envelope. He noticed that the contents &#147;felt like paste type of
substance definitely not documents.&#148; Mr. Kamerling&#146;s suspicions
were also aroused by the presence of the carbon paper. He said,
&#147;&#133; anybody knows that something shipped in carbon paper is to
hide the real nature of the package because it cannot be x-
rayed.&#148;2
[11] Because of his concerns about the contents of the envelope,
Mr. Kamerling contacted Julian Harris, a Revenue Canada employee
who was a Customs Superintendent at Pearson International
Airport. Kamerling told Harris about the specific envelope and
about other envelopes that were similarly suspicious in that they
were also undeliverable. After he spoke briefly with Mr.
Kamerling, Mr. Harris asked Mr. Kamerling to return the then
undelivered envelopes to Customs.
[12] Mr. Harris asked Mr. Kamerling to return the envelopes
because:
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the envelopes were undeliverable;
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the first envelope contained carbon paper, not documents as
          advertised.</pre>
    <pre>[13] As a result of his conversation with Mr. Harris, Kamerling
instructed his drivers to return all 6 suspicious envelopes to
Customs. These envelopes were similar in appearance and all came
from Trinidad via the same courier.
[14] Within a short time these envelopes including the envelope
that was first opened by the courier) were returned to customs.
In the end, six envelopes from Trinidad, all said to contain
documents, were returned to Customs and opened. The inner
contents of all six envelopes were wrapped in carbon paper and
all six envelopes contained cocaine.
[15] Mr. Harris testified that he thought he was authorized by
the Customs Act to examine the envelopes after they had cleared
Customs. In addition to the previously listed factors raising the
suspicions of the courier company, he noted that the envelopes,
said to contain documents, came into Canada duty and tax free.
Thus, if the contents were other than documents a different
duty/tax classification code might have to be applied and,
depending on the classification of the contents, duty and taxes
collected.
[16] Once preliminary testing revealed that all the envelopes
contained cocaine,3 the R.C.M.P. arranged a controlled delivery
of the envelopes. On March 15, 1994, Maxine Nugent attended at
the Elite courier premises. She told the constable that she was
there to pick up an envelope for S. Protech, Media Supplies Ltd.
The officer obtained an envelope with that address on it and
asked Ms. Nugent to print and sign her name where indicated.  She
printed and signed the name Dianne Williams and left with an
envelope addressed to Samuel Fullinton.
[17] Mr. Gayle came to Elite&#146;s office and asked for an envelope
for Complete Software. The constable asked him if he was Mr.
Correia. Mr. Gayle said yes. He was given the waybill and asked
to sign and print his name on it. He printed and signed the name
Carlos Carrara and took an envelope addressed to Carlose Correia.
[18] After that, Mr. Collymore arrived at Elite&#146;s office and
asked for the envelope for Transdate Limited. He was shown a
waybill and asked to print and sign his name on it. He printed
the name Patrick Belgrave, scribbled the signature and took
possession of that envelope.
[19] The waybills did not identify any of the respondents as the
intended recipients of the envelopes. There was no person able to
be identified as Samuel Fullinton, Carlos Carreia or Patrick
Belgrave, and Protech Media Supplies Limited, Complete Software
and Transdate Limited could not be located.
[20] All three respondents were arrested shortly after the
controlled delivery. At the time of his arrest the three
envelopes that were the subject of the controlled delivery were
found in the physical possession of Mr. Collymore.</pre>
    <pre>     The Ruling on the Section 8 Voir Dire</pre>
    <pre>[21] The trial judge accepted that Ms. Haynes, the courier
employee who opened the first envelope, did not act unlawfully.
However, he concluded that the Customs officer, Mr. Harris, &#147;&#133;
had no reasonable and probable grounds to believe, nor did he
actually believe, that any violation of the law had occurred in
relation to that parcel.&#148;  The trial judge acknowledged that
Mr. Harris was subjectively suspicious that the envelope which he
examined did not contain documents, contrary to what was stated
on the Customs documentation.
[22] The trial judge went on to find that:
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    Mr. Harris of Customs Canada had no lawful right to
          &quot;require&#148; the courier company to return any of the six parcels to
          Customs for further examination.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    Customs Canada had no statutory authority to examine any of
          the parcels, once they had cleared Customs, since Mr. Harris, the
          Customs Officer who &#147;ordered&#148; the return of the envelopes could
          not have &#147;suspected on reasonable grounds&#148; that any of offences
          contemplated by the statutute had occurred or might occur. Thus,
          the trial judge concluded that the search of the six envelopes
          was effected without a warrant and without statutory authority.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    The evidence (cocaine) was conscriptive evidence and its
          admission &#147;would result in unfairness to the accused.&#148;  The trial
          judge therefore excluded the evidence of what was found in the
          six envelopes under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in
reaching these conclusions.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[24] In my opinion, the Customs officers who opened the six
envelopes after they had cleared Customs, but before they were
delivered, did so in the exercise of the constitutionally valid
authority given to them by s. 99(1)(d) and (e) of the Customs
Act. My reasons for reaching that conclusion follow.
[25] I should state that in dealing with the issue whether the
Customs officers acted under a valid statutory authority, I have
assumed that all respondents had a sufficient privacy interest in
the relevant envelopes to engage their s. 8 Charter rights.
Whether the respondents had any expectation of privacy sufficient
to give them s. 8 Charter rights in the envelopes is an issue
that I need not, and do not, decide in light of my conclusion on
the scope of the authority provided by s. 99(1) of the Customs
Act.</pre>
    <pre>The Customs Act</pre>
    <pre>[26] Section 99(1) of the Customs Act, the section under which
the envelopes were opened, provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               99. (1) An officer may
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  at any time up to the time of
          release,4 examine any goods that have been
          imported and open or cause to be opened any
          package or container of imported goods and
          take samples of imported goods in reasonable
          amounts;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  at any time up to the time of
          release, examine any mail that has been
          imported and, subject to this section, open
          or cause to be opened any such mail that he
          suspects on reasonable grounds contains any
          goods referred to in the Customs Tariff, or
          any goods the importation of which is
          prohibited, controlled or regulated under any
          other Act of Parliament, and take samples of
          anything contained in such mail in reasonable
          amounts;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  at any time up to the time of
          exportation, examine any goods that have been
          reported under section 95 and open or cause
          to be opened any package or container of such
          goods and take samples of such goods in
          reasonable amounts;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  where the officer suspects on
          reasonable grounds that an error has been
          made in the tariff classification, value for
          duty or quantity of any goods accounted for
          under section 32, or where a refund or
          drawback is requested in respect of any goods
          under this Act or pursuant to the Customs
          Tariff, examine the goods and take samples
          thereof in reasonable amounts;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d.1)  where the officer suspects on
          reasonable grounds that an error has been
          made with respect to the origin claimed or
          determined for any goods accounted for under
          section 32, examine the goods and take
          samples thereof in reasonable amounts.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)  where the officer suspects on
          reasonable grounds that this Act or the
          regulations or any other Act of Parliament
          administered or enforced by him or any
          regulations thereunder have been or might be
          contravened in respect of such goods, examine
          the goods and open or cause to be opened any
          package or container thereof; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (f)  where the officer suspects on
          reasonable grounds that this Act or the
          regulations or any other Act of Parliament
          administered or enforced by him or any
          regulations thereunder have been or might be
          contravened in respect of any conveyance or
          any goods thereon, stop, board and search the
          conveyance, examine any goods thereon and
          open or cause to be opened any package or
          container thereof and direct that the
          conveyance be moved to a customs office or
          other suitable place for any such search,
          examination or opening. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[27] Section 99(1)(a), (b) and (c) authorize the examination of
goods (ss. (a) and (c)) and mail (ss. (b)) without a warrant and
without threshold grounds. These subsections are not in issue
here. Section 99(1)(d), (d.1), (e) and (f) all impose a &#147;suspect
on reasonable grounds&#148; threshold requirement.
[28] Section 99(1)(a) and (b) limit the right of Customs to
examine goods &#147;up to the time of release.&#148;  Section 99(1)(c)
limits the right of examination &#147;up to the time of exportation.&#148;
Conspicuously subsections (d) (d.1), (e), and (f) contain no
such, or similar, words of temporal limitation. It seems to me
that there is a message in this silence. In my view, Parliament
did not intend to limit Customs&#146; right to examine goods, for
example, &#147;to the time of release&#148; where any of subsections (d),
(d.1), (e), and (f) are engaged. See R. v. Multiform
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (1990), 79 C.R. (3d) 390 (S.C.C.);
Dreidger on The Construction of Statutes 3d. ed. Butterworths
Canada Ltd.1994, at 168-172.
[29] Section 99(1)(d) authorizes the examination of goods and
taking samples, where an officer &#147;suspects on reasonable grounds&#148;
that an error has been made in &#147;tariff classification.&#148;  Section
99(1)(e) is more general. It permits an officer to &#147;examine the
goods and open or cause to be examined any package &#133;&#148; if the
officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the Customs Act or
any other Act administered or enforced by the officer have been
or might be contravened.</pre>
    <pre>Constitutionality of s. 99(1)</pre>
    <pre>[30] The respondents provided a notice of constitutional question
as required by s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. 43. As the constitutional issue was framed, the respondents
challenge the constitutionality of warrantless searches and
seizures of goods that had cleared Customs (post-release goods).
Looked at broadly, the respondents&#146; position is that s. 99(1)
should be read down so as to require that the post-release
examination of goods be done &#147;only with prior authorization and
upon reasonable and probable grounds.&#148;  This would replace the
existing &#147;suspects on reasonable grounds&#148; standard now found in
s. 99(1)(d) and (e).
[31] I see no basis upon which to conclude that s. 99(1) as it
now stands does not survive constitutional scrutiny. See R. v.
McKay et al (1992), 134 A.R. 188 (Alta. C.Q.B.). It must be
emphasized that the search in this case took place before the
envelopes had been delivered. In the circumstances, it is
therefore not necessary to consider Customs post-release search
rights in the context of goods that have been delivered.
[32] In determining whether a seizure and search without warrant
was justified in these circumstances, the controlling principles
are set out in Chief Justice Dickson&#146;s judgment in  R. v. Simmons
(1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 296 (S.C.C.). In Simmons, a border
personal search case, Dickson C.J. recognized that border
crossings present special circumstances for purposes of a s. 8
Charter analysis. See also R. v. Monney (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d)
129 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Jacques (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.). In Simmons, Dickson C.J. referred to the state&#146;s
interest in securing its borders in these terms at pp. 320-321:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    I accept the proposition advanced by the Crown that the
          degree of personal privacy reasonably expected at Customs is
          lower than in most other situations. People do not expect to be
          able to cross international borders free from scrutiny. It is
          commonly accepted that sovereign states have the right to control
          both who and what enters their boundaries. For the general
          welfare of the nation the state is expected to perform this role.
          Without the ability to establish that all persons who seek to
          cross its borders and their goods are legally entitled to enter
          the country, the state would be precluded from performing this
          crucially important function. Consequently, travellers seeking to
          cross national boundaries fully expect to be subject to a
          screening process. &#133; Physical searches of luggage and of the
          person are accepted aspects of the search process where there are
          grounds for suspecting that a person has made a false declaration
          and is transporting prohibited goods.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In light of the existing problems
          in controlling illicit narcotics trafficking
          and the important government interest in
          enforcing our Customs laws, and in light of
          the lower expectation of privacy one has at
          any border crossing, I am of the opinion that
          ss. 143 and 144 of the Customs Act [now s.
          98] are not inconsistent with s. 8 of the
          Charter. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[33] From the passage quoted above it is apparent that Dickson
C.J. recognized a state interest in not only who, but also what,
crosses Canada&#146;s borders. For purposes of this case, it seems to
me that the same principles and logic apply to s. 99(1) of the
Customs Act, which gives &#147;an officer&#148;5 authority to examine
goods, mail, a conveyance or a container at Canada&#146;s borders.
[34] In Simmons, Dickson C.J. also accepted that border searches
of both persons and goods were of a sufficient national
importance to justify departure from the Hunter v. Southam
standards. Looked at generally, the examination, or search, of
unaccompanied goods is manifestly less intrusive than a personal
border search. I see no basis upon which to reject Parliament&#146;s
&#147;suspects on reasonable grounds&#148; standard, particularly as it
relates to the circumstances presented here.</pre>
    <pre>The Threshold Test</pre>
    <pre>[35] There remains to be considered the issue whether the Customs
Officers suspected on reasonable grounds that there had been an
error in tariff classification (s. 99(1)(d)) or that there had
been a contravention of the Customs Act or, in the circumstances
here, the Narcotics Control Act (s. 99(1)(e)).
[36] In response to Mr. Harris&#146; request, Mr. Kamerling, the
president of the courier company, returned the envelope to Canada
Customs shortly after 3:00 p.m. on March 14th. The enveloped that
was returned was described as a &#147;courier envelope.&#148;  The envelope
contained the importer&#146;s name and address and the address of the
sender. The sender was noted as high-Tech, Port of Spain,
Trinidad. Mr. Harris testified that Trinidad was regarded as a
source country for illegal drugs.
[37] When asked what Mr. Kamerling told him, Mr. Harris said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               When I say suspicious, he told me that his suspicions had
          been aroused by the fact that he couldn&#146;t deliver this envelope,
          and that it had carbon paper &#150; when &#150; I presume that it had been
          opened to some extent, that he found carbon paper on the inside.
          That to the best of my recollection, is his conversation to me
          and he said that he was suspicious of a package he basically
          didn&#146;t like, you know. He felt that it was something other than
          what it was described as.</pre>
    <pre>[38] Against that general background the envelope was opened. Mr.
Harris found another envelope wrapped in carbon paper inside the
courier envelope. The second or inner envelope contained a white,
powdery substance. Its contents tested as cocaine.
[39] As I have noted, when Mr. Harris requested the return of the
envelopes to Customs, and later caused the envelopes to be
opened, he knew that:
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    there were delivery problems, with respect to one of the
       envelopes.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the envelope first examined by the courier employee
       contained an inner envelope that was wrapped in carbon paper.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the envelope first opened did not appear to contain
       &#147;documents,&#148; contrary to what was stated on the Customs
       documentation.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The first envelope that Customs opened was not the envelope
that Elite Courier had opened. Another envelope, which was
already out for delivery, was the first envelope returned and
opened by Customs. In causing the envelopes to be opened
Mr. Harris thought that he had authority to examine them under s.
99(1) of the Customs Act. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; that number 99 has lots of sub-headings, but basically
          authorizes Customs inspectors to open goods that come into
          Canada, and the first heading it&#146;s before release, but there are
          sub-headings that apply after release &#133; I believe that its 1(d)
          that would give authority to go ahead and examine goods that have
          already been imported into Canada. &#133; I feel that if goods had not
          been delivered, if the goods were in limbo, as I felt they were,
          if we didn&#146;t know what the goods were inside, if there was a
          question as to what they were, that they had not been delivered,
          that they are, perhaps undeliverable, I felt that it was in my
          realm of power as a Customs superintendent to ask to bring those
          back.</pre>
    <pre>[41] The trial judge accepted that the courier employee did
nothing wrong in examining the envelope to obtain a better
address for delivery. He also accepted that the courier employee
had &#147;reason to be suspicious&#148; and that he was reasonably
suspicious whether the contents of the envelope were documents,
as stated. However, the trial judge went on to conclude that when
the Customs official (Mr. Harris) was told about the courier&#146;s
reasonable suspicions he did not have a right to require the
return of the envelope. This, in my view, is not an issue in this
case since the courier was in no way compelled by Customs to
return the envelopes to Customs. As the trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; what occurred here was no longer a border search as the
          parcel had already been released by Canada Customs and the local
          courier had been authorized to deliver it to its receiver.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The trial judge found that the Customs officials who gave
evidence lacked knowledge of their statutory right to examine the
envelopes. He concluded that they acted on instinct and
expediency rather than on a clear appreciation of their limits
and powers set out in the Customs Act. As the testimony quoted
above illustrates, the Customs official was, in fact, generally
aware of his statutory authority to examine the envelopes. He
specifically referred to s. 99 in his evidence.
[43] When the trial judge considered the provisions of s. 99(1)
of the Customs Act, he concluded that goods could be examined
following their release &#147;where an officer suspects on reasonable
and probable grounds that one or more specified things had
occurred or might occur.&#148;  He thus accepted the statutory
threshold &#150; suspects on reasonable grounds and the Crown&#146;s
contention that some goods may be examined &#147;following their
release.&#148;  Nonetheless, in what seems to be a contradictory
statement, he then concluded that there was no statutory
provision &#147;that authorizes post-release examinations.&#148;  He went
on to find that six envelopes were opened without statutory
authority. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have not been referred to any provision that authorizes
          post-release examinations. It is my conclusion that the senior
          Custom official who ordered the return of the parcels and
          subsequent opening by another Customs official did not and could
          not reasonably have &#147;suspected on reasonable grounds&#148; that any of
          those things contemplated by the statute had occurred or might
          occur. It follows, therefore, that the opening of the six parcels
          by Canada Customs was done without statutory authority and
          constituted a warrantless search.</pre>
    <pre>[44] In the passage quoted above, the trial judge seems to have
proceeded on the basis that there was no statutory provision that
authorized the post-release examination of goods. This seems to
be inconsistent with his earlier finding that s. 99(1) did
provide for post-release examination of goods in certain
circumstances. In any event, it seems to me to be clear from the
language chosen by Parliament that post-release examinations are
authorized by s. 99(1)(d) and (e). The threshold requirement
(suspect on reasonable grounds) is low and was met in this case.</pre>
    <pre>Section 24(2)</pre>
    <pre>[45] Before concluding I should make brief reference to the trial
judge&#146;s finding on the issue whether the evidence (cocaine)
should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The trial judge
did not refer the factors set out in Collins v. The Queen (1987),
33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). His reasons indicate that he excluded
the evidence on the basis that its admission would result in
unfairness to the accused. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               it is my view that to permit the Crown to tender into
          evidence against the accused what was discovered by the opening
          of the parcels would bring the administration of justice into
          disrepute and that the evidence ought to be excluded.  Had the
          parcels not been opened as they were, it is unlikely that the
          contents of the parcels would have been determined in any lawful
          way by any person in authority. The section 24(2) test requires a
          careful balancing of competing objectives in the administration
          of justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; To allow the challenged evidence to be
          tendered would countenance a violation of the
          Charter rights of the accused and would
          result in unfairness to the accused in their
          present trial. I am persuaded that their
          right to a fair trial must prevail and that
          the evidence must be excluded.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[46] The respondents accept that the trial judge did not apply
the correct test in his s. 24(2) analysis. As Cory J. stated in
R. v. Stillman (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) if the
accused was not compelled to participate in the creation or
discovery of the evidence (that is if the evidence existed
independently of the Charter breach in a form usable by the
state), the evidence will be classified as non-conscriptive. The
admission of evidence which falls into this category will, as
stated in Collins, supra, rarely operate to render the trial
unfair. If the evidence has been classified as non-conscriptive
the court should move on to consider the second and third Collins
factors, namely, the seriousness of the Charter violation and the
effect of the exclusion on the repute of the administration of
justice. Because I think there must be a new trial, I propose to
say nothing more about the s. 24(2) issue beyond simply noting
that the trial judge did not follow the correct path in dealing
with it.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[47] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
verdicts of acquittal and direct that there be a new trial.
</pre>
    <pre>&#147;C. Osborne J.A.&#148;   I agree:  J. Brooke J.A.  I agree:  S. Goudge J.A.
