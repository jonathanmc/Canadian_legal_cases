      <pre>On appeal from the Order of Madam Justice Greer dated November 20, 1998
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The  appellants appeal the order of Greer J. (the  &quot;motions
judge&quot;)  finding them in contempt of court and ordering  them  to
pay monies into court.
[2]  On June 17, 1998, counsel for the appellants (defendants in
the action) gave an undertaking, reduced to an endorsement by
Ferrier J., not to close any &quot;transaction&quot; relating to the action
without first giving the respondent (plaintiff) sufficient notice
to enable the respondent to raise the matter in the injunction
motion before the court.  There is no dispute that the
endorsement of Ferrier J., subsequently refined by agreement of
counsel, contained an undertaking not to take certain actions
without notice to the respondent.
[3]  Subsequently, alleged &quot;transactions&quot; were closed without
notice to the respondent that changed the intended status quo of
the action.
[4]  When the matter was heard before the motions judge, counsel
for the appellants did not at any time request a trial with
respect to the issue of contempt.  On the contrary, it was
specifically agreed between counsel that the motion would proceed
on the record before the court (Respondents' Appeal Book, Tabs A
and B).
[5]  It is beyond dispute that &quot;transactions&quot; closed on August 5,
1998, with the participation and knowledge of the appellants.
The documents speak for themselves.  More specifically, it was
open to the motions judge to find that Tevana Traders Corp. was a
participant in the events of August 5, 1998.  No notice was
provided as undertaken by counsel for the appellants.  The
finding of the motions judge that Sasha Starr, Rubin Schindermann
and Tevana Traders Corp. were in contempt of the order of
Ferrier J. is amply supported by the evidence.
[6]  No proper basis was advanced for the admission of fresh
evidence.
[7]  In the final analysis, we see no error in the conclusion of
the motions judge that the transactions were in contempt of the
undertaking given by counsel for the appellants.
[8]  We also see no basis to interfere with the penalty imposed.
No issue was raised with respect to the amount until late into
the argument during the appeal.  We note that the amount bears
some similarity to the &quot;transactions&quot;.
[9]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $5,000 to
Mr. Siegel's client and $2,500 to Mr. Gray's clients.</pre>
