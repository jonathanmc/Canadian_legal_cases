    <pre>HEARD:         May 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Macdonald, dated
July 11, 1997.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The central issue on this appeal is whether Justice Ellen
Macdonald erred in concluding that Mr. Nader Ghermezian had given
his personal guarantee to return the purchaser&#146;s deposit paid to
Mr. Ghermezian&#146;s company if the conditions for the real estate
subdivision development were not satisfied.  The circumstances
giving rise to the dispute are contained in the decision of
Macdonald J. which is reported at (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 73 and we
need not repeat them here.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant submits that the trial judge&#146;s findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence. We do not agree that the
trial judge erred. This is essentially a fact driven appeal.  The
trial judge&#146;s conclusion is supported in large part by the
document signed by Mr. Ghermezian&#146;s solicitor in which he
undertook, on behalf of Mr. Ghermezian to execute a personal
guarantee. It follows that we see no merit in the appellant&#146;s
arguments concerning the Statute of Frauds and lack of ostensible
authority on the part of the solicitor. Because the trial judge
correctly found that there was authority in the solicitor to give
the undertaking, it is unnecessary for us to deal with the
application of the parole evidence rule.  The liability springs
directly from the undertaking given by the solicitor. We see no
merit in the submission that, once the vendor was in default, the
respondent was required to attempt to enforce the guarantee
against the corporate co-guarantor, Triple Five, before
attempting to enforce it against Mr. Ghermezian. Finally, the
trial judge did not err in dismissing the cross claim against
Robins, Appleby and Taub and Mr. Larry.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents.</pre>
