</pre>
    <pre>The Conviction Appeal
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The competence of the complainant to testify was canvassed</pre>
    <pre>in a s. 16 hearing before the witness was sworn.  The evidence</pre>
    <pre>given by the complainant, a mentally handicapped, middle-aged</pre>
    <pre>man, provided an adequate basis for the trial judge's conclusion</pre>
    <pre>that the complainant was competent to testify under oath.  The</pre>
    <pre>complainant's acknowledgement that he spoke to his caregivers at</pre>
    <pre>a break concerning an issue on which he was being cross-examined</pre>
    <pre>does not, standing alone, suggest any incapacity on his part.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge's ruling that an apparent inconsistency</pre>
    <pre>between a comment in the victim impact statement and the</pre>
    <pre>complainant's testimony concerning his prior acquaintance with</pre>
    <pre>the appellant did not warrant setting aside the conviction, was a</pre>
    <pre>proper exercise of his discretion.  Given the trial judge's</pre>
    <pre>finding with respect to the reliability of the complainant's</pre>
    <pre>evidence on matters other than those critical to the complaint</pre>
    <pre>and the overwhelming nature of the confirmatory evidence, we see</pre>
    <pre>no basis upon which the comment in the victim impact statement</pre>
    <pre>could reasonably have affected the result.  Nor can we accept the</pre>
    <pre>appellant's submission that if one assumes the complainant would</pre>
    <pre>have testified as set out in the victim impact statement, that</pre>
    <pre>testimony would have rendered the appellant's evidence credible.</pre>
    <pre>The appellant's story was quite incredible and remained so</pre>
    <pre>whether or not the complainant had some prior acquaintance with</pre>
    <pre>the appellant.  The conviction appeal is dismissed.

</pre>
    <pre>The Sentence Appeal

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, the sentence imposed by the trial judge was</pre>
    <pre>entirely fit and we see no basis upon which we can interfere.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the sentence appeal</pre>
    <pre>is dismissed.</pre></td>
