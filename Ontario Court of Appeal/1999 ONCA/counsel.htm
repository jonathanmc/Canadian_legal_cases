    <pre>[1]  This appeal involves a question of priority to the proceeds
from the sale of property.  The contest is between Counsel
Holdings' first mortgage (registered) and ONHWP's subrogated
rights of purchasers (unregistered) to recover their deposits
paid under purchase agreements of condominium units of which
Counsel Holdings had notice.

[2]  It is undisputed that Counsel Holdings has first priority
under its mortgage except to the extent that it had actual notice
of a prior interest. ONHWP relies on the purchase agreements to
impute notice to Counsel Holdings. Paragraph 26 of the purchase
agreements expressly subordinated the rights of purchasers to
Counsel Holdings' mortgage. ONHWP argues, however, that Counsel
Holdings cannot claim the benefit of the subordination clause
because it is not a party to the purchase agreements.

[3]  In our view, the issue is not one of privity of contract but
of notice. The trial judge correctly held that notice of an
interest that is expressly stated to be subordinate to the
mortgage is not actual notice of a “prior” interest and,
therefore, cannot defeat Counsel Holdings' registered interest.
Counsel relied on the case of Euroclean Canada Inc. v. Forest
Glade Investments Ltd. et al. (1985), 49 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.).
However, that case is not of assistance to the appellant as it
does not deal with the issue of notice.

[4]  Alternatively, ONHWP argues that, as a matter of
construction, the subordination clause does not apply to the
purchasers’ equitable liens because the liens do not arise from
the contract but by operation of law. The trial judge was correct
in rejecting this argument. The purchasers' claim to their
deposits clearly arose under the purchase agreements and any
rights flowing therefrom are subject to the terms of those
agreements, including the subrogation clause.

[5]  The ground of appeal with respect to the deposits being
subject to a trust claim, an argument that the trial judge held
to be without merit, has been abandoned.

[6]  In the result, we agree with the trial judge's conclusions
on the two issues raised on appeal. The appeal is dismissed with
costs.</pre></td>
