    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]    This is an inmate appeal.  The appellant pleaded guilty on
July 15, 1998 to robbery and assault.  He was sentenced the same
day to twenty months in prison on the robbery conviction and
three months concurrent on the assault conviction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]    He was represented by counsel that day.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]    Acting for the Crown that day was a solicitor who had
appeared as duty counsel for the appellant at a previous
appearance on these charges, and who the appellant says in the
Notice of Appeal, had a legal aid certificate to represent him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]    The appellant says that this presents a conflict of
interest on the part of the Crown that requires a new trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]    We have no hesitation in saying that this situation
results in a most unfortunate appearance. It ought not to have
happened and if it were raised at trial, the solicitor would
properly be prevented from continuing to act for the prosecution.
In controlling the trial process a trial judge can appropriately
use aggressive prophylactic measures: see  R. v. Widdifield
(1995) 25 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.); R. v. Lindskog  (1997), 117
C.C.C. (3d) 553 (Sask. Q.B.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]    However, on appeal, our task must be to determine if there
was a miscarriage of justice. Normally, on a motion such as this,
counsel for the appellant would seek to file evidence from
someone such as trial counsel or the accused who has knowledge of
what transpired in the court below which is not disclosed by the
transcript. If that evidence discloses a possible miscarriage of
justice, there may be cross-examination or responding evidence
filed. The procedure is fully outlined in the Widdifield case,
supra.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]    In this case, where the appellant is an inmate appearing
on his own behalf, he has no ability to obtain or file evidence
from another person. He did not file his own affidavit, but
advised the court orally that he did meet with duty counsel on
the first occasion in connection with the matter before the
court. The appellant did not know what if any of the information
he disclosed to that counsel was used in any way when that
counsel became the Crown Attorney who negotiated the guilty plea
with his then counsel. He said he was ill at the time he agreed
to the plea arrangement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]    In this unique circumstance, we are of the view that it is
desirable in the interests of justice that counsel be appointed
for the appellant pursuant to s. 684(1) of the Criminal Code, in
order to assist him to investigate the situation, to advise the
appellant, and as advised to bring forward evidence and reargue
the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]    We understand that the appellant may well be in a position
to be released before the matter can be reheard. This order does
not oblige him to continue with the appeal.
If the matter is to be reargued, counsel for the appellant is to
file a notice changing the appeal to a solicitor=s appeal within
30 days of release of this endorsement.  Otherwise, we will
dispose of the appeal thereafter on the record as presently
before us.</font></pre></td>
