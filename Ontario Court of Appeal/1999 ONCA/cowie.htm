    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice J. L. Lax dated May
1, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellants Philip and Leslie Wynn were ordered to
pay a penalty of $1,000,000 for assisting in the fraudulent
removal of a commercial tenant's goods and chattels to prevent
the landlord from distraining those goods and chattels for
arrears of rent.  The judgment of the trial judge, Lax J., is
reported at (1997), 32 O.T.C. 4; 10 R.P.R. (3d) 35 (Ont. Gen.
Div.).
[2]       The penalty was imposed pursuant to s. 50 of the
Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7 (&#147;the Act&#148;).  It
reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               50. If a tenant so fraudulently removes, conveys away or
          carries off the tenant&#146;s goods or chattels, or if any person
          wilfully and knowingly aids or assists the tenant in so doing, or
          in concealing them, every person so offending shall forfeit and
          pay to the landlord double the value of such goods or chattels,
          to be recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[3]       In order to understand the scope of s.50 and the
reference to &#147;so fraudulently removes&#148;, it is useful to consider
s.48(1) of the Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>            48. (1) Where any tenant, for life or lives, term of years, at
          will, sufferance or otherwise, of any messuages, lands, tenements
          or hereditaments, upon the demise or holding whereof any rent is
          reserved, due, or made payable, fraudulently or clandestinely
          conveys away, or carries off or from the premises the tenant&#146;s
          goods or chattels to prevent the landlord from distraining them
          for arrears of rent so reserved, due, or made payable, the
          landlord or any person lawfully empowered for that purpose by the
          landlord, may, within thirty days next ensuing such conveying
          away or carrying off, take and seize such goods and chattels
          wherever they are found, as a distress for such arrears of rent,
          and sell or otherwise dispose of them in such manner as if they
          had actually been distrained by the landlord upon such premises
          for such arrears of rent. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[4]       The appellants restricted their argument on appeal to
the findings of fact made by the trial judge. They argued that
her findings on the questions of fraudulent intent, concealment
and valuation of the goods were unreasonable and not supported by
the evidence. We see no merit to the grounds of appeal raised by
the appellants. In our view, the trial judge&#146;s findings are
reasonable and are entirely supported by the evidence.
[5]       During the course of the argument, this court raised a
further issue with counsel for the respondent.  The court queried
whether there could be a &#147;fraudulent&#148; removal of goods within the
meaning of s.50 beyond those goods whose value would equal the
amount of arrears owing to the landlord. More specifically, the
court asked whether s.50 could reasonably be interpreted so as to
restrict the penalty to twice the value of the arrears owing at
the time of the removal of the goods. The parties were given an
opportunity to file written submissions on this question.
[6]       Counsel for the respondent correctly notes in his
submissions that the landlord is entitled to distrain any
chattels on the premises and hold them as security for payment of
the rent arrears. Hence it is argued that the removal of any
goods with intent to deprive the landlord of this right can be
said to be fraudulent within the meaning of the Act. We agree
with this submission.  Nonetheless, the right to distrain is not
unlimited. The Act provides that the distress shall be reasonable
(s.43), and a distrainor who takes an excessive distress is
liable in damages to the owner of the distrained goods (s.55).
[7]       In our view, the scope of the right to distrain is
relevant to the determination of what constitutes a fraudulent
removal within the meaning of the Act. Section 48 makes it clear
that, in order to be caught by the Act, the fraudulent removal of
the tenant&#146;s goods must be done to prevent the landlord from
distraining &#147;them&#148;, i.e. the goods removed. There cannot be a
fraudulent removal within the meaning of s.50 with respect to
goods that could not have been subject to the landlord&#146;s right of
distress at the time of their removal.
[8]       Hence, to use an example referred to at the hearing, a
landlord&#146;s right to distrain for arrears of rent in the sum of
$1,000 could not reasonably be said to extend to goods and
chattels worth $1,000,000 unless there was only one piece of
valuable merchandise on the premises.  In the more usual case,
the landlord could only distrain goods of a value reasonably
adequate to secure payment of the arrears and costs. In the same
way, the tenant in arrears for $1,000 who removes goods worth
$1,000,000 from the premises could not be said to have &#147;so
fraudulently&#148; removed all of those goods within the meaning of
the Act when the bulk of those goods could not have been subject
to distress in the first place. On this interpretation, the
penalty under s. 50 would only extend to &#147;double the value of
such goods or chattels&#148; that were removed and to which the
landlord&#146;s right of distress would have extended at the time of
removal.
[9]       In this case, the value of the goods removed was
$500,000. The trial judge found that, as of April 1, 1993,
nineteen days before the removal of the goods, there were rental
arrears in the amount of $189,315.36. This amount included the
rent owing under the acceleration clause contained in the lease.
There were also continuing obligations under the lease. The
arrears of rent were calculated at trial at $236,641.20.
[10] On this evidence, it is at least arguable that the
landlord&#146;s right to distrain could  reasonably have extended to
all of the goods removed by the appellants. A landlord  who
chooses to exercise the right to distrain cannot be expected to
determine the value of the distrained goods with certainty.
Further, it would have been open to the appellants to make this
argument at trial and to introduce evidence on the value of the
goods. However, they took the position that none of the goods
were taken with fraudulent intent and introduced no evidence on
the issue of valuation.
[11] Upon considering the whole of the evidence and the course of
the proceedings, we find no justification to interfere with the
finding, which is implicit in the trial judge&#146;s conclusion, that
all the goods were removed with fraudulent intent within the
meaning of s.50 of the Act.
[12] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs up to and
including the hearing of the appeal. Each party is to bear the
costs incurred in the preparation of the additional written
submissions requested by the court.
