    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Glass J. dated January 30, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Glass J. dated
January 30, 1998 in which he declared that the respondents, the
Craigs, were the owners by virtue of the doctrine of adverse
possession of a narrow strip of land to which legal title was
held by the appellants, the Kingstons.  The land in question is
part of the backyard space between the residential properties
owned by the two families at 812 and 818 Mary Street North in
Oshawa.
[2]  In addition, the trial judge ordered the Kingstons to pay
special damages for trespass in the amount of $3,260.25 and
punitive damages of $4,000.00.  The judge also found the
Kingstons in contempt of the consent injunction.  They were
ordered to relocate a fence they had constructed and to do so at
their own expense.  The Kingstons appeal from all of these
components of Glass J.&#146;s order.
[3]  The grounds of appeal are that the judge was biased against
the appellants, that he should not have heard the contempt motion
in conjunction with the action relating to adverse possession,
that his conclusion on the adverse possession issue was wrong and
that he erred in awarding special and punitive damages.  In oral
argument, Mr. Jain emphasized the bias and adverse possession
grounds of appeal.
[4]  In our view, all of these grounds of appeal are without
merit.  An allegation of bias against a judge should not be made
lightly.  In this case, the record establishes nothing to suggest
that this ground of appeal should have been contemplated, let
alone pursued.  The allegation is that the trial judge was upset
because the appellants were unavailable to continue the trial on
an earlier date than the date scheduled for its resumption and
that this coloured his perception of the appellants&#146; case.  This
is a very unfair characterization of what happened.  The trial
judge sought to have the case moved forward when court time
became available but, when it became clear that the appellants
were away, he simply adjourned the case to the original return
date.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that this
simple scheduling scenario influenced the judge in any way.
Indeed, he handled it in a polite and entirely professional
fashion.
[5]  We are also of the view that the judge was correct to hear
the contempt matter and the action together.  Counsel had agreed
that the contempt motion should be converted into the trial of an
issue.  Accordingly, since the subject matter of this trial of an
issue and the action for adverse possession involved the same
parties, the same property and conduct relevant to both
proceedings, it made sense to hear them together.
[6]  On the issue of adverse possession, we can find no error in
the judge&#146;s analysis or conclusions.  Mr. Jain&#146;s argument
essentially invited this court to review and reverse the trial
judge&#146;s assessment of the evidence at the trial.  Our review of
the record raises nothing that would approach a &#147;palpable and
overriding error&#148; on the judge&#146;s part.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
