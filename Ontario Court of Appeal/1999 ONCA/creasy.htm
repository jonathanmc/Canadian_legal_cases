    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Gordon J. dated May 21, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  appeal  involves  three  actions  by  three  sets  of
plaintiffs  with properties in the Town of Copper Cliff,  against
the  appellant  The  Regional Municipality  of  Sudbury  and  the
respondent Inco Limited for damages the plaintiffs suffered as  a
result of two sewer back-ups in the Town.
[2]  The trial judge awarded judgment to each of the plaintiffs
against Inco, and ordered Sudbury to indemnify Inco for the total
amount. He ordered that Inco and Sudbury share responsibility for
the plaintiffs&#146; costs, and that Sudbury pay Inco&#146;s costs in
respect of the issues between them.
[3]  The plaintiffs have not appealed.
[4]  The appellant Sudbury seeks a variation of the judgment by
either a) awarding judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against
Inco and dismissing the plaintiffs&#146; actions as against Sudbury,
or b) awarding judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against both
Sudbury and Inco with Inco indemnifying Sudbury in full.
[5]  Inco cross-appeals seeking judgment in favour of the
plaintiffs against Sudbury alone for their damages and costs,
with dismissal of their actions against Inco, and judgment in
favour of Inco against Sudbury for its costs. In the alternative,
Inco seeks judgment for the plaintiffs against both Inco and
Sudbury equally, with Sudbury indemnifying Inco for all amounts.
[6]  There is no issue that the plaintiffs in this case are to
recover. In spite of the form of relief requested in the appeal
and cross-appeal, because the plaintiffs have not appealed, the
judgment in their favour against Inco cannot be modified.1 The
issues on appeal are whether Sudbury must indemnify Inco for part
or all of the damages, whether judgment is to go against Sudbury,
and if so, whether Inco must then indemnify Sudbury, whether
either will indemnify the other in respect of its share of the
plaintiffs&#146; costs, and who is to bear the costs of the issues
between them.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Based  on the findings made by the trial judge,  he  should
have  awarded judgment not only against Inco, but also in  favour
of  the  plaintiffs  against  Sudbury  for  its  negligence,  and
apportioned  liability  between  Sudbury  and  Inco.   The   most
appropriate apportionment is 50% liability for Inco and  50%  for
Sudbury.  Under s. 1 of the Negligence Act,2 each is required  to
indemnify the other in respect of its 50% share in the event that
the  plaintiffs elect to recover the entire amount  from  one  of
them.  Their  agreement has no express or implied term  that  the
obligation to indemnify will not apply.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[8]   Inco  built,  maintained and operated  the  sanitary  sewer
system  in the Town of Copper Cliff in order to handle the sewage
from  its own operations located there.  The system included  the
Nickel  Street  lift  station, which was the  catchment  for  all
sewage  in Copper Cliff. The sewage was lifted from there to  the
Copper  Cliff  sewage  treatment plant.  About  half  the  sewage
entering the lift station came from the Inco smelter complex  and
half came from the Town of Copper Cliff.
[9]  In 1959, Inco and Copper Cliff signed an agreement whereby
the Town of Copper Cliff paid Inco $1,000 per month for treatment
of the sewage from the town. In 1972 they signed a new agreement
which superseded the 1959 agreement and which provided for
payment of $5000 per month. Paragraph  4 of the 1972 agreement
provided:
</pre>
    <pre>          4.  Inco  makes  no  representations  or
          warranties as to the quality of  service
          to  be supplied and in this respect Inco
          shall  not be liable either directly  or
          indirectly in respect of any  injury  or
          damage  to any individuals, property  or
          equipment alleged to result or resulting
          from  the  nature  of  the  quality   of
          treatment.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  In  1973  the  Regional Municipality of Sudbury  came  into
existence  and became statutorily responsible for collection  and
disposal  of  sewage in the Region. Section  1  of  the  Regional
Municipality  of Sudbury Act, 1972, S.O. 1972, c. 104,  s.  31(1)
provided:
</pre>
    <pre>          On  and  after the 1st day  of  January,
          1973,  the  Regional  Corporation  shall
          have  the  sole responsibility  for  the
          collection and disposal of sewage in the
          Regional  Area and all of the provisions
          of  any  general  Act  relating  to  the
          collection and disposal of sewage  by  a
          municipal  corporation or a local  board
          thereof and all of the provisions of any
          special  Act relating to the  collection
          and   disposal  of  sewage  by  an  area
          municipality  or a local  board  thereof
          apply  mutatis mutandis to the  Regional
          Corporation,   except   the   power   to
          establish a public utilities commission.</pre>
    <pre>The  Town of Copper Cliff ceased to exist.  Sudbury continued  to
pay  Inco  a  monthly amount for the treatment  of  Copper  Cliff
sewage,  which amount increased over time, and  it  also  made  a
significant capital contribution. Inco however, continued to  own
and operate the sewage treatment system and the land on which  it
operated. The 1972 agreement remained in effect between Inco  and
Sudbury as successor to Copper Cliff.
[11]  On  March  11, 1992 a station malfunction  caused  sanitary
sewage to back up from the Nickel Street lift station. The  back-
up  went  through the sewer system and damaged  the  premises  of
certain of the plaintiffs.
[12] On July 20, 1992, sanitary sewage again backed up from the
Nickel Street lift station through the Copper Cliff sewers,
damaging the premises of the other plaintiffs. This second back-
up was also caused by a malfunction of the Nickel Street lift
station.
[13] The trial judge found that both sewage back-ups were the
result of negligence on the part of Inco in its sewage treatment
operation, and that the Nickel Street lift station was part of
the Sewage Disposal Plant referred to in the 1972 agreement. He
further found that the exclusion of liability clause, paragraph 4
of the 1972 agreement, must be read contra proferentem against
Inco because on the evidence it was drafted by Inco, and that as
it does not refer to negligence, then negligence by Inco is not
exempted by the paragraph. He next turned to the issue of
whether, aside from the contract, Sudbury was required to
indemnify Inco at law.
[14] He referred to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in The
City of St. John v. Charles Donald, [1926] S.C.R. 371, which
stands for the proposition that where a person employs an
independent contractor to do work,
</pre>
    <pre>     [h]is  vicarious  liability arises &#133;  where  the  danger  of
     injurious consequences to others from the work ordered to be
     done  is  so  inherent  in it that to any  reasonably  well-
     informed  person who reflects upon its nature the likelihood
     of  such consequences ensuing, unless precautions are  taken
     to  avoid them, should be obvious, so that were the employer
     doing  the  work  himself his duty to take such  precautions
     would be indisputable. (p. 383)</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  trial  judge  reasoned  that  because  Sudbury  has  a
statutory  responsibility for sewage services to the  plaintiffs,
and because the movement of raw sewage through the system carries
with  it  an  obvious, serious hazard to the  residents,  Sudbury
could not escape responsibility for the movement of the bacteria-
laden  waste by engaging Inco as independent contractor. He  said
that  Inco&#146;s  failures  could have been anticipated  and  guarded
against  by  Inco  and Sudbury by a system of  joint  inspection,
specifications  for  non-electrical back-up warning  systems  and
specifications  for  the training of personnel,  as  Sudbury  was
contributing one-half of the costs of the operation. He concluded
that  therefore, Sudbury had a responsibility to indemnify  Inco.
He  did  not,  however,  hold  Sudbury  directly  liable  to  the
plaintiffs.
</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>     1)   Was the trial judge correct in holding that paragraph 4 of
       the 1972 agreement did not protect Inco from liability to the
       plaintiffs by requiring Sudbury to indemnify Inco?</pre>
    <pre>     2)   Was the trial judge correct in holding that Sudbury must
       indemnify Inco on the basis of  the rule set out in the St. John
       case?</pre>
    <pre>     3)   Was the trial judge correct in failing to grant judgment to
       the  plaintiffs against Sudbury and failing  to  apportion
       responsibility between them?
     </pre>
    <pre>     4)   Is Sudbury liable to indemnify Inco for contribution or
       indemnity under the Negligence Act? Is Inco liable to indemnify
       Sudbury?</pre>
    <pre>     5)   Is it necessary or desirable for the judgment to be amended
       to grant judgment to the plaintiffs against Sudbury, pursuant to
       s. 134 of the Courts of Justice Act where the plaintiffs have not
       appealed?</pre>
    <pre>1)   DOES THE AGREEMENT PROVIDE INDEMNITY FOR INCO BY SUDBURY?</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Inco&#146;s  position is that paragraph 4 of the 1972  agreement
provides  a  complete  indemnity for  Inco  by  Sudbury  for  any
liability Inco may incur arising from its operation of the Sewage
Treatment Plant.
[17] The agreement is made only between Inco and Sudbury (as
successor to Copper Cliff). It therefore refers only to their
obligations to each other, although it is worded in terms of
their liability to others. The issue is whether as between Inco
and Sudbury, paragraph 4 of the 1972 agreement shields Inco from
its liability to the plaintiffs for its negligence in failing to
prevent the malfunctions of the lift station and the resulting
sewage back-ups.  The agreement cannot affect any duty which Inco
may owe directly to the residents of the Town. All it can do is
adjust that responsibility as between the two parties by Sudbury
indemnifying Inco for any liability which Inco may incur in
carrying out its obligations under the agreement.
[18] Paragraph 4 is set out again for ease of reference:
</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Inco makes no representations or warranties as to the
     quality of service to be supplied and in this respect Inco shall
     not be liable either directly or indirectly in respect of any
     injury or damage to any individuals, property or equipment
     alleged to result or resulting from the nature of the quality of
     treatment.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  When interpreting a clause in an agreement, the first  step
is  to see if there is any ambiguity in the clause, reading it in
the  context of the entire agreement.3  In my view, when read  in
the context of the agreement as a whole, there is no ambiguity in
the meaning of the paragraph.
[20] The two recitals to the 1972 agreement articulate its basis:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Whereas  Inco  owns  and  operates   the
          Sewage  Treatment Plant used to  service
          the  presently existing residential  and
          commercial  properties in  the  Town  of
          Copper Cliff;
          </pre>
    <pre>          And Whereas Inco and Copper Cliff desire
          to  enter  into  an  agreement  for  the
          continued  operation of the said  Sewage
          Treatment Plant:</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  term &#147;to service&#148; is not defined in the agreement.  It
ordinarily means to provide a certain service, in this case,  all
that is required to move the sewage through the various stages of
the plant together with the treatment of the sewage in the plant.
[22] By paragraph 4, 1) Inco does not warrant to Sudbury the
quality of the service; and 2) the parties agree that Inco is to
have no liability for injury or damage &#147;from the nature of the
quality of the treatment.&#148;
[23] The term &#147;treatment&#148; is also not defined in the agreement.
However, in the context of sewage treatment, the ordinary meaning
of &#147;the nature of the quality of the treatment&#148; is the quality of
the process used to clean the sewage and make the water usable
again, and the quality of the outcome of the process.
[24] The trial judge concluded that:
</pre>
    <pre>          &#147;I  can find nothing on overview  or  in
          particular   that   would   favour    an
          interpretation   that   would   restrict
          absolution  to  only  one  part  of   an
          interdependent  plant,  that  being  the
          actual chemical treatment of waste after
          it   has  been  lifted  and  transported
          through the forcemain.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Having   interpreted  this   clause   as
          applying  to the lift station, forcemain
          and  chemical treatment, does it in  law
          have the intended effect.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[25] With respect I disagree with that interpretation.
[26] In my view paragraph 4 distinguishes between the sewage
treatment service as a whole including moving the water through
the system, and the portion of that service where the wastewater
is treated and purified, and protects Inco by indemnity only from
liability for damage arising from the treatment of the
wastewater.
[27] In this case, the damage was caused by a sewage back-up
which resulted from a malfunction of the lift station, and not
from any failure of the process of water treatment. As a result,
the paragraph does not provide an indemnity for Inco in respect
of its liability to the plaintiffs for the damage to their
properties caused by the two sewage back-ups.
[28] The trial judge concluded that paragraph 4 does not
specifically refer to negligence of Inco in the operation of the
Sewage Treatment Plant but would cover nuisance. Because the
damage in this case arose as a consequence of the failure of a
part of the system which is not covered by the indemnity clause,
it is unnecessary to decide whether the clause would respond
depending upon whether the failure occurred as a result of Inco&#146;s
negligence or nuisance.
[29]  I agree with the trial judge that because the agreed
statement of facts states that Inco probably drafted the 1959 and
the 1972 agreements, if there is any ambiguity in the meaning of
paragraph 4 of the 1972 agreement, it should be read contra
proferentem against Inco.
[30] Therefore on the first issue, the agreement between the
parties does not provide any indemnity to Inco for its liability
to the plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>2)    WAS THE TRIAL JUDGE CORRECT IN HOLDING THAT THERE IS A
      COMMON LAW OBLIGATION ON SUDBURY TO INDEMNIFY INCO BASED ON THE
      RULE IN The City of St. John v. Donald?
</pre>
    <pre>[31]  In my view the trial judge erred in the manner in which  he
applied the St. John principle to the issues in this case and  in
his finding that Sudbury had a common law duty to indemnify Inco.
[32] In ordinary circumstances, a person who retains an
independent contractor is not responsible to others for the
negligence of the contractor: St. John at p.383. However, the
rule in that case is that where a person retains an independent
contractor to carry out a responsibility which, if performed
negligently, could have serious consequences to others because of
its dangerous nature, then in that circumstance, the person who
retains the contractor is vicariously liable for the negligence
of the contractor.
[33] The trial judge found that the provision of the sewage
treatment plant service is a potentially dangerous activity
because of the nature of raw sewage and the potential
consequences of a spill. Based on that finding, it was open to
the trial judge to grant judgment to the plaintiffs against
Sudbury for vicarious liability for the negligence of Inco. For
reasons not explained, he did not do so.
[34] However, the St John case does not address the issue of the
obligations of the contractor and the employer to each other, and
therefore is not a basis for holding that Sudbury has any
obligation at common law to indemnify Inco in respect of its
obligations to the plaintiffs for its negligence in the operation
of the lift station.</pre>
    <pre>3)    SHOULD JUDGMENT HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO THE PLAINTIFFS AGAINST
      SUDBURY
</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge found Inco to be negligent and made specific
findings  that  it  used personnel unfamiliar  with  the  system,
failed  to  provide a non-electrical alarm system and  failed  to
adequately test the back-up diesel. He made no specific  findings
of  fault  or  negligence against Sudbury, but in the  course  of
finding that Sudbury was liable to indemnify Inco, he said:</pre>
    <pre>          By   engaging  Inco  as  an  independent
          contractor,  the  Region  cannot  escape
          responsibility  for  movement  of   such
          bacteria laden waste.  It had no  reason
          to  expect  that Inco would  manage  the
          system  differently than it had  in  the
          past but even in that regard, it appears
          some  $800,000.00  was  contributed   to
          upgrade  the system prior to the  Region
          accepting.   The evidence is  less  than
          clear   whether  these  funds   included
          upgrading of both the collection  system
          and  the  &#147;sewage treatment plant&#148;,  but
          either  way, it serves as an  indication
          that the services had been somewhat less
          than   acceptable  before  upgrade.    A
          system  of  joint  inspection  was   not
          provided for, nor specifications re non-
          electrical back up warning systems,  nor
          for  the  training  of  personnel,  even
          though  one-half  the costs  were  being
          contributed.  The failures of  which  we
          have  heard  of  are not  such  acts  of
          negligence as could not have  have  been
          anticipated and guarded against.  I find
          therefore   that  the   Region   has   a
          responsibility to indemnify.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Inco&#146;s position is that Sudbury should have been  found  at
fault  or  negligent as well. The plaintiffs alleged  negligence,
nuisance  and breach of statutory responsibility4 in their  claim
against  Sudbury.  The St. John case also  raises  the  issue  of
vicarious  liability referred to above, and the related potential
cause of action for  breach of non-delegable duty.
[37]  In Lewis v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1145, the
court held that the responsibility of a government agency to use
reasonable care in carrying out its statutory authority in
respect of public works will extend to responsibility for the
negligence of an independent contractor retained to do the work.
Cory J. speaking for the majority characterized this
responsibility as &#147;a non-delegable duty to use reasonable care in
the performing of the required work.&#148; (p. 1162).  As to the type
and extent of the liability this duty encompasses, the reasons of
the majority suggest that depending on the statute and all of the
circumstances, there may be a combination of vicarious liability
in the form of responsibility by the government agency for the
negligence of its contractor, together with direct responsibility
on the government agency to engage a competent contractor and if
required to supervise that contractor. In concurring reasons,
McLachlin J. described the non-delegable duty in this way:
</pre>
    <pre>          In  essence, a non-delegable duty  is  a
          duty  not  only  to take  care,  but  to
          ensure  that care is taken.  It  is  not
          strict   liability,  since  it  requires
          someone (the independent contractor)  to
          have  been negligent. But if it applies,
          it is no answer for the employer to say,
          &#147;I   was  not  negligent  in  hiring  or
          supervising the independent contractor.&#148;
          The   employer   is   liable   for   the
          contractor&#146;s  negligence.  The  employer
          already  has a personal duty  at  common
          law  or  by  statute to take  reasonable
          care.  The  non-delegable duty  doctrine
          adds  another obligation &#150; the  duty  to
          ensure  that the independent  contractor
          also takes reasonable care. (p.1171/2).</pre>
    <pre>[38] The factual foundation upon which the trial judge based  his
conclusion  that Sudbury was obliged to indemnify  Inco  for  its
liability to the plaintiffs, was his finding that Sudbury had not
provided for a system of joint inspection, non-electrical back-up
warning systems nor the training of personnel, all of which  were
problems  which contributed to the failures that caused  the  two
sewer back-ups.
[39] Rather than providing a basis to require Sudbury to
indemnify Inco, these conclusions call for a finding of liability
of Sudbury to the plaintiffs for its own negligence in the form
of breach of non-delegable duty.
[40] Sudbury should also have been found vicariously liable to
the plaintiffs for Inco&#146;s negligence, applying the rule in St.
John&#146;s v. Donald, as the trial judge did.

</pre>
    <pre>3)    IS  INCO ENTITLED TO CONTRIBUTION OR INDEMNITY FROM SUDBURY
      PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEGLIGENCE ACT? IS INCO LIABLE
      TO INDEMNIFY SUDBURY?</pre>
    <pre>[41]  Each of the defendants cross-claimed against the  other  in
the  actions  for  contribution and  indemnity  and  pleaded  the
Negligence Act. Section 1 of that Act provides:
  </pre>
    <pre>          Where   damages  have  been  caused   or
          contributed to by the fault  or  neglect
          of  two or more persons, the court shall
          determine  the degree in which  each  of
          such  persons is at fault or  negligent,
          and, where two or more persons are found
          at  fault or negligent, they are jointly
          and   severally  liable  to  the  person
          suffering loss or damage for such  fault
          or    negligence,   but    as    between
          themselves,  in  the  absence   of   any
          contract  express  or implied,  each  is
          liable   to   make   contribution    and
          indemnify  each other in the  degree  in
          which they are respectively found to  be
          at fault or negligent.
  </pre>
    <pre>Having found Sudbury liable at common law to indemnify Inco,  the
trial judge did not deal with whether Sudbury must indemnify Inco
under s. 1 of the Negligence Act.</pre>
    <pre>[42] This section applies when there are two or more persons  who
are  at fault or negligent causing damage to a plaintiff. In that
case,  they  are each fully liable to pay the awarded damages  to
the plaintiff, or, in other words, they are jointly and severally
liable  to  the  plaintiff. However, as between themselves,  they
bear  the  financial  responsibility  to  the  plaintiff  in  the
proportions that they are respectively found to be at  fault,  in
the absence of any contract express or implied.
[43] Where two parties who have caused damage to a plaintiff have
a relationship with each other which is in the form of a contract
either express or implied, and which governs their obligations to
each other in the eventuality which in fact occurs, then the
Negligence Act does not override that contract but has no
application to those parties in respect of their obligations as
between themselves. This makes sense because there is no need for
legislative intervention or assistance in those situations where
parties know that they may each incur liability to third parties
as a result of an undertaking in which they are both
participating. They are able to structure their financial
arrangements, including insurance, in accordance with the
obligations to each other undertaken within their agreement. A
similar analysis led Cory J. to note in Lewis v. British
Columbia, supra, that one of the policy reasons for imposing
liability on British Columbia for the negligence of its
contractor was that the Crown may stipulate for indemnification
by its contractor for negligently performed work as a condition
of entering into the contract to do the work.
[44] The application of s. 1 of the Negligence Act in terms of
the obligations of each of the parties to indemnify the other
turns in part on the basis for the finding of liability by each
to the plaintiffs, and also on whether there is an express or
implied contract to indemnify or any other right of
indemnification.
</pre>
    <pre>a)   Vicarious Liability of Sudbury</pre>
    <pre>[45] At common law an implied right of indemnity arises where one
person  who  is  not  at fault is exposed to  liability  for  the
tortious  acts  of  another, such as in situations  of  vicarious
liability: McFee v. Joss (1925), 56 O.L.R. 578 (C.A.),   Fenn  v.
Peterborough  (1978), 25 O.R. (2d) 399 (C.A.), aff&#146;d.,  [1982]  2
S.C.R.  613,  Rinaldi et al. Remedies in Tort vol. 4,  chap.  26,
par.  60, Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed, (1998), at pp.  298-
300.  Had the trial judge found Sudbury to be vicariously  liable
for  Inco&#146;s negligence, by applying the St. John principle, there
would be an implied right of indemnity arising at common law that
would displace the operation of s. 1 of the Negligence Act.
[46] That implied right must be considered in conjunction with
the written agreement between the parties. The parties made their
own bargain as contemplated by s. 1 of the Negligence Act. The
first half of paragraph 4 provides that Inco makes no
representations or warranties as to the quality of service to be
supplied. It is arguable that that statement is enough to
negative an implied warranty arising at common law that Inco will
indemnify Sudbury if Sudbury is held vicariously liable for
damages resulting from Inco&#146;s negligence. However, because of the
trial judge&#146;s findings of acts of negligence by Sudbury, and the
effect of those findings discussed below, it is unnecessary to
determine whether Inco is required to indemnify Sudbury for its
vicarious liability.</pre>
    <pre>b)   Nuisance</pre>
    <pre>[47]  Since  Sudbury itself did not allow the  sewer  back-up  to
occur,  if  Sudbury were to be held liable, its  liability  would
only  arise in the context of vicarious liability for a  nuisance
created or allowed by Inco. Sudbury&#146;s right to be indemnified  by
Inco  would  arise by implication at common law, consistent  with
their agreement as discussed above under &#147;Vicarious Liability.&#148;


</pre>
    <pre>c)   Negligence and Breach of Non-Delegable Duty
</pre>
    <pre>[48]  The  reasons  of the trial judge indicate  that  there  was
negligence  on the part of Sudbury, consisting of its failure  to
supervise  or inspect Inco as it carried out the sewage treatment
operation  and to have systems in place to prevent sewage  backup
failures  such as the two that occurred. These types of  failures
constitute  specific ways in which Sudbury can be  said  to  have
breached a non-delegable statutory duty to the plaintiffs to  use
reasonable  care  in  providing  a  safe  and  effective   sewage
treatment system.
[49] Sudbury should have been found liable to the plaintiffs in
respect of those failures, and liability apportioned  between
Sudbury for its breaches and Inco for its negligence in operating
the system. As the trial judge made no apportionment, this court
is entitled to do so. Counsel for Inco submitted that a 50/50
apportionment was appropriate. I agree.
[50] The issue then becomes whether there is an implied term
within the agreement between the parties that Inco would
indemnify Sudbury in these circumstances. Although the agreement
contemplates that Inco will be fully responsible for the
operation of the treatment facility without supervision by
Sudbury, Inco specifically does not warrant to Sudbury the
quality of its service. This speaks against any implied agreement
that Inco would indemnify Sudbury for any damage caused by its
negligence, including if it arose in circumstances where
supervision could have prevented it even though no supervision
was contemplated. Such an indemnity would have to have been an
express provision of the agreement. There is no basis in the
agreement for an implied indemnity by Inco for Sudbury&#146;s
negligence in failing to supervise it.
</pre>
    <pre>IS  IT  NECESSARY TO AMEND THE JUDGMENT TO GRANT JUDGMENT TO  THE
PLAINTIFFS AGAINST SUDBURY?</pre>
    <pre>[51] Section 134(5) of the Courts of Justice Act provides that on
appeal, the court may exercise any of its powers in favour  of  a
party  even if that party did not appeal. The plaintiffs in  this
case did not appeal from the decision which granted them judgment
only  against  Inco and not against Sudbury. The reason  why  the
court  would need to decide whether judgment should go  in  their
favour  against  Sudbury  is if the court  had  to  consider  the
application  of  s.  1 of the Negligence Act  and  whether  there
should  be  an  order dividing the financial  obligation  to  the
plaintiffs as between the two defendants. For the reasons  stated
above,  judgment  should  go against Sudbury  in  favour  of  the
plaintiffs,  and  s.  1 of  the Negligence Act  applies  allowing
Sudbury  and Inco each to claim indemnity from the other  to  the
extent of the other&#146;s personal liability.
</pre>
    <pre>RESULT</pre>
    <pre>[52]  The appeal of Sudbury and the cross appeal by Inco are both
allowed.  The judgment below in favour of the plaintiffs  against
Inco  shall  be modified to add judgment in their favour  against
Sudbury.  Liability is apportioned between them on a 50/50  basis
including  for  all  costs.  Although both  sides  achieved  some
success  on the appeal, Sudbury&#146;s liability was reduced  by  50%.
Therefore Sudbury shall have its costs of the appeal.

1 Section 134(5) of the Courts of Justice Act,  R.S.O.1990, c.
C.43 allows a court on appeal to exercise its powers &#147;in favour

appears that judgment in this case could be modified, for
