    <pre>HEARD:         June 2, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of  Mr. Justice C. Misener dated
November 3, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  respondent&#146;s  claim is based on a  personal  guarantee</pre>
    <pre>signed  by  the  appellant  in 1988.   The  appellant  takes  the</pre>
    <pre>position that the guarantee was superseded when different  credit</pre>
    <pre>arrangements  were  made  with  the  respondent  in   1990   and,</pre>
    <pre>alternatively, that the company whose debts he had guaranteed had</pre>
    <pre>repaid its entire indebtedness to the respondent in 1992.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The motion judge acknowledged that the appellant&#146;s affidavit
offered some support for both positions.  He further concluded,
however, that the appellant&#146;s answers on cross-examination on his
affidavit so qualified and contradicted the relevant assertions
in the affidavit as to deprive the affidavit of any probative
value.
[3]  Having reviewed the cross-examination we agree with the
motion judge.  The three letters (April, May and June 1992) said
to lend support to the claim that the indebtedness was repaid in
1992, while not entirely clear, do not support this submission.
Indeed, the May letter makes specific reference to the continued
existence of the debt on which the respondent&#146;s claim is based.
The April letter also acknowledged the continued existence of the
personal guarantee.
[4]  The appellant&#146;s claim that new credit arrangements were made
in 1990 which rescinded the 1988 guarantee is not supported by
his testimony.  He said that he objected to allowing this
personal guarantee to remain in effect and that he may have
discussed his position with the respondent when the new credit
facility was being negotiated.  The respondent&#146;s evidence is
clear.  There was no agreement to rescind the 1988 personal
guarantee.  The appellant&#146;s belief that he may have told the
respondent that he was not prepared to allow his 1988 personal
guarantee to continue cannot, standing alone, support the
inference that the respondent agreed to rescind that personal
guarantee.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
