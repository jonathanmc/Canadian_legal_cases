    <pre>BEFORE:        CARTHY, AUSTIN AND MACPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Henry G. Blumberg and Albert S. Frank, for the appellants</pre>
    <pre>               E.G. Upenieks, for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 20, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Pitt J. dated February 3, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal of an order of Pitt J. in which he issued
a  Certificate  confirming the assessment of  Assessment  Officer
Gramlow.   The principal ground of appeal is that the  assessment
officer  erred in finding that the solicitor worked  480  to  500
hours for the clients.
[2]  The basis for this submission is that the solicitor
acknowledged in cross-examination that the work he performed in
relation to the paper documentation (the diary and 100 folders)
totalled only 282.5 hours.  However, the paper documentation in
this case is not the entire basis on which the assessment was
conducted.  The solicitor did not keep traditional time records
because for eight years all parties thought the solicitor&#146;s
compensation for his legal work was 30% of the shares in the
company.  Only after Justice Farley held that the solicitor did
not have this share interest did it become necessary to
reconstruct eight years of legal services provided by the
solicitors to the clients.  The reconstruction is an amalgam of
documents and oral testimony.
[3]  In our view, the Assessment Officer made no error in
principle in considering the evidence on the time issue.  Indeed,
he reduced the hours claimed by the solicitor by 300 to 320
hours.
[4]  Moreover, the Assessment Officer explicitly considered all
of the factors enumerated in Cohen v. Kealey.  On some of the
factors his analysis favoured the clients; on others it favoured
the solicitor.  We cannot say that his consideration of the
various factors displays any error.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
