    <pre>HEARD:         November 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Klowak J. dated April 8, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants&#146; factum candidly admits that the appellants
know nothing about the arrangements between the respondents and
the plaintiff and that what it has to rely on is what was gleaned
from Mr. Whitehead in an exhaustive and repetitious cross-
examination on his affidavit.  That cross-examination produced a
great deal of chaff and, insofar as we can determine, nothing
whatever that could be identified as wheat.
[2]  As the motions judge said &#147;there is simply no evidence to
tie the Whiteheads to this litigation&#148;.  The evidence on which
the appellants rely is, to quote the motions judge, &#147;but examples
of mundane daily relationships and feelings which could not give
rise to a finding of liability&#148;.  That evidence does not support
a finding that there is a genuine issue for trial.
[3]  One could be forgiven for believing that joining the
Whiteheads was simply a means of getting discovery of them or of
warning them off the plaintiff, or both.
[4]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
