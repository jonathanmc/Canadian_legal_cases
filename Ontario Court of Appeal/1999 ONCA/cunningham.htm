    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Glithero J., with a jury, dated
December 5, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant submits that the failure of the jury to
convict the appellant of driving his motor vehicle with a
concentration of alcohol in his system of more than 80 milligrams
of alcohol in a 100 millilitres of blood (over 80), meant that
the jury must have accepted the appellant&#146;s evidence that his
consumption of alcohol was below the level of impairment. It is
trite law that a jury can accept all or part of the evidence and
there is evidence in the record to support a finding that the
appellant had a concentration of alcohol in his body that was
below that which would justify a conviction for &#147;driving over 80&#148;
and yet sufficient to cause impairment.
[2]  The appellant further submits that there is no evidence that
whatever impairment he suffered caused the accident. However, the
standard for a causal connection is simply that it must be beyond
the de minimus level. There was evidence that after seeing the
lights of an on-coming vehicle, the appellant turned his face
towards his passenger and talked to him. When he then turned his
head and looked forward, the oncoming vehicle appeared to be in
his lane. He then took evasive action that was inappropriate and,
as it turned out, ineffective.
[3]  In these circumstances, it was open to the jury to find that
there was a causal connection between the appellant&#146;s impairment
by alcohol and his initial inattention, followed by his failure
to follow more effective evasive action.
[4]  As to sentence, this is an alcohol-related death. A
custodial term is called for. However, we are of the view that in
the circumstances of this case, eighteen months is not a fit
sentence.  The trial judge found, consistent with the verdict of
the jury, that the appellant&#146;s impairment was at the lower level
and it is evident that the causal connection between impairment
and the death of the passenger was not greatly over the de
minimus requirement. In mitigation of sentence, the appellant had
no driving record, the passenger who died was his best friend and
he himself was badly injured. There were no other persons
injured. Looking at this case on its own merits, we feel that the
sentence should be nine months.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed,
leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is reduced
from eighteen months to nine months.</pre>
