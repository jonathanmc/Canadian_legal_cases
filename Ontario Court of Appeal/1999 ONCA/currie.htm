</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The crown applies for an order revoking the Judicial Interim
Release Order of the appellant. He has been convicted of breach
of recognizance and is presently serving his sentence in custody.
The application record was served on counsel for the appellant.
He takes the position that the court is without jurisdiction to
hear the application because no warrant has been issued for the
arrest of the accused pursuant to ss. 525(5)(6)(7) of the
Criminal Code. He relies on the decision of Goodman J.A. in this
court in R. v. F.J.U. (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 408.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In that case, the appellant had been arrested and released
on a show cause hearing in provincial Court and was not in
custody when the application was brought. Goodman J.A. referred
to s. 679(6) of the Code which deals with release pending appeal,
and which makes ss. 525(5),(6), and (7) applicable &#147;with such
modifications as the circumstances require&#148;.  He held that as the
appellant had been arrested and then released pursuant to
judicial order, therefore a warrant was required in order to
arrest the appellant and bring into custody in order to give the
court jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Once he was in
custody he could of course also show cause why he should be
released.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In my view, however, the more applicable case to this one is
a Chambers decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v.
Parsons (1997), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 92, where the appellant, who was
on bail by order of the Court of Appeal pending a new trial, was
in custody following his arrest on two new charges and was held
pending a hearing in that court for revocation of bail requiring
show cause. The court held that there was no need to issue a
further arrest warrant in those circumstances and stated: &#147;As
long as the accused is lawfully in custody and is given notice of
the intention of the Crown to seek to revoke his existing bail by
an application specifically for that purpose, there is no
prejudice to him.&#148; (pp. 103-104).
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Where there is judicial interim release pending appeal, the
code sections are to apply &#147;with such modifications as the
circumstances require.&#148; In my view where the appellant is already
in custody, the procedure can be modified to obviate the need for
a further warrant of arrest. The purpose of the warrant is to
bring the appellant before the court for the show cause. That is
accomplished if the appellant is already in custody and receives
proper notice of the application as was this case here.  On
appeal, the appellant is not brought in person before the Court
of Appeal.  Rather the procedure is carried out in writing.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  It is clear on the record before the court and not disputed
that the appellant has been found guilty of breach of
recognizance in respect of consumption of alcohol. As crown
counsel pointed out, the breach occurred at a time which was in
contravention of the curfew condition modified last year  by the
Chief Justice when this appellant was brought before him after
arrest on other charges while on bail.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The recognizance is therefore cancelled and the appellant is
to be detained in custody pending the hearing and disposition of
his appeal, subject to any further application he may bring for
judicial interim release.
