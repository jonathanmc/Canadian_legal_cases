</pre>
    <pre>                          ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants were each convicted by a court composed of a
judge and jury of one count of assault causing bodily harm with
respect to different complainants.  They have raised numerous
grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>1. Unreasonable verdict with respect to the appellant Cvetan.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We see no merit in this ground of appeal.  There was ample
evidence which, if believed, could support the verdict.</pre>
    <pre>2. Evidence of a prior act of violence.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We see no error in the exercise of the trial judge's
discretion in concluding that a prior act of violence of one
complainant was inadmissible.   This evidence was not
sufficiently probative to warrant its admission in light of its
potential prejudice to the trial process.</pre>
    <pre>3. Self-defence.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On the facts of this case, the trial judge adequately
instructed the jury on the defence of self-defence.  He
instructed the jury in a manner that was understandable in
relation to the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>4. Consciousness of guilt.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge's instructions on this issue were adequate
and we see no error.  He left the evidence of flight as a
circumstance to be considered with all the other evidence.</pre>
    <pre>5. The definition of assault.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The elements of the offence of assault causing bodily harm
were properly explained to the jury and again we see no error.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  With respect to sentence, the appellants were sentenced to
six months' imprisonment plus a period of probation of two years.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge did not accept the evidence of Mr. Stevens
to the effect that the assault was motivated by the sexual
orientation of the complainants.  Without this evidence, we see
no other evidence to support the trial judge's conclusion that
the sexual orientation of the complainants played any part in
this assault and was an aggravating factor in imposing sentence.</pre>
    <pre>[10] This unprovoked assault calls for denunciation.  However, we
are of the view that in light of: 1) the age and the solid
backgrounds of the appellants; 2) the absence of any criminal
record; 3) the fact that they have been on bail for four years
pending appeal (the delay is without any fault of their own); and
4) the appellants' exemplary conduct and contributions to the
community while on bail, the proper disposition is a conditional
sentence for both appellants on the conditions set out in the
Conditional Sentence Order.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeals are allowed and
the sentences are varied to conditional sentences of six months
on the conditions set out in the Conditional Sentence Orders.
The probation orders are struck out.</pre></td>
