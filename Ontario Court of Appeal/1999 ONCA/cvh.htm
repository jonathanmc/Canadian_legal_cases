               v. THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE (Respondent/
               Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        WEILER, GOUDGE and BORINS JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Warren W. Tobias,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Wendy J. Linden,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice R. A. Blair dated
August 29, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant sought to argue that the assessment made by
the respondent was made against the wrong party, that is that the
bankrupt was not the employer of those for whom deductions were
to be made. This argument does not appear to have been raised
before Blair J. and there is an inadequate factual record for
this court to be able to deal with it.

[2]  Secondly, the appellant now concedes, we think,
appropriately, that s. 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act gives the
respondent priority over the appellant's unsecured interests.
Blair J. reached this conclusion for reasons with which we
completely agree.

[3]  The third argument is that the respondent's failure to
pursue its claim in the bankruptcy proceedings prevented it from
proceeding with its assessment.  For the reasons given by
Blair J., this argument also fails.

[4]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
