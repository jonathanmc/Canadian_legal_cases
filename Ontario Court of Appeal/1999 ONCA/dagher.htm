</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Brennan J., without a jury, dated
September 25, 1998
</pre>
      <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
      <pre>[1]   This appeal requires us to decide whether a judge of what
is now the Superior Court of Justice properly assumed
jurisdiction in an application arising from a protracted labour
dispute between the parties.</pre>
      <pre>The proceedings</pre>
      <pre>[2]  The employer, the appellant McDonnell-Ronald Limousine
Service Limited, holds 119 permits to operate a limousine service
to and from Lester B. Pearson International Airport.  The
respondents are drivers in the appellant's limousine service.
[3]  The appellant has entered into a contract known as a Service
Agreement with various individuals referred to as brokers.  Under
the Service Agreement, brokers obtain the right to operate an
airport limousine.  Brokers pay a monthly brokerage fee to the
appellant for the use of the permit and for dispatch and
accounting services provided by the appellant.  Brokers sometimes
drive limousines themselves, or they may lease their right to
drive to others.
[4]  Drivers of the appellant's limousines are members of a
bargaining unit represented by Local 1703 of the Amalgamated
Transit Union (&quot;Union&quot;).  Drivers may be brokers, or they may
simply drive under agreements with brokers.  Brokers are not
members of the bargaining unit unless they are also drivers.
[5]  The respondents are all drivers and thus members of the
bargaining unit and the Union.  Five of the respondents are also
brokers, who have entered Service Agreements with the appellant.
Two of the respondents (Emile Dagher and Wayne King) claim to
have entered an oral lease with a broker and to have thereby
acquired all of the contractual rights of a broker.
[6]  The Service Agreements between the brokers and the appellant
renew annually with identical terms except that the appellant may
increase the brokerage fee in accordance with the terms of
Schedule A.  Schedule A sets the monthly fee at $630, effective
August 1, 1984 to December 31, 1984.  It permits the appellant to
increase the brokerage fee according to the following formula:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … Dispatching and Brokerage annual fee increases shall not
          exceed the Consumer Price Index as published by Statistics Canada
          for the proceeding year and ten (10%) per cent whichever is less;
          provided that the Corporation shall be permitted at any time to,
          after December 31st, 1984, make an application for an amount in
          excess of the Consumer Price Index …</pre>
      <pre>[7]  In addition to the Service Agreements between the appellant
and the brokers, the appellant and the Union entered a collective
agreement, effective November 8, 1995 to November 8, 1997, which
recognized the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all
drivers of the appellant's limousine company.  The collective
agreement granted the appellant the right to &quot;…continue to have
the right to require Service Agreements from all brokers and
broker drivers.&quot;  The agreement defined &quot;brokers&quot; as those &quot;who
are signatory to a Service Agreement with the Company granting
them rights as a 'broker'&quot;.  The collective agreement provided
that the monthly brokerage fee payable by those in the bargaining
unit was to remain at $775 per month for the duration of the
agreement.
[8]  The collective agreement expired on November 9, 1997.  No
new collective agreement has since been signed despite
negotiations between the Union and the appellant.
[9]  In a letter to all brokers, lessees and drivers dated
December 29, 1997, the appellant announced that effective January
3, 1998:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Since your working relationship with the Company will no
          longer be governed by the terms and conditions of the expired
          Collective Agreement the Company hereby advises that it wishes to
          continue your working relationship with the Company effective
          January 3, 1998 in accordance with the following terms and
          conditions:
          </pre>
      <pre>                              …
          </pre>
      <pre>               2.  The Company will continue to apply
          the terms and conditions of the existing
          Service Agreements;
          </pre>
      <pre>                              …
          </pre>
      <pre>               4.   Until the Company enters into a new
          Collective Agreement with the Union, it will
          not be collecting union dues.
          </pre>
      <pre>               5. …[S]ervice fees charged by the
          Company will remain at $775 for the month of
          January, 1998.  The Company is hereby
          providing 30 days' notice the service fees
          will be increased to $925 per month,
          effective February 1, 1998….</pre>
      <pre>[10] The Union commenced two applications before the Ontario
Labour Relations Board (&quot;OLRB&quot;) under s. 96 of the Labour
Relations Act, 1995 , S.O. 1995, c.1, Sched. A,(the &quot;Act&quot;)
alleging that the appellant had violated various provisions of
the Act including the obligation to bargain in good faith.
These proceedings, which were initiated on January 12, 1998, were
consolidated with a decertification application initiated by
certain employees of the appellant that had been filed on
September 15, 1997 and was still pending before the OLRB.  That
application sought a declaration that the Union no longer
represented the employees in the bargaining unit.  The Union
responded that the application was tainted by management
sponsorship.
[11] In support of the allegation that the appellant had failed
to bargain in good faith, the Union asserted that:
          </pre>
      <pre>               …the Employer did not intend to enter into good faith
          negotiations insofar as the Employer insisted on a brokerage fee
          increase of approximately twenty percent (20%).  Such an increase
          is unlawful pursuant to the provisions of the service agreements
          between the brokers and the Employer.</pre>
      <pre>[12] At a hearing brought by the Union for interim relief in the
s. 96 application, the appellant contested the jurisdiction of
the OLRB.  It contended that the relationship between it and the
brokers was governed by a commercial contract, which continued to
exist outside of the collective agreement. The appellant also
took the position that the fee increase was lawful because the
collective agreement had expired.
[13] The OLRB issued its decision on the application for interim
relief on February 27, 1998.   The decision of the majority of
the Board noted that the collective bargaining history of the
parties &quot;…can be described as turbulent.&quot;  The majority commented
as follows about the brokerage fee increase:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The union … asserts that the employer is
          restricted by the terms of the service
          agreement, from imposing a 20 percent
          increase at this time.  And while that
          prohibition may be found in the terms of what
          might be characterized as a term of a private
          contract between the company and its brokers,
          the union asserts that it is a violation of
          the Act for the company to have implemented
          that increase.
          </pre>
      <pre>                    The union's argument acknowledges
          that, when the parties are in a
          strike/lockout position, an employer is
          generally permitted to make unilateral
          changes to the terms and conditions of
          employment of bargaining unit employees
          without offending the Act.
                              …
          </pre>
      <pre>                    We understand that the employer asserts first of all
          that the Board ought not to engage in an interpretation of the
          rights and obligations set out in the service agreement, a
          document it sees as a private contract between the company and
          the individual brokers.  We further understand that the employer
          asserts that, even if the Board were to engage in such an
          exercise, the conclusion advanced by the union (i.e. that the 20
          percent increase is contrary to the terms of the service
          agreement) is an incorrect interpretation.
          </pre>
      <pre>                    The employer may well ultimately
          persuade us of the veracity of either or both
          of those propositions.  That is a
          determination that may have to be made in the
          main application.  For the present purposes,
          however, our concern is whether the union has
          established an arguable case.  As we have
          already indicated, we are satisfied that it
          has.
     
</pre>
      <pre>[14] In the result, the majority of the OLRB refused the Union's
request to grant an interim order on the basis that the Union had
failed to establish sufficient harm to labour relations if relief
were not granted.  Specifically, the majority concluded that the
relief sought was primarily financial in character and thus
amenable to an award of damages.  What is important for our
purposes is that the respondents invoked the jurisdiction of the
OLRB and asserted and continues to assert jurisdiction over the
dispute between the parties.
[15] On May 29, 1998, following the OLRB’s ruling on the interim
relief application, the respondents commenced an application in
the then Ontario Court (General Division). The respondents
sought, inter alia, a declaration that the appellant had violated
the terms of the Service Agreement by imposing an increase in
brokerage fees in excess of the annual increase in the Consumer
Price Index (CPI).
[16] In a brief endorsement released September 25, 1998, the
application judge rejected the appellant's argument that it was
entitled to a cumulative increase of an amount equivalent to the
yearly increases in the CPI between 1988 and 1998.   He also
rejected the appellant's argument that he was without
jurisdiction to decide the matter, stating:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The contract which is the subject of this application was
          entered into long before certification of the bargaining unit and
          before the collective agreement came into existence.  Although
          the collective agreement included a provision prohibiting the
          company from invoking the Service Agreement's provision to
          increase those fees, in my view it did not alter the commercial
          contract, and the interpretation of that contract remains within
          the jurisdiction of this Court.  I am mindful of the decision in
          Weber v. Ontario Hydro (1995), 125 D.L.R. (4th) 583 (S.C.C.), but
          I consider it distinguishable.  The agreement in question pre-
          dates the collective agreement, and its provisions govern the
          relations of persons outside the bargaining unit.</pre>
      <pre>Analysis</pre>
      <pre>[17] With respect to the applications judge, Weber v. Ontario
Hydro is not distinguishable from this case.  The fact that the
Service Agreement pre-dated the collective agreement is of no
significance. The contractual terms respecting the brokerage fees
in the Service Agreement ceased to govern the parties once the
appellant entered into the collective agreement with the
respondents' bargaining agent. That collective agreement
negotiated with the Union as the official bargaining agent of the
respondent employees placed the parties to this agreement
squarely within the jurisdiction of the OLRB. This is so even
after the collective agreement has expired in accordance with its
terms where, as here, the parties were negotiating a new
collective agreement and one of the parties alleged that the
other engaged in unfair labour practices under the Act. In the
case in appeal, the central issue that arose following the expiry
of the collective agreement was whether the employer violated its
obligation to bargain in good faith by imposing the 20% fee
increase under the Service Agreement.  This is a matter that was
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OLRB to decide under
s.96 of the Act.
[18] It was a mistake for the application’s judge to entertain
this matter.  He could not resolve the overall dispute between
the parties and essentially was being asked to determine a
subsidiary issue in a labour conflict that was already before the
OLRB, a fact that was conceded in effect by the respondents’
counsel.  Under s.114(1) of the Act, the OLRB has exclusive
jurisdiction to exercise power conferred upon it under the Act
and to determine all questions of fact and law that arise in any
matter before it.  The actions or decisions of the OLRB are final
and conclusive for all purposes.
[19] That this is the law has been recognised by our courts in a
long line of decisions that were accepted as authoritative by the
Supreme Court of Canada in St. Anne-Nackawic Pulp &amp; Paper Co.
Ltd. v. C.P.W.U., Local 219 (1986), 28 D.L.R. (4th) 1.  Estey J.,
speaking for the Court, stated at p. 12:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The more modern approach is to consider that labour
          relations legislation provides a code governing all aspects of
          labour relations, and that it would offend the legislative scheme
          to permit the parties to a collective agreement, or the employees
          on whose behalf it was negotiated, to have recourse to the
          ordinary courts which are in the circumstances a duplicate forum
          to which the Legislature has not assigned these tasks.</pre>
      <pre>[20] Since St. Anne-Nackawic Pulp &amp; Paper, the extent of the
jurisdiction of the OLRB, has, if anything, been enlarged by the
Supreme Court.  Weber v. Ontario Hydro, supra, involved the
interpretation of s. 45(1) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. L.2 [now s. 48(1) of the Act], which states:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Every collective agreement shall provide for the final and
          binding settlement by arbitration, without stoppage of work, of
          all differences between the parties arising from the
          interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation
          of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter
          is arbitrable.</pre>
      <pre>[21] McLachlin J., speaking for the Court on this point,
explained that in deciding whether a dispute is to be arbitrated
or if it is properly before the courts, what matters is  “…not
the legal characterization of the claim, but whether the facts of
the dispute fall within the ambit of the collective agreement (at
p. 600).” She concluded that in light of the mandatory
arbitration clause in s. 45(1), the jurisdiction issue falls to
be decided by considering, “…whether the dispute, viewed with an
eye to its essential character, arises from the collective
agreement (at p. 607).”
[22] Although Weber involved the interpretation of the mandatory
arbitration provision of the Act, the same principles apply to
the case at bar.  The Supreme Court in Gendron v. Supply and
Services Union, P.S.A.C., Local 50057, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1298 at
1326 established that the principles of deference apply equally
to the decision-making structure under the collective agreement
and to the decision-making structure created by statute, namely,
the OLRB.  The Act grants jurisdiction to the OLRB to address
violations of the Act that occur after the expiry of the
collective agreement:  s. 96(1) and (4).  Section 114(1) of the
Act provides that this jurisdiction is exclusive to the Board:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers
          conferred upon it by or under this Act and to determine all
          questions of fact or law that arise in any matter before it, and
          the action or decision of the Board thereon is final and
          conclusive for all purposes….</pre>
      <pre>[23] The Union, representing the respondents, argued before the
OLRB that the increase in the brokerage fees following the expiry
of the collective agreement amounted to a breach of the
employer's obligation to bargain in good faith, as mandated by
ss. 17, 59 and 60 of the Act.  The OLRB has been given exclusive
jurisdiction to deal with this issue.   The respondents now
attempt to characterise the claim as a breach of private
contract.   Ironically, the appellant advanced the same
characterisation of the dispute before the OLRB. However, the
fact that one or both of the parties took positions before the
OLRB that were inconsistent with their respective postures before
the application judge is of no consequence in determining the
issue of jurisdiction of the respective tribunals.  The
respondents’ claim, to use the language of Weber, clearly “arises
from the collective agreement”, and therefore is not properly
before the courts.
[24] Accordingly, for the above reasons, I would allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of Brennan J., and enter an order
dismissing the application below.  However, I would not allow the
appellant its costs. This application before Brennan J. was but
one more occurrence in a protracted labour dispute that has yet
to be resolved.  The respondents were encouraged to bring it, in
part at least, because of the objections taken by the appellant
to the OLRB hearing the matter.  In the circumstances, there
should be no costs to either party here or below.
