    <pre>WEILER J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue on this appeal is whether Sharpe J. 1 was correct
in declaring s. 136 of the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2, to
be of no force and effect because it violates the denominational
guarantee contained in s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867.2
Section 93(1) states that no law may prejudicially affect any
right or privilege that Roman Catholics had by law concerning
Separate Schools at the time of Confederation.
[2]  For ease of reference, s. 136 is produced below:
               136(1) For the purpose of maintaining the distinctiveness of
          separate schools, the Roman Catholic separate school board may
          require as a condition of employment that teachers hired by the
          board after the ten school year period mentioned in subsection
          135(6)3 agree to respect the philosophy and traditions of Roman
          Catholic separate schools in the performance of their duties.</pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Subject to subsection (1), and despite section 24 of
          the Human Rights Code,  section 5 of the said code applies to
          ensure that such teachers employed by a Roman Catholic school
          board will enjoy equal opportunity in respect of their
          employment, advancement and promotion by the board.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  If it is finally determined by a
          court that subsection (1) or (2)
          prejudicially affects a right or privilege
          with respect to denominational schools
          guaranteed by the constitution of Canada,
          subsections (1) and (2) are repealed, it
          being the intention of the Legislature that
          the remaining provisions of the Act are
          separate from and independent of the said
          subsections.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The reference to s. 24 of the Human Rights Code, R.S.O.
1990, c. H. 19 in s. 136(2) is of central concern in this appeal.
Section 24 of the Code would allow a Roman Catholic school board
to give a preference in hiring and promotion to Roman Catholics
if it could be shown that this was a bona fide occupational
requirement. Subsection (2) of s. 136 of the Education Act
prevents the application of s. 24 of the Code.
[4]  Read as a whole, s. 136 means that if a teacher agrees to
respect the philosophy of a separate school, a Roman Catholic
school board cannot take into consideration the religion of the
teacher in making employment decisions. For the reasons that
follow, I am of the opinion that Sharpe J. was correct in
declaring s. 136 of the Education Act to be of no force and
effect because it violates s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act.
[5]  Section 136 was enacted after this court&#146;s decision
upholding the constitutionality of the legislation which extended
full funding to Roman Catholic separate secondary schools: see
Reference Re Act to Amend the Education Act (1986), 53 O.R. (2d)
513 (C.A.). When the decision of the Court of Appeal on the
Reference was appealed to the Supreme Court, that Court was asked
to also give its opinion as to the constitutionality of the then
recently enacted s. 136. The Supreme Court declined to do so,
however, in the absence of an opinion from this court on this
issue; see [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1148.  Certain individual separate
school supporters and trustees of Roman Catholic separate school
boards then brought an application for a declaration that s. 136
infringed the rights guaranteed by s. 93(1) of the Constitution
Act, 1867.  In the decision appealed from, Sharpe J. granted the
declaration, and declared that s. 136 was of no force and effect.
[6]  In Attorney General of Quebec v. Greater Hull School Board,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 575 at 582, Chouinard J. noted that in order to
claim protection under s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867,
the following conditions must be met:
               a)   there must be a right or privilege affecting a
          denominational school;
               b)   enjoyed by a particular class of
          persons,
               c)   by law;
               d)   in effect at the time of Union
          (Confederation);
               e)   and which is prejudicially
          affected.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In my opinion, this appeal requires the resolution of two
issues:
          1)       Did Sharpe J. correctly determine that at the time of
          confederation Roman Catholic separate schools had the right or
          privilege by law to prefer Roman Catholics in hiring or
          promoting a teacher?
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)   Even if there was a right to prefer
          Roman Catholics at the time of Confederation
          did Sharpe J. correctly determine that s. 136
          prejudicially affects a right or privilege
          guaranteed under s. 93(1)?
          </pre>
    <pre>          For the reasons that follow, the answer to
          both questions is in the affirmative and the
          appeal is dismissed.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     
     1.        Did Sharpe J. correctly determine that at the time of
          Confederation Roman Catholic separate schools had the right or
          privilege by law to prefer Roman Catholics in hiring or promoting
          a teacher?
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The Act to Restore to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada
Certain Rights in Respect to Separate Schools, 26 Vict., c. 5
(&#147;the Scott Act&#148;)4 was the last statute respecting separate
schools passed prior to Confederation. Section 2 of the Scott Act
gave Roman Catholics the right to establish a Separate School for
Roman Catholics, provided there were a minimum of five persons
within a school section or three square mile radius, and the
right to elect &#147;... trustees for the management&#148; of the schools.
Section 7 of the Scott Act gave trustees of Roman Catholic
separate schools in Upper Canada all the powers possessed by
trustees of Common Schools. Under the Common Schools Act, 22
Vict. c. 64 s. 27 trustees had the right to &#147;&#133;contract with and
employ teachers&#148;  and, under s. 79(8)(b), the right,  &#147;to
determine ... the terms of employing them; the amount of their
remuneration and the duties which they are to perform&#148;.
[9]  Sharpe J. considered the evidence before him in the light of
this legislation at p. 52:</pre>
    <pre>               The evidence shows that at the time, the Catholic teacher
          was seen as the only possible means of imparting a Catholic
          curriculum. There appears to be no doubt that at the time of
          Confederation, separate school boards did take matters of faith
          into account in the hiring of teachers and that this was accepted
          not only by Roman Catholics but by the rest of the community
          including those in the common schools.
          </pre>
    <pre>               While a practice that existed without
          statutory sanction at the time of
          Confederation does not qualify as a &#147;right or
          privilege&#148; within the meaning of s. 93(1):
          (see Reference re An Act to Amend the
          Education Act (Ontario),  [1987] 1 S.C.R.
          1148 at pp. 1177-78, 40 D.L.R. (4th) 18)
          [hereinafter referred to as the Bill 30
          Reference]; a right capable of attracting the
          protection of s. 93(1) may be &#147;implicit&#148; in
          broadly defined statutory powers (at p.
          1183).
</pre>
    <pre>     He concluded at p. 54:
               In the light of this statutory framework and the climate of
          religious animosity that prevailed in pre-Confederation Canada,
          it is my view that by conferring the power on separate school
          trustees to select and employ teachers, the colonial legislature
          contemplated that such power could be exercised preferentially in
          favour of Roman Catholics. As already noted, an implicit power
          does qualify for protection under s. 93(1).
          </pre>
    <pre>                             . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               On a fair reading of the Scott Act,
          together with the Common Schools Act, at the
          time of Confederation separate school
          trustees did enjoy, by law, the right to
          prefer Roman Catholics when hiring teachers.
          While the right is not explicit, the power to
          hire teachers is conferred in broad and
          general terms. Given the purpose and
          philosophy of separate schools and the
          prevailing attitudes of the day with respect
          to religion, I conclude that separate school
          trustees did have the implicit legal right to
          prefer those of the Roman Catholic faith when
          making employment decisions relating to
          teachers.
</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant &#150; the Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#146;
Federation (&#147;OSSTF&#148;)  - and the intervenor &#150; the Canadian Civil
Liberties Association (&#147;CCLA&#148;)  - submit that Sharpe J. erred in
concluding that trustees of Roman Catholic Separate Schools had
the implicit right or privilege &#147;by law&#148; to prefer Roman Catholic
teachers when exercising their powers to employ a teacher. They
submit that a &#147;right or privilege&#148; that is protected from
legislative interference under s. 93(1) must be one that is
expressly found in a statutory provision in existence at the time
of Confederation. OSSTF and CCLA acknowledge that in the Bill 30
Reference, supra, at 1183, Wilson J., held that, despite the fact
that the Common Schools Act did not confer an express power on
school trustees to prescribe the courses to be taught in schools,
such a right was implicit in the legislation. Wilson J. therefore
recognized that a right or privilege protected by law may be one
that is implicit in the legislation. OSSTF and CCLA submit that
the approach of Wilson J. in the Bill 30 Reference has, however,
no application to this case as the issue does not engage equality
of funding for education and that Sharpe J. erred in applying
this approach.
[11] I disagree. The purposive approach adopted by Sharpe J. is
dictated by s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and it is
therefore applicable to this case. As noted by Wilson J. in the
Bill 30 Reference, supra, at 1196:
               &#133; s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act was intended to give
          constitutional value to the rights and privileges conferred in
          the Scott Act and the  Common Schools Act of 1859. Section 93(1)
          should, in my view, be interpreted in a way which implements its
          clear purpose which was to provide a firm protection for Roman
          Catholic education in the Province of Ontario&#133;.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[12] The purposive approach is of general application and is not
limited to questions of funding. It has been subsequently applied
by Iacobucci J. on behalf of the majority of the Supreme Court in
Ontario. Home Builders&#146; Association. v York Region Board of
Education (1996), 137 D.L.R. (4th) 449 at 489 (S.C.C.).
[13] A related submission of the OSSTF and the CCLA is that there
is no language in any applicable statute in existence at the time
of Confederation that supports an implicit right to discriminate
on the basis of religion in the employment of teachers in
Separate Schools. This submission would have the Court adopt a
formalistic approach to interpretation. Again, such a submission
must be rejected.  As stated in Ontario. Home Builders&#146;
Association, supra, at 489 by Iacobucci J.:
               &#133; recent jurisprudence, including Greater Montreal
          Protestant School Board v. Quebec (Attorney-General), [1989] 1
          S.C.R. 377 at p. 402, 57 D.L.R. (4th) 521 (S.C.C.), has continued
          to emphasize that a formalistic  interpretation of s. 93(1) may
          not in fact protect the substance of the guarantee contained
          therein:
                         It is true that the rights or
               privileges under ordinary law to which s.
               93(1) refers have been frozen at
               Confederation. But just like the basic
               provincial power which, as Viscount Cave
               explained, was not &#145;stereotyped&#146; at the
               Union, the exception to that power has also
               matured over time through judicial
               interpretation. The approach courts have
               taken to the interpretation of the expression
               &#145;with respect to Denominational Schools&#146; in
               cases such as Hull, supra demonstrates that
               the law in force &#145;at the Union&#146; cannot on its
               own set the content of the constitutional
               rights in s. 93(1).
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[14]  Attempting to get around this holding, OSSTF and CCLA point
out that the right of Catholic trustees to employ or promote
teachers was limited by a number of other provisions in both the
Scott Act and the Common Schools Act. Teachers teaching in
separate schools were required to possess &#147;certificates of
qualifications&#148; in the same manner as common school teachers: s.
13, Scott Act. At the time of applying for their teaching
certificates, teachers had to furnish proof of good moral
character and be a subject of her Majesty: ss. 80 and 99, Common
Schools Act. In addition, the Governor had the power to appoint a
Council of Public Instruction and to pass regulations for the
&#147;organization, government, discipline of Common Schools and for
the classification of Schools and Teachers&#148;: ss. 114 and 119,
Common Schools Act.   Finally, separate schools were subject to
inspection by the Chief Superintendent of Education: s. 26, Scott
Act.
[15] OSSTF and CCLA submit that, because the authority held by
separate school trustees was subject to the authority of the
Council of Public Instruction and the Chief Superintendent, the
trustees did not have the right or privilege to consider
religious affiliation when deciding whether to employ or promote
a teacher. Religious affiliation, they say, is a qualification
over which the separate school trustees had no authority. They
submit that Sharpe J. erred because his reasons do not consider
these provisions or the preamble in the Scott Act which gave
Roman Catholics &#147;certain rights&#148; with a view to bringing &#147;&#133; the
provisions of the Law respecting Separate Schools more in harmony
with the provisions of the Law respecting Common Schools.&#148;
[16]  These submissions, however, are not in accord with the
purposive approach required by Ontario Home Builders&#146; and the
Bill 30 Reference, supra.  The purpose of the public schools, or
&#147;Common Schools&#148;, was to enable the teaching of a common
curriculum wholly independent from religious doctrine because
children of many denominations attended those schools: see Quebec
Association of Protestant School Boards et al v. Attorney-General
of Quebec et al. (1985), 21 D.L.R. (4th) 36 at 44-45 (Que. S.C.)
The purpose of granting to Roman Catholics the right to funding
for separate schools and the right to elect trustees to manage
their own schools was to enable the teachings of the Roman
Catholic faith to be transmitted to the children of Roman
Catholics while educating them in secular subjects. See Brophy v.
A.G. of Manitoba, [1895] A.C. 202 (J.C.P.C.) per the Lord
Chancellor at p. 214; the dissenting reasons of Anglin J. in Tiny
Separate School Trustees v. The King, [1927] S.C.R. 637 at 656,
adopted by this court in Reference re Education Act (Ontario) and
Minority Language Rights, (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 1 at 55-56;
Caldwell v. Stuart (1984), 15 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) at 608, 618-
19, and 624; and Canadian Civil Liberties Association  v. Ontario
(1990), 71 O.R. (2d) 341 (C.A.) at 363, 367. At the time of
Confederation, when the one room schoolhouse with only one
teacher was not uncommon, it would have been unthinkable that
anyone but a Roman Catholic could impart the Roman Catholic faith
to students. Although custom is not protected by s. 93(1), the
history and purpose of s. 93(1) cannot be ignored. To disallow
consideration of religion when hiring a teacher would have
defeated the purpose of the Scott Act. Thus, the control
possessed by the Council of Education could not be used to defeat
this constitutional guarantee of Roman Catholic educational
rights: see Bill 30 Reference, supra, at 1194-95. The right to
hire was guaranteed by law, as was the right to management of the
schools. No regulation passed by the Council of Education could
supercede these powers.
[17] CCLA also submitted that the power to consider the religious
affiliation of the teacher in employment was contrary to the pre-
Confederation Act Respecting the Rectories (Can) 14 &amp;15 Vict., c.
175 (1852) [the &#147;Imperial Statute of 1852&#148;]. This statute
disestablished the Church of England in the Province of Canada
and, it was submitted, enshrined the principle of equality of
religions. As a result, CCLA submits that the hiring of Roman
Catholic teachers for separate schools was but a practice not
protected by law. Sharp J. rejected this submission on the basis
that the denomination of teachers was the explicit subject of
legislation relating to separate schools prior to confederation.
He stated at p. 53:
               Until the passage of An Act to Amend the Law Relating to
          Separate Schools in Upper Canada, 18 Vict., c. 131 (&#147;Tache Act&#148;),
          the right to establish a Roman Catholic separate school was
          dependent upon the faith of the teacher in the common school. If
          one of the teachers in the common schools was a Catholic, then no
          separate school could exist. If a Catholic teacher was hired by
          the common school, any separate school that had been established
          was required to be closed. An effect of the Tache Act  was to
          permit the establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic
          separate schools regardless of the religion of the teacher in the
          common school.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[18] In so holding Sharpe J. reviewed the historical context in
which the Imperial Statute of 1852 was enacted, correctly
rejecting the submission of CCLA that the statute affected any
right that Catholic trustees might have to employ or promote
teachers in Roman Catholic schools. One of the concerns at the
time of the Rebellion of 1837 was the fact that land was reserved
and given to the clergy of the Anglican Church and no other
religion. After the Rebellion, the division of clergy reserves
took place among other denominations in 1840; Anglican rectories
that had been endowed were disestablished in 1852; and clergy
reserves were abolished in 1854. This history reveals that the
legislation upon which CCLA relies has everything to do with
churches and nothing to do with schools. Even accepting the
argument that the legislation conferred the right to practice
one&#146;s religion within reason, that right was not, at the time,
transformed into a right to be employed in any Roman Catholic
separate school.
[19] Even if the Imperial Statute of 1852 was intended to affect
employment in Roman Catholic Separate Schools, it is to be
interpreted as subject to the Scott Act for two reasons. First,
the more recent enactment of the Scott Act just prior to
Confederation gives it precedence over the Imperial Statute of
1852. The rules of statutory interpretation state that &#147;the more
recent expression of the will of the legislature should be
retained&#148;: Pierre-André Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation
in Canada, 2nd ed. (1991), at 301. Second, the Scott Act, being
specific legislation in relation to education, is considered to
be an exception to other more general legislation, such as the
Imperial Statute of 1852: see Elmer Dreidger, Construction of
Statutes, 2nd ed. (1983), at p. 227.
[20] The appellants&#146; submission concerning the Imperial Statute
also does not take into consideration the decision in Hirsch v.
The Protestant Board of School Commissioners of Montreal, [1926]
S.C.R. 246, wherein Anglin, C.J.C. at 269-270 stated that neither
Protestant nor Catholic school boards could be compelled to hire
non-adherents as teachers. On appeal to the Privy Council, [1928]
A.C. 200, Viscount Cave L.C., in discussing the right or
privilege which &#147;any class of persons had by law at the time of
union&#148; stated at 212:
               The Roman Catholics in Montreal or Quebec formed a class of
          persons who had the right and privilege of having their schools
          controlled and managed by Commissioners of that religious
          persuasion and the teachers examined by Examiners of the same
          persuasion; and like privileges belonged to the Protestants of
          each city with regard to the schools controlled by the Protestant
          Board of Commissioners. This view is confirmed not only by
          expressions contained in the judgments of this Board in the
          Manitoba cases (City of Winnipeg v. Barrett, [1892] A.C. 445, 453
          to 456; Brophy v. Attorney-General of Manitoba, [1895] A.C. 202,
          226, 227) and in the Ottawa case (Ottawa Separate School Trustees
          v. Mackell, [1917] A.C. 62, 69), but also by the emphatic
          statement of the experienced judges who dealt with this matter in
          the Canadian Courts.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[21] As established by Viscount Cave, at the time of
Confederation, Catholics had the privilege of having Catholic
examiners examine teachers who taught in their schools. The
necessary  implication is that the right or privilege to exclude
teachers on the basis of religion also existed by law at that
time.
[22] In addition, in Reference re Education Act (Quebec), supra,
Gonthier J. stated at p. 580 that outside of the cities of Quebec
and Montreal, the right to have a denominational school did not
include the right or privilege of admitting children of other
faiths. (In Quebec and Montreal, the denominational schools had
common school status). The implication again is that if the
denominational school did not have common school status there was
a corollary right or privilege to exclude non-adherents to the
faith.
[23] The appellants make the further submission that, because the
qualifications of teachers are regulated, the trustees are not
empowered to take into consideration the religion of the teacher
because this would impose an additional qualification over and
above those already provided for. This submission also fails. The
right to modify an implicit power was recognized by Beetz J. in
Greater Montreal Protestant School Board , supra, at 546 where he
adopted the submission of the Attorney-General of Quebec that
(translation):
               The trustees of dissentient schools, whether Catholic or
          Protestant, are therefore subject to the regulation of curricula.
          However, in view of the constitutional protection they are given,
          they may adapt these curricula by offering them in a manner
          consistent with their religious values&#133;.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24] In a similar vein, the trustees of Roman Catholic secondary
separate schools are subject to the requirement that all teachers
hired must be qualified. However, in view of the constitutional
protection given under s. 93 they may adapt the power to employ
by offering employment in a manner consistent with their
religious values.
[25] If the Imperial Statute had brought freedom of religion into
Roman Catholic separate schools it would not be possible to
dismiss a teacher for denominational cause. The right of Roman
Catholic separate schools to dismiss a teacher based on serious
departures from the teachings of the Catholic faith
(denominational cause) is not disputed by the appellants. See
Caldwell v. Stewart, supra., Re Essex County Roman Catholic
Separate School Board v. Porter (1978), 21 O.R.(2d) 255 (C.A.)
per Zuber J.A. at 257-258. Implicit in the recognition of the
constitutional right to dismiss a teacher for denominational
cause is an acknowledgment of the importance of the faith of the
teacher to Catholic education.   In my opinion, this right to
dismiss necessarily has as its corollary a right to consider the
faith of a prospective teacher.
[26] Given the above, it is my opinion that Sharpe J. correctly
concluded that, at the time of Confederation, Roman Catholic
separate school trustees did have the implicit legal right to
prefer persons of the Roman Catholic faith when making employment
decisions relating to teachers.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.        Did Sharpe J. correctly determine that s. 136
          prejudicially affects a right or privilege relating to the
          denominational aspect of separate schools?</pre>
    <pre>[27] OSSTF and CCLA submit that, even if the ability to prefer
Roman Catholic teachers in employment decisions was guaranteed
&#147;by law&#148; at the time of Confederation, s. 136 does not infringe
s. 93(1). They submit that the evidence in this case does not
support the conclusion of Sharpe J. that the ability to hire on
the basis of religion is necessary to preserve the Catholic
character of the schools.
[28] One response to this submission is that the right to hire
and to promote is in and of itself a denominational guarantee and
is protected from scrutiny. On this view it is not necessary to
justify the right to preferentially hire or promote a teacher for
a Catholic high school. I disagree with this position for the
reasons expressed in Branch Affiliates v. Dufferin-Peel Roman
Catholic Separate School Board released concurrently with these
reasons.
[29] Another response, and the one which I adopt, is that the
evidence does support the conclusion of Sharpe J. that the
ability to hire preferentially on the basis of religion will be
necessary to preserve the Catholic character of Roman Catholic
Separate Schools in many cases. Section 136 prejudicially affects
the denominational guarantee because it prohibits any
consideration of religion when exercising the power to employ,
advance and promote teachers within a separate school system even
when such consideration is necessary to achieve the
denominational guarantee in s. 93 of the Constitution Act.
[30] There are two approaches one can use to arrive at this
conclusion. One is that the guarantee under s. 93(1) is a
nondenominational, or administrative, &#147;aspect&#148; of the right to a
Catholic education. On this view the right to preferentially hire
and promote is protected insofar as it is necessary to give
effect to the denominational guarantee of the Catholicity of the
school: Greater Montreal  Protestant School Board, supra, at per
Beetz J at p. 415. The other approach is that s. 136(2) violates
s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act because it prohibits the
preference of Roman Catholic teachers even where it can be
established by objective and cogent evidence that such preference
is a bona fide occupational requirement under the Human Rights
Code. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and the
adoption of the one or the other may depend on the manner in
which the issue arose.
[31] Under either approach, the evidence before Sharpe J.
justified his conclusion that s. 136 infringes the constitutional
guarantee under s. 93(1) because it takes away the right to even
consider whether a teacher is Catholic or not in making
employment decisions in Roman Catholic Separate Schools.
[32] The appellants also submit that Sharpe J. erred in his
assessment of the evidence by assessing the evidence on the basis
of the subjective belief of the affiants.  However, Sharpe J. did
not, as the appellants suggest, assess the evidence solely on
this basis.  Rather, he agreed that the evidence had to be
assessed in an objective fashion and proceeded on this basis.  At
the same time he bore in mind that the subjective perspective of
the affiants as to the adverse effect of an influx of non-
Catholic teachers on the Catholicity of their schools was also a
relevant factor to be taken into account. There are two reasons
he was entitled to do so. Firstly the very reason for the
constitutional guarantee is based on the conclusion that there is
a link between the transmission of religious values and
education. Such a link canot be established other than by
reference to evidence that is, at least in part, necessarily
subjective.  Secondly, the right of Catholics to manage Catholic
separate schools is protected under s. 93(1) and the perspective
of the rights holders is a legitimate consideration. Accordingly,
the approach used by Sharpe J. to assess the evidence was not
flawed.
[33] The main evidence before Sharpe J. consisted of the
affidavit of Msgr. Murphy, a Roman Catholic priest who has a
Ph.D. in education and who is Catholic Education Director of the
Ontario Separate School Trustees Association. Msgr. Murphy&#146;s
evidence was that the curriculum could not be delivered from a
truly Catholic perspective by non-Catholics.  The evidence of
Professor Isajiw, a sociology professor, supported Msgr. Murphy.
His evidence was to the effect that the Catholicity of a school
is dependent upon the commitment of the teacher to the basic
beliefs, values, attitudes and knowledge of Catholicism.
Professor Isajiw cited sociological evidence that the
transmission of beliefs, values, attitudes and knowledge is
accomplished both directly and indirectly from teacher to
student, whether the subject being taught is religion or another
subject. While knowledge can be transmitted by a non-Catholic
teacher, the transmission of beliefs, values and attitudes are
different. Sharpe J. recognized the distinction. He was entitled
to do so. The fact that not all Catholic teachers are practicing
Catholics or that their views on various questions may differ
does not detract from his conclusion. As stated by him at 67:
               A constitutional guarantee is an ideal but must function in
          a human context. This means that it will almost certainly never
          be fully realized. The failure of a human institution to achieve
          perfection surely cannot defeat the ideal of the guarantee.
</pre>
    <pre>[34] The evidence establishes that the aim of Catholic education
is not merely the transmission of knowledge and development of
skills, but rather the integral formation of the whole person
according to a vision of life that is revealed in the Catholic
tradition. Religious faith on the part of the teachers is a valid
consideration if the aim of the school to create a community of
believers with a distinct sense of the Catholic culture is to be
achieved.
[35] Religious faith will have a greater role to play in the
teaching of some subjects such as religion and family studies. I
agree with Sharpe J. that it would be inappropriate to attempt to
identify which, if any, courses would not require preference to
be given to religious faith. To do so would be to rewrite the
legislation. That is not the function of this court. To do so,
would also, in my opinion unduly compartmentalize the role of the
teacher within the school. The teacher who teaches algebra may
not have any opportunity to infuse the Catholic faith into this
course. This same teacher may, however, exert an important
influence insofar as the Catholicity of the school is concerned
in relation to extra-curricular activities such as attendance at
Mass, choir practice, or the establishment of Catholic social
clubs.
[36] Section 136 violates the denominational guarantee in s. 93
of the Constitution in other respects. Section 136(1) enables a
school board to require the undertaking of a teacher to respect
the philosophy and traditions of the separate school and no more.
Such an undertaking falls well short of the active pursuit of the
goal of indoctrinating students in the teachings of the Catholic
religion, which is the constitutionally protected aim of the
separate schools. Trustees making a decision as to whether or not
to hire a teacher have a right to consider how active the teacher
will be in promoting the goals of Catholicism in order to
preserve the Catholicity of the school and not merely that the
teacher passively acquiesce in these goals. The subsection also
potentially affects the right to dismiss for denominational
cause. A Catholic teacher who married a divorced person in a
civil ceremony as in Caldwell v. Stewart, supra,  could argue
that he or she nevertheless respected the philosophy or
traditions of the separate school as much as any non-Catholic
teacher and was entitled not to be dismissed. The opening words
of s. 136(2) make the subsection subject to subsection (1). These
are two additional reasons why s. 136, as a whole, infringes the
rights guaranteed in s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 relating
to the denominational aspect of separate schools.</pre>

</pre>
    <pre>WHEREAS it is just and proper to restore to Roman Catholics in
Upper Canada certain rights which they formerly enjoyed in

may convene a public meeting of persons desiring to establish a
Separate School for Roman Catholics, in such school section or
ward, for the election of Trustees for the management of the
same.</pre>
    <pre>                             . . . .

    <pre>13.  The Teachers of Separate Schools under this Act shall be
subject to the same examinations, and receive their certificates
of qualifications, in the same manner as Common School Teachers
generally; provided that persons qualified by law as Teachers,
either in Upper or Lower Canada, shall be considered qualified
Teachers for the purposes of this Act.</pre>
    <pre>                             . . . .</pre>
    <pre>26.  The Roman Catholic Separate Schools, (with their Registers),

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1    The reasons of Sharpe J. are reported at (1997), 38 O.R.
(3d) 37 (Gen. Div.).
2    The first issue decided by Sharpe J. was that s. 136 only
applied to secondary schools, not elementary schools. Secondly he
held that s. 136 applied at the point of hiring as well as after
a teacher had been hired. No appeal has been taken from these two
portions of the judgment.
3    The reference in s. 136(1) to,&#148; the ten school year period
mentioned in subsection 135(6)&#148; is a reference to the fact that
when public funding was extended to Roman Catholic separate high
schools a number of teachers, including non-Catholic teachers,
who were then employed by the public school boards were
designated and transferred to the Roman Catholic school boardsin
order to teach the large number of students who would be
transferring from the public school system to the separate school
system.
4    For ease of reference the text of certain provisions of the
Scott Act, the Common Schools Act and other relevant legislation
is attached as an appendix to these reasons.</pre></td>
