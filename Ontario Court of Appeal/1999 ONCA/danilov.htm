    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Bell J. dated March 19, 1999 made at
Ottawa.

</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal from the decision of Bell J. on a  motion
for  summary judgment wherein she determined that the plaintiff&#146;s
contract of employment at the point of his termination included a
provision  that  he was employed at pleasure and was,  therefore,
not  entitled  to  any notice of termination. As  a  result,  she
dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s action.
[2]  In our view, Bell J. erred in not sending this matter on to
trial.
[3]  Vital to the resolution of this litigation is the
determination of the precise terms and conditions of the
plaintiff&#146;s contract of employment at termination.
[4]  The defendant says that, because the letter offering
employment to the plaintiff in 1977 said that the plaintiff&#146;s
tenure would be at pleasure, the terms under which the plaintiff
worked almost twenty-one years later must be the same. The
plaintiff says that over those 21 years his terms of employment
changed in many ways. These included the right accorded to him by
the defendant to receipt of severance pay on termination which,
the plaintiff says, is incompatible with employment at pleasure.
[5]  This factual conflict requires a trial to determine the
terms of the contract applicable to the plaintiff on termination.
[6]  Moreover, since the decision of Bell J., the Supreme Court
of Canada has released its decision in Wells v. Newfoundland (15
September 1999). This decision appears to shed a new light on
contracts of employment covering what the court describes as &#147;the
feudal condition of servants serving at the pleasure of the
Crown.&#148;  It seems to suggest that such contracts should now be
viewed more strictly through the lens of modern employment law.
[7]  Hence, in this case, the question whether a contract of
employment at pleasure disentitles an employee to compensation
when it is terminated is very much alive. So, too, on the facts
of this case, is the question whether the defendant&#146;s power to
fix the tenure of appointment permits the defendant to contract
on an &#147;at pleasure&#148; basis.
[8]  In our view, particularly in light of Wells, these issues
also justify sending this matter on to trial.
[9]  Finally, we do not think that the existence of the statutory
grievance procedure provided by the Public Service Staff
Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.P-35 (the &#147;PSSRA&#148;) justifies the
dismissal of this action. That procedure does not permit the
plaintiff to take this dispute to binding adjudication by a third
party. He can do no more than raise it as a complaint with his
employer. Moreover, unlike the circumstances in Johnson-Paquette
v. Canada (1998), 159 F.T.R. 42, the plaintiff here did not agree
through collective bargaining to have the grievance procedure in
the PSSRA serve as his dispute resolution mechanism.
[10] Hence the rationale of Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 929 is simply not applicable. Where the statutory
grievance procedure is neither agreed to, nor is a mechanism
providing final and binding adjudication of this dispute, that
procedure cannot be said to have exclusive jurisdiction over the
dispute to the exclusion of the courts.
[11] Finally, where as here the grievance procedure is available
not because it is incorporated into a collective agreement but
because of the PSSRA itself, we do not think Parliament intended
that the grievance procedure have exclusive jurisdiction over
grievable disputes. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the
PSSRA does not provide that this grievance procedure is to be a
mandatory one meant to exclude the employee&#146;s right to sue.
Rather it is a process which, in the language of the legislation,
the employee &#147;is entitled&#148; to use. But the employee may also
access the courts.
[12] We therefore conclude that the statutory grievance procedure
does not bar this action.
[13] We would therefore allow the appeal with costs. We would
vary the order below to dismiss both motions for summary
judgment, without costs.
