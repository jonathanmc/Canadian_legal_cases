    <pre>On  appeal  from  the  judgment of Mr.  Justice  McWilliam  dated
November 27, 1996.
                                        
</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A. (Dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>The Issues:</pre>
    <pre>     Did the principal debtor execute the bond in issue?
     Is a surety obligated to honour the terms of a performance
     bond if the principal debtor failed to deliver the performance
     bond to the obligee?
          If the surety was otherwise bound to honour the terms of the
     performance bond, did the obligee fail to perform its obligations
     under its contract with the principal debtor thereby relieving
     the surety of its obligations under the performance bond?</pre>
    <pre>Facts:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Carleton Roman Catholic Separate School Board (the
School Board) decided to build a new school in Kanata, Ontario.
It retained Paul D'Aoust Construction Ltd. (D'Aoust) as
construction manager to oversee the tendering process, the
awarding of contracts, and the work done on the project. In the
summer of 1989, D'Aoust put out a call for tenders on the various
contracts needed to complete the project.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Preston &amp; Lieff Glass Contracts Inc. (P &amp; L) bid on the
contract for the installation of windows, skylights and aluminum
entrances to the school.  The tender documents required that the
successful bidder supply a performance bond and a labour and
material payment bond.  Only the former is relevant to this
appeal.  The performance bond was for the protection of the
School Board in the event that the successful bidder did not
perform as required under the terms of the contract.  The tender
documents provided as follows in paragraph 12:</pre>
    <pre>          12.  PERFORMANCE BOND AND LABOUR AND
          MATERIALS PAYMENT BOND</pre>
    <pre>          (FOR ALL BIDS OVER $100,000.00 ONLY)</pre>
    <pre>          i.)  The Contractor shall be required to
               provide a 50% Performance Bond
               covering faithful performance of
               the Contract, ...</pre>
    <pre>[3]  P &amp; L was awarded the contract in August 1989.  On September
17, 1989, D'Aoust sent P &amp; L copies of the contract for execution
and written instructions requesting that:</pre>
    <pre>          The following documents must also be returned
          with the contract: ...</pre>
    <pre>          For contracts above $100,000.00 provide the
          performance bond (50%) ... .</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The terms of the contract provided for total payment to P &amp;
L in the amount of about $410,000.00.  The contract terms
incorporated the requirement set out in the tender documents that
P &amp; L &#147;promptly&#148; provide a performance bond equal to 50% of the
contract price.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On September 25, 1989, P &amp; L wrote to D'Aoust confirming its
obligation to obtain the performance bond.  The letter said:</pre>
    <pre>          Pursuant to your instructions, we will be
          providing you with bonding in accordance with
          the Specific Instructions to Bidders dated
          June 27, 1989 [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The letter went on to indicate that the cost of the bond was
$2,608.00.  P &amp; L took the position that this cost was an extra
and was not part of the contract price.  D'Aoust, however,
indicated that the cost of the bond was included in the contract
price.  D'Aoust's interpretation was apparently accepted by P &amp;
L.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In October 1989, P &amp; L obtained a performance bond as
required under the terms of its contract.  The bond was obtained
through the agent of Markel Insurance Company of Canada (Markel)
and covered a two-year performance period.  The bond referred to
Markel as the surety, P &amp; L as the principal and D'Aoust as the
obligee.  The terms of the bond included the following:</pre>
    <pre>          KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS THAT PRESTON &amp;
          LIEFF GLASS CONTRACTS INC.</pre>
    <pre>          as Principal, hereinafter called the
          Principal, and MARKEL INSURANCE COMPANY OF
          CANADA a corporation created and existing
          under the laws of Canada and duly authorized
          to transact the business of Suretyship in
          Canada as Surety, hereinafter called the
          Surety, are held and firmly bound unto PAUL
          D'AOUST CONSTRUCTION LTD.</pre>
    <pre>          as Obligee, hereinafter called the Obligee,
          in the amount of --</pre>
    <pre>          TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED
          AND THIRTY-SIX 50/100 Dollars ($205,336.50)</pre>
    <pre>          lawful money of Canada, for the payment of
          which sum, well and truly to be made, the
          Principal and the Surety bind themselves,
          their heirs, executors, administrators,
          successors and assigns jointly and severally,
          firmly by these presents.</pre>
    <pre>                              ...</pre>
    <pre>          NOW, THEREFORE, THE CONDITION OF THIS
          OBLIGATION is such that if the Principal
          shall promptly and faithfully perform the
          Contract then this obligation shall be null
          and void;  otherwise it shall remain in full
          force and effect.</pre>
    <pre>          Whenever the Principal shall be, and declared
          by the Obligee to be, in default under the
          Contract, the Obligee having performed the
          Obligee's obligations thereunder, the Surety
          may promptly remedy the default, or shall
          promptly</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  complete the Contract in accordance with
          its terms and conditions:</pre>
    <pre>          (2)  obtain a bid or bids for submission to
          the Obligee for completing the Contract in
          accordance with its terms and conditions, and
          upon determination by the Obligee and the
          Surety of the lowest responsible bidder,
          arrange for a contract between such bidder
          and the Obligee and make available as work
          progresses (even though there should be a
          default, or a succession of defaults, under
          the contract or contracts of completion,
          arranged under this paragraph) sufficient
          funds to pay the cost of completion less the
          balance of the Contract price;  but not
          exceeding, including other costs and damages
          for which the Surety may be liable hereunder,
          the amount set forth in the first paragraph
          hereof.  The term &quot;balance of the Contract
          price&quot;, as used in this paragraph, shall mean
          the total amount payable by the Obligee to
          the Principal under the Contract, less the
          amount properly paid by the Obligee to the
          Principal.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The contract referred to in the performance bond was the
contract between D&#146;Aoust and P &amp; L.  The contract was, by
reference, made part of the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The bond contained places for the signatures of Markel and P
&amp; L.  It was signed by the broker on behalf of Markel in October
1989 and forwarded to P &amp; L.  In accordance with the practice in
the industry, Markel received an unsigned copy of the bond from
its broker.  Markel was paid its fee for the bond by the broker
who then looked to P &amp; L for payment.  That fee ultimately came
from D&#146;Aoust as part of the contract price.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Markel had no direct contact with D'Aoust before issuing the
bond.  Under the terms of the bond D&#146;Aoust was not required to do
anything other than perform its obligations under the terms of
its contract with P &amp; L.  The bond did not require that D'Aoust
sign the bond or otherwise acknowledge its existence.  Once
Markel issued the bond it assumed that the bond was operative and
acted accordingly.  In March and April 1990, Markel requested and
received from D'Aoust updates on the performance of the contract
by P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  As of October 1989, the principals of P &amp; L were Kenneth
Daku, Bernard Lieff and Edward McGregor.  Two of those three
could sign documents on behalf of P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Markel and P &amp; L had a business relationship prior to Markel
executing the performance bond.  About a year earlier, Markel had
obtained an indemnity agreement from P &amp; L and the three
principals of P &amp; L in their personal capacities.  Under the
terms of that indemnity agreement, the three principals agreed to
personally indemnify Markel if it was required to make payment
under any performance bond.  The indemnity agreement specifically
provided that P &amp; L's failure to sign any bond would not release
the principals from their personal obligations under the
indemnity agreement.  Consequently, at the time Markel executed
the bond it was positioned to seek indemnity from the principles
personally if P &amp; L failed to perform its contract with D&#146;Aoust.
[1]
[10] The performance bond was signed on behalf of P &amp; L by Mr.
Daku and Mr. McGregor.  Mr. Daku testified that he probably
signed the bond in January 1990 after the formal contract with
D&#146;Aoust was executed.  Mr. McGregor testified that he signed the
bond only as &quot;an  administrative procedure.&quot;  He said that he
never intended that the bond would be delivered to D'Aoust as by
the fall of 1989 he had grown to mistrust Mr. Lieff and did not
want to be in a position where he could be liable under the terms
of the indemnity agreement he had signed with Markel.  Mr. Daku
also testified that P &amp; L never intended to be bound by the bond.
He said that the three principals had agreed, contrary to the
terms of P &amp; L&#146;s contract with D&#146;Aoust, that the bond would not
be turned over to D'Aoust.  Mr. Daku also testified, however,
that the principals knew that the bond might have to be delivered
to D'Aoust if P &amp; L wanted to receive payment on the contract.
As I understand Mr. Daku's evidence, he believed that the project
would be completed without any difficulty and that delivery of
the bond would never become an issue.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The school had to be built by the commencement of the school
year in September 1990.  P &amp; L started work in late 1989 or early
1990.  The work proceeded according to schedule in the early part
of 1990.  P &amp; L sent its first progress report to D'Aoust on
February 13, 1990 claiming payment of approximately $151,000.00.
On that same day an employee of D'Aoust wrote to P &amp; L stating:</pre>
    <pre>          ... I have not received from you the W.C.B.
          and your bond.</pre>
    <pre>          Your file has to be in order before we may
          release any money.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[12] It was D'Aoust's firm practice that no funds should be
released to a contractor until D'Aoust had received the
performance bond required under the terms of the contract.</pre>
    <pre>[13] On March 12, 1990, Mr. D'Aoust met with Mr. Daku and Mr.
McGregor.  They requested payment on the first progress report.
They also provided their second progress report.  There was
conflicting evidence as to what was said in the meeting
concerning delivery of the performance bond.  The trial judge
found, however, that neither Mr. Daku nor Mr. McGregor made any
misrepresentation as to delivery of the bond.  Both knew that the
bond had not been delivered to D'Aoust, and on the findings of
the trial judge, neither suggested to Mr. D&#146;Aoust that it had
been delivered.  The trial judge concluded that when Mr. D'Aoust
saw the cheque in the amount of $151,000.00 in his file he
mistakenly assumed that the bond had been delivered and released
that cheque to P &amp; L.  Mr. D'Aoust made it clear in his evidence
that had he known the bond was not in D'Aoust's hands, he would
not have released any funds to P &amp; L.  Under the terms of the
contract, D'Aoust could have withheld payment until receipt of
the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Mr. Daku testified that by mid-March he no longer trusted
Mr. Lieff.  Mr. Daku said that some time before the meeting with
Mr. D'Aoust on March 12, 1990, he removed the performance bond
from the files of P &amp; L.  He obliterated his signature on the
bond with &quot;white-out&quot; and kept the bond.  Mr. Daku said he took
the bond and obliterated his signature as it was his intention
that the bond was no longer binding and he wanted to be sure that
it would not be delivered to D'Aoust.  Mr. Daku kept the bond
until the trial of this action.  The original bond with Mr.
McGregor's signature and Mr. Daku's &quot;whited-out&quot; signature was
tendered at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[15] In early April 1990, D'Aoust became aware that P &amp; L had not
paid one of its suppliers. D&#146;Aoust refused to make any further
payment to P &amp; L until that problem was resolved.  Shortly
afterward, Mr. Daku was fired and left the job site, and P &amp; L
stopped work on the project.  This was a breach of its contract
with D'Aoust.  On May 1, 1990, after giving proper notice,
D'Aoust terminated its contract with P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[16] On May 10, 1990, D'Aoust wrote to Markel advising of a claim
on the performance bond.  D'Aoust eventually re-tendered the
contract and hired a new contractor to complete the work before
the commencement of the school year.  Markel denied liability
under the bond on the basis that the bond had not been delivered
to D'Aoust.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Although the trial judge found in Markel's favour, he did
address the quantum of the claim against Markel.  The parties
were agreed on the quantification of the claim in all aspects
save one.  The agreed upon damages equalled $68,035.53.  The
contested issue concerned the School Board's right to claim
certain legal expenses under the terms of the performance bond.
The trial judge found that the Board was entitled to claim legal
expenses, but further held that the proper amount of that claim
could only be determined after an assessment.  Damages are not in
issue on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Reasons of the Trial Judge:  [(1996), 31 C.L.R. (2d) 180]</pre>
    <pre>[18] The trial judge identified the central issue in these terms,
at p. 186:</pre>
    <pre>          ... Is it necessary that a surety bond be
          delivered to the obligee for the surety to be
          bound?  The facts are clear that the
          principal P &amp; L failed to (to choose a
          neutral term) give possession of the surety
          bond to the Board.  Does that constitute
          failure to deliver and if it does, what is
          the legal effect of such a failure?</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge canvassed three Canadian cases on point and
the leading Canadian text.  After acknowledging that the cases
were somewhat inconsistent, His Honour held that Markel could
only be liable under the bond if it was delivered to D'Aoust.  In
reaching that conclusion, he relied on the evidence of Mr. Shand,
Markel's representative.  According to the trial judge, it was
Mr. Shand&#146;s evidence that delivery by the broker on behalf of the
surety to P &amp; L was conditional upon the delivery by P &amp; L to the
obligee.  The trial judge also seems to have relied on the
evidence that neither Daku nor McGregor intended P &amp; L to be
bound by the bond when they signed it.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge saw his conclusion as furthering the policy
concerns underlying commercial relationships.  He observed, at
pp. 192-93:</pre>
    <pre>          It seems to me that appropriate commercial
          policy requires that execution and delivery
          of the bonds of sureties require precisely
          that.  Suretyship at common law requires a
          tripartite relationship involving the
          principal, the surety and the obligee.  The
          obligee ought to have the bond delivered to
          it so it can know precisely what obligations
          the principal and the surety are assuming in
          relation to it.  The obligee is in a position
          to enforce delivery practically as the
          paymaster.  Failure to do so would, of
          course, have practical consequences.  To take
          a more &quot;constructive&quot; view of delivery, in my
          opinion, invites a guessing game where
          principal obligors retain possession of bonds
          in circumstances which call for extensive
          inquiries into intentions and motives.</pre>
    <pre>The execution and delivery issues:</pre>
    <pre>[21] I do not think that the applicable law nor policy
considerations compel the conclusion reached by the trial judge.
Nor do I agree that Mr. Shand's evidence or the evidence
concerning the intentions of the principals of P &amp; L has any
relevance to the question of whether Markel was bound to honour
the bond even though it was not delivered to D'Aoust.  I will
deal first with the evidence and then the applicable law and
policy considerations.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Mr. Shand, Markel's witness, had some 50 years of experience
in the surety business.  He had no involvement in issuing this
bond and did not become aware of the bond until the School
Board's claim was under investigation by Markel.  The following
exchange occurred during Mr. Shand's examination-in-chief:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Now as you had indicated before, the
          bond, in this case, the performance bond, is
          signed by the attorney, in fact on behalf of
          Markel Insurance, and then delivered to
          Preston and Lieff Glass Contracts Inc.  What
          additional steps from the prospective of the
          surety are required before the surety
          considers that bond to be a binding
          performance bond?  What else needs to be
          done?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   Well, what has to be done, as far as I'm
          concerned, is that the company for whom the
          surety has lent its name as surety be certain
          that the bond is signed by the principal, who
          once signed, and once delivered, the two
          parties, the principal and the surety, are
          then jointly bound to a third party, whoever
          that may be.  And until that situation comes
          about, as far as I'm concerned, there is no
          obligation on either party.  That could be,
          work either one way or the other.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And the principal in this case was
          Preston and Lieff Glass Contracting Inc.?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   That's correct.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And as you indicated, from the surety's
          prospective it requires the signature of
          Preston and Lieff Glass Contracts Inc. on the
          performance bond.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   That is correct.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   From the surety's prospective is
          delivery of the bond essential from Preston
          and Lieff to, in this Paul D&#146;Aoust
          Construction, or Carleton Roman Catholic
          School Board?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   In my opinion, yes.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And when you say, your opinion, is that
          from your years of being in the surety
          industry, the surety business, that you come
          that conclusion?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I would say, yes, but it's a logical
          thing that out of all the bonds that I've
          ever issued over a life time, certainly if
          there was any problem as far as the owner not
          receiving the bond, I would certainly hear
          about it in a hurry from my contractor,
          because he would not get paid any money.</pre>
    <pre>[23] In cross-examination, he put his position this way:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   All right.  And is there anything in
          this bond that tells an owner or anyone else
          that the bond is not effective until it's
          delivered to the owner?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   No, there is not. But, I think it is an
          accepted principle on the part of all surety
          companies that before a joint obligation of
          two parties, it would have to be signed by
          both, it would have to be delivered.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   That's your opinion.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   That's my opinion.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[24] I read this evidence as Mr. Shand's understanding of how
surety companies interpret their obligations under performance
bonds. It is hardly surprising that they would favour an
interpretation which limits their liability.  Mr. Shand made it
clear that his understanding flowed not from the language of the
bond, or previous judicial interpretations of performance bonds,
but from the practicalities of the industry as he understood
them.  Since, in his view, the obligee would not pay the
contractor without first receiving the bond, any failure to
deliver the bond would effectively bring matters to a halt before
the obligee had advanced any funds.  While Mr. Shand's
observations concerning the practical effects of non-delivery are
no doubt correct (except in exceptional cases like this one),
they do not assist in determining the nature and scope of
Markel's liability under the bond.  The determination of that
liability depends first and foremost on the language of the
performance bond.  As McIntyre J. said in Citadel General
Assurance Co. v. Johns-Manville Canada Inc. et al. (1983), 147
D.L.R. (3d) 593 at 601, (S.C.C.):</pre>
    <pre>          ... The basis of the surety's liability must,
          of course, be found in the bond into which it
          has entered, ... .</pre>
    <pre>[25] This view is echoed in the words of one commentator:1</pre>
    <pre>          ...  It is essential, therefore, that the
          starting point for determining the rights and
          obligations as between any of the parties to
          a bond or contract of indemnity begin with a
          careful review of the instrument from which
          the rights arise.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The interpretation of the language of the bond is not
something to which Mr. Shand could speak despite his undoubted
expertise in the industry.  The practices within the industry
were relevant only if the language of the bond was ambiguous or
unclear.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Nor do I think Mr. Daku's or Mr. McGregor's intentions with
respect to delivery of the bond to D'Aoust assist in interpreting
Markel's obligations under the bond.  If on a proper
interpretation of the language of the bond, delivery to D'Aoust
was not a prerequisite to Markel's liability under the bond, the
failure to deliver the bond was of no consequence regardless of
the reasons for that failure.  Similarly, if under the terms of
the bond, delivery to D'Aoust was essential to Markel's
liability, then non-delivery vitiated any liability Markel had
regardless of the reasons for that non-delivery.</pre>
    <pre>[28] I turn now to the language of the bond.  As I read it, the
bond did the following:
     it created a joint and several liability as between Markel
     and P &amp; L to D'Aoust in the amount of $205,336.50;
     the joint and several liability of Markel and P &amp; L became
     &quot;null and void&quot; upon P &amp;  L's performance of its contract with
     D'Aoust;
          if P &amp; L defaulted under its contract with D'Aoust and
     D'Aoust had performed its obligations under the contract and
     given notice of the default, Markel was required to remedy the
     default in one of the two ways provided in the bond;  and
     the obligations under the bond remained in effect for two
     years.</pre>
    <pre>[29] It may be argued that by incorporating the contract between
P &amp; L and D&#146;Aoust into the bond, Markel made delivery of the bond
(a term of the contract) a requirement of the bond.  As I read
the bond, the contract between P &amp; L and D&#146;Aoust is referenced in
order to identify the work covered by the bond for the purpose of
demarcating Markel&#146;s potential liability under the bond and to
identify the obligations D&#146;Aoust had to meet before it could call
on Markel to remedy any default by P &amp; L under the contract.  The
requirement in the contract that P &amp; L deliver the bond to
D&#146;Aoust related neither to the nature and extent of the work
covered by the contract nor to any of D&#146;Aoust&#146;s obligations under
the contract.  Instead, it referred to an obligation placed on P
&amp; L under the contract.  If P &amp; L&#146;s obligations under the
contract are made part of the bond in the sense that compliance
with those obligations is essential to the operation of the bond,
then the bond would serve no purpose.  The bond would be
effective only when P &amp; L had fulfilled its obligations under the
contract in which case there would be no need to resort to the
bond.  The bond is provided to protect D&#146;Aoust in the event that
P &amp; L failed to perform its obligations under the contract.  I
would not make the bond&#146;s effectiveness dependent upon P &amp; L&#146;s
compliance with any of its obligations under its contract with
D&#146;Aoust.  In my opinion, nothing in the language of the bond
makes delivery by P &amp; L to D&#146;Aoust a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The language in the bond does, however, make it very clear
that Markel was not assuming sole responsibility for any default
by P &amp; L on its contract with D'Aoust.  Markel&#146;s  liability was
contingent upon P &amp; L accepting joint and several liability under
the bond for any default by it under the contract with D&#146;Aoust.
This interpretation is apparent not only in the language of the
bond, but in the requirement that P &amp; L along with Markel execute
the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[31] This brings me to the question of execution.  Did P &amp; L
execute the bond?  I think it did.  Mr. Daku and Mr. McGregor
signed the bond on behalf of P &amp; L.  Mr. McGregor's protestation
that he signed only &quot;as an administrative procedure&quot; is a legally
meaningless qualification on that signature.  Mr. Daku&#146;s
subsequent obliteration of his signature when he became
dissatisfied with his relationship with the other principals of P
&amp; L cannot retroactively undo his execution of the bond on behalf
of P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[32] I also fail to see how P &amp; L's intention not to deliver the
bond to D&#146;Aoust could affect the validity of the execution of the
bond by P &amp; L.  If I am right in holding that the bond was
effective without delivery to D&#146;Aoust then an intention not to
deliver the bond is irrelevant.  I also find it passing strange
that a secret intention by the principals of P &amp; L to breach its
contract with D&#146;Aoust in the hope of avoiding potential personal
liability under indemnity agreements with Markel could somehow
affect the validity of the execution of another contract (the
bond) on behalf of P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[33] Based strictly on the language of the bond, it seems to me
that once P &amp; L had executed the bond, Markel received exactly
what it had bargained for.  In exchange for the fee paid to it,
Markel assumed joint and several liability along with P &amp; L for
any default on the contract by P &amp; L as long as D&#146;Aoust performed
its obligations under the contract.  Markel further protected
itself by obtaining personal indemnities from the principals of P
&amp; L should it be required to honour the bond.  Markel was in the
bonding business.  It chose the language of the bond and was
fully capable of protecting its interests when framing the bond.
Unless the case law requires the contrary, I would not read
protections into the bond which Markel chose not to include in
the language of the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[34] I will now address the case law relating to the delivery of
performance bonds to obligees and the commentary on that case
law.  There are three relevant Canadian cases.  Not surprisingly,
none share the unusual facts of this case.  In Aldgate
Enterprises Ltd. v. Pacific Filtration Ltd. (1990), 44 C.C.L.I.
14 (B.C.S.C.), Aldgate owned a commercial building.  It agreed to
lease those premises to Pacific Filtration, the former owner.
Pacific Filtration agreed to provide a performance bond in the
amount of $35,000.00 in favour of Aldgate.  Pacific Filtration
eventually defaulted on the lease and Aldgate sued Laurentian
Pacific Insurance Company claiming that it had issued the
$35,000.00 performance bond.</pre>
    <pre>[35] Laurentian had in fact signed a bond and delivered it to
Pacific Filtration.  Pacific Filtration did not execute the bond
or deliver it to Aldgate.  Its reason for failing to do so was
explained by the trial judge, at p. 25:</pre>
    <pre>          Mr. Hodgson, the president of Pacific,
          testified that he and the other principal
          ultimately decided they were not prepared to
          be bound by personal guarantees, and sought
          the agreement of Laurentian Pacific to
          dispense with them.  When that request was
          refused, they decided they would not endorse
          or deliver the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Aldgate advanced two arguments.  It contended that
Laurentian was estopped from denying the validity of the bond
because of the conduct of its agent, and that the bond was valid
and enforceable, even though it had not been signed by Pacific
Filtration or delivered to Aldgate.  The trial judge rejected
both submissions.  He said, at pp. 26-27:</pre>
    <pre>          It is clear on the wording of the document,
          and on the evidence before me, that
          Laurentian Pacific agreed to issue the bond
          on the basis that Pacific Filtration Ltd.
          would execute the bond and that they would
          have the security of the two personal
          guarantees. The decision of Pacific
          Filtration Ltd. through its principals not to
          execute the bond went to the very root of the
          relationship between the parties and, in
          fact, prevented the formation of the contract
          at all.</pre>
    <pre>          The failure to perfect the bond as
          contemplated by Laurentian Pacific had
          nothing to do with their conduct or the
          communications made by Mr. Mills [the agent].
          Rather, it occurred because of the conscious
          decision of the principal to withdraw its
          application for the bond prior to its
          perfection and delivery to the obligee.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[37] In dismissing Aldgate's claim, the trial judge concluded
with these words, at p. 27:</pre>
    <pre>          This is not a case in which, in my view,
          estoppel can be applied against Laurentian
          Pacific.  It is a case in which, regrettably,
          I must conclude that no bond ever came into
          existence.  The decision of Pacific
          Filtration Ltd., not to execute and deliver
          the bond has, in part, resulted in their
          liability to the plaintiff Aldgate.  That
          decision, however, cannot create a valid bond
          where none existed.</pre>
    <pre>[38] While the trial judge in Aldgate did refer to Pacific
Filtration's failure to both execute and deliver the bond in
coming to his conclusion that there was no valid bond, the
essence of his reasoning is found in the passage quoted above
from pp. 26-27.  The surety, Laurentian, agreed to assume joint
and several liability along with Pacific Filtration under the
terms of the bond, but it wanted the personal indemnities of the
principals of Pacific Filtration.   However, Pacific Filtration
never agreed to joint and several liability.  Its failure to
execute the bond meant that the relationship of joint and several
liability contemplated by Laurentian never came into existence.
As the trial judge indicated, there was no meeting of the minds
between Laurentian and Pacific Filtration and, therefore, no
contract and no bond.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The second of the three Canadian cases to be considered is
Westburne Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. The Halifax Insurance
Co. (1983), 2 C.L.R. 14 (Nfld. S.C.).  Westburne was a
subcontractor and it claimed that it was entitled to damages
under a labour and material bond said to be issued to the
contractor, A.D.G. Ltd. by the surety Halifax.  In dismissing the
action, Noel J. said, at p. 17:</pre>
    <pre>          ... The bond was not delivered, and, for that
          reason, the plaintiff has no right under it.
          The plaintiff's action fails because the bond
          was not delivered.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The trial judge in this case adopted and relied on those
words.  In my view, they were used by Noel J. in a very different
factual context and must be understood in that context.  In
Westburne, the owner (Ryan) did not demand that A.D.G. (the
contractor) provide a bond as a term of its contract with Ryan.
Not only did Ryan not request bonding, it was never charged for
bonding and never gave any indication to Westburne that its
contract with A.D.G. was bonded or that A.D.G. was obliged to
provide any bonding.  When A.D.G. initially secured its contract
with Ryan, one of A.D.G.&#146;s employees erroneously believed that
bonding was required.  A bond was in fact obtained from the
broker for Halifax.  When the bond, executed on behalf of
Halifax, was delivered to A.D.G., the employee of A.D.G. became
aware of the earlier mistake and advised that no bond was
required.  The bond was not executed by A.D.G. and was returned
to the broker for Halifax.  There was no evidence that Westburne
was aware of or in any way relied on the bond when it delivered
the materials to A.D.G. which were the subject matter of the
eventual claim against Halifax.</pre>
    <pre>[41] On these facts, Noel J. held that A.D.G. was not the agent
for the owner Ryan or the subcontractor when it accepted delivery
of the bond from Halifax and that A.D.G. had the option of either
executing and delivering the bond or returning it to Halifax.  By
returning the bond, A.D.G. declined to enter into the
relationship described in the bond and no enforceable bond ever
existed.</pre>
    <pre>[42] Westburne, like Aldgate, is best understood as a case in
which the relationship of joint and several liability
contemplated by the bond simply never came into existence.
A.D.G. was under no obligation to execute the bond and chose not
to do so, thereby declining to create the joint and several
liability contemplated by the bond.  As the liability of Halifax
was premised on the existence of that joint and several
liability, A.D.G.'s decision not to enter into that relationship
clearly negated any potential liability Halifax had under the
bond.</pre>
    <pre>[43] The third case referred to by counsel and the trial judge is
Helm et al. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General Insurance Co. et al. (1979),
108 D.L.R. (3d) 8 (Alta. C.A.).  In Helm, the owner (Helm)
entered into a contract with the contractor (Edwards).  Under the
terms of the  contract, Helm could require Edwards to provide a
50% performance bond.  Helm required that Edwards provide a bond
and Edwards promised to do so.  Edwards applied for a bond
through the broker for Simcoe &amp; Erie.  A bond was executed on
behalf of Simcoe &amp; Erie and delivered to Edwards.  The principals
of Edwards had also executed indemnity agreements with Simcoe &amp;
Erie.  Edwards did not sign the bond and did not forward it to
Helm.  Instead, it returned the bond to the broker, who returned
it to Simcoe &amp; Erie for its cancellation.  Edwards defaulted on
the contract and Helm sued Edwards and Simcoe &amp; Erie.</pre>
    <pre>[44] The trial judge held in favour of Simcoe &amp; Erie ((1978), 87
D.L.R. (3d) 263).  He found first that Edwards' failure to
execute the bond meant that Edwards was not jointly and severally
liable on the bond.  As Simcoe &amp; Erie had contemplated joint and
several liability, Edwards' failure to execute the bond resulted
in no bond coming into existence.  The trial judge further held
that the delivery of the bond to Edwards was not delivery to
Helm, but a conditional delivery which could be completed by
Edwards both executing the bond and delivering it to Helm.  As
Edwards did neither, Simcoe &amp; Erie was not liable under the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[45] In allowing the appeal and holding Simcoe &amp; Erie liable,
Moir J.A. found that Edwards' failure to execute the bond did not
affect the liability of Simcoe &amp; Erie.  He said, at pp. 14-15:</pre>
    <pre>          In my opinion, we must look at the obligation
          the respondent [Simcoe &amp; Erie] undertook.
          That was to guarantee up to 50% the due
          performance of the contract the appellants
          [Helm] had with Edwards.  That contract was
          under the seal of both the appellants and
          Edwards.  The respondents, if they are
          liable, already had in their possession the
          guarantees of the directors and the
          indemnities they required.  This is clear
          from Mr. Charter's evidence.  They are in
          exactly the same position in law and in
          equity they would have been had Edwards
          executed the bond.  In my view, the liability
          mentioned in the bond is the liability that
          Edwards and the respondent have here.  The
          learned trial judge found it was not.  In my
          respectful opinion, that is looking at the
          form of the transaction and not at the
          substance.  Equity will not relieve against
          differences in form only.</pre>
    <pre>[46] Moir J.A. further held that Edwards' failure to deliver the
bond was not relevant to the liability of Simcoe &amp; Erie.  He
pointed out that the terms of the bond did not require delivery
to Helm and that the evidence of the practice in the industry
could not support the conclusion that delivery of the bond was a
condition precedent to its enforceability against Simcoe &amp; Erie.
He concluded, at p. 12:</pre>
    <pre>          Thus, the appellants sought a bond, the
          respondent executed and delivered a bond to
          the principal or contractor through the
          broker.  Surely the surety has done all he
          could do to be bound.  The delivery of the
          bond to the contractor must be equivalent to
          delivery to the obligee or appellants.</pre>
    <pre>[47] Moir J.A.&#146;s comments regarding both non-execution and non-
delivery have been criticized by the authors of Scott and
Reynolds on Surety Bonds, (1996), at pp. 2-32-2-33.  I find their
criticism of the decision as it relates to non-execution of the
bond compelling.  The authors write, at p. 2-33:</pre>
    <pre>          It is the view of the authors that Helm ...</pre>
    <pre>          2.)  erroneously places the onus upon the
          surety to demonstrate a conditional delivery
          when the very document sued upon and upon
          which the obligee must rely demonstrates the
          nature of the surety's conditional execution,
          i.e., the bond in its operative words,
          inherently requires execution by both the
          principal and the surety to come into force;
          ...</pre>
    <pre>[48] The authors? criticism of this aspect of the decision in
Helm is supported by Larbonne v. Shore, [1928] 2 D.L.R. 977
(B.C.C.A.) where it was unanimously held that the bond was
unenforceable against the surety where the principal debtor had
failed to execute the bond. This criticism of Helm is not germane
to the present case if I am correct in holding that P &amp; L did
execute the bond.</pre>
    <pre>[49] I do not find the authors&#146; criticism of the holding in Helm
that delivery was not essential to the liability of the surety as
cogent.  The authors state, at p. 2-33:</pre>
    <pre>          It is the view of the authors that Helm ...</pre>
    <pre>          3.)  must, in any event, be restricted to its
          own facts which facts turn on the evidence of
          Mr. Charter [the representative of the
          surety].  In the writers' view, available
          evidence of current industry practices is
          much stronger from the surety's point of view
          than that offered in Helm and Yaren and would
          compel the conclusion that a surety bond
          which has not in fact been executed and
          delivered by the principal as well as the
          surety is inoperative either upon the basis
          that delivery to the principal is conditional
          or an [sic] escrow.</pre>
    <pre>[50] For the reasons set out above, I do not think that industry
practice is helpful in interpreting the bond unless there is some
uncertainty or ambiguity in the language of the bond.  I can find
none in this bond.  It simply does not state or even imply that
delivery of the bond to the owner by the principal debtor (P &amp; L)
is a condition precedent to Markel's liability under the bond.
Nor is Markel's liability affected by non-delivery. Its liability
is triggered by P &amp; L&#146;s non-performance of the contract.  The
relevant non-performance occurred, not when P &amp; L failed to
deliver the bond, but when it left the job site with the work
uncompleted.  This was exactly the circumstance in which Markel
had undertaken to be joint and severally liable with P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[51] I do not think that Canadian case law establishes that
delivery of the bond to the obligee is a prerequisite to the
operation of the bond.  Absent such authority, I prefer an
approach which looks to the language of the bond, as authored by
the surety, to discern the relevance, if any, of non-delivery of
the bond to the obligee.
[1]
[52] The authors of Scott and Reynolds also quote, with approval,
the trial judge's assessment of the policy considerations that
favoured the holding that Markel was not liable.  For
convenience, I repeat that part of the trial judge's reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          It seems to me that appropriate commercial
          policy requires that execution and delivery
          of the bonds of sureties require precisely
          that.  Suretyship at common law requires a
          tripartite relationship involving the
          principal, the surety and the obligee.  The
          obligee ought to have the bond delivered to
          it so it can know precisely what obligations
          the principal and surety are assuming in
          relation to it.  The obligee is in a position
          to enforce delivery practically as the
          paymaster.  Failure to do so would, of
          course, have practical consequences.  To take
          a more &quot;constructive&quot; view of delivery, in my
          opinion, invites a guessing game where
          principal obligors retain possession of the
          bonds in circumstances which call for
          extensive inquiries into intentions and
          motives.</pre>
    <pre>[53] With respect, I cannot accept this analysis of the relevant
policy considerations.  It appears to proceed on the assumption
that the terms of the bond require delivery to the owner.  This
bond does not.  Nor does the view I favour require any &quot;guessing
game&quot; as to motives of the principal debtor.  If a bond worded as
this bond is worded, is properly executed by the surety and
principal debtor, it is, absent some other reason for holding it
unenforceable, enforceable against the surety and principal
debtor.  I also cannot agree that because the obligee is in a
position to insist on delivery before making any payment to the
principal debtor, that delivery to the obligee should be read
into the bond as a condition precedent to the surety&#146;s liability.
In this case, Markel could have accomplished the same end by
making delivery to D'Aoust a term of the bond.  It had control
over the terms of the bond and chose not to make delivery to
D&#146;Aoust a requirement.</pre>
    <pre>[54] I think policy considerations favour holding Markel liable.
It chose the language of the bond.  It was paid a fee (which it
apparently still has) in return for assuming joint and several
liability with P &amp; L should P &amp; L not perform its contract with
D'Aoust.  Markel also has the indemnity agreements.  It has
exactly what it bargained for when it placed the bond and took
the fee.  I find the words of Moir J.A. in Helm at p. 16
apposite:</pre>
    <pre>          As was found by the learned trial judge the
          appellants [Helm] were told by Edwards [the
          contractor] that the bond was coming. The
          appellants were obliged to pay the premium to
          Edwards.  Edwards was indebted to Dale &amp;
          Company [the surety's agent] for the premium.
          However, the directors of Edwards had given
          personal guarantees and indemnities to the
          respondent [Simcoe &amp; Erie].  They had a
          personal interest in lying to the appellants
          and returning the bond to the detriment of
          the appellants and to their own personal
          benefit.  The respondent had all its
          protection, they executed and delivered the
          bond.  It's just and equitable that they
          perform.</pre>
    <pre>[55] In my opinion, the language of the bond and policy
considerations do not favour allowing Markel to escape liability
under the bond by virtue of P &amp; L&#146;s failure to deliver the bond
to D&#146;Aoust as it was obligated to do under its contract with
D&#146;Aoust.  Nor does the case law compel that conclusion.  Under
the language of this bond, delivery to D&#146;Aoust was not a
prerequisite to D&#146;Aoust&#146;s enforcement of the bond against Markel.</pre>
    <pre>Did D'Aoust fail to perform its obligations under its contract
with P &amp; L?</pre>
    <pre>[56] Under the terms of the bond, Markel was liable only if
D'Aoust performed its obligations under the contract with P &amp; L.
Markel argues that by failing to obtain the bond before advancing
funds to P &amp; L on March 12, 1990, D'Aoust failed to perform its
obligations under the contract thereby rendering the bond
unenforceable.</pre>
    <pre>[57] I would reject this argument for two reasons.  First, under
the contract between P &amp; L and D'Aoust, P &amp; L was obligated to
obtain and deliver a performance bond.  D'Aoust could have
insisted upon delivery before providing funds to P &amp; L.  Clearly
in its capacity as agent for the School Board, it should have
done so.  I do not, however, read the contract as imposing an
obligation on D'Aoust to obtain delivery of the performance bond.
The obligation was on P &amp; L to deliver the bond.  D'Aoust's
failure to ensure that P &amp; L had performed that obligation before
advancing funds is not a failure by D'Aoust to perform any of its
obligations under its contract with P &amp; L.</pre>
    <pre>[58] Second, I cannot accept that D'Aoust's failure to obtain the
performance bond had any effect on Markel's liability.  As I
understand the record, P &amp; L was entitled to payment of the funds
paid to it on March 12, 1990.2  Had D'Aoust obtained the bond on
or before March 12th, it would have been obligated to make the
payment to P &amp; L.  The breach of contract by P &amp; L which gave
rise to Markel's liability occurred a month later when P &amp; L
stopped work and left the job uncompleted.  Had D'Aoust actually
received the bond before P &amp; L left the job site, Markel's
position would have been exactly as it is now.  The damages
D'Aoust seeks from Markel flow from the non-completion of the
work and, in my view, are unaffected by the non-delivery of the
bond prior to the advance of funds to P &amp; L on March 12, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion:</pre>
    <pre>[59] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below, and
substitute a judgment allowing the appellants' claim against
Markel and directing that damages be assessed in accordance with
the reasons of the trial judge.  D&#146;Aoust and the School Board are
entitled to their costs at trial and on appeal on a party and
party basis.</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[63] I have read Doherty J.A.'s reasons and I agree with his
resolution of two of the three issues.  I agree that on the facts
of this case, the principal under the bond (Preston &amp; Lieff Glass
Contracts Inc.) executed the bond.  I also agree that any lack of
performance on the part of the appellants did not affect the
respondent&#146;s liability.  However, I agree with the trial judge
that the bond was not valid and effective since it was not
delivered to the owner (the appellant the Carleton Roman Catholic
Separate School Board) or its agent (the appellant Paul D&#146;Aoust
Construction Ltd.).  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[64] I need only deal with two issues on the question of
delivery:</pre>
    <pre>  1. Must a bond be delivered to be effective? and</pre>
    <pre>  2. If so, was the bond delivered in this case?
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The delivery requirement</pre>
    <pre>[65] The respondent, Markel, is a compensated surety.  In Citadel
General Assurance Co. v. Johns-Manville Canada Inc. et al.
(1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 593 (S.C.C.) at 601, McIntyre J. pointed
out that Canadian courts have tended to favour a &#147;more liberal
approach to the consideration of the rights to claimants under
bonds&#148; issued by a compensated surety.  This is in contrast to
the approach in cases of accommodation sureties who have entered
into the surety contract with the expectation of little or no
remuneration for assisting the principal debtor.  In the latter
case, the courts have adopted the strictissimi juris construction
of the surety contract.
[66] McIntrye J. held at p. 601, in the passage quoted by Doherty
J.A., that the basis of the surety&#146;s liability must be found in
the bond into which it has entered.  McIntyre J. also held that
&#147;in the case of the compensated surety it cannot be every
variation in the guaranteed contract, however minor, or every
failure of a claimant to meet the conditions imposed by the bond,
however trivial, which will enable the surety to escape
liability.&#148;  Doherty J.A. reasons that since the bond did not
expressly make delivery by P &amp; L to D&#146;Aoust a condition precedent
to the effectiveness of the bond, the lack of delivery did not
affect the respondent surety&#146;s obligations.  In my view, the
principle stated in Johns Manville does not apply in this case.
The failure to effect delivery of the bond in this case was
fundamental and therefore the obligations imposed in the bond
never came into effect.  There is, therefore, no occasion to look
to the actual wording of the bond itself.
[67] In my view, the starting point in this case is not the
language of the bond, but an understanding of the nature of the
bond itself.  This is set out succinctly and I believe accurately
in Scott and Reynolds3 at s. 2.3(a), p. 2-14:</pre>
    <pre>     A bond is simply a deed (a deed being a document in writing
on paper which is signed, sealed, and delivered&#133;) whereby one
person undertakes to pay a specified sum of money to another,
either immediately or at a future date.</pre>
    <pre>[68] At common law, in order to be effective a deed must be
delivered:  Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 12, para. 1329.
While &#147;no special form or observance is necessary for the
delivery of a deed, and it may be in words or by conduct&#148;, it
appears to be accepted that there must be delivery.  Even in Helm
et al. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General Insurance Co. et al. (1979), 108
D.L.R. (3d) 8 (Alta. C.A.), in which the court goes the furthest
in stripping away the formalities of execution and delivery, the
court appears to have accepted that to be effective the bond must
be delivered.  The court merely held at p. 11, based on the
evidence adduced in that case, that it was reasonable to infer
that &#147;the owner, in asking the contractor to obtain the bond,
appointed the contractor as agent of the owner to obtain and
accept delivery of the bond on behalf of the owner&#148;.  I will
return to the Helm decision and its application to the facts in
this case when I discuss the meaning of delivery and application
of this court's decision in Re Sammon (1979), 22 O.R. (2d) 721.
Suffice it to say that, in my view, the trial judge properly
interpreted the law as requiring delivery to make this bond
effective.
[69] It is also important to look to the indemnity agreements
that led Markel to issue the bond.  Under those agreements the
principals of P &amp; L, Mr. Daku, Mr. McGregor and Mr. Lieff, agreed
to indemnify Markel against any losses that Markel may incur if
it was called upon under any of the bonds it might issue in
favour of P &amp; L.  Those agreements were made because P &amp; L may,
in the words of the agreements, &#147;desire, or be required, to
execute and deliver or procure the execution and delivery of
Bonds as hereafter defined&#148;.  Finally, as pointed out by Doherty
J.A., the agreement between the appellants and P &amp; L expressly
contemplated delivery of the bond:</pre>
    <pre>     The Contractor shall promptly provide to the Owner the
surety bonds called for in the tender documents.</pre>
    <pre>[70] To summarize, the common law required delivery of the bond
and there is nothing in the contractual relationships to indicate
that the parties did not intend this law to apply.  To the
contrary, the various agreements all contemplated delivery of the
bond.  The delivery requirement is also consistent with the
reasonable expectations of the parties and industry practice
generally.  In addition to the evidence of Mr. Shand, referred to
by Doherty J.A., there is the evidence of the appellant&#146;s
principal, Mr. Paul D&#146;Aoust.  He agreed that the &#147;norm in the
industry&#148; is not to release a progress payment until all of the
bonds have been delivered.
[71] If a deed is not delivered, it is not effective.  In Re
Sammon, at p. 724, Morden J.A. held as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     Although the manual transfer of the document is the origin
of the term &#147;delivery&#148;, very early in the practice of making
transfers by deed Sir Edward Coke said that &#147;as a deed may be
delivered to a party without words, so may a deed be delivered by
words without any act of delivery&#148;: I Co. Litt. 36a, and American
Law of Property (1952),  12.64, at p. 313.  There can be no
doubt as to the generally applicable substantive requirements of
delivery.
               </pre>
    <pre>                 In order that a deed shall be effective it must be
               &#147;delivered&#148;, that is to say the party whose deed the
               document is expressed to be, having first sealed it,
               must by words or conduct expressly or impliedly
               acknowledge his intention to be immediately and
               unconditionally bound by the expressions contained
               therein.</pre>
    <pre>     Re Metropolitan Theatres Ltd.; Magee Real Estate Co. Ltd.&#146;s Claim
(1917), 40 O.L.R. 345 at p. 347; Carson et al. v. Wilson et al., 
[1961] O.R. 113 at p. 119, 26 D.L.R. (2d) 307 at p. 313; and 8 C.E.D.
(Ont. 3rd), under the title Deeds &amp; Documents  28.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[72] To be effective a deed, and thus a bond, must be delivered.
I can see no reason to depart from this settled law.  I agree
with Doherty J.A. that the finding that the surety was not bound
in both Aldgate Enterprises Ltd. v. Pacific Filtration Ltd.
(1990), 44 C.C.L.I. 14 (B.C.S.C.) and Westburne Industrial
Enterprises Ltd. v. The Halifax Insurance Co. (1983), 2 C.L.R. 14
(Nfld. S.C.), can be supported on a basis other than the failure
of delivery.  Those cases and Helm are important because they
represent a common understanding that delivery is an essential
aspect of an effective bond.  On the other hand, with one
possible exception,4 we were not referred to any Canadian case
that held that delivery is not required.
[73] Although the following was said in relation to the &#147;sealed
contract rule&#148;, it is also relevant to the issue in this case:</pre>
    <pre>     Accepting that it is a formal rule which has been much
criticized, it is, at least in this jurisdiction, unquestionably
part of our law.  Parties may take it into account in structuring
their transactions.  The form of the document, either selected or
imposed by law, dictates who may have rights and obligations
under it.  For a court to repeal the rule (which is not sought
from us) or cut back on the scope of the rule (which is sought)
could unfairly frustrate the intention of the parties.</pre>

(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 712 (C.A.) at 728-29.

</pre>
    <pre>  2. Was the bond delivered?</pre>
    <pre>[74] Whether or not there has been delivery is a &#147;matter of
intention which may be manifested by acts or words&#148; and is
therefore a question of fact:  Re Sammon at p. 724.  The
intention to be proved is, as set out above, an intention to be
&#147;immediately and unconditionally bound by the expressions
contained therein&#148;.  Since it is a question of fact, this court
is bound by the trial judge&#146;s findings in the absence of some
palpable or overriding error.  The trial judge appears to have
accepted the evidence of the three principals of P &amp; L that they
did not intend to deliver the bond and did not intend to be bound
by it.  The trial judge found:</pre>
    <pre>  With the obliteration of Mr. Daku's signature before any
&quot;regular&quot; delivery was possible before the March 12 payment of
$151,000, the need for D'Aoust to insist on delivery under its
contract with P&amp;L was even more apparent.  Mr. McGregor said he
signed the bond for administrative convenience, but he never
intended to deliver it because he knew he had executed and
delivered indemnification agreements to the surety in 1988, about
a year before these negotiations began. This is the converse,
factually, to the situation in the Aldgate case, supra.  There
the principal officers did not want to sign the indemnification
agreements.  Here Mr. McGregor did not want to trigger liability
by delivering the bond; which is what he thought would happen if
he took that step.  Given what was going on inside the company
with relations deteriorating between himself and Bernard Lieff
and between Lieff and Mr. Daku it is not unreasonable to conclude
that he did not intend when he signed the bond as the
administrative officer of P&amp;L that he intended P&amp;L to be bound by
the bond as a co-surety with Markel to the Board.  The failure to
deliver the bond in these circumstances makes the ambiguities
surrounding the obliteration of Daku and the reluctance of
McGregor more telling in my view.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[75] Notwithstanding the expressed intentions of the principals
not to be bound by the bond, it would be open to the court to
infer delivery if P &amp; L impliedly acknowledged its intention to
be immediately and unconditionally bound by its contents.  The
only evidence from which an intention might be inferred is the
evidence of Mr. D&#146;Aoust that Mr. Daku told him, in the presence
of Mr. McGregor, that the bond had already been placed in the
D&#146;Aoust Construction file.  D&#146;Aoust testified that he issued the
$151,000 progress payment based on this representation.  However,
McGregor and Daku denied saying that and the trial judge accepted
their evidence and found that Mr. D&#146;Aoust was mistaken.
[76] In my view this is not a case for application of the
&#147;principle&#148; that delivery may be inferred from the fact of
execution in the presence of an attesting witness.  It does not
appear that the bond was executed by any of the principals of P &amp;
L in the presence of an attesting witness.  The space for the
signature of a &#147;Witness as to Principal&#148; is blank.  In any event,
I would apply the following holding by Morden J.A. in Re Sammon
at p. 730:</pre>
    <pre>     Further, in considering the potential probative force of the
mere signing in the presence of an attesting witness, it is well
to return to the substantive principle in question.  The grantor,
in addition to signing the document, has to do or say something
to make it an effective deed.  These fundamental requirements are
clearly stated on p. 57 of Sheppard's Touchstone: &quot;But by one or
both of these [delivery] must be made; for otherwise, albeit it
be never so well sealed and written, yet is the deed of no
force.&quot; [Emphasis in Morden J.A.'s.]  It would subvert this clear
substantive requirement if the tendency were to assume
automatically that signing, etc., itself embraced the added
requirement of evidencing an intention to be immediately and
unconditionally bound.  There should be some logical reason, in
the total circumstances, for inferring such an intention and I
think that the case law, some of which I shall be referring to
shortly, bears this out.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[77] In my view, in light of the findings of fact by the trial
judge, it is not open to this court to infer delivery from the
mere act of signing by Mr. Daku and Mr. McGregor.
[78] Finally, I would decline to apply the holding of the Alberta
Court of Appeal in Helm and find that delivery to P &amp; L was
delivery to the owner.  That holding seems to have been based on
the evidence adduced in that case, particularly the evidence of
Mr. Charter, an employee of the surety company.  Thus, Moir J.A.
held as follows at pp. 11-12:</pre>
    <pre>          In the light of Mr. Charter's evidence just referred
to, it appears that the surety acknowledges that many bonds do
remain in the contractor's office and that the respondent is not
concerned with the delivery to the obligee.  It appears
reasonable to infer that the owner, in asking the contractor to
obtain the bond, appointed the contractor as agent of the owner
to obtain and accept delivery of the bond on behalf of the owner.</pre>
    <pre>     There are numerous American authorities dealing
with this question.  Numerous are cited in corpus juris
secundum.  On the question of delivery to an agent they
say this in 72 C.J.S., para. 55, p. 545:
               </pre>
    <pre>                              By or to agent.  Delivery of the bond or
               obligation to the obligee may be made by the surety
               through an agent, and where the surety places a fully
               executed bond or obligation in the hands of an agent
               for use in a transaction to be consummated, without
               giving the agent any special instructions, he thereby
               authorizes its delivery to the obligee to secure any
               agreement coming within its terms.  The principal
               obligor may act as the agent of the surety for the
               purpose of making delivery, and such authority may be
               inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case,
               such as from the acts and conduct of the surety which
               fairly evince such an intention.  As far as the surety
               is concerned, his liability on the bond or obligation
               becomes fixed by his delivering it to the principal,
               with the intention that it shall become fixed by his
               delivering it to the principal, with the intention that
               it shall become operative, as where he places it in the
               office of the principal for his signature, since this
               is equivalent to delivery to the obligee.</pre>
    <pre>     Thus, the appellants sought a bond,
the [surety] executed and delivered a
bond to the principal or contractor
through the broker.  Surely the surety
has done all he could do to be bound.
The delivery of the bond to the
contractor must be equivalent to
delivery to the obligee or appellants.</pre>
    <pre>[79] The evidence from the bonding company in this case is
different.  Mr. Shand testified that in his lengthy experience,
the owner expected to receive the bond and if the contract
required a performance bond, the owner would not make any
payments until the bond had been delivered.  There was no
evidence of any industry practice that the contractor holds or
takes delivery of the bond as agent for the owner.  The evidence
in this case appears to be consistent with the view expressed by
Scott &amp; Reynolds.  At s. 2.3(c)(vi), p. 2-33 they offered the
opinion that Helm</pre>
    <pre>  must, in any event, be restricted to its own facts which facts
turn on the evidence of Mr. Charters.  In the writers&#146; view,
available evidence of current industry practice is much stronger
from the surety&#146;s point of view than that offered in [Helm] and
would compel the conclusion that a surety bond which has not in
fact been executed and delivered by the principal as well as the
surety is inoperative either upon the basis that delivery to the
principal is conditional or an escrow.</pre>
    <pre>[80] In this case, the owner appointed the appellant Paul D&#146;Aoust
Construction Ltd. as its agent on this construction project and
the bond was not delivered to it.  In the circumstances, it is
not possible to find that P &amp; L or someone else was the owner&#146;s
agent for taking delivery of the bond.
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[81] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
    <pre>[63]      CARTHY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[82] I agree with Rosenberg J.A.

297 (Man. K.B.) concerned an action by a contractor against the
bonding company and a third party action between the bonding
company and a subcontractor. The bond was neither executed by the
principal (the subcontractor) nor delivered to the owner or the
contractor.  The surety, however, did not deny liability under
the bond and agreed that the bond was binding upon it.  The only
issue litigated as to the validity of the bond seems to have been
with respect to the liability of the principal to indemnify the
surety.  It may be that the surety was estopped from denying
liability as against the contractor because when informed of the
principal&#146;s default it instructed the contractor to take
possession and act for it to complete the subcontract &#147;using all
your tools and equipment in accordance with the indemnity
agreement&#148;.</pre></td>
