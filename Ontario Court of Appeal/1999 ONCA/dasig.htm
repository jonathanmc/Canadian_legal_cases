               John Pavoni, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 3, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of McCombs J., dated September 14,
1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We agree with the finding of the motions judge that the
insurance policy excludes coverage for the alleged assault
committed by the appellant Jose Dasig in which the appellant
Veneracion Dasig was said to be an accessory. In the case of the
tort of assault as pleaded, the conduct of both appellants
resulted in bodily injury caused intentionally or at their
direction or resulted from their criminal acts, all within
exclusion (5) to Section II &#150; Liability Coverages.  The tort of
malicious prosecution as pleaded was also intentional and
additionally did not result in bodily injury as defined in this
particular policy.
[2]  The law relating to the duty to defend has recently been
summarized by Rosenberg J.A. of this court in Cummings v. Budget
Car &amp; Rental Toronto Ltd. (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 1 at 11:
          </pre>
    <pre>                       To summarize, unless the defence clause indicates
          otherwise, the duty to defend arises where a claim is made
          against the insured that &#147;potentially&#148; falls or &#147;may be argued&#148;
          to fall within the terms of the policy. Whether or not the claim
          falls within the terms of the policy is determined on the basis
          of the allegations in the statement of claim, not on the facts as
          they may be later determined at a trial. While the duty to defend
          is wider than the duty to indemnify, ordinarily the duty to
          defend is only triggered where the claim, if made out, would call
          upon the insurer to indemnify. The mere possibility, however,
          that the claim might succeed is sufficient to trigger the duty to
          defend. In determining whether or not the claim might succeed the
          court must take into account any exclusion clause, and where it
          is clear from the pleadings that the claim falls outside of the
          coverage of the policy by reason of an exclusion clause, the duty
          to defend does not arise.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our opinion, it is clear from the pleadings in this case
that the claims fall outside of the coverage of the policy by
reason of the exclusionary clause in issue and the duty to defend
does not arise.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
