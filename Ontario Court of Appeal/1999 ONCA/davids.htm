</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice
Shaughnessy dated July 3, 1998.</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant (husband) appeals from the judgment of
Shaughnessy J. dated July 3, 1998.  The relevant parts of that
judgment can be summarized as follows:</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <pre>the divorce was granted;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>the respondent (wife) was awarded spousal support in the
amount of $3,000.00 per month;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>the husband was ordered to pay child support of $2,524.00
per month;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>upon equalization of the net family property, it was
determined that the wife owed the husband $178,514.10 from which
$125,810.55 was subtracted to pay arrears owing on interim
support orders made against the husband;  and</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>the matrimonial home was ordered sold and it was directed
that the amount payable to the husband from the equalization of
the net family property (about $52,000.00) should be held by the
wife in trust as security for payment by the husband of the
spousal and child support ordered.</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>[2]  The support orders were premised on the trial judge’s
finding that the husband’s imputed income was $168,000.00 per
year.  That figure was based largely, but not exclusively, on the
evidence of a forensic accounting expert called by the wife at
trial.  The husband operated his own business through two
corporate entities.  The expert arrived at his calculation of the
husband’s imputed income after detailed examinations of the
husband’s and the corporations’ records for the years 1993, 1994
and 1996.  The husband did not provide a current financial
statement at the time of trial.  The imputed income came in the
form of salary from the corporations, cash from unknown sources,
corporate income available to the husband, and payments made by
the corporations but attributable to the husband.
[3]  The trial judge also found that the wife was entitled to her
costs on a solicitor-and-client basis almost from the outset of
the proceedings and gave detailed directions to the assessment
officer to assist in the assessment of those costs.
[4]  The husband was not represented at trial.  He was
represented in the proceedings which led to the costs order made
by the trial judge.
[5]  The husband asks that the judgment be set aside and a new
trial ordered.  Counsel for the appellant advanced two grounds of
appeal:</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <pre>the trial judge erred in refusing the appellant’s request
for an adjournment and forcing the appellant to proceed to trial
without counsel;  and</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>the trial itself was so unfair as to result in a miscarriage
of justice.</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>[6]  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal the costs order.
In oral argument, counsel limited his argument to the question of
whether the trial judge erred in providing detailed directions to
the assessment officer.
[7]  The wife cross-appeals the trial judge’s order with respect
to the distribution of the net family property.  Counsel for the
wife indicated that this appeal would be pursued only if any part
of the main appeal succeeded.</pre>
      <pre>The refusal of the adjournment</pre>
      <pre>[8]  These proceedings were commenced by the husband’s petition
in February 1995.  The wife’s answer and counter-petition were
dated May 23, 1995.  An interim-interim spousal and child support
order was made in May 1995.  In July 1996, both parties moved for
interim support and custody orders.  After a hearing, McLean J.
ordered that the interim-interim order made a year earlier remain
in force until trial.  In his endorsement, McLean J. indicated
“trial is expected to be in November or December 1996.”  In his
order, he directed that “the matter should be tried as soon as
possible.”
[9]  The husband and wife both were represented by counsel on
both motions and filed material in support of their respective
positions.  Neither party appealed or moved to vary the order of
McLean J.
[10] A pre-trial was held on September 30, 1996 and the trial was
scheduled for February 1997.  In October 1996, the husband
retained Mr. Edwin Flak.  Mr. Flak raised the possibility of
resolving the issue between the parties by way of a
mediation/arbitration arrangement.  The wife agreed to attempt to
resolve the issues in that way and Mr. Stephen Grant was selected
as the arbitrator.  The trial did not proceed in February 1997
but the case remained on the trial list.
[11] In the fall of 1997, the trial was adjourned on consent to
the next sittings in the spring of 1998 so that the parties could
proceed with their mediation/arbitration attempts.  Those
attempts continued into 1998.  By March 1998, it was apparent
that the mediation/arbitration efforts could well fail.  Mr.
Cole, counsel for the wife advised Mr. Flak that his client was
anxious to know how the matter would proceed.  He indicated that
the spring sittings were rapidly approaching.  An assignment
court was held in March.  Both parties were notified but neither
attended.  The trial was scheduled for May.  In keeping with the
local practice, the husband could have brought a motion for an
adjournment of the trial at the assignment court.  He did not do
so.
[12] By the end of March, Mr. Cole wrote to Mr. Flak stating that
it did not appear that matters would be settled and he would
prepare to proceed for trial.  Mr. Cole did indicate that the
wife was prepared to proceed with the mediation/arbitration if
there was any hope of success.
[13] By early April, the possibility of resolving the issues by
way of mediation/arbitration had all but disappeared.  The
husband had not responded to the wife’s requests to extend the
mediation/arbitration arrangement and had not made the final
payment to the arbitrator as he was required to do.
[14] On April 24, 1998, the husband filed a notice of an
intention to act in person.  He had discharged Mr. Flak taking
the position that Mr. Flak’s retainer extended only to the
mediation/arbitration proceedings.  Mr. Cole was never told that
Mr. Flak’s retainer was limited and that he would not act if the
matter proceeded to trial.
[15] On May 4, 1998, the husband applied for an adjournment of
the trial for a period of about six weeks.  In his affidavit
filed in support of the motion, the husband said he had “almost
no funds” and had been denied legal aid.  His application for
legal aid had been made on April 28, 1998.  The motion was heard
by Madam Justice Klowak on May 4, 1998.  The husband was
unrepresented.  She refused the adjournment and indicated that
the trial would proceed the next day.
[16] On May 5, 1998, the parties appeared before Mr. Justice
Shaughnessy.  The husband was represented by Mr. Wrock.  Mr.
Wrock said that he had been retained the previous night solely
for the purpose of seeking an adjournment of some three or four
weeks.  He said that if the adjournment was granted his firm
would represent the husband.  Mr. Wrock indicated that a
“difference of opinion” had developed between the husband and Mr.
Flak in late April and that as a result, Mr. Flak no longer acted
for the husband.  Counsel also advised that the husband had told
him that he did not appreciate that the trial would proceed at
these sittings.  Counsel acknowledged that it was difficult to
accept that one would not understand that the trial could proceed
as scheduled.
[17] Mr. Cole opposed the adjournment.  He advised that the
arrears on the support orders amounted to over $100,000.00 and
that any payments the wife had managed to extract from the
husband had been obtained only after various enforcement
proceedings had been taken. He pointed out that the parties and
their counsel had known since March that the
mediation/arbitration efforts could well fail and that he had
taken the position that the matter should proceed to trial if
those efforts failed.  Mr. Cole stressed that the husband’s
failure to abide by the terms of the interim orders had put the
wife under severe financial and emotional pressure.  As an
example, Mr. Cole referred to the husband’s refusal to make
mortgage payments on the home and the wife’s need to search out
alternate financing or risk losing the home.  He submitted that
an adjournment would significantly add to the wife’s costs and
place her under added pressure.  Finally, Mr. Cole pointed out
that if the matter was adjourned for three weeks, the sittings
would be over and the case would not be heard until the next
sittings in November.
[18] Shaughnessy J. was clearly concerned that the husband should
be represented, if reasonably possible.  He asked Mr. Wrock if he
could be available to start the case in two days.  Mr. Wrock,
quite properly, indicated that he could not give that undertaking
but that he was prepared to attempt in the next two days to “get
up to speed” as much as possible and report the results of his
efforts to Shaughnessy J.
[19] Counsel for the wife maintained his primary position that
the matter should proceed.  He did indicate, however, that he
would be prepared to consent to an adjournment if “very stringent
payments requirements were attached to it.”  It seems clear that
counsel for the wife was anxious to have the husband represented
as long as the wife’s and children’s financial needs could be
properly addressed by terms of the adjournment needed to allow
the husband to be represented.
[20] After a brief adjournment, both counsel reported to
Shaughnessy J. that if the trial was adjourned for more than one
or two days, it could not proceed until the next sittings
commencing November 2, 1998.  Mr. Wrock suggested that the
husband would make a lump sum payment of $10,000.00 towards the
arrears and would pay $2,500 per month pending the trial in
November.  The $10,000.00 payment equalled less than 10 per cent
of the amount owing and the suggested monthly payments were less
than half of the payments required under the existing interim
order.  Mr. Cole took the position that a payment of $30,000.00
should be made and that the monthly payments should be in the
amount required under the interim order.  Other terms were
discussed, but they are not germane to these reasons.
[21] After considering counsel’s submissions, Shaughnessy J.
said:
          </pre>
      <pre>            … I am gravely concerned about the delay in this matter.
       However, I also, in the best interests of the conduct of the
       trial, in hoping that Mr. Wrock will be appearing as counsel and
       acting on Mr. David’s behalf, and that in turn they lead to a
       resolution either in the court or outside the court, which will
       be of great benefit to the parties financially and otherwise.
       Reviewing the court record, it is apparent to me that this case
       may not be completed in four days with an unrepresented Mr. Davids.
          </pre>
      <pre>               I am going to adjourn this matter, but I
          am going to adjourn it on essentially
          stringent terms as requested by Mr. Cole
          [counsel for the wife].</pre>
      <pre>[22] The terms imposed by the trial judge included the
requirement that the husband make three $10,000.00 payments to
the wife between May 15th  and July 15th and that he comply with
the existing interim orders.
[23] Mr. Wrock then told Shaughnessy J. that the husband had
asked him to inform the court that he “could not live with that
order and would become in default.”  Counsel advised that the
husband was prepared to represent himself, and that he requested
“a couple of days” before the beginning of the trial.  As I
understand this request, it did not involve Mr. Wrock assisting
the husband during this two-day period.
[24] Shaughnessy J. declined to allow the appellant a two-day
adjournment and directed that the trial should proceed.  At the
outset of the trial, Shaughnessy J. gave the husband a “thumbnail
sketch” of the procedures and indicated to the husband that he
would call his case first and that “presumably you will be your
first witness.”  The trial  proceeded on May 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11.
The matter could not proceed beyond May 11th as a jury trial had
been scheduled for that court.  The trial was adjourned to June
8th.  The husband was still presenting his case when the trial
was adjourned.  He had testified and called several witnesses.
The husband advised Shaughnessy J. that he might retain counsel
to represent him when the trial resumed.
[25] The trial recommenced on June 8th after a four-week
adjournment.  The husband was still unrepresented, and there is
no suggestion that he attempted to obtain counsel during the
adjournment.  The trial proceeded through June 8, 9 and was
completed on June 10th.
[26] The husband and no one else must take responsibility for the
decisions which resulted in him being unrepresented as of May
5th.  He knew well in advance of that date that there was a real
possibility that the trial would proceed at that sittings.  There
is no suggestion that he was abandoned by his lawyer, or that Mr.
Flak had not kept him informed of Mr. Cole’s position.  He
clearly chose to appear unrepresented and to seek an adjournment.
He first tried to obtain that adjournment on his own.  When that
effort failed, he went to Mr. Wrock and retained him for the
limited purpose of seeking an adjournment so that Mr. Wrock could
be properly retained for trial.  He offered no support for his
claim that he could not pay the amounts ordered by the court and
gave no explanation for his failure to attempt to have the
interim order varied in the two years since it had been made.  It
could be inferred from the husband’s conduct that he was
attempting to prolong the proceedings with a view to forcing his
wife to accept settlement on his terms rather than continuing
with the litigation.
[27] In our view, the events leading up to the husband’s request
for an adjournment before Shaughnessy J., his apparent
determination to avoid his financial obligations to his wife and
children pending trial, and the financial and emotional hardship
caused to the wife by further delay in the resolution of this
matter could well have led Shaughnessy J. to refuse outright the
husband’s request for an adjournment.
[28] Shaughnessy J. did not do so.  He obviously wanted the
husband to be represented by counsel if that representation could
be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the process and
giving proper weight to the interests of the wife.  Shaughnessy
J. proposed an adjournment on terms.  In doing so, he exercised
his discretion.  The husband declined the terms.  The question on
appeal becomes  – were the terms set out by Shaughnessy J.
unreasonable?  If they were not, then there can be no criticism
of his decision to proceed with the trial after the husband
rejected those terms.
[29] Counsel for the husband submits that the trial judge could
not impose the terms he did without satisfying himself that the
husband could meet the financial conditions of those terms.  He
also submits that the trial judge should have made inquiries into
the wife’s financial condition.  We cannot agree.
[30] The appellant had failed to meet his obligations under an
existing court order.  That order was made after a hearing in
which the husband had a full opportunity to present his position
through counsel.  He made no attempt to challenge that order or
to seek any variation.  Instead, he allowed the arrears to climb
to over $100,000.00.  Absent compelling evidence that the husband
had made his best efforts to comply with the orders and was
financially unable to do so, the trial judge could not relieve
the husband of his obligations under those orders.  The husband’s
mere assertion that he could not pay was hardly a sufficient
basis upon which to vary his obligations. Certainly, the
suggested terms of the adjournment put forward on behalf of  the
husband indicate that he could pay considerably more than he had
been paying.
[31] Nor do we find anything in the record to support the
submission that Shaughnessy J. somehow denied the husband an
opportunity to lead evidence of his financial circumstances and
inability to pay the support required under the outstanding
orders.  The husband showed no inclination to share his true
financial situation with the court.
[32] We think that it was not only reasonable for the trial judge
to require the husband to comply with the existing judicial
orders as a term of any adjournment, but that any other order
would have been unreasonable in the circumstances of this case.
[33] We also find nothing unreasonable in the trial judge’s
requirement that the husband make some payment on the arrears as
a term of the granting of any adjournment.  Such a term is common
where the party in arrears seeks an adjournment.  The trial
judge’s order that the husband pay less than 30 per cent of the
amount owed over a 3 ½ month period was not an unreasonable
exercise of his discretion.
[34] The terms proposed by the trial judge were reasonable.  The
husband’s decision not to comply with those terms was, in effect,
a decision to proceed to trial unrepresented.  We see no basis
upon which to hold that Shaughnessy J. erred in the exercise of
his discretion.</pre>
      <pre>Was the trial so unfair as to result in a miscarriage of justice?</pre>
      <pre>[35] Mr. Bastedo, in forceful submissions on behalf of the
husband, submits that even if the trial judge did not err in
refusing an adjournment, the trial was so unfair as to result in
a miscarriage of justice.  In Mr. Bastedo’s submission, the
husband could not represent himself effectively in this complex
litigation.  This submission proceeded on the premise that the
fairness of the trial must be considered by comparing what
happened at the trial with how the trial might have been
conducted had the husband been represented by competent counsel.
It is argued that competent counsel would have presented expert
evidence in support of the husband’s position with respect to his
income and would have challenged many parts of the testimony of
the expert called by the wife.  Mr. Bastedo argues that had the
husband been represented by competent counsel, his imputed income
would have been much lower than the figure arrived at by the
trial judge.
[36] We cannot accept the premise of Mr. Bastedo’s argument.  The
fairness of this trial is not measured by comparing the
appellant’s conduct of his own case with the conduct of that case
by a competent lawyer.  If that were the measure of fairness,
trial judges could only require persons to proceed to trial
without counsel in those rare cases where an unrepresented person
could present his or her case as effectively as counsel.
Fairness does not demand that the unrepresented litigant be able
to present his case as effectively as a competent lawyer.
Rather, it demands that he have a fair opportunity to present his
case to the best of his ability.  Nor does fairness dictate that
the unrepresented litigant have a lawyer’s familiarity with
procedures and forensic tactics.  It does require that the trial
judge treat the litigant fairly and attempt to accommodate
unrepresented litigants’ unfamiliarity with the process so as to
permit them to present their case.  In doing so, the trial judge
must, of course, respect the rights of the other party.
[37] Shaughnessy J., who observed the husband over a lengthy
trial, described him as “a very articulate and intelligent
person.”  Nothing in the record causes us to doubt that
assessment.  The husband understood the issues to be litigated.
He had been involved in them for many years.
[38] It is true that the assessment of the husband’s income was
complicated.  That complication, however, arose primarily from
the husband’s own machinations and efforts to limit his
obligations to his wife and children.  There is no reason to
doubt that he had a full appreciation of his own financial
situation and the financial circumstances of his corporations.
[39] The husband had a full opportunity to present his case and
challenge the case presented for the wife.  He did both.  The
introduction of an updated report from the wife’s expert during
the trial did not materially affect the case the husband had to
meet and is explained by the wife’s inability to gain timely
access to the husband’s financial information.
[40] It is telling that, even when the trial was adjourned for
some four weeks, the husband chose to continue to represent
himself rather than retain counsel.  In the light of that
considered decision, it is hard to give any credence to the claim
that he felt overwhelmed by the proceedings and was unable to
adequately present his case.  He presented the case he chose to
present.  It may have been very different from the case a
competent lawyer would have presented, but that does not make the
trial unfair.
[41] It is also submitted that the husband was treated unfairly
by the trial judge.  The parts of the record relied on by the
husband to support that submission do not lead us to conclude
that the husband was treated unfairly or that the appearance of
fairness was compromised.  Clearly, on occasion, the trial judge
was required to correct the husband and to limit the scope of
some of the husband’s answers and submissions.  Such rulings are
commonplace in all trials, even when counsel are involved.
[42] Nothing has been placed before us that would give us cause
to doubt the reliability of the essential findings of the trial
judge.  Those findings include his determination that the
husband’s annual income was very substantial and that he could
have made the interim support payments had he chosen to do so.
Submissions which do no more than present arguments that might
have been made and which, if accepted, could have reduced the
husband’s income somewhat do not undermine the fairness of the
proceedings or the reliability of the result.
[43] It is clear from a review of the trial judge’s reasons, that
the husband’s problem at trial was not that he was unrepresented.
His real problem was that he was determined to give his wife and
children as little as possible and was prepared to lie and cheat
to achieve that goal.  The trial judge said:
          </pre>
      <pre>            Regretfully, I find that Mr. Davids has unequivocally
       demonstrated a profound lack of consideration for his family, and
       that it is highly unlikely that he will pay periodic child and/or
       spousal support at least with a degree of regularity consistent
       with the best interest of the children.  I find that he has
       deliberately diverted assets to avoid seizure of them to satisfy
       support orders.  He has consistently manipulated both his income
       and his assets for no other purpose than to defeat court orders.
          </pre>
      <pre>               The fact that he has alienated several
          of his children appears to be of little
          importance to him.  I find that Mr. Davids
          was not a credible witness.  His testimony is
          replete with fabrication and deception.  In
          particular, his answers were unresponsive or
          deliberately evasive when he was questioned
          about the incorporation of Renart
          Construction, the transfer of his shares to
          his parents and the transfer of vehicles to
          his father.  Mr. Davids is a very articulate
          and intelligent person who I find feigned
          misunderstanding and incomprehension on major
          substantive issues where he had purposefully
          mislead the court concerning his income and
          assets.</pre>
      <pre>[44] The husband was capable of representing himself in these
proceedings.  He was not treated unfairly by the trial judge.
There is no cause to doubt the reliability of the result.  The
husband is very much the author of whatever misfortune he
perceives may have befallen him in the course of this litigation.</pre>
      <pre>The costs appeal</pre>
      <pre>[45] Shaughnessy J. had a discretion to give directions to the
assessment officer.  We see nothing wrong with the directions he
provided and would not interfere with the exercise of his
discretion.</pre>
      <pre>The cross-appeal</pre>
      <pre>[46] As the main appeal fails, it is unnecessary to deal with the
merits of the cross-appeal.</pre>
      <pre>Conclusion</pre>
      <pre>[47] The appeal is dismissed with costs.  The cross-appeal is
dismissed without costs.
