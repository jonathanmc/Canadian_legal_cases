    <pre>[1]  These two appeals arise out of the same transaction and they
were heard together. Davis appeals from conviction and sentence.
Walker appeals only from sentence.</pre>
    <pre>  DAVIS&#146; CONVICTION APPEAL
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.     Admissibility of Davis&#146; Statements to the Police</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge rejected Davis&#146; evidence on the voir dire
and found as a fact that the police had properly informed him of
his right to counsel, both at the scene of the arrest and later
on at the police station before he admitted being present during
the commission of the offences.
[3]  The trial judge further found that Davis understood his
rights and that on each occasion, despite being given the
opportunity to contact counsel immediately, he declined to do so.
[4]  Contrary to the submission of the appellant, it was not
incumbent on the police to instruct Davis that he could, if he
wished, call the lawyer he had retained previously in connection
with an unrelated charge. Assuming that the police were even
aware  of this information, a matter not free from dispute, Davis
was told in no uncertain terms that he could speak to counsel of
his choice or duty counsel, as he saw fit. In our view, the
police were not obliged to go further to fulfil their mandate
under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
[5]  As for the failure of the police to provide Davis with the
toll free legal aid number, the trial judge found as a fact that
Davis was informed that free legal aid was available on a 24-hour
basis and that a legal aid number would be provided upon request
in the event he wished to call counsel immediately. Nothing more
was required of the police. (See R. v. Bartle (1994), 92 C.C.C.
(3d) 289 at 305 (S.C.C.).
[6]  Accordingly, we see no basis for interfering with the trial
judge&#146;s conclusion that having been fully informed of his rights,
Davis chose to waive his right to counsel.
[7]  Finally, with respect to the failure of the police to audio
tape Davis&#146; statement, the trial judge held, correctly in our
view, that while it would have been preferable had the police
used a tape recorder, they were not required, as a matter of law,
to do so. The trial judge then went on to consider the facts and
circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement to
determine whether this was an appropriate case to draw an adverse
inference against the police. In the end, he chose not to do so,
having rejected, at least implicitly, the defence suggestion that
the police had deliberately refrained from recording the
statement in order to set up a credibility contest between
themselves and Davis. In our view, it was open to the trial judge
to come to this conclusion and we see no basis for interfering
with it.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.     The Admissibility of Chen&#146;s Preliminary Hearing Testimony
       as Original Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In view of Chen&#146;s recalcitrance as a witness and his
apparent inability to remember any of the events giving rise to
the charges against Davis, let alone Davis&#146; role in them, the
Crown sought to introduce as original evidence portions of Chen&#146;s
testimony given at Davis&#146; preliminary hearing.
[9]  In determining whether the proposed evidence should be
admitted as original evidence, the trial judge instructed himself
in accordance with the principles set forth in R. v. B. (K.G.)
(1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.) and he carefully considered
all the facts and circumstances surrounding Chen&#146;s involvement
from the time of his arrest to the time of Davis&#146; trial.
[10] In deciding whether the proposed evidence met the threshold
indicia of reliability, the trial judge placed considerable
emphasis on the fact that Chen had testified under oath at Davis&#146;
preliminary hearing and he was thoroughly cross-examined by
Davis&#146; counsel. The trial judge also took into account Chen&#146;s
detailed confession upon arrest, in which he implicated not only
himself but his accomplices, Davis and Walker, his recent plea of
guilty to the very crimes which he now claimed he could not
remember and his apparent motivation for refusing to testify
against Davis at trial.
[11] In the end, it was the trial judge&#146;s considered opinion that
the testimony given by Chen at Davis&#146; preliminary inquiry was
sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception as original
evidence. In our view, it was open to the trial judge to make
this finding and we see no basis for interfering with it.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.     The Trial Judge&#146;s Charge on Credibility and Reliability</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge carefully instructed the jury on the
inherent dangers and frailties of eye-witness identification
evidence and he stressed the factors which bore on the accuracy
of the identification evidence given by the complainants Ms. G.
and Mr. P.  In doing so, he made it clear to the jury that honest
witnesses could be mistaken and he specifically warned the jury
to be &#147;cautious and careful&#148; before accepting this type of
evidence as reliable.
[13] In our view, the charge was adequate and we see no merit in
the suggestion that the trial judge should have gone further than
he did in instructing the jury on the issue of reliability.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.     The Vetrovec Warning</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge warned the jury that to the extent they
found the witnesses Chen, Lacrosse, Barrett and Walker to be of
unsavoury character, they should proceed with care and caution
before acting on their evidence to convict Davis. The trial judge
also set out, in summary form, the factors which the jury should
consider in deciding whether these witnesses, or any of them,
could properly be characterized as unsavoury.
[15] Although the trial judge should not have left it to the jury
to determine whether the witnesses in question were of unsavoury
character, we are confident that the jurors would have had little
difficulty in arriving at this conclusion on their own. As
indicated, the trial judge drew the jury&#146;s attention to the
factors that potentially impaired the worth of the witnesses&#146;
testimony, including their prior criminal records, their
disreputable backgrounds, the fact that Chen and Walker were
accomplices and the admission by Ms. Lacrosse that she had
committed perjury. While it might have been preferable had the
trial judge elaborated somewhat on these factors, in all of the
circumstances, we believe that the instructions were adequate.
[16] Notably, in providing the Vetrovec warning, the trial judge
neglected to instruct the jury that in assessing the worth of the
evidence given by these witnesses, the jury could look to
evidence which tended to confirm their testimony. In this
respect, the charge was unduly favourable to the defence since
there was an abundance of evidence capable of confirming the
witnesses&#146; testimony, including, Davis&#146; inculpatory statement,
the eye-witness testimony of Ms. G. and Mr. P. and the evidence
of various police officers.
[17] On balance, we are satisfied that the jury would have
clearly appreciated the need to proceed with caution before
acting on the evidence of the suspect witnesses to convict Davis.
Accordingly, even though the Vetrovec warning was less than
perfect, it did not, in our view, constitute reversible error.
[18] Accordingly, Davis&#146; appeal from conviction fails.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE APPEALS</pre>
    <pre>[19] Davis and Walker each received sentences totalling 16 years,
comprised as follows:  15 years for the offence of kidnapping; 13
years concurrent for the offence of sexual assault with a weapon;
12 years concurrent for the offence of robbery; and one year
consecutive for the offence of using a firearm in the commission
of an indictable offence. Walker received an additional three
years concurrent for two unrelated break and enter charges.
[20] In addition, the trial judge invoked the provisions of s.
741.2 of the Criminal Code (now. 743.6(1)) and he ordered that
each offender serve one-half of his sentence before being
eligible for parole.</pre>
    <pre>[21] At the time of the commission of the offences, Davis and
Walker were both age 19. Walker, by this time, had already
amassed a substantial youth court record, including a prior
conviction for sexual assault with a weapon. Davis, though
without criminal record, was on bail for a serious firearms
offence arising out of a violent confrontation at a donut shop
where a shot was fired and the Toronto SWAT Unit called.
[22] Based upon the evidence led at the respective sentence
hearings, the trial judge formed the opinion that Davis and
Walker were highly dangerous individuals. He noted that neither
had lived a productive life or contributed to society in any
meaningful way. To the contrary, they had chosen to live a life
of crime and each represented a serious and continuing threat to
society. In the opinion of the trial judge, their prospects for
rehabilitation were slim to nil.
[23] The offences which attracted the 16 year prison terms were,
to say the least, horrific. According to the trial judge, they
represented the worst offences, short of murder, known to our
society. Ms. Cecchetto, on behalf of the Crown, portrayed the
case as one of urban terrorism involving stark horror. In our
view, both descriptions are apt.
[24] In the early morning hours of March 6, 1993, the victims,
Ms. G. and Mr. P. were seated in an automobile parked at King and
Victoria Streets in downtown Toronto drinking tea when they were
approached by Walker, Chen and Davis. Walker went to Ms. G.&#146;s
side of the car and the other two went to the driver&#146;s side. Ms.
G. and Mr. P. were ordered out of the car. When Ms. G. hesitated,
Walker assaulted her and shouted, &#147;Get the fuck out of the car,
bitch.&#148;  Mr. P. initially resisted but complied when they were
shown a sawed off shotgun. Davis and Chen wanted the keys to the
vehicle which were in the ignition. Mr. P. refused to comply and
a shoving match ensued. Walker then fired a shot into the ground
ending Mr. P.&#146;s resistance.
[25] Mr. P., who is white and Ms. G., black, were then ordered
into the car. The gun was pointed at Mr. P.&#146;s head and he was
told to drive. After proceeding a short distance, Chen replaced
P. as the driver and the car was driven to a remote location on
the lakefront. Throughout this time, derogatory remarks were made
against Ms. G. because she had, at one time, been a prostitute
and against Mr. P. because he was white. The three men, speaking
in Jamacian patois, discussed killing the two victims and
disposing of their bodies. Ms. G.,  who is Jamaican, understood
their remarks.
[26] Once the vehicle was stopped at the waterfront, Ms. G. was
ordered out of the car and she was forced to perform fellatio on
Davis. Walker and Chen remained in the car with P.  Davis refused
to use a condom during the act of fellatio. He threatened to blow
Ms. G.&#146;s head off because she was not doing a good job.
[27] After the act of fellatio, Ms. G. was forced to take off her
clothes and lie in the snow where Davis proceeded to rape her. At
this point, Walker shouted at Davis to cover up and use a condom
to avoid the possibility of forensic evidence. Once Davis
finished raping Ms. G., he forced her back into the car in a semi-
naked state and he asked the other two if they wanted anything of
a sexual nature.
[28] Walker took up the offer. He told Ms. G. to leave her
clothes off and he began ridiculing her, stating &#147;[a] nice girl
like you shouldn&#146;t be doing this. After tonight you won&#146;t be
doing this, I am making sure you never do it again.&#148;
[29] Walker then ordered Ms. G. to spread her legs and he
inserted the fully loaded and cocked shotgun into her vagina and
her mouth. He then rammed several of his gloved fingers into her
vagina, after which he ordered her to lick the glove.
[30] The car was then driven from the lakeshore to the High Park
area. En route, the three men discussed the fate of the victims,
including the possibility that they should be killed or kept
hostage. Ultimately, after taking Ms. G.&#146;s purse and Mr. P.&#146;s
wallet and gold chain, the two were ordered out of the car. They
were threatened that if they called the police, their heads would
be blown off.
[31] Needless to say, throughout the ordeal, the victims were
terrified. Apart from being subjected to extreme violence and
dehumanizing acts of unspeakable proportions, both were made to
believe that they were going to die. The incident, which lasted
some two and one-half hours, has had a profound impact on their
lives. To this day, they remain psychologically scarred and it is
safe to say that their lives will never again be the same.
[32] With this background in mind, we turn to the grounds of
appeal raised by the appellants.
[33] The appellants submit that the trial judge committed two
errors in principles in arriving at the 16 year sentences.
[34] First, they contend that the trial judge failed to give
effect to the time each had spent in pre-trial custody. In
Walker&#146;s case, this amounted to 21 months, in Davis&#146; case 15
months.
[35] We see no merit in this argument. In his reasons for
sentence, the trial judge specifically referred to the time each
accused had spent in pre-trial custody and we have no reason to
believe that he failed to take it into account. Presumably, the
trial judge was of the view that having regard to the background
and character of the offenders and the horrific nature of their
crimes, sentences in the range of 18 or 19 years were called for
and would otherwise have been imposed but for the time spent in
pre-trial custody.
[36] Second, the appellants submit that the trial judge failed to
take into account the disparity between the sentences imposed
upon them and the six and one-half year prison term imposed upon
their accomplice Chen.
[37] In our view, this submission is ill-conceived. Chen took no
part in the brutal and degrading sexual assault of Ms. G. and he
was not convicted of that offence. This was a very serious
aggravating feature and it warranted the imposition of much
stiffer sentences upon the appellants.
[38] Furthermore, upon his arrest, Chen co-operated with the
police and provided a full confession in which he implicated not
only himself but his two accomplices. Chen&#146;s initial co-operation
provided the police with valuable information which assisted them
in bringing Davis and Walker to justice. While it is true that
his willingness to co-operate waned over time, Chen nonetheless
gave evidence at Davis&#146; preliminary inquiry which no doubt helped
to secure Davis&#146; conviction.
[39] Finally, unlike Davis and Walker, Chen entered a plea of
guilty in the provincial court at an early opportunity.
[40] In sum, having regard to Chen&#146;s conduct, both during and
after the event, we believe that he was entitled to a much lesser
sentence than his accomplices.
[41] In any event, if anything, Chen&#146;s sentence was overly
lenient and the parity principle does not require this court to
impose equally inappropriate sentences on the appellants. (See
R. v. Hunter (1972), 16 C.R.N.S. 12 (Ont. C.A.).
[42] Finally, the appellants submit that their sentences are
manifestly excessive and far beyond the range of sentences
imposed in like cases. We disagree.
[43] Without delving into the relevant caselaw, suffice it to say
that in the whole of the circumstances, while the sentences are
certainly at the high end of the range, they do not, in our view,
constitute a marked departure from sentences imposed in like
cases.
[44] The remaining question is whether the trial judge erred in
requiring the appellants to serve a minimum of 8 years before
being eligible for parole.
[45] Much as the trial judge recognized that s. 741.2 should be
used sparingly and only in circumstances where the Crown had led
clear evidence of justification, the trial judge essentially
invoked the provision because of his belief that the appellants
represented a continuing danger to society.
[46] We take no issue with that finding. It was certainly one
which the trial judge was entitled to make and it served in no
small measure to justify the very lengthy periods of
incarceration imposed. This court has made it clear, however,
that in imposing a s. 741.2 order, the reasons must extend beyond
those which led to the imposition of the sentence in the first
place. (See R. v. Goulet (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 61 and R. v.
Osborne (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 161.)  With respect, it would
appear that the trial judge failed to give effect to this
principle.
[47] Accordingly, although the case is a close one, we are of the
view that the s. 741.2 orders were not justified and they cannot
stand.
[48] In the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
s. 741.2 order as against each of the appellants is set aside. In
all other respects, the appeals against sentence are dismissed.</pre></td>
