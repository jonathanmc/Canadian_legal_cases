      <pre>Application for review of the order of Mr. Justice R. J. Otter
dated July 12, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The Crown brings this application for a review of the order
made  by Otter J., pursuant to s. 16(1.05) of the Young Offenders
Act  R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, as amended by S.C. 1995, c.  19,  s.  7
(the “Act”), that the respondent, A.W.D., be proceeded against in
youth  court.  The  order was made on the basis  of  the  Crown’s
failure  to  file  a  notice of opposition  to  the  respondent’s
application  for  transfer to the youth  court  within  the  time
prescribed  under  the  Act.  This review  turns  on  whether  an
application for transfer, within the meaning of the Act,  had  in
fact been made by the young person.
[2]  Although the young person communicated his intention to
apply for a transfer to the youth court, it is our view that no
application was made that would trigger the commencement of the
prescribed time limit for filing the notice of opposition. At the
conclusion of the review hearing, we held that the application
was allowed for reasons to follow. The following are those
reasons.
[3]  The respondent is charged with the attempted murder of his
stepfather.  He was sixteen years of age at the time of the
alleged offence. In view of his age and the nature of the
offence, the Act provides that the respondent must be proceeded
against in ordinary court unless the youth court, upon
application made by the Crown or the young person, makes an order
that the young person be proceeded against in youth court.
[4]  According to s. 16(1.02) of the Act, the application for
transfer “must be made orally, in the presence of the other party
to the proceedings, or in writing, with a notice served on the
other party to the proceedings”. If the application is opposed,
the other party to the proceedings must file a notice of
opposition within 21 days after the making of the oral
application or service of the written notice, as the case may be.
Where no notice of opposition is filed within the prescribed
time, “the youth court shall order that the young person be
proceeded against in youth court”: s. 16(1.05) of the Act. The
time period for filing the notice of opposition may be extended
by mutual agreement of the parties by filing a notice to that
effect with the youth court: s. 16(1.06) of the Act.
[5]  No written application was made in this case. However, the
respondent takes the position that an oral application was made
either in open court on March 8, 1999, or during the course of a
judicial pre-trial conference held before Otter J. on March 12,
1999. It is agreed that the Crown did not file a notice of
opposition within 21 days of either one of those two dates.
[6]  On March 8, 1999, counsel for the respondent informed Cole
J. in open court, in the presence of Crown counsel and his
client, that a judicial pre-trial would be taking place on March
12, 1999 “with respect to a transfer hearing”. The respondent
takes the position that these words, either in and of themselves
or in conjunction with the later discussions at the judicial pre-
trial, are sufficient to be construed as an oral application for
transfer within the meaning of the Act.
[7]  The parties agree that counsel for the young person in fact
informed Crown counsel that he was going to make an application
on behalf of his client for a transfer of the prosecution to
youth court. There is some disagreement as to whether Crown
counsel was so informed in his office on March 8, 1999, or later
at the judicial pre-trial on March 12, 1999. In any event, it is
clear that a definite intention to bring an application to
transfer the proceedings was conveyed by counsel for the young
person during the course of the judicial pre-trial before Otter
J. The judicial pre-trial conference was adjourned to March 19,
1999 so that Otter J. could determine when a justice would be
available to conduct the transfer hearing. Given the fact that
the parties contemplated that a transfer hearing would take
place, it is also clear that Crown counsel indicated his
opposition to the application.
[8]  On March 19, 1999, at the continuation of the pre-trial
conference, it was agreed that five days would be required for
the transfer hearing and a date was set for May 25, 1999. The
question of bringing a formal application for transfer and of
filing a notice of opposition was not adverted to or discussed
and the matter was never addressed on the record either on March
12 or on March 19, 1999.
[9]  On May 14, 1999, counsel for the young person realized that
the Crown had failed to file a written notice of opposition. He
therefore informed Crown counsel that his client would not agree
to extend the time for filing the notice of opposition but,
rather, would take the position that the proceedings were
automatically transferred to youth court because of the Crown’s
failure to file the required notice.
[10] The parties further agree that the Crown would not have
objected to the transfer hearing proceeding on May 25, 1999, on
the basis that counsel for the young person never applied for the
transfer, and, also, that the Crown’s failure to file a notice of
opposition, if it was required in the circumstances, was
inadvertent.
[11] Otter J. held that an oral application to transfer the
proceedings to youth court had been made through the combined
effect of the March 8, 1999 appearance before Cole J. and the
March 12, 1999 judicial pre-trial. He also held that the time for
filing the notice of opposition could not be extended other than
by agreement between the parties on filing a notice to that
effect with the youth court. Consequently, Otter J. made the
transfer order now under review.
[12] In our view, Otter J. erred in finding that an oral
application had been made. Rather, there was nothing more than
the expression of an intention to bring an application.
[13] First, the words spoken by counsel for the young person in
open court on March 8 cannot reasonably be construed as being an
“oral application”. At best, counsel was informing the court that
the issue of a transfer would be the subject-matter for
discussion at the judicial pre-trial.
[14] Second, the full and free discussions that take place at a
judicial pre-trial, off the record and in the privacy of judicial
chambers, are simply intended, in the interests of a fair and
expeditious hearing, to provide a forum for the consideration of
matters that would be better decided before the start of the
proceedings and for the making of arrangements for those
decisions to be so made. This is made clear by both s. 625.1 of
the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and s. 27.03(1) of the
Ontario Court of Justice Criminal Proceedings Rules, SI/92-99,
1992 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2298, as amended.
          </pre>
      <pre>               Section 625.1(1) of the Criminal Code reads as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Subject to subsection (2), on
          application by the prosecutor or the accused
          or on its own motion, the court, or a judge
          of the court, before which, or the judge,
          provincial court judge or justice before
          whom, any proceedings are to be held may
          order that a conference between the
          prosecutor and the accused or counsel for the
          accused, to be presided over by the court,
          judge, provincial court judge or justice, be
          held prior to the proceedings to consider the
          matters that, to promote a fair and
          expeditious hearing, would be better decided
          before the start of the proceedings, and
          other similar matters, and to make
          arrangements for decisions on those matters.
          [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
      <pre>          
          </pre>
      <pre>               Rule 27.03(1) of the Criminal
          Proceedings Rules provides as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Unless otherwise ordered by the pre-
          hearing conference judge in accordance with
          rule 2.02, a pre-hearing conference shall be
          an informal meeting conducted in chambers at
          which a full and free discussion of the
          issues raised may occur without prejudice to
          the rights of the parties in any proceedings
          thereafter taking place.</pre>
      <pre>[15]  Hence,  the discussions between counsel and  the  presiding
judge  on March 12, 1999 were without prejudice to the rights  of
the parties in the proceedings thereafter taking place and do not
constitute  an oral application within the meaning  of  the  Act.
They  amounted to no more than the expression of an intention  to
bring  an  application  for transfer and  the  expression  of  an
intention  to  oppose the application. While the  court,  in  the
interest  of  expediency, certainly acted within its  mandate  in
setting  a  date for the making of the decision on  the  transfer
issue,  it remained incumbent upon the young person to  make  the
necessary  application and for the Crown to file  its  notice  of
opposition in accordance with the Act.
[16] For these reasons, Otter J.’s order must be reversed. The
proceedings shall continue in ordinary court as provided in the
Act, unless the youth court orders otherwise upon proper
application being made.
