    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on May 7, 1997 by Mr. Justice
Paisley, sitting with a jury.1</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   After  a  trial  by  a judge and jury,  the  appellant  was
convicted   of  sexual  assault  and  unlawful  confinement   and
sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  five  years.   The
appellant appeals against his conviction and sentence.   In  view
of  our conclusion, we do not find it necessary to deal with  the
sentence  appeal.  The appellant raises five separate grounds  of
appeal against the conviction.
</pre>
    <pre>Challenge for Cause:
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  appellant,  a  black man, was  charged  with  sexually
assaulting a 16 year-old white woman.  Prior to the selection  of
the   jury,  counsel  for  the  appellant  applied  to  challenge
prospective  jurors for cause and sought to put what he  referred
to  as  the  &#147;standard Parks question&#148; to each of  the  potential
jurors.   The wording of the question that was approved  by  this
court in Parks was as follows:
          
               Would your ability to judge the evidence in the case without
          bias, prejudice or partiality be affected by the fact that the
          person charged is black and the deceased is a white man?
</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  trial judge permitted counsel in this case  to  ask  a
question  based  on  the  fact  that  the  appellant  was  black.
However,  he refused to permit counsel to include in the question
any reference to the fact that the complainant was white because,
in  his view, the colour of the complainant was irrelevant to the
issue  of  the possible partiality of the potential jurors.   The
result was that the trial judge refused to permit a question that
would  inquire  into  the possible partiality  arising  from  the
interracial nature of this alleged violent crime.  In  our  view,
he erred in limiting the question in this fashion.
[4]  In R. v. Parks (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353, this court
quashed a manslaughter conviction where the accused was black and
the deceased was white because the trial judge had refused to
permit the defence to ask the potential jurors the question set
out above.  The court pointed out that a question in this form
would capture two elements which may produce partiality:  the
colour of the accused and the interracial nature of the violence
alleged.  The court concluded that the interracial nature of the
violence and the fact that the alleged crime occurred in the
course of the black accused being involved in a criminal drug
transaction combined to provide circumstances in which it was
essential to the conduct of a fair trial that counsel be
permitted to put the question in this form.
[5]  There is no reason to distinguish the violence alleged in
Parks, murder, from that in this case, sexual assault.  If
anything, the potential for partiality in a case involving the
alleged sexual assault of a 16 year-old white girl by a black man
is greater than in the case of alleged violence by one man
against another man.
[6]  The significance of the interracial nature of a crime as it
relates to the potential of partiality was highlighted by
McLachlin J. in R. v. Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481
(S.C.C.).  At p. 494 she said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Racial prejudice against the accused may be detrimental to
          an accused in a variety of ways.  The link between prejudice and
          verdict is clearest where there is an &#147;interracial element&#148; to
          the crime or a perceived link between those of the accused&#146;s race
          and the particular crime.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  respondent argues that the interracial nature  of  the
crime was subsumed in the more general question permitted by  the
trial  judge.  We disagree.  The interracial nature of the  crime
increases  the possibility of partiality.  There may be potential
jurors  who  would consider that they would be able to  reach  an
impartial verdict in the case of a black accused but not  in  the
case  where the victim of the alleged violence is white.  At  the
time  of  the  challenge for cause in this  case,  the  potential
jurors  would not have known the colour of the complainant.   The
question permitted by the trial judge failed to inquire into  the
critical  concern  of partiality that may flow  solely  from  the
interracial nature of the offence.  As this court held in  R.  v.
Glasgow  (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 57, the defendant &#147;was  entitled
to  confront &#133; potential bias head on in the challenge for  cause
process,&#148; and this required that the full Parks question  be  put
to potential jurors.
[8]  In the result, we conclude that the appellant was denied his
statutory right to challenge for cause based on partiality.
This improper denial of the right requires that the conviction be
quashed and a new trial ordered.
</pre>
    <pre>Refusal of Adjournment:
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   At  the outset of trial, defence counsel, not Mr.  Lockyer,
made  an  application to have the trial adjourned  to  allow  him
further  time to prepare.  He had been retained four days earlier
and  told the court that he might be in a position to proceed the
next  day but that realistically he could not imagine being ready
in less than a week.  This was not a simple case.  He pointed out
there  was a large amount of material, including reports of  four
experts  to review, a number of pre-trial applications to prepare
and  several  important  tactical  decisions  to  consider.   The
preliminary  hearing had lasted six days and it would  take  some
time  to review the transcript.  There was serious difficulty  in
reviewing  the  tape  recordings of two statements  made  by  the
complainant  which would be important in the preparation  of  his
cross-examination  of  that  witness.   These  difficulties  were
compounded by the late disclosure of two reports from the  Centre
of Forensic Sciences and the failure by the Crown to disclose the
notes  of  two  police  officers until  the  day  the  trial  was
scheduled to begin.
[10] The Crown did not suggest to the trial judge that there
would be any problems with the availability of witnesses or the
conduct of the prosecution if the case were adjourned as
requested by the defence.
[11] The trial judge refused the application.  In doing so, he
noted that the appellant had changed counsel on a number of
occasions and that &#147;there is nothing before me that indicates
that his discharge of counsel is for good cause.&#148;  He described
the appellant as the author of his own misfortune.  The trial
judge in effect rejected the submission of defence counsel that
he required further time to prepare and concluded that there
would be no prejudice to the accused if the trial were to
proceed.
[12] The court has a discretion whether or not to adjourn a
trial.  This discretion must be exercised judicially.  In our
view, the trial judge erred in refusing to adjourn the trial in
the circumstances of this case.  There was nothing to suggest
that the appellant had discharged his lawyers for anything other
than perfectly proper reasons.  There was no suggestion that the
appellant was attempting to delay the trial or manipulate the
system.  Indeed, his counsel was ready to proceed after a very
short adjournment.  The Crown did not indicate there would be any
prejudice to its case if the adjournment were granted.
[13] Moreover, the submission of defence counsel that he required
more time to prepare was objectively reasonable.  This was a
complex case.  There was much to be done to fully and adequately
prepare.  The trial judge ought to have attached more weight to
the seemingly reasonable submissions of an experienced defence
counsel and allowed the short adjournment requested.
[14] That said, the appellant does not now contend that the
defence at trial was incompetent.  Indeed, in the circumstances,
trial counsel appears to have done a commendable job.  Rather,
the appellant argues that once it is shown that the trial judge
erred in exercising his discretion in refusing an adjournment, it
automatically follows that there must be a new trial.  In other
words, the unfairness of the trial is presumed.  We do not accept
that argument.  The test, in our view, is whether it can be shown
that the refusal to grant the adjournment resulted in an
unfairness to the appellant or created the appearance of
unfairness.  In view of the fact that we are directing a new
trial, in any event, we do not find it necessary to determine if
that test has been met in this case.</pre>
    <pre>Alleged Concocted Alibi:
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The Crown, as part of its case, moved to lead evidence that
the  appellant had concocted an alibi that had been  led  at  his
show  cause  bail hearing.  In support of its motion,  the  Crown
referred to an outline of the evidence it intended to call.   The
defence  objected  to the Crown introducing the  concocted  alibi
evidence.   The  trial judge found that there was an  evidentiary
basis  from  which  the  jury could  infer  that  the  alibi  was
deliberately  fabricated and permitted  the  Crown  to  lead  the
evidence as part of its case.
[16] It is not necessary to describe the evidence.  What is
important is that the Crown at trial, the trial judge and the
respondent on this appeal have all accepted that the evidence
actually led by the Crown fell short of establishing that the
alibi put forward at the show cause hearing was concocted.  It is
also agreed that as the evidence failed to provide a basis for a
finding that the alibi was concocted, it should not have been led
as part of the Crown&#146;s case:  R. v. Witter (1996), 105 C.C.C.
(3d) 44 (C.A.).
[17] In our view, the failed attempt by the Crown to establish
that the appellant had concocted an alibi could have caused
serious prejudice to the appellant in a number of different ways.
The most significant potential prejudice was that at the close of
the Crown&#146;s case counsel may have felt obliged to rely upon the
defence of alibi.  The jury had heard that the defence had
asserted an alibi at the show cause hearing.  It would have been
difficult to abandon that defence at trial and maintain any
credibility with the jury.  The alibi evidence was not strong.
It is not hard to imagine that counsel, absent the alibi evidence
adduced by the Crown, might have chosen not to simply argue that
the Crown had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
[18] Had counsel not wanted to rely on the alibi, he could have
moved for a mistrial at the conclusion of the Crown&#146;s case.
Counsel did not move for a mistrial, but instead called one
witness to attempt to support the alibi.  The evidence of this
witness was very weak.
[19] We must assume that the defence was aware of its options at
the end of the Crown&#146;s case and nonetheless chose to proceed with
the alibi defence rather than bringing the mistrial motion.
Consequently, we would not be prepared to hold that by leading
the evidence of the alibi, the Crown forced a defence upon the
accused or that there was actual prejudice to his defence.
[20] The difficult situation created when the Crown&#146;s case failed
to live up to expectations demonstrates the caution which must be
exercised when the Crown seeks to adduce evidence of a concocted
alibi.  While we do not suggest that the trial judge must hear
the evidence by way of voir dire in every case, he or she should
be satisfied that the evidence will in fact provide the basis for
the inference of concoction.</pre>
    <pre>Fibre Expert Evidence:
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in admitting
the evidence of a fibre expert who testified that fibres found on
the   seat  of  the  appellant&#146;s  truck,  where  the  complainant
testified  she had sat, could have come from the same  source  as
fibres found on the complainant&#146;s clothing.  The fibres were  not
originally  from  the  truck or the clothing.   They  were  black
polyester  fibres which were mass-produced and, therefore,  could
have come from a great number of different sources.
[22] The probative value of this evidence was slight.  However,
it was within the trial judge&#146;s discretion to weigh that
probative value against its prejudicial effect in order to
determine if the evidence was admissible.  We are not prepared to
interfere with the exercise of this discretion.  The evidence was
simple and straightforward.  We are not persuaded that the jury
would not have understood the evidence and have attached the
appropriate weight to it.  It must also be said that apart from
the fibre evidence, there was a formidable body of circumstantial
evidence placing the complainant in the appellant&#146;s vehicle.
Therefore, we do not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Medical Evidence:
</pre>
    <pre>[23]  The  Crown called a doctor who had examined the complainant
shortly after the alleged assault.  The doctor testified that the
complainant  had  two linear cuts on her right labium  and  three
linear  cuts on her left labium.  The doctor testified that  this
was  abnormal but was unable to describe the cuts in  detail  and
significantly was unable to describe the age of the cuts.   This,
of  course, greatly reduced the probative value of the  evidence.
In  his  charge  the  trial judge reviewed the  evidence  of  the
doctor,  but failed to point out the difficulty with the evidence
arising from her inability to indicate the age of the cuts.  This
was  a serious omission in the review of this witness&#146;s evidence.
However, in view of the fact that we are ordering a new trial, in
any  event, we do not find it necessary to decide if this  error,
taken alone, would have justified ordering a new trial.
</pre>
    <pre>Disposition:
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  Accordingly,  the  appeal is  allowed,  the  conviction  is
quashed and a new trial is ordered.
