    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>
[1]  The parties hereto entered into a Jewish religious marriage</pre>
    <pre>on April 3, 1987.  On July 20, 1994, the parties were married in</pre>
    <pre>a civil ceremony pursuant to the provisions of the Marriage Act,</pre>
    <pre>R.S.O. 1990, c.M.3.  Between those dates, the husband acquired</pre>
    <pre>substantial assets.  The parties then separated and the issue</pre>
    <pre>arose as to whether the equalization date for the division of</pre>
    <pre>assets, pursuant to the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3,</pre>
    <pre>should be 1987 or 1994.  The plaintiff instituted an action for a</pre>
    <pre>declaration that the definition of a spouse in s.1(1)(b) of the</pre>
    <pre>Family Law Act gave her the status to claim as such from and</pre>
    <pre>after April 3, 1987.  The defendant moved for summary judgment.</pre>
    <pre>Walsh J.  of the Ontario Court General Division allowed the</pre>
    <pre>motion and dismissed the action in respect of this issue.  The</pre>
    <pre>plaintiff appeals from this disposition.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Section 4 of the Marriage Act provides that no marriage may</pre>
    <pre>be solemnized except under the authority of a licence issued</pre>
    <pre>pursuant to the Act.  The appellant does not contend that she</pre>
    <pre>thought the 1987 ceremony was being conducted pursuant to the</pre>
    <pre>statute; but she claims that her husband made representations</pre>
    <pre>which led her to believe in good faith that she was for all</pre>
    <pre>purposes legally married.  There are differences in the evidence</pre>
    <pre>of the parties as to what occurred leading up to the 1987</pre>
    <pre>ceremony, and if the appeal requires a resolution of those facts</pre>
    <pre>then clearly a trial will be required.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  I have concluded that the legal issue on appeal can be</pre>
    <pre>framed by taking the appellant's position at its highest from the</pre>
    <pre>facts and, specifically, from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the</pre>
    <pre>appellant's factum reading:
</pre>
    <pre>          22.  Shortly before the scheduled nuptials
          were to be performed on 3 April 1987, the
          husband advised the wife that he wished to
          continue receiving his widower's pension
          benefits under the Canada Pension Plan Act
          and he therefore proposed that their marriage
          not be registered with the authorities for a
          while.</pre>
    <pre>          23.  The wife's evidence is that she agreed
          to the absence of the marriage licence and
          the consequent non-registration with the
          government of the marriage, relying on
          representations from the husband (which he
          denies making) that the absence of the
          marriage licence would not change the nature
          of the marriage and that the marriage would
          be the same as one for which a marriage
          licence had been obtained.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The definition of spouse is found in s.1(1) of the Family
Law Act:</pre>
    <pre>          &quot;spouse&quot; mans either of a man and woman who,</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  are married to each other, or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  have together entered into a
               marriage that is voidable or void, in
               good faith on the part of the person
               asserting a right under this Act.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant relies upon the good faith provision in</pre>
    <pre>subparagraph (b) and frames the issue in its factum as follows:
</pre>
    <pre>          a)   The Learned Justice erred in determining
          that the good faith required by s.1(1)(b) of
          the Family Law Act was the intention to
          comply with the Marriage Act, rather than the
          intention to comply with the Family Law Act,
          in the sense of assuming mutual rights and
          obligations under the Family Law Act of
          spousal support and equalization of family
          property as would arise from the legal and
          valid marriage that would have resulted had
          there been a marriage licence obtained.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant's argument is that the Family Law Act should</pre>
    <pre>be given a broad reading to assure a fair distribution of assets</pre>
    <pre>between the parties. On this approach if, as is alleged, the</pre>
    <pre>husband by his representations led the wife to the bona fide</pre>
    <pre>belief that she was for all purposes legally married, she should</pre>
    <pre>be entitled to rely upon that good faith in asserting a right</pre>
    <pre>under the Family Law Act.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  This issue was considered in Re Harris and Godkewitsch</pre>
    <pre>(1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 779 (Prov. Ct.) by Nasmith J., where the</pre>
    <pre>parties had participated in a Jewish religious marriage ceremony</pre>
    <pre>and had intentionally avoided compliance with the provisions of</pre>
    <pre>the Marriage Act. He said at p. 781:
</pre>
    <pre>               In my view &quot;good faith&quot; as used in s.
          1(f)(iii) [of the Family Law Reform Act, S.O.
          1978] must be taken in the sense of
          &quot;intention to comply with Ontario law&quot;. This
          is consistent, I think, with the scheme of
          s.1 and the provisions of the Ontario
          Marriage Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.256, including
          s.31 which reads as follows:
</pre>
    <pre>                    31. If the parties to a marriage
               solemnized in good faith and intended to
               be in compliance with this Act are not
               under a legal disqualification to
               contract such marriage and after such
               solemnization have lived together and
               cohabited as man and wife, such marriage
               shall be deemed a valid marriage,
               notwithstanding that the person who
               solemnized the marriage was not
               authorized to solemnize marriage, and
               notwithstanding the absence of or any
               irregularity or insufficiency in the
               publication of banns or the issue of the
               licence.</pre>
    <pre>               To extend &quot;spouse&quot; under s.1 to cover a
          person who has participated in a ceremony in
          Ontario which is quite clearly and
          deliberately outside the Marriage Act because
          it was &quot;in good faith&quot;, in the non-legal
          sense of religious and moral commitments,
          would be to invite much confusion and
          uncertainty. This is an intention which I am
          not inclined to attribute to the Legislature.</pre>
    <pre>     [Section 31 above is virtually identical to s.31 of the
current Marriage Act.]</pre>
    <pre>[8]  This reasoning was adopted by Granger J. in Reaney v. Reaney</pre>
    <pre>(1990), 28 R.F.L. (3d) 52 (Ont. H.C.). In that case the applicant</pre>
    <pre>for relief under the Family Law Act entered into a civil marriage</pre>
    <pre>and was issued a licence under the Act, but he did so knowing</pre>
    <pre>that he remained married to his first wife. Granger J. held that</pre>
    <pre>the applicant could not have been acting in good faith in the</pre>
    <pre>sense of having an intention to comply with Ontario law.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Walsh J. followed these authorities in reaching his</pre>
    <pre>conclusion and I am satisfied that it was right for him to do so.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] From a policy point of view, it is reasonable to argue for</pre>
    <pre>fairness in the interpretation of a statute such as the Family</pre>
    <pre>Law Act. However, it is my view that in this instance the</pre>
    <pre>stronger policy argument is for certainty of identification of</pre>
    <pre>the status of being married as the indicator for the distribution</pre>
    <pre>of assets. The appellant's reading of &quot;good faith&quot;, as referring</pre>
    <pre>to the state of mind of the applicant as to the legality of the</pre>
    <pre>marriage, which was knowingly not conducted pursuant to the laws</pre>
    <pre>of Ontario, creates unlimited scope for uncertainty and</pre>
    <pre>inevitable conflicts in the evidence presented by parties whose</pre>
    <pre>interests are at stake over what would be, in the last analysis,</pre>
    <pre>a subjective assumption as to a legal status.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] Policy aside, on a plain construction analysis of the</pre>
    <pre>language of the definition of spouse, the appellant's position</pre>
    <pre>seems to me to be strained. Subsection 1(1)(a) of the Family Law</pre>
    <pre>Act refers to persons who are married, which can only refer to</pre>
    <pre>persons who are considered married under the laws of Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>Subsection 1(1)(b) refers to marriage which, prima facie, would</pre>
    <pre>carry the same meaning. There is then a reference to &quot;voidable or</pre>
    <pre>void&quot;. Those words have no relevance or application to the</pre>
    <pre>circumstances of the parties to this appeal. The religious</pre>
    <pre>ceremony was not void or voidable and these words have obvious</pre>
    <pre>reference to the statutory marriage, which may, in particular</pre>
    <pre>circumstances, be void or voidable. We then come to the words &quot;in</pre>
    <pre>good faith on the part of the person asserting a right under this</pre>
    <pre>Act.&quot; As I read it, this would refer to the respondent, (not the</pre>
    <pre>applicant), in the Reaney case who, unknowingly, married a</pre>
    <pre>bigamist. There, the marriage is void or voidable because one of</pre>
    <pre>the parties was legally disqualified from entering a second</pre>
    <pre>marriage. The innocent party to that purported marriage is given</pre>
    <pre>a status under the Family Law Act that he or she does not have</pre>
    <pre>under the Marriage Act.  That is, in my view, the type of</pre>
    <pre>fairness which the Legislature intended to build into the scheme</pre>
    <pre>of distribution of assets under the Family Law Act.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] Thus, reading &quot;marriage&quot; as meaning marriage under the</pre>
    <pre>Marriage Act gives purpose to the definition of spouse consistent</pre>
    <pre>with the Family Law Act and does not introduce the myriad of</pre>
    <pre>uncertainties that would flow from a broader interpretation. It</pre>
    <pre>is therefore unnecessary to determine what events led up to the</pre>
    <pre>1987 religious marriage. The parties entered into a legal</pre>
    <pre>marriage in 1994 and the equalization date should be set</pre>
    <pre>accordingly.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] For these reasons I agree with the disposition by the</pre>
    <pre>motions judge and would dismiss the appeal with costs.
