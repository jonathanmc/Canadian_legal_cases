</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgments of Madam Justice Joan Lax dated
November 14, 1996 and April 6, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We agree with Lax J., for the reasons she gave, that on the
material before her in November 1996, there were no genuine
issues for trial.
[2]  The admissibility of the July affidavit is not properly
before us.  Lax J. held that it was inadmissible and Blair J.
refused leave to appeal that decision.  The filing of that
affidavit for purposes of identification on the cross-examination
did not make its contents admissible for their truth.
Accordingly, this appeal must be determined without reference to
that affidavit.
[3]  The decision whether or not to reopen the motion was
discretionary.  While the test has been expressed in a number of
different ways, it essentially comes to this.  The court must
consider whether the evidence would probably have changed the
result and whether that evidence could have been discovered by
the exercise of reasonable diligence.  The reasonable diligence
requirement will, however, be relaxed in exceptional
circumstances where necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice.
[4]  The motions judge found on a preliminary assessment of the
additional material that she was prepared to accept that it would
probably have changed the result.  She also found, and this is
incontrovertible, that the evidence could have been presented on
the motion through the exercise of reasonable diligence.  The
issue then was whether there were exceptional circumstances that
warranted setting aside the due diligence requirement.  Lax J.
fully considered that issue.  She was prepared to assume that the
solicitor was negligent but that even so the circumstances were
not so exceptional as to warrant the exercise of discretion in
favour of the appellants.  On the basis of the material that was
properly before her, there is  no basis for interfering with Lax
J.&#146;s decision or for holding that she failed to exercise her
discretion on proper grounds.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
