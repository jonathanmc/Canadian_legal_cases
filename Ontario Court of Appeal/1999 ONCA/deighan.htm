    <pre>HEARD:         June 24, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice MacPherson dated June 25, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge found that the officer had reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that the appellant was intoxicated
and intended to drive his motor vehicle away from the scene.  We
reject the contention that the appellant&#146;s level of intoxication
and his words were not such as could reasonably justify those
findings.  The finding of intoxication was available on the
evidence.  We do not agree that as a matter of law only extreme
intoxication amounting to stupefaction will suffice to justify an
arrest under the relevant legislation.  The findings of fact are
supported by the evidence and, in our view, there is no error in
law.
[2]  A belief that an arresting officer does not have reasonable
and probable grounds to arrest and that the arrest is therefore
unlawful is not a defence to the charge.  The Crown must prove
that the arrest was in fact lawful and that it was made on
reasonable and probable grounds, but an accused&#146;s assessment of
the lawfulness of the arrest is irrelevant.
[3]  In our view, the sentence imposed reveals no error in law.
However, we wish to make it clear that on the proper
interpretation of the sentence, the appellant has 71 days left to
serve on this intermittent sentence.  It is also our intention
that the appellant serve the sentence on the normal terms, that
is that he surrender by 7:00 p.m. on each Friday and that he be
released by 6:00 a.m. or earlier, if possible, on each Monday
until the sentence is served.
[4]  Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
