    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hoilett J. dated February 26 and
June 26, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal from two of the three decisions rendered
by  Hoilett  J. in this action. The three decisions are  related;
they all flow from a ninety-seven day trial presided over by  the
trial  judge.  Before the trial commenced, the parties agreed  on
the  question  of damages: $1,692,575.58 for Petrus  DeJong,  the
young  man  who  suffered the injuries which  gave  rise  to  the
action, and $1,128,383.88 for Theodora DeJong, Petrus&#146; mother and
his principal caregiver since he suffered the injuries.1
[2]  In his principal set of reasons on February 26, 1996, the
trial judge held that the defendants Owen Sound General and
Marine Hospital, Jean Leaver, Anna Pettit and Jos Hulshof  (&#147;the
hospital&#148;) and the defendants Dr. Thomas Schofield and Dr.
Winston Gormandy (&#147;the doctors&#148;) were liable in negligence for
the injuries suffered by Petrus DeJong.
[3]  In his second decision, on June 26, 1996, the trial judge
apportioned liability among the defendants on the following
basis: the hospital &#150; 65%; Dr. Gormandy &#150; 25%; Dr. Schofield &#150;
10%.
[4]  In his third decision, on December 23, 1996, the trial judge
awarded the plaintiffs their costs of the action which he fixed
at $975,340.74 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.
[5]  The defendants appeal the first and second decisions
rendered by the trial judge.  They contend that they were not
negligent in their conduct with respect to the plaintiff, Petrus
DeJong.  In the alternative, they contend that if they were
negligent, the apportionment of liability should be varied in
their favour (and against their co-defendant(s)).
[6]  The trial judge&#146;s first and second decisions dealing with
the liability and apportionment issues are comprehensive sets of
reasons.  The trial judge summarized the facts in a clear and
organized fashion.  His review of the evidence was both
comprehensive and careful.  He made clear findings of
credibility.  After a lengthy trial, and in a field as complex as
medical malpractice, the structure and contents of the trial
judge&#146;s reasons are of real value to an appellate court.
</pre>
    <pre>A.   The Hospital&#146;s Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  trial  judge  found  the hospital  negligent  in  four
respects (Reasons, at pp. 129-30):

      (a) it located the plaintiff in a room, A-127, framed with
          windows comprised of glass that was not only easily breakable,
          but when broken, shattered into potentially lethal weapons; a
          circumstance that rendered, very difficult, if not impossible,
          any reasonable attempts at restraining or rescuing the plaintiff;
          a corollary to which was a failure to place the plaintiff in an
          area of greatest safety, as required by hospital policy;
      </pre>
    <pre>      (b) it failed, by virtue of the omissions of its staff, to
          elevate the level of observation for the plaintiff to constant at
          a time when the plaintiff posed a high suicide risk; having
          evinced suicide ideation and a plan, or at least created in the
          team members a state of mind that obliged them to treat the
          plaintiff as if he had a plan, until they were able to elicit
          from him information to the contrary;</pre>
    <pre>      (c) it failed on the second admission to hold an intake
          conference within the 72 hours, in accordance with hospital
          policy.  Given the acute, and worsening presentation on the
          second admission, it cannot be an excuse that team members were
          going on vacation.  There is an overriding obligation on the part
          of the hospital to ensure that an acutely depressed patient does
          not, as it were, fall through the cracks;</pre>
    <pre>      (d) the quality of charting during the second admission fell
          short of reasonable standards; the most flagrant manifestation
          being that of Nurse Oberle, the circumstances of which were fully
          canvassed.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The hospital mounted a detailed attack on all four of these
findings.  In our view, none of the hospital&#146;s attack goes beyond
asking this court to conduct a retrial of the action.  We are  of
the  view  that  all  four  of  the trial  judge&#146;s  findings  are
supported  by  the  evidence. In particular, we  think  that  the
record  provides  very  strong support  for  his  conclusions  in
paragraphs (a) and (c).
[9]  The glass in a private room in a psychiatric ward should not
have been ordinary, easily breakable glass. The clearest
indication of this is that all the doctors and staff in the
hospital believed that it was safety glass. Given that it was
ordinary glass, the plaintiff should not have been placed in that
room, especially in his worsened condition on the second
admission.
[10] Moreover, the hospital (and Dr. Gormandy) failed in their
obligation to hold an intake conference within 72 hours of the
plaintiff&#146;s readmission.  A conference within this time frame was
a formal hospital policy.  Indeed, it appears that a conference
concerning the plaintiff was scheduled; nurse Jean Leaver wrote
on the patient&#146;s chart on August 22, 1984 (the second day of his
readmission): &#147;He will be conferenced tomorrow&#148;.  For reasons
unexplained, the intake conference was never held.  In our view,
this conference was especially necessary in light of the
plaintiff&#146;s early return after his lengthy first admission and
the obvious fact that his condition upon readmission was
significantly worse than it has been when he was discharged six
days earlier.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Dr. Gormandy&#146;s Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The  trial  judge  found Dr. Gormandy  negligent  in  three
respects (Reasons, at pp. 130-31):
      </pre>
    <pre>      (a) Either  he   accurately  diagnosed   the
          plaintiff&#146;s   illness  but   failed   to
          prescribe    medication    in    amounts
          adequate  to reflect that diagnosis;  or
          in  the alternative, he misdiagnosed the
          plaintiff&#146;s   illness  and  accordingly,
          failed     to    prescribe    medication
          adequately   to  treat  the  plaintiff&#146;s
          true illness;
      </pre>
    <pre>      (b) he  failed  on  the  plaintiff&#146;s  second
          admission   adequately  to  assess   the 
          plaintiff&#146;s suicide risk, and, a fortiori,
          failed to order constant observation, the
          level  of observation appropriate  to the
          high  suicide  risk  that, on  the expert
          evidence,  I  find  was   posed  by   the
          plaintiff;
      </pre>
    <pre>      (c) Although  Dr. Gormandy  equivocated  when
          asked who the  team leader  was, at least
          one of the psychiatric experts who  spoke
          to    the  issue   testified  that    the
          psychiatrist was. Common sense would tend 
          to  support  that  view, given  that  the
          psychiatrist is the  senior  professional
          on the team.  I appreciate the  fact that
          Dr. Gormandy  was  off ill after the late
          morning of August 24, 1984  but  he must,
          in my view, share the responsibility  for
          the  failed  intake  conference.   He was
          only a telephone call  away  and, indeed,
          was in the  hospital  on  the evening  of
          August 24,  following  the  mishap, as he
          was in the days leading up to the mishap.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Dr.  Gormandy&#146;s  appeal against these findings  essentially
boils  down  to this: the trial judge believed the  wrong  expert
witnesses.   He  should have believed the doctors called  by  the
defendants.
[13] We disagree.  The trial judge carefully reviewed the
evidence of all of the doctors including, importantly, Dr.
Gormandy himself.  He analyzed the substance of their evidence
and he made clear findings of credibility.  There is nothing in
the record, or in counsel&#146;s legal submissions on appeal, to
justify a conclusion that the trial judge erred in relying on the
expert testimony of Dr. John Mount and Dr. John Bradford.
[14] Moreover, there was nothing wrong with the trial judge&#146;s
treatment of Dr. Gormandy&#146;s evidence.  At various junctures,
before there was any suggestion of litigation, Dr. Gormandy
formally documented his diagnosis of the plaintiff as a person
with a psychotic depressive illness.  The trial judge was
entitled to accept that evidence, as opposed to Dr. Gormandy&#146;s
attempt to qualify it during his testimony, and use it as a
departure point for his analysis of the treatment the doctor
provided to his patient.  He was also entitled to conclude, on
the basis of his consideration of the factual situation and the
medical testimony he did accept (on this point, principally that
of Dr. Bradford) that the treatment provided by Dr. Gormandy fell
below the standard of care that the medical and psychiatric
communities would regard as reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>C.   Dr. Schofield&#146;s Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  trial judge found Dr. Schofield negligent in a  single
respect (Reasons, at pp. 136-38):

          Dr.  Schofield,  at all material  times,
          was  the  Chief  of  the  Department  of
          Psychiatry  at  the defendant  hospital,
          having  assumed that role in  1981.   He
          had  admitted the responsibility for the
          formulation   and   implementation    of
          policies  and  procedures applicable  to
          the  running  of  the psychiatric  unit,
          which   responsibility   included    the
          overall  safety  and  security  of   the
          physical     environment    in     which
          psychiatric patients are housed.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  appears clear from the evidence that
          either  Dr.  Schofield  took  inadequate
          steps  to inform himself concerning  the
          calibre  of the glass contained  in  the
          windows in the psychiatric unit, and, in
          particular, the glass in the windows  of
          the  room assigned to the plaintiff; or,
          if  he  adequately informed himself,  he
          failed  to  take  reasonable  steps   to
          ensure  that the glass was strong enough
          to protect against the kind of risk that
          materialized  in  the early  evening  of
          August   24,  1984.  Counsel   for   Dr.
          Gormandy  argued,  convincingly,  in  my
          view,   that  Dr.  Gormandy  by   making
          queries concerning the strength  of  the
          window  glass on his first  arrival  had
          acted  reasonably and prudently and  had
          thereby discharged his responsibility in
          that  regard.  The indications are  that
          Dr. Schofield made no such enquiries and
          given    his    overall   administrative
          responsibility, the onus on him would be
          greater  than  on a staff  psychiatrist.
          To  the  extent that the overall  safety
          features  of  the  hospital  failed  Dr.
          Schofield   must   in   my   view   bear
          responsibility.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Dr. Schofield admitted to responsibility
          for  determining the patient  population
          admitted  to the hospital, a  population
          of which high risk suicidal patients are
          a component.  His failure, therefore, to
          ensure  the  safety of P-1 by satisfying
          himself concerning the strength  of  the
          window  glass constituted  a  breach  of
          duty  to the plaintiff; and, for reasons
          I  have earlier given, I find that there
          is  a  causal  connection  between  that
          breach and the plaintiff&#146;s damages.</pre>
    <pre>[16] It can be seen that the gist of the trial judge&#146;s finding is
that Dr. Schofield failed in his duty qua hospital administrator,
not  qua  treating physician.  Counsel for the hospital  candidly
conceded as much in his argument.  Counsel also stated, fairly in
my  view,  that to his knowledge there is nothing in  the  record
that  could support a finding of negligence against Dr. Schofield
qua  treating  physician.  Moreover, in  our  view  there  is  no
evidence  to  support the conclusion that in  his  administrative
capacity Dr. Schofield had any responsibility for the building.
[17] Since the liability the trial judge ascribed to Dr.
Schofield related only to the composition of the glass in the
plaintiff&#146;s hospital room and since the trial judge found that
the hospital was, and Dr. Gormandy was not, responsible for the
glass, it follows that the 10% of liability assigned to Dr.
Schofield should be shifted entirely to the hospital.
</pre>
    <pre>D.   Liability &#150; All Defendants</pre>
    <pre>[18]  Before leaving the issue of liability, we want  to  address
one  argument  made  strenuously  by  all  the  defendants.   The
hospital contends that, even if it was negligent with respect  to
the  plaintiff, no liability should be found against  it  because
the   principal  cause  of  the  plaintiff&#146;s  injuries  was   the
negligence  of  Dr. Gormandy.  The doctors submit  the  opposite,
namely that even if they were negligent, they should not be  held
liable  because  the  principal cause of  the  injuries  was  the
hospital&#146;s negligence.  Put more succinctly, the hospital  argued
vigorously   that  &#147;Petrus  was  injured  because  Dr.   Gormandy
undermedicated  him&#148;; Dr. Gormandy&#146;s response was &#147;my  medication
did not cause the injury; it was the hospital&#146;s dangerous glass.&#148;
[19] We do not agree with this line of argument.  The trial judge
said (Reasons, at p. 135):

          The  crisis that occurred on August  24,
          1984,  was,  in  my  view,  the  logical
          culmination   of  those   instances   of
          negligence that I have canvassed in  the
          course of these reasons.  Together, they
          constituted  a breach of  duty  of  care
          owed by the defendants to the plaintiff.
          It  is  not,  in my view,  necessary  to
          weigh  the  various causes  contributing
          to  the plaintiff&#146;s injury, convinced as
          I  am  that  they were each contributing
          causes. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[20]  We agree with this analysis.  In School Div. of Assiniboine
South  v.  Hoffer, [1971] 4 W.W.R. 746 at 750 (Man. C.A.),  aff&#146;d
[1973] S.C.R. vi, Dickson J.A. said:</pre>
    <pre>          It  is  enough to fix liability  if  one
          could foresee in a general way the  sort
          of thing that happened.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  In the present case, Dr. Gormandy could foresee that if  he
failed  to  order  an  appropriate level  of  observation  and/or
medication,  his  patient  could act out  in  a  self-destructive
manner  and  hurt himself. He could do so in all sorts  of  ways,
some   involving  negligence  by  the  hospital  and  some   not.
Similarly,  the  hospital could foresee  that  if  it  failed  to
provide a safe setting on its psychiatric ward, the patient could
act   out   and  harm  himself,  whether  or  not  he  had   been
appropriately treated by his attending physician.
[22] The fact situation here is not, as Dr. Gormandy contends,
analogous to the situation in Mortimer v. Cameron (1994), 17 O.R.
(3d) 1 (C.A.).  In that case two boys were engaged in horseplay
at the top of a staircase.  They fell together down the stairs
and lightly struck an interior wall.  The wall had been poorly
built and it collapsed.  The boys fell an additional 10 feet to
the ground outside.  One boy suffered a broken neck and was
rendered a complete quadriplegic.
[23] The trial judge and this court held that although the second
boy engaged in dangerous conduct, he was not liable in negligence
because his conduct was not the proximate cause of the ultimate
injury to the other boy.  Referring to the two boys and their
horseplay, Robins J.A. said, at p. 15:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   risk   to   which   they   exposed
          themselves was the risk of being injured
          by  falling down the stairs or onto  the
          exterior  landing  or  by  hitting   the
          exterior    wall.    The    risk    that
          materialized was of a different nature.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In the present appeal, the harm that materialized was  well
within  the  range  of  harm that the defendants,  including  Dr.
Gormandy, could reasonably foresee.  He could foresee that if  he
failed  to  properly treat a suicidal patient, the patient  might
attempt  to  act  out  in a self-destructive  manner  inside  the
hospital,  or try to escape the hospital grounds and do something
self-destructive.  Whether the patient threw  himself  against  a
window  or simply waited for an opportune moment to bolt  through
the  front  door  of the hospital, the potential result  &#150;  self-
destructive conduct resulting in  personal injury to the  patient
&#150;  was foreseeable.  In Dickson J.A.&#146;s words, Dr. Gormandy &#147;could
foresee in a general way the sort of thing that happened&#148;.
[25] In summary, the negligence of the hospital and Dr. Gormandy
were both direct causes of the plaintiff&#146;s injuries.  The attempt
by both defendants to impose complete liability on each other
fails.</pre>
    <pre>E.   Apportionment</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The  hospital and doctors both challenge the trial  judge&#146;s
apportionment  of liability. An appellate court should  interfere
with a trial judge&#146;s apportionment of liability only if there are
&#147;strong  and  exceptional  circumstances&#148;  to  support  such   an
intervention: see Sparks and Fairfax v. Thompson, [1975] 1 S.C.R.
618  at  626.  In our view, there is nothing in the trial judge&#146;s
careful  analysis, or in the record before him, that  comes  even
close  to this standard.  The only variation in the trial judge&#146;s
apportionment that should be made is the one required by allowing
Dr.  Schofield&#146;s appeal.  Liability rests 75% with  the  hospital
and 25% with Dr. Gormandy.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appeals of the hospital and Dr. Gormandy are dismissed.
[28] The appeal of Dr. Schofield is allowed and the action
against him is dismissed.
[29] The apportionment of liability as between the hospital and
Dr. Gormandy is varied to provide that the hospital is 75% liable
and Dr. Gormandy is 25% liable.  The costs order made at trial is
varied to reflect this apportionment.
[30] The respondents are entitled to one set of costs on the
appeal payable 75% by the hospital and 25% by Dr. Gormandy.  The
costs of the appeal are on a party and party scale.
