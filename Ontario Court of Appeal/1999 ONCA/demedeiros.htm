    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice T. Zuber on
December 5, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his sentence of sixteen years'
imprisonment for attempted murder and an additional two years for
use of a firearm in the commission of an offence.  The sentences
for other related firearm offences were made concurrent to these
sentences.  The total sentence of eighteen years was in addition
to twenty months' pre-trial custody.  The appellant also appeals
from the parole ineligibility order of one-half the global
sentence, or nine years.
[2]  Although, in our view, the sentence for attempted murder was
at the high end of the range, we are unable to conclude that the
trial judge erred in principle in imposing this sentence for this
very serious offence.
[3]  Looking specifically at the weapons charge of two years, we
think it was an error in principle for the trial judge to double
the minimum sentence of one year provided by the Code.  Without
the Code provisions this would be a concurrent sentence.  Given
that the attempted murder sentence was at the upper level, there
was no principled reason to double the minimum consecutive
sentence for use of a firearm.  It is not tinkering to cut a
sentence in half.
[4]  In addition, the trial judge increased the appellant's
parole ineligibility period to one-half of the global sentence as
permitted by s. 741(2) [now 743.6] of the Criminal Code.
Although we agree with the comments of the trial judge with
respect to the circumstances of the offence, no consideration
appears to have been given to the character and circumstances of
the appellant, as required by s. 741.2.
[5]  An order under s. 741.2 is to be made in exceptional
circumstances.  In light of the very significant sentence imposed
and the limited criminal background of the appellant, the order
ought not to have been made in this case.  See R. v. Osborne
(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 167 (Ont. C.A.).
[6]  Accordingly, the weapons charge is reduced to one year and
the order under s. 741.2 is quashed.  The appeal is in all other
respects dismissed.</pre>
