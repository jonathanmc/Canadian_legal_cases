    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of the Divisional Court dated April 29,
1998 (Cunningham J.  for the majority, Matlow J. concurring; A.G.
Campbell J. dissenting).</pre>
    <pre>ABELLA J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue in this appeal is the scope of a pension
counsellor&#146;s duty in communicating information to potential
beneficiaries of a pension plan. The pension plan advisor in this
case failed to inform a union member and his wife in express
terms that if the wife signed a spousal waiver, she would receive
no benefits when her husband died.
[2]  The question to be decided is whether or not the failure to
provide this specific information breached a duty of care owed by
the pension advisor to the wife.
[3]  The trial judge, McGarry J., found that the pension advisor
did not fully inform the union member and his wife of the
implications of signing the waiver and, accordingly, found that
the wife&#146;s waiver was null and void.  (Deraps v. Labourer&#146;s
Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada (1997), 146 D.L.R.
(4th) 321.)  On appeal to the Divisional Court, this finding was
overturned (Cunningham J. for the majority,  A.G. Campbell J.
dissenting:  Deraps v. Labourer&#146;s Pension Fund of Central and
Eastern Canada (1998), 18 C.C.P.B. 293.
[4]  The respondents acknowledged at the outset of the appeal
that the pension advisor was the agent of both the union and the
pension fund.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND:</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Gabriel Deraps was a member of the Labourers&#146; International
Union of North America since September 1965.  In early February
1990, he learned that he had lung cancer.  On February 20, 1990,
his left lung was removed, leaving him weak, experiencing
shortness of breath, and suffering pain.
[6]  Gloria Da Silva Hickey had been hired by the union in 1989
to assist union members in their applications for pension and
other benefits.  The letter advising union members of her role
was sent to them on February 1, 1989, and stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Recently we hired Gloria Da Silva as a social services
          counselor to assist our members in the following areas.  She can
          be reached in our office ...
          </pre>
    <pre>               Welfare - Assist in completing
          applications and forms.
               </pre>

    <pre>[7]  Because he was too young to apply for early retirement,  Mr.
Deraps arranged to meet with Ms. Hickey to discuss what
disability benefits he was entitled to.
[8]  Ms. Hickey&#146;s evidence was that Mr. Deraps and his wife
Monique came to her office on April 5, 1990 to complete
applications for Canada Pension Plan disability payments.  At
that time, Ms. Hickey undertook to get more information from the
Labourers&#146; Pension Fund about what was available to Mr. Deraps
from the union pension plan.
[9]  Later in April, Ms. Hickey received further information with
respect to the disability pension, and showed Mr. Deraps some
calculations she had prepared indicating what his disability
benefits would be.  According to her information, there were two
options available to him:  the first was to receive a lower
monthly disability pension, with his wife receiving 60% of his
benefits when he died;  the second was that if his wife signed a
spousal waiver, Mr. Deraps would receive a higher monthly amount
for disability benefits while he was alive.
[10] Mr. Deraps was informed by Ms. Hickey that if his wife did
not sign the waiver, his monthly disability payment would be
$321.00 and his wife&#146;s survivor&#146;s benefit would be $193.00.  If,
on the other hand, Mrs. Deraps signed the waiver, her husband&#146;s
monthly benefit would increase to $425.00.  Mr. Deraps had
initially been told, incorrectly, that the amount was $375.00,
not $425.00.
[11] The page containing the calculations prepared by Ms. Hickey
showing the difference between what Mr. Deraps would receive if
his wife signed a spousal waiver and if she did not, was
introduced at trial.  Nowhere do these calculations show that the
result of Monique Deraps signing a spousal waiver would be that
she would receive &#147;zero&#148; when her husband died.
[12] Notwithstanding Monique Deraps&#146; evidence that she had not
met with Ms. Hickey to sign the waiver, the trial judge accepted
the evidence of Ms. Hickey that both Monique and Gabriel Deraps
attended at her office on August 23, 1990 to fill out the forms
to receive the disability pension available under the union
pension plan.
[13] The pension form outlined the following two options for
union members who have a spouse:
          </pre>
    <pre>               VII. NORMAL FORM OF BENEFIT PAYMENT:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Please check the appropriate box below.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Normal Form for employees who have
          a Spouse.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i.) __   I wish to receive my pension
          benefits in the form of a 60% Joint and
          Survivor annuity.  I understand that I will
          receive a monthly pension for my lifetime and
          in the event of my death my spouse will
          receive 60% of my monthly pension for life.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii.)     _x_  My Spouse and I wish to
          waive the 60% Joint and Survivor (Please
          complete the attached Spousal Waiver form)
          and elect an Optional form of Payment.  I
          understand that if an Optional form is not
          elected, that I will automatically receive my
          pension benefits for my lifetime with a
          guarantee of 60 monthly pension payments.  If
          I die, the balance of my 60 payments will
          continue to my designated beneficiary or
          beneficiaries or my estate.  I understand
          that if the 60% Joint and Survivor annuity is
          waived and I am eligible for a Disability
          Pension, the Normal form is a level monthly
          amount of life annuity with no guarantee.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[14] Mr. Deraps ticked off the second box indicating that he and
his wife wished to waive the 60% joint and survivor annuity.
[15] The actual waiver, entitled &#147;Spousal Waiver of Joint and
Survivor Pension,&#148; states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I am aware that, in the absence of a waiver, a pension
          payable to a former member who has a spouse on the date that the
          payment of the first installation of the pension is due must be
          paid as a joint and survivor pension as required by Section 45 of
          the Pension Benefits Act, 1987.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I understand that I may waive any right
          to a survivor pension of at least 60% of my
          spouse&#146;s pension benefit should my spouse
          predecease me.  By waiving my right, my
          spouse will be able to elect an alternative
          form of pension which will provide me with no
          survivor pension or a pension which is less
          than the 60% minimum.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>               I hereby waive my right to a joint and
          survivor pension as required by Section 45 of
          the Act.  The signature of my spouse, below,
          serves as an acknowledgement that he or she
          agrees to such a waiver.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I understand that we may revoke this
          waiver at any time prior to the date of the
          commencement of payment of my spouse&#146;s
          pension.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Ms. Hickey&#146;s evidence was that before Mr. and Mrs. Deraps
signed the forms, she &#147;&#133; asked if they had any questions, if they
understood everything and no one asked any questions.&#148; She said
she told Mr. Deraps:  &#147;If you leave a pension for your wife, this
is how much you would get.  If you don&#146;t leave a pension for your
wife, this is how much you would get.&#148;
[17] Without any further explanation or discussion, Ms. Hickey
then left the two pages containing the spousal waiver with Mr.
and Mrs. Deraps. She remembered that Mrs. Deraps was hesitant
about signing, but no conversation took place.
[18] On cross-examination, Ms. Hickey confirmed that she took no
steps to read or explain the spousal waiver to the Deraps:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   &#133; [A] very important part of that form as far as Mrs.
          Deraps is concerned is pages nine and ten of the application,
          [the waiver form] and you have that in front of you.  And you
          don&#146;t know if Mrs. Deraps read that or not?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I do not.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And you didn&#146;t read it to her?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I did not.  It was not asked that I
          read it to her.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Well, Ms. Hickey, if you did not
          read it to her, and if you don&#146;t know if she
          read it herself, then you don&#146;t know if she
          understood the option which she was signing,
          do you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I don&#146;t know, but it was not
          questioned.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And in fact Mrs. Deraps says she
          didn&#146;t understand it, so that you don&#146;t have
          any quarrel with that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I don&#146;t know whether she understood
          or not;  nothing was asked.  I even asked if
          there was any questions;  there were none.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   But we certainly do know that you
          didn&#146;t go over those two pages and read it to
          her on the 23rd of August, or any other time
          for that matter?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I did not, no.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   In fact what you did, you put the
          paper in front of her and you made the
          assumption that she understood it without
          explaining the words to her?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   There was no indication that I
          needed to explain the words.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   I understand that, but I just want
          to be clear on what happened, not was not
          said.  What happened was that you put the
          form in front of her, you didn&#146;t read it to
          her, you didn&#146;t explain what the words meant,
          you assumed that she understood it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Because there was no questions
          asked, yes, I assumed they understood.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And on August the 23rd, 1990 that
          was the first time Mr. Deraps would have seen
          the application form?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I believe so.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Because you went and got it out of
          the drawer and essentially said &#147;Here&#146;s the
          form you have to complete,&#148; and you completed
          it?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And also on that day your evidence
          is that Mrs. Deraps seemed reluctant to sign?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You did not read the form to them,
          did you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I don&#146;t believe I did.  I placed
          the form in front of them, asked them to read
          it.  No one indicated that they couldn&#146;t read
          or didn&#146;t understand the form.</pre>
    <pre>[19] It is clear from this evidence that Ms. Hickey was of the
view that in the absence of any questions, she was neither
required to provide any explanation about the waiver to Mr. and
Mrs. Deraps, nor under any obligation to be satisfied that they
understood it.
[20] David D&#146;Agostini, on the other hand, the senior
administrator of the pension plan, gave evidence that
representatives of the pension plan who were hired by the union,
such as Ms. Hickey, were required to explain clearly that the
effect of signing the form was a loss of future benefits, as the
following extract from his testimony demonstrates:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   &#133; [D]oes the pension fund maintain any policy as to any
          advice or information that&#146;s to be provided to members in regards
          to the waiver?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   We ask that no influence with
          regard to the selection is given except a
          clear explanation of the form and its
          implications.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:   Q. So the person who is
          doing the work in the field for you is not to
          influence either of the parties, right?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Correct.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And is required to provide &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   A clear understanding of the
          implications of the form.
          </pre>
    <pre>               BY [COUNSEL]:  Q.  Now by clear
          implications, do you mean that they are to in
          any way advise the member as to whether or
          not to complete the form?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   They should advise the members that
          there is a forfeiture of one&#146;s portion of the
          pension should they decide to sign it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:   Q.  &#133;[W]here you have
          somebody in place, your instructions to that
          person is that they are to provide a clear
          understanding of the implications of the
          form?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   That&#146;s right.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And does that imply &#150; I imply from
          that, that that relates to an understanding
          that the union member would have and the
          spouse would have as a result of signing the
          document?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Now apart from the numbers
          involved, your instruction would also &#150; to
          the union local &#150; be to the effect that there
          should be a clear understanding upon the part
          of both the member and the member&#146;s spouse as
          to the implications of signing a spousal
          waiver form?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Correct.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21] Mr. Deraps was the  only source of income Mrs. Deraps had,
and Mrs. Deraps thought he had less than a year to live.
[22] Gabriel Deraps died on April 22, 1991, 8 months after the
August 23, 1990 meeting with Ms. Hickey.  A week before he died,
he called Ms. Hickey to ask her what benefits his wife would
receive upon his death.  She told him that his wife would not
receive any benefits.
[23] Monique Deraps did not learn that by signing the waiver she
had lost her benefits until around the time of her husband&#146;s
death, as the following exchanges at trial show:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Now since August of 1990 when that form was signed, has
          your knowledge or understanding about what that form was all
          about changed?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And what do you now know that form
          to mean?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   That by signing I waiver all my
          rights, and I wouldn&#146;t receive any pension.
          That I didn&#146;t know before.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And when did you find that out?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   When I ask Gloria to send me all
          the &#150; like the booklet, the 1988 booklet and
          all the forms for me to look at, to know, to
          find out about the pension that I didn&#146;t know
          nothing on.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And this was after your husband&#146;s
          death, is that correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   In August of 1990, had you known
          that the signing of that form would have
          meant that you got nothing after your
          husband&#146;s death, would you have signed it?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I would have not signed.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   So you didn&#146;t understand what would
          happen&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   &#133;if you didn&#146;t sign it?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No, I didn&#146;t really understand, you
          know, what was happening.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Well, you knew something was going
          to happen, didn&#146;t you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes, that he would get a bigger
          pension and I would get a smaller pension.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   So that if you didn&#146;t sign it, he
          would get a smaller pension but you didn&#146;t
          know what would happen to you, is that fair
          to say?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yeah.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You didn&#146;t understand how much
          bigger &#150; no, I think it&#146;s correct &#150; how much
          bigger his pension would be if you signed, as
          opposed to if you didn&#146;t sign?  &#133;You didn&#146;t
          know what the difference was?
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And I take it from that, you didn&#146;t
          know how much smaller your pension would be
          if you did sign it?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I didn&#146;t know either.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge made a number of relevant findings.  He
found that Monique Deraps thought that she would be entitled to a
reduced pension on the death of her husband if she signed the
waiver.  He further found that she did not understand the
document she was signing, a document shown for the first time to
the Deraps on August 23, 1990, both because the information was
not provided by Ms. Hickey and because the waiver form itself was
confusing.
[25] He also found that Ms. Hickey was counting on Mr. Deraps to
relay information to his wife, and that she did not tell Monique
Deraps what the implications of the waiver were.  He found that
Ms. Hickey&#146;s calculations did not show that the surviving spouse
would get &#147;zero&#148;, and that Mrs. Deraps&#146; understanding was that
signing the waiver meant a higher pension for Mr. Deraps and a
reduced one for her.
[26] The central finding made by the trial judge was that Ms.
Hickey &#147;did not establish the onus placed upon her to the effect
that the surviving spouse must be aware of the implications of
signing a waiver.&#148;
[27] Relying on Fletcher v. Manitoba Public Insurance Co., [1990]
3  S.C.R. 191, the trial judge identified the issues as being
whether there was a duty to provide information, whether there
was reliance on that information, and whether the reliance was
reasonable in the circumstances.  The trial judge then proceeded
to analyze the scope of the duty in accordance with the following
passage from Fletcher:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Members of the public need to have all relevant information
          available to them in an explicit and readily comprehensible
          manner if they are to make intelligent decisions about how much
          risk they are prepared to bear. (at p. 218)</pre>
    <pre>[28] Based on this entitlement, the trial judge concluded that
Ms. Hickey was required to &#147;go further than she did in the
circumstances&#148;.  Having found that Monique Deraps &#147;did not
understand the nature of the document which she was signing nor
was it fully explained to her,&#148; he declared the Spousal Waiver of
Joint and Survivor pension signed by Monique Deraps to have been
insufficiently explained to her and therefore null and void and
unenforceable.
[29] The majority in the Divisional Court reversed the trial
judge&#146;s findings and conclusion.  A.G. Campbell J. dissented,
concluding that the evidence supported the trial judge&#146;s
findings.
[30] Both the trial judge and the majority in the Divisional
Court dealt with the issues of fiduciary duty, non est factum,
and mistake of fact.  However, I agree with the dissenting
reasons of Campbell J. in the Divisional Court that none of these
issues is relevant in this case.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>a)   Standard of Review</pre>
    <pre>[31] The trial judge&#146;s key finding was that Monique Deraps did
not understand what she was signing and that this was a
consequence of Ms. Hickey&#146;s failure to explain the waiver to her.
In his words:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [T]he information provided to [the appellant] by the
          defendant Hickey through the application for pension benefit and
          waiver form was sufficiently confusing and that [the respondent]
          did not understand the document she was executing.  (at p. 326)
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] In the Divisional Court, Cunningham J. erred in his
perception of the above finding when he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Moreover, the trial judge accepted Hickey&#146;s evidence that
          the respondent appeared to understand what she was signing and
          that the respondent did not, at any time during the August 23rd
          meeting, ask for further information, clarification or give any
          indication that she did not understand what she was signing.
          Furthermore, the respondent testified she did not read the
          spousal waiver before she signed it although she had ample
          opportunity to do so.  (at p. 297)  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[33] The Divisional Court not only appeared to reverse the trial
judge's conclusion, it was of the view that no conclusion other
than that Monique Deraps understood what she was signing, was
reasonable. According to the majority, the trial judge, having
rejected Monique Deraps&#146; evidence as to where the documents were
signed on August 23, 1990, was not then entitled to accept her
evidence about her level of comprehension of the waiver.
[34] The Divisional Court concluded that Ms. Hickey was obliged
to do no more than provide information, not to give advice.  In
addition, the words on the spousal waiver form stating that &#147;each
party should consider obtaining independent legal advice
concerning their individual rights and the effect of this
waiver,&#148; rendered unreasonable Ms. Deraps&#146; claim that she had
received no relevant information from Ms. Hickey.  The Divisional
Court  also held that because the trial judge was satisfied that
Monique Deraps understood English sufficiently, no explanation of
the document was required from Ms. Hickey.  However, it also
found that Ms. Hickey had an obligation &#147;to explain what the
option meant as fully as possible.&#148;
[35] Nowhere does the waiver form itself state that the effect of
signing the waiver is that there will be no pension;  rather, it
says that there is the possibility of a reduction and, elsewhere
in the document, the possibility of no pension.  Given these
contradictory alternatives, it was reasonable for the trial judge
to conclude that it was incumbent upon Ms. Hickey to explain the
simplest aspect of the available options, namely, that rather
than a reduced pension, there would be none at all.  It was
therefore also reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that
Ms. Hickey, based both on her assigned responsibilities and the
fact that she had already taken the trouble to go through some
calculations for Mr. Deraps, had a duty to explain clearly to Mr.
and Mrs. Deraps that the result of the waiver in this case would
be the denial of benefits to Monique Deraps when her husband
died.
[36] The extent to which Monique Deraps understood - or was made
to understand &#150; what she was signing was a central issue in this
case.  She was entirely dependent on her husband&#146;s income and did
not expect him to live long.  Based on these circumstances, along
with the highly confusing language in the waiver, it was
reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that Monique Deraps,
in the absence of any clarifying information from Ms. Hickey, did
not understand that she was signing away her entitlement to a
survivor&#146;s pension.
[37] In fact, based on the evidence before him, the trial judge&#146;s
findings generally were reasonable and entitled to deference.
Yet the Divisional Court appeared to reject them seriatim,
including the following findings made by the trial judge:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)  that there was reliance by Monique Deraps;
(b)  that Ms. Hickey&#146;s function was not merely to help fill out
union members&#146; application forms;
(c)  that Ms. Hickey was obliged to ensure that the parties
understood all of the implications of the signing of the waiver; and
(d)  that Ms. Hickey&#146;s asking the Deraps if they had any
questions was not enough to discharge her duty to them.</pre>
    <pre>[38] The majority judgment in the Divisional Court essentially
represents not a review but, inappropriately, a reassessment de
novo of the trial evidence.
[39] Lord Sumner explained in S.S. &#147;Hontestroom&#148; v. S.S.
&#147;Sagaporack&#148;, [1927] A.C. 37 (H.L.), that the rationale for
deferring to trial judges&#146; factual findings is based on the
following principle:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a
          permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge,
          and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has
          palpably misused his advantage, the higher Court ought not to
          take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at,
          merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of
          the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the
          case. &#133;  (at p. 47)
          </pre>
    <pre>          
See also Stein v. The Ship &#147;Kathy K&#148;, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802.</pre>
    <pre>[40] In Lewis v. Todd, [1980] 2 S.C.R.  694, Dickson J.
emphasized that a trial judge&#146;s findings of fact should not be
interfered with unless he or she has made a &#147;palpable and
overriding error&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    It is trite law that an appellate Court should not
          readily interfere with the findings of a trial Judge, for reasons
          so often adumbrated but resting largely upon the advantage which
          a Judge at trial enjoys over an appellate court, in having seen
          and heard the witnesses in the atmosphere of the arena. (at p.
          700)</pre>
    <pre>[41] The fact that the trial judge did not accept Monique Deraps&#146;
evidence as to where the waiver was in fact signed, did not make
the entirety of his reasons vulnerable to review.  A trial judge
is free to accept some, all, or none of a witness&#146;s evidence.
While the trial judge did not accept Mrs. Deraps&#146; evidence as to
where the document was signed, he nonetheless accepted her
evidence, as he was entitled to do, with respect to what she
understood to be the implications of her signature.  To the
extent, therefore, that the majority in the Divisional Court
purported to overturn the trial judge&#146;s findings, findings which
were reasonable in the circumstances, they erred.</pre>
    <pre>b)   Negligent Misrepresentation</pre>
    <pre>[42] The tort of negligent misrepresentation arises when there is
a duty of care based on a special relationship;  when information
has been provided which is inaccurate, or misleading, or untrue;
when the person giving the information was negligent in providing
the information;  when the recipient of the information relied on
the negligent misrepresentation;  when the reliance was
reasonable; and when the reliance resulted in damages to the
person receiving the information.    (See Hedley Byrne Ltd. v.
Heller &amp; Partners Ltd., [1963] 2 All E.R. 575 (H.L.), Fletcher,
supra, Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R.
165, and Queen v. Cognos Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87).
[43] In Cognos, Iacobucci J., discussed the standard of care to
be applied in cases involving allegations of negligent
misrepresentation:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The applicable standard of care should be the one used
          in every negligence case namely the universally accepted, albeit
          hypothetical, &#147;reasonable person&#148;.  The standard of care required
          by a person making representations is an objective one.  It is a
          duty to exercise such reasonable care as the circumstances
          require to ensure that representations made are accurate and not
          misleading:  see Hedley Byrne, supra, at p. 486, per Lord Reid;
          Hodgins v. Hydro-Electric Commission, supra, at pp. 506-9, per
          Ritchie J. for the majority of this Court;  H.B. Nickerson &amp; Sons
          v. Wooldridge, supra, at pp. 135-36;  J.G. Fleming, The Law of
          Torts (7th ed. 1987), at pp. 96-104 and 614;  Linden, supra, at
          pp. 105-19;  and Klar, supra, at pp. 159-60.  Professor Klar
          provides some useful insight on this issue (at p. 160):
               </pre>
    <pre>                       An advisor does not guarantee the
               accuracy of the statement made, but is only
               required to exercise reasonable care with
               respect to it.  As with the issue of standard
               care in negligence in general, this is a
               question of fact which must be determined
               according to the circumstances of the case.
               Taking into account the nature of the
               occasion, the purpose for which the statement
               was made, the foreseeable use of the
               statement, the probable damage which will
               result from an inaccurate statement, the
               status of the advisor and the level of
               competence generally observed by others
               similarly placed, the trier of fact will
               determine whether the advisor was negligent.
               (at pp. 121-22)</pre>
    <pre>[44] A special relationship giving rise to a duty of care was
defined in Hedley Byrne as  follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A reasonable man, knowing that he was being trusted or
          this his skill and judgment were being relied on, would, I think,
          have three courses open to him.  He could keep silent or decline
          to give the information or advice sought:  or he could give an
          answer with a clear qualification that he accepted no
          responsibility for it or that it was given without that
          reflection or inquiry which a careful answer would require: or he
          could simply answer without any such qualification. If he chooses
          to adopt the last course he must, I think, be held to have
          accepted some responsibility for his answer being given
          carefully, or to have accepted a relationship with the inquirer
          which requires him to exercise such care as the circumstances
          require.  (at p. 583)</pre>
    <pre>[45] In Fletcher this concept was adopted and amplified by Wilson
J.  She begins the relevant passage quoting Lord Morris of Borth-
y-Gest:
                </pre>
    <pre>                     &#133; if someone possessed of a special skill undertakes, quite
              irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance
              of another person who relies upon such skill, a duty of care will
              arise.  The fact that the service is to be given by means of or
              by the instrumentality of words can make no difference.
              Furthermore, if in a sphere in which a person is so placed that
              others could reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or
              upon his ability to make careful inquiry, a person takes it upon
              himself to give information or advice to, or allows his
              information or advice to be passed on to, another person who, as
              he knows or should know, will place reliance upon it, then a duty
              of care will arise.  [Emphasis in original.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                  Courts in England and
          Canada have applied the Hedley
          Byrne principle to other
          relationships of proximity where it
          was foreseeable that one party
          would reasonably rely on the
          information or advice given by the
          other:  see, for example, Haig v.
          Bamford, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 466
          (chartered accountant/investors),
          B.D.C. Ltd. v. Hofstrand Farms
          Ltd., [1986] 1 S.C.R. 228, (courier
          company/client), and Kamloops (City
          of) v. Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2,
          66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273 (municipal
          building inspectors/homeowners).
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In Mutual Life &amp; Citizens&#146;
          Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Evatt, [1971] 1 All
          E.R. 150, Lord Diplock discussed at p.154 the
          type of circumstances which give rise to a
          relationship of reliance and a concomitant
          duty to take care.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               These cases support the proposition that
          individuals or corporations whose business
          involves the provision of information or
          advice to others owe a duty of care in
          communicating that information or advice to
          those whom they know will reasonably rely on
          it.  (at pp. 209-212)</pre>
    <pre>[46] In Hercules Managements, La Forest J. said that the
plaintiff and the defendant can be said to be in a &#147;special
relationship&#148; when the following exists:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In negligent misrepresentation actions, &#133; the
          plaintiff&#146;s claim stems from his or her detrimental reliance on
          the defendant&#146;s (negligent) statement, and it is abundantly clear
          that reliance on the statement or representation of another will
          not, in all circumstances, be reasonable.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; determining whether &#147;proximity&#148; exists
          on a given set of facts consists in an
          attempt to discern whether, as a matter of
          simple justice, the defendant may be said to
          have had an obligation to be mindful of the
          plaintiff&#146;s interests in going about his or
          her business.   (at pp. 189-90)</pre>
    <pre>[47] He summarized the reliance issue by setting out what he
considered to be the two issues implicit in this analysis:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In cases of negligent misrepresentation, the relationship
          between the plaintiff and the defendant arises through reliance
          by the plaintiff on the defendant&#146;s words.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the defendant ought reasonably to
          foresee that the plaintiff will rely on his
          or her representation;  and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  reliance by the plaintiff would, in
          the particular circumstances of the case, be
          reasonable.  (at p. 188)</pre>
    <pre>[48] Professor Bruce  Feldthusen in Economic Negligence:  The
Recovery of Pure Economic Loss, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1994)
sets out eight general indicia of reasonable reliance, which
offer useful factors to consider:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  The defendant voluntarily assumed

    <pre>CONCLUSIONS:</pre>
    <pre>[49] Based on the foregoing legal framework, several observations
arise.
[50] Gloria Hickey was the agent of the pension plan and she was
retained by the union to provide information to union members
with respect to, among other things, the terms and conditions of
the pension plan.</pre>
    <pre>[51] Section 23(2) of the Pension Act states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The administrator of a pension plan shall use in the
          administration of the pension plan and in the administration and
          investment of the pension fund all relevant knowledge and skill
          that the administrator possess or, by reason of the
          administrator&#146;s profession, business or calling, ought to
          possess.</pre>
    <pre>[52] This duty was assigned to Ms. Hickey by virtue of s. 23(5)
of the Pension Act which states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (5)  Where it is reasonable and prudent in the circumstances
          so to do the administrator of a pension plan may employ one or
          more agents to carry out any act required to be done in the
          administration of the pension plan and in the administration and
          investment of the pension fund.</pre>
    <pre>[53] Ms. Hickey had, and was deemed to have, specialized
knowledge and skill in her position as agent of the administrator
of the pension plan.  The Deraps were entitled to rely on
information provided by Ms. Hickey, given the letter from the
union to its members, the expertise Ms. Hickey was presumed to
possess, and the dependence of Mrs. Deraps and her husband on
this information.
[54] Ms. Hickey&#146;s failure to advise Monique Deraps at all, let
alone in a clear way, that she would receive nothing when her
husband died if she signed the waiver, was misleading and a
misrepresentation.
[55] Because she had a responsibility to provide complete and
clear information, Ms. Hickey&#146;s failure to do so amounts to a
breach of her duty of care.  This duty was best characterized by
Linden J.A. in Spinks v. Canada (1996), 134 D.L.R. (4th) 223,
where he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;It seems to me that where one party is advising another,
          the failure to divulge material information may be just as
          misleading as a positive misstatement.  Missing information can
          be just as harmful as mistaken information.  Both types of advice
          are equally erroneous.  This is especially the case where, as
          here, the information in question is of a specialized nature,
          which is easily available to the advisor but not easily
          obtainable by the party being advised.  In such a context, the
          duty of an advisor is to advise competently, accurately, and
          fully.  (at p. 230).</pre>
    <pre>[56] Ms. Hickey was trained to provide pension information, was
held out by the union to have the necessary expertise and
specialized knowledge, and union members were encouraged to seek
her assistance in determining what benefits they were entitled
to.  In that capacity, Ms. Hickey should have been aware that
there were serious implications for Monique Deraps in signing the
waiver, implications which were profoundly different from what
Ms. Hickey had told Mr. Deraps at their meeting in April, and
implications she knew, or ought to have known, would be of
particular interest to Monique Deraps as the surviving spouse.
[57] In my view, the failure to provide Monique Deraps or her
husband with complete information on what the implications of
signing the waiver would be, represented a breach of a duty to
exercise reasonable care in providing information to persons who
would be expected to rely on it.  The purpose for which the
information was being sought was apparent to Ms. Hickey.  She
knew that the parties would want to know, and in fact Mr. Deraps
specifically asked, what would be the result in monthly amounts
of Monique Deraps&#146; signing the waiver.  It was reasonably
foreseeable that Monique Deraps would rely on any information Ms.
Hickey provided, and that the implication of not giving full
information could be devastating to someone in Mrs. Deraps&#146;
circumstances.
[58] The failure to obtain and disclose this material
information, as she told Mr. Deraps in early April she would do,
was a breach of Ms. Hickey&#146;s duty to him and to his spouse, and
the failure in particular to disclose to Monique Deraps that her
signature would result in no pension, is negligent
misrepresentation.
[59] It was not sufficient for Ms. Hickey to say, as she did: &#147;If
you leave a pension for your wife this is how much you will get.
If you don&#146;t leave a pension to your wife, this is how much you
will get.&#148;   The ambiguity of those statements, combined with the
complexity and contradictory nature of the statements in the
document itself, deprived Mrs. Deraps of the opportunity to make
an informed decision.
[60] It was Ms. Hickey&#146;s duty to disclose that nothing would be
forthcoming to Mrs. Deraps in a clear and forthright way.  No
reason was given for the obliqueness of her advice, and her
absence of clarity represented conduct falling below the
requisite standard of care.
[61] Any damages caused to Monique Deraps were a direct result of
her reliance on Ms. Hickey&#146;s failure to provide relevant and
complete information which Ms. Hickey knew or ought to have known
would be relied on, and was in fact relied on by both Mr. and
Mrs. Deraps.
[62] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with costs throughout,
set aside the order of the Divisional Court, and, in its place,
grant judgment in favour of the appellant, Monique Deraps, for
damages representing the pension earnings she would have received
had the spousal waiver form not been signed.  If the parties
cannot agree on the quantum of damages, that issue will be
referred to a judge of the Superior Court of Justice.
