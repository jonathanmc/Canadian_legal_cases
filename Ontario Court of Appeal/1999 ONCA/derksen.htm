    <pre>On appeal from the order of Stach J. dated September 8, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by a comprehensive general liability
insurer from a decision of Stach J. made September 8, 1998 on a
motion for the opinion of the court on a special case pursuant to
Rule 22.01(1).
[2]  The decision was made in four cases, all arising out of an
accident which occurred on Highway 11 near Fort Frances, Ontario
on December 5, 1994.
[3]  Putting it in very general terms, a heavy metal plate came
through the windshield of a school bus killing one student
instantly and causing serious head injuries to three others.  The
metal plate was the bottom of a road sign used by Roy&#146;s Electric
in the course of work for Bell Canada along the side of Highway
11 near Fort Frances.  Instead of being loaded into Roy&#146;s truck,
or fixed to the compressor unit being towed by the truck, it was
simply placed by Roy&#146;s employee on, or in, a cross member of the
two-wheeled compressor unit.  The road was rough and as the
compressor was towed along the highway the base plate was bounced
from its position on the compressor into the air and through the
front window of the oncoming bus.
[4]  The questions raised in this special case all concern
insurance coverage.  Roy&#146;s Electric had three policies:
          </pre>
    <pre>  1. An owned automobile policy (Wawanesa, $1 million)
          </pre>
    <pre>  2. A comprehensive general liability policy (General Accident, $1 million)
          </pre>
    <pre>  3. An umbrella liability policy (General Accident, $4 million)


[5]  The first issue has to do with the extent of the
&#147;protection&#148; afforded by the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8
s.267.1, although it is conceded by all concerned that all the
claims meet and exceed the severity threshold imposed by s.267.1
of the Act, which section came into force on December 31, 1993.
[6]  The so-called &#147;protection&#148; from liability for pecuniary loss
is provided to &#147;the owner and occupants of an automobile and any
person present at the incident&#148;.  As owner, Roy&#146;s Electric would
qualify.  But, it is argued, the language does not protect Roy&#146;s
Electric as contractor for vicarious responsibility in negligence
arising out of its quite distinct legal capacity as an employer
and flowing from the negligent clean-up by its crew at the
original work site.
[7]  Stach J. reviewed the law going back to Harrison v. Toronto
Motor Car Ltd. [1945], 1 D.L.R. 286 (Ont. C.A.) and concluded
that s.267.1 protected Roy&#146;s Electric qua owner but not qua
employer.
[8]  Stach J. referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Co-operators Insurance Association v. Kearney (1964),
48 D.L.R. (2d) 1, but did not analyze it in his extensive and
persuasive reasons.  In that case, in dissent, Cartwright and
Ritchie JJ. were of the view that Harrison was wrongly decided.
Spence J. for the majority, accepted it as the law upon the basis
that its consequences were well known and the Ontario Legislature
had not seen fit in the intervening 19 years to change the law.
An additional 35 years has since passed; accordingly, Harrison
must be accepted and we agree that the conclusion of Stach J.
follows from it.
[9]  Stach J. also concluded that the General Accident CGL policy
provided coverage for the loss notwithstanding the presence in
that policy of exclusions:
          </pre>
    <pre>      (a) with respect to &#147;bodily injury&#133;arising out of the&#133;use
          or operation by or on behalf of any insured of&#133;any automobile;&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          and
          </pre>
    <pre>      (b) &#147;bodily injury&#133;with respect to which any motor vehicle
          liability policy is in effect&#133;&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[10] This conclusion was reached upon the basis that the loss had
two causes operating concurrently, one related to the operation
of the motor vehicle and the second related to the contractor&#146;s
liability for negligence in cleaning up at the work site.
[11] Reliance was placed on the decision in Canadian Indemnity v.
Security National (1994) 26 C.C.L.I. (2nd) 295 (Sask. Q.B.), the
&#147;sailboat&#148; case.
[12] Cases in which there are two or more concurrent causes of a
plaintiff&#146;s damages are more easily decided when multiple
causation is brought about by several parties.  If  Roy&#146;s
Electric had put the plate on the compressor frame and another
entity had transported it, there would be much less room for
arguing that the loss was not brought about by two separate
causes,  the first work-site related and the second automobile-
use related.  The fact that one person was both loader and driver
in the instant cases, should not alter the coverage consequences.
[13] Stach J. also concluded, as in State Farm v. Partridge 10
Cal. 3d 94 (Cal. S.C. 1973), that there was nothing in the CGL
policy to indicate that coverage for a covered risk would be
rendered inoperative in the event an expressly excluded risk
constituted an additional cause of the injury.
[14] The court below stated that counsel were agreed that there
were no exclusions of coverage in the General Accident umbrella
policy that bore on this case.  No argument was addressed to this
court in that regard.  Nor was any objection made to the manner
in which Stach J. dealt with the questions of priority of
coverage and the determination of pecuniary and non-pecuniary
damages.
[15] Subject to some very minor corrections to the reasons to
Stach J., we are not persuaded that he erred in disposing of the
questions raised and the appeal is accordingly dismissed with
costs.
[16] The minor corrections are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  In paragraph 36 the reference to s.276.1(2) should be
          to s.267.1(2).
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   The  last  three  lines  of  that
          paragraph may be misleading.  They  would  be
          less  so  if  they read as &#147;&#133; the  effect  of
          s.267.1(7)  of  the  Act  is  to  limit   the
          contractor&#146;s liability for pecuniary loss  as
          an  unprotected defendant to the extent  that
          the contractor or its employee is at fault or
          negligent&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (c)    In   paragraph  70,   line   5,
          &#147;protected&#148; should be &#147;unprotected&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                (d)   In  paragraph 71,  the  reference
          should be to s.267.1 rather than 271.1.
