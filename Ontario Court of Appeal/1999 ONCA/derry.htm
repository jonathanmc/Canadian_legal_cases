    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant Derry &amp; Tomken Business Centre Inc. (ADerry@)</pre>
    <pre>appeals from the summary dismissal of its action against the</pre>
    <pre>respondent Kingslea Development Limited (AKingslea@). In its</pre>
    <pre>action against Kingslea, Derry seeks an order of specific</pre>
    <pre>performance requiring Kingslea to convey certain lands to it. In</pre>
    <pre>the same action, the appellant seeks damages against the Canadian</pre>
    <pre>Imperial Bank of Commerce (ACIBC@).  Kingslea moved for summary</pre>
    <pre>judgment dismissing the action and obtained judgment accordingly.</pre>
    <pre>Although the CIBC appeared on the motion and on this appeal as an</pre>
    <pre>interested party, the summary judgment under appeal applies to</pre>
    <pre>Kingslea only.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This action concerns certain conditions registered on title</pre>
    <pre>by Derry in 1986 with respect to property it owned at the time,</pre>
    <pre>including the land in question in this action. These conditions</pre>
    <pre>purported to be a building scheme and included Derry=s right of</pre>
    <pre>first refusal to purchase the land in the event of certain</pre>
    <pre>happenings. In December 1993, Derry transferred the land (and</pre>
    <pre>other property) to CIBC pursuant to a settlement agreement</pre>
    <pre>between Derry, CIBC and other persons related to Derry. The</pre>
    <pre>transfer to CIBC, duly registered, did not state that it was</pre>
    <pre>subject to the conditions registered in 1986.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  By subsequent transfer dated July 14, 1997, CIBC transferred</pre>
    <pre>the land to Kingslea without notice to Derry. Kingslea, although</pre>
    <pre>aware of the conditions on title as registered in 1986, did not</pre>
    <pre>inquire from Derry but, rather, obtained on closing a statutory</pre>
    <pre>declaration from CIBC indicating that all conditions had been</pre>
    <pre>complied with to date.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The motions judge granted summary judgment dismissing the</pre>
    <pre>action against Kingslea on three bases. He held that:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  the land is not so unique as to entitle Derry to a</pre>
    <pre>          remedy of specific performance;</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  Derry effectively released its claims on the land by</pre>
    <pre>          the transfer to CIBC as provided in s. 5(1)1.v. of the</pre>
    <pre>          Land Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990,  c. L.4 ;</pre>
    <pre>          and</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  the conditions registered by Derry did not effectively</pre>
    <pre>          bind the land and ought not to have been registered</pre>
    <pre>          under the Land Titles Act.</pre>
    <pre>On this appeal, Derry disputes all three findings.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In our view, the motions judge was correct in finding that</pre>
    <pre>the transfer to CIBC effectively released all claims on the land,</pre>
    <pre>including any right of first refusal. Section 5(1) of the Land</pre>
    <pre>Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4, provides as</pre>
    <pre>follows:

</pre>
    <pre>          5.(1) A transfer in the prescribed form shall
          be deemed to include the following covenants
          and release by the transferor, for the
          transferor and the transferor=s successors,
          to and with the transferee and persons
          deriving title under the transferee:
</pre>
    <pre>          1.   In a transfer of freehold or leasehold
               land by the beneficial owner for
               valuable consideration, unless the
               transfer is expressed to be a quitclaim:
</pre>
    <pre>               v.   That the transferor releases to the
                    transferee all the transferor=s
                    existing claims on the land, except
                    as the transfer provides and the
                    records of the land registry office
                    disclose.[Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>The transfer from Derry to CIBC provides for no exception. Hence,</pre>
    <pre>pursuant to s. 5(1)1.v., it is deemed to include a release by</pre>
    <pre>Derry to the CIBC of all of Derry=s Aexisting claims on the</pre>
    <pre>land@.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Derry takes the position that its right of first refusal is</pre>
    <pre>not a Aclaim on land@ within the meaning of s. 5(1)1.v. and</pre>
    <pre>relies on Canadian Long Island Petroleum Ltd v. Irving</pre>
    <pre>Industries, [1974] 6 W.W.R. 385 (S.C.C.) in support of its</pre>
    <pre>contention. In our view, the latter case does not assist the</pre>
    <pre>appellant. While the Supreme Court in Canadian Long Island held</pre>
    <pre>that a right of first refusal does not constitute an Ainterest@</pre>
    <pre>in land, the words Aexisting claims on the land@ in s. 5(1)1.v.</pre>
    <pre>have a wider meaning and, in our view, do include a right of</pre>
    <pre>first refusal. Reference need only be made to the following</pre>
    <pre>definitions in The Dicitionary of Canadian Law (Carswell:</pre>
    <pre>Toronto, 1991:</pre>
    <pre>     Claim:      A right, title, interest, encumbrance or</pre>
    <pre>                 demand of any kind affecting land.

</pre>
    <pre>     Interest in land:(i) An estate in land less than an</pre>
    <pre>                 estate in fee simple; and (ii) any</pre>
    <pre>                 interest, right, easement, or right-of-</pre>
    <pre>                 way, in, to, or over, land other than the</pre>
    <pre>                 interest of the owner of an estate in fee</pre>
    <pre>                 simple.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It is common ground between the parties that, whatever</pre>
    <pre>equities may exist between Derry and the CIBC, Kingslea can only</pre>
    <pre>be bound by what is on title. Since the transfer from Derry to</pre>
    <pre>the CIBC did not expressly reserve any right arising from the</pre>
    <pre>1986 conditions registered on title, Kinglea was entitled to rely</pre>
    <pre>on it as a release of all existing claims by Derry.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In light of our conclusion on this issue, we do not find it</pre>
    <pre>necessary to deal with the other findings made by the motions</pre>
    <pre>judge. In particular, we express no opinion on any matter</pre>
    <pre>concerning Derry=s claim against the CIBC.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
