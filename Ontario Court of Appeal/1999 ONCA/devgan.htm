    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by German J. on May 17, 1996
following a conviction by German J. on January 26, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellant was convicted by German J. on January 26,
1996 of one count of fraud (&#147;count 1&#148;) and one count of making a
false statement (&#147;count 2&#148;), contrary to sections 380(1)(a) and
362(1)(c) of the Criminal Code.  The two counts involved
different complainants.  On May 17, 1996, the trial judge
sentenced the appellant to ninety days in jail to be served
intermittently.   On application by the Crown, the trial judge
made two compensation orders under s. 725(1) of the Criminal
Code, one in favour of each complainant.  This appeal is only
concerned with the validity of the compensation orders.
[2]       Sections 725(1) and (2) read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (1) A court that convicts or discharges under
          section 736 an accused of an offence may, on
          the application of a person aggrieved, at the
          time sentence is imposed, order the accused
          to pay to that person an amount by way of
          satisfaction or compensation for loss of or
          damage to property suffered by that person as
          a result of the commission of the offence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Where an amount that is ordered to
          be paid under subsection (1) is not paid
          forthwith, the applicant may, by filing the
          order, enter as a judgment, in the superior
          court of the province in which the trial was
          held, the amount ordered to be paid, and that
          judgment is enforceable against the accused
          in the same manner as if it were a judgment
          rendered against the accused in that court in
          civil proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[3]       Section 725 [now 738] was amended on September 3, 1996.
The parties agreed that the amendments are of no consequence for
the purpose of this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Count 1</pre>
    <pre>[4]       Count 1 related to the appellant fraudulently placing a
mortgage on the complainant&#146;s business property in the amount of
$425,000.  The appellant misled the complainant as to the true
value of the mortgage.  She believed that she was renewing a
mortgage for $83,000.
[5]       The complainant commenced a civil action against the
appellant and others on September 26, 1988.  The action was
settled on March 11, 1993.  The appellant consented to judgment
for $110,000 with interest thereon, to be paid to the complainant
on specific terms.  Prior to March 11, 1993, the appellant made
an assignment in bankruptcy.  The minutes of settlement provided
that the judgment survived the bankruptcy of the appellant.  At
the time of the sentencing hearing, the complainant was receiving
payments pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
[6]       In support of its application for compensation under s.
725(1) of the Criminal Code, the Crown relied on a letter from
the former solicitor for the complainant in respect of the
mortgage transaction.  The letter stated that, in addition to the
amount of the settlement in the civil action, the complainant had
sustained a loss of $78,534.83 for legal fees and disbursements
related to the fraudulent mortgage.  The letter also stated that
the solicitor estimated that no more than $5,000 of the total
fees and disbursements had been expended in the prosecution of
the civil action against the appellant which ultimately settled.
The balance of the legal fees and disbursements related to other
proceedings against the appellant and other persons.
[7]       In her reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated
that she would not make a compensation order with respect to the
judgment &#147;because it would just duplicate what she [the
complainant] already has.  She has a judgment for the amount that
is outstanding.&#148;  However, when advised that costs were never
awarded to the complainant as part of the minutes of settlement,
the trial judge made a compensation order for $73,534.83.  This
figure represented the total for legal fees and disbursements
incurred by the complainant less the estimated $5,000 in costs
related to the settled civil claim. Presumably, this amount was
deducted because these costs could have been part of the
settlement.</pre>
    <pre>Count 2</pre>
    <pre>[8]       Count 2 related to a loan made by the second
complainant to the appellant by way of a promissory note in the
amount of $100,000.  The promissory note falsely indicated that
the appellant had an interest in the property subject to the
mortgage in count 1.
[9]       The complainant instituted a civil action against the
appellant for fraud.  On December 6, 1989, she recovered by way
of summary judgment the principal amount of $100,000 and pre-
judgment interest of $28,900.
[10] The trial judge made a compensation order in favour of the
complainant in the amount of $128,900 which amount included both
the principal and pre-judgment interest.  She saw no difficulty
in awarding interest as part of the compensation order, although
concerns were raised during submissions as to the propriety of
including interest in a compensation order.  Moreover, unlike
count 1, she was not concerned with any issue of duplication in
granting the second compensation order despite the existing civil
judgment.
[11] The appellant appeals from both compensation orders.</pre>
    <pre>     Positions of the parties</pre>
    <pre>[12] It is the position of the appellant that the trial judge
erred in issuing the compensation orders.  He argues that as both
complainants had obtained civil judgments against him prior to
the criminal proceedings, the doctrine of res judicata operated
to bar  the granting of the compensation orders under s. 725(1)
of the Criminal Code.  If this argument fails, the appellant
maintains that the granting of the compensation orders was not a
proper exercise of the discretion conferred by s. 725(1).
[13] The respondent argues that the doctrine of res judicata has
no application to this case and that the making of the
compensation orders was a proper exercise of discretion by the
trial judge in sentencing the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>Issues</pre>
    <pre>[14] The issues on this appeal are twofold.  First, whether a
civil judgment can serve as a bar to a compensation order under
s. 725(1) of the Criminal Code on the basis of res judicata.
Second, whether, in the circumstances of this case, the making of
the compensation orders by the trial judge was a proper exercise
of discretion.</pre>
    <pre>  Res judicata</pre>
    <pre>[15] In London Life Insurance Co. v. Zavitz (1992), 12 C.R. (4th)
267, the British Columbia Court of Appeal addressed the issue of
res judicata in relation to s. 725(1) of the Criminal Code.  In
that case, London Life alleged that it had been defrauded by the
defendant and brought a civil action against her for the amount
of its loss.  The defendant also pleaded guilty to a criminal
charge of fraud.  As part of her sentence, London Life was
granted a compensation order pursuant to s. 725(1).  London Life
filed its compensation order in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia and sought to proceed with its civil action against the
defendant.  A chambers judge dismissed the action, finding that
the compensation order was a complete bar on the basis of res
judicata.  In allowing an appeal from this decision, the Court of
Appeal concluded that a compensation order made under s. 725(1)
cannot operate as res judicata to bar a civil action.  At p. 270,
McEachern C.J.B.C., speaking for the court, stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>            &#133;Chief Justice Laskin [in R. v. Zelensky (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d)
          97 (S.C.C.)] concluded that Parliament has not purported to
          interfere with any right of civil recourse by reason of the
          making of a compensation order.  That and the facts: (a) that
          compensation orders are discretionary both as to whether an order
          should be made and as to amount (which might be less than the
          amount owed); (b) they carry no interest; (c) they are doubtfully
          assignable; (d) they are not subject to appeal except by the
          accused; and (e) they are intended for an entirely different
          purpose, that is, as part of the sentencing process, persuade me
          I should not give the compensation order the status of a judgment
          for the purpose of the res judicata doctrine.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               My conclusion therefore is that the
          compensation order stands outside the civil
          law system and, except as to quantum of an
          ultimate judgment, does not bar or impede the
          civil process.  I say this because a
          plaintiff must, of course, give credit for
          any amount recovered under a compensation
          order.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
See, also, Williamson v. Wyton (1984), 42 C.P.C. 20 (Ont. Prov.
Ct.); and Hurley v. Foreman (1962), 35 D.L.R. (2d) 596
(N.B.Q.B.).</pre>
    <pre>[16] Accordingly, the law is well established that a compensation
order cannot serve as a bar to a civil action on the basis of res
judicata.
[17] The appellant does not question this proposition.  However,
he maintains that in the reverse situation res judicata applies
with the result that an existing civil judgment precludes the
granting of a compensation order.
[18] In R. v. Carter (1990), 9 C.C.L.S. 69  (Ont. Gen. Div.), a
decision not referred to by the parties, Borins J. (as he then
was) considered this very issue.  In Carter, the accused was
convicted of numerous fraud-related offences.  On sentencing, the
accused, like the appellant in the instant case, opposed the
making of a compensation order under s. 725(1) because the victim
had previously obtained a civil judgment against him.  The
application for compensation was also opposed by the accused on
the ground that as an undischarged bankrupt he was unable to pay
the amount of any compensation order.
[19] Borins J. rejected both arguments.  At p. 4 of his reasons,
he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In my view, it is settled law that the
          granting of a compensation order is part of
          the sentencing process and is separate and
          distinct from the process of civil recovery,
          and that the existence of an unsatisfied
          civil judgment against an accused is simply a
          circumstance for the sentencing judge to take
          into consideration in the exercise of the
          judge&#146;s discretion in determining whether or
          not a compensation order is to be granted.
          Similarly, the fact that an accused is
          bankrupt and may not have the financial
          ability to pay a compensation order are
          circumstances for the sentencing judge to
          consider.  This conclusion is based on two
          decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, R.
          v. Zelensky; and R. v. Fitzgibbon [citations
          omitted]; and the decision of the Ontario
          Court of Appeal in R. v. Scherer (1984), 16
          C.C.C. (3d) 30.  In my opinion, this is a
          proper case in which to issue a compensation
          order. [Emphasis added.]1</pre>
    <pre>[20] The position of the appellant cannot succeed for the same
reasons referred to in Zavitz and Carter.   Just as s. 725 does
not purport to interfere with any right of civil recourse,
neither can a civil judgment purport to usurp the power given to
a sentencing judge under s. 725(1).  Compensation orders are
discretionary, both as to whether an order should be made and as
to amount.  At most, the existence of a civil judgment is but a
factor for the sentencing judge to consider in exercising this
discretion.
[21] I also note that certain essential requirements for the
application of the doctrine of res judicata are not met in this
case.  Specifically, the availability of res judicata depends on
identity of parties and of subject matter.  The compensation
orders are intended for an entirely different purpose than the
civil remedies, namely as part of the sentencing process.
Moreover, the Crown was a party to both compensation orders but
was not involved in the civil actions.  Similarly, the
complainants were both parties in the civil actions but were not
parties at the criminal proceedings.  See Maynard v. Maynard,
[1951] S.C.R. 346 at 358-59; and Spencer-Bower and Turner, The
Doctrine of Res Judicata (2nd. ed., 1969) at pp. 18-19.
[22] The argument that a civil judgment operates as a bar to a
compensation order under s. 725(1) of the Criminal Code on the
basis of res judicata therefore fails.</pre>
    <pre>     Exercise of discretion</pre>
    <pre>[23] The remaining issue is whether, in the circumstances of this
case, the making of the compensation orders involved a proper
exercise of discretion.
[24] The starting point for this analysis is the decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Zelensky, supra.  In Zelensky,
the accused pleaded guilty to theft.  In addition to a term of
imprisonment, the sentencing judge made a compensation order
pursuant to s. 653(1) [s. 725(1)] of the Criminal Code.  The
victim had also instituted a civil action against the accused
which was continuing at the time of the order.  The principal
issue was whether s. 653 was ultra vires Parliament as
legislation pertaining to property and civil rights which
properly fell within the legislative competence of the province.
Laskin C.J., speaking for the court, reviewed the historical
development of compensation orders under the Criminal Code and
determined that s. 653 was valid legislation as part of the
criminal sentencing process.
[25] More to the point with respect to the issues raised in this
appeal, Laskin C.J. held that a court&#146;s power to make a
compensation order as part of the sentencing process is
discretionary.  See, also, R. v. Fitzgibbon (1990), 55 C.C.C.
(3d) 449 at 453 (S.C.C.).
[26] In Zelensky, Laskin C.J. identified certain objectives and
factors that relate to the application of s. 725(1).  These
considerations have been expanded upon in subsequent cases.
Below, I have consolidated these objectives and factors, all of
which are relevant to the issue of what constitutes a proper
exercise of discretion for the purpose of s. 725(1).</pre>
    <pre>
     1.   An order for compensation should be made with
          restraint and caution;
          </pre>
    <pre>     2.   The concept of compensation is essential to the
          sentencing process:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (i)   it emphasizes the sanction imposed upon the
          offender;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii)  it makes the accused responsible for making restitution to
                the victim;
               </pre>
    <pre>          (iii) it prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and
               </pre>
    <pre>          (iv)  it provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of
                recovery for the victim;</pre>
    <pre>     3.   A sentencing judge should consider;
     </pre>
    <pre>          (i)  the purpose of the aggrieved person in
               invoking s. 725(1);
               </pre>
    <pre>          (ii) whether civil proceedings have been initiated and are being
               pursued; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     the means of the offender.</pre>
    <pre>     4.   A compensation order should not be used as a
          substitute for civil proceedings.  Parliament did
          not intend that compensation orders would displace
          the civil remedies necessary to ensure full
          compensation to victims.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
     5.   A compensation order is not the appropriate
          mechanism to unravel
          involved commercial transactions;
          </pre>
    <pre>     6.   A compensation order should not be granted when it
          would require the criminal court to interpret
          written documents to determine the amount of money
          sought through the order.  The loss should be
          capable of ready calculation.
          </pre>
    <pre>     7.   A compensation order should not be granted if the effect of
          provincial legislation would have to be considered in order to
          determine what order should be made;
     </pre>
    <pre>     8.   Any serious contest on legal or factual issues should signal
          a denial of recourse to an order;
     </pre>
    <pre>     9.   Double recovery can be prevented by the
          jurisdiction of the civil courts to require proper
          accounting of all sums recovered; and
          </pre>
    <pre>     10.  A compensation order may be appropriate where a
          related civil judgment has been rendered
          unenforceable as a result of bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>For a discussion of these factors, see R. v. Zelensky at 111-13;
R. v. Fitzgibbon at 454-55; London Life Insurance Co. v. Zavitz
at 270; R. v. Scherer at 37-38; R. v. Salituro (1990), 56 C.C.C.
(3d) 350 at 372-73 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Horne (1996), 34 O.R. (3d)
142 at 148-49 (Gen. Div.); and R. v. Carter at 75-76.</pre>
    <pre>[27] It is in light of these considerations that an exercise of
discretion under s. 725(1) must be assessed.  None of these
considerations by themselves are determinative of whether a
compensation order should be granted.  The weight to be given to
individual considerations will depend on the circumstances of
each case.  Nor is the preceding list intended to be exhaustive.
Indeed, other relevant considerations may arise in future cases.
[28] I appreciate that a reviewing court should not lightly
interfere with the exercise of discretion necessarily involved in
imposing a sentence.  As made clear by the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Shropshire (1996), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.),
the appropriate standard of review in this context is one of
reasonableness.  This court should therefore only interfere with
the trial judge&#146;s exercise of discretion in granting  the
compensation orders under s. 725(1) if the trial judge applied
wrong principles or if the sentence was excessive or inadequate.
See, also, R. v. M. (C.A.) (1991), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    <pre>     Count 1</pre>
    <pre>[29] With respect to count 1, the trial judge exercised her
discretion in refusing to grant a compensation order for the
amount of the civil judgment which, as she said, would only
duplicate what the complainant had already received.  There was
no question that as a debt or liability arising out of fraud, the
judgment survived the bankruptcy of the appellant under s. 178(e)
of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, S.C. 1992, c. 97.  In
addition, as already noted, the minutes of settlement expressly
provided for this outcome.
[30] It remains to be determined whether the compensation order
for legal fees and disbursements was valid.
[31] The parties have not provided any case where legal costs
were included as part of a compensation order.  Whether s. 725(1)
contemplates compensation for legal fees and disbursements
requires a close reading of that section.   For ease of
reference, s. 725(1) is reproduced.  It provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1) A court that convicts or discharges under section 736 an
          accused of an offence may, on the application of a person
          aggrieved, at the time sentence is imposed, order the accused to
          pay to that person an amount by way of satisfaction or
          compensation for loss of or damage to property suffered by that
          person as a result of the commission of the offence. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] The wording of this section is clear and unambiguous.  Under
s. 725(1), the court can order the accused to pay an amount by
way of satisfaction or compensation for loss or damage to
property as a result of the criminal offence in question.
[33] In R. v. Zelensky, Laskin C.J. commented on the scope of s.
725.  At p.103, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It appears to me that ss. 653, 654 and 655 [ss. 725, 726 and
          727], historically and currently, reflect a scheme of criminal
          law administration under which property, taken or destroyed or
          damaged in the commission of a crime, is brought into account
          following the disposition of culpability, and may be ordered by
          the criminal Court to be returned to the victimized owner if it
          is under the control of the Court and its ownership is not in
          dispute or that reparation be made by the offender, either in
          whole or in part out of money found in his possession when
          arrested if it is indisputably his and otherwise under an order
          for compensation, where the property has been destroyed or
          damaged.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[34] In R. v. Brunner, (1995) 27 Alta. L.R. (3d) 436, Conrad
J.A., speaking for the Alberta Court of Appeal, relied on this
same statement in concluding that s. 725 was never intended to
provide compensation for loss of rents or profits from loss of
property.  In reaching this conclusion, he noted that the wording
of s. 725(1) makes no reference to damages arising from loss of
use of property.
[35] Section 725(1) also makes no mention of compensation for
legal costs arising out of loss or damage to property.  This is
not a question of discretion.  The wording of the section does
not authorize the making of a compensation order for legal fees
and disbursements.
[36] The Court in R. v. Brunner found that s. 725(1) was never
intended to confer upon the criminal courts the right to award
civil loss-of-use damages to a victim.  I also read this section
as compelling the conclusion that it does not permit the making
of a compensation order for legal costs incurred to recover
property lost or damaged as a result of a criminal offence.
Parliament never intended to confer upon the criminal courts the
right to award compensation for legal fees and disbursements as
part of a compensation order.  An order under this section is
limited to an amount representing the actual loss of the
property.
[37] Extending s. 725 to include recovery for incidental damages
would cross the constitutional boundary of s. 725 and intrude
upon the jurisdiction of the civil courts.  As Laskin C.J. stated
in R. v. Zelensky at p. 111:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The constitutional basis of s. 653 must, in my opinion, be
          held in constant view by a Judge called upon to apply its terms.
          It would be wrong, therefore, to relax in any way the requirement
          that the application for compensation be directly associated with
          the sentence imposed as the public reprobation of the offence.</pre>
    <pre>[38] To paraphrase Conrad J.A. in R. v. Brunner, claims for legal
fees and disbursements, like claims for loss of use or profits,
would change the nature of the criminal inquiry, and properly
fall within the domain of the civil courts.
[39] Accordingly, in my view, a compensation order for the
complainant&#146;s legal fees and disbursements should not have been
granted.  This is not the proper subject-matter of s. 725.
[40] The compensation order in respect of count 1 is therefore
set aside.</pre>
    <pre>Count 2</pre>
    <pre>[41] Turning to count 2, the compensation order made in favour of
the complainant was for the total civil judgment which included
the loss suffered by the complainant of $100,000 together with
interest of $28,900.
[42] In R. v. Bordonaro (1983), 10 W.C.B. 352 (Ont. Co. Ct.), an
application was made for a compensation order pursuant to s.
653(1) of the Criminal Code for an amount which included a claim
for pre-judgment interest.  Cartwright Co. Ct. J.  noted that s.
653(1) permitted the making of an order &#147;by way of satisfaction
or compensation for loss of property&#148;.   On this wording, he
concluded that it was not within the competence of the court to
include pre-judgment interest as part of a compensation order.
[43] In R. v. Carter, Borins J. concluded that a compensation
order made under s. 725(1) of the Criminal Code could include
interest.  He relied on the decision of the English Court of
Appeal in R. v. Schofield, [1978] 2 All E.R. 705.  In that case,
the court was dealing with s. 35(1) of the Powers of Criminal
Courts Act, 1973.  The Act provided &#147;compensation for any
personal injury, loss or damage resulting from that offence&#148;.
The court interpreted these words as not being limited to any
particular kind of loss, provided the loss was a result of the
criminal offence.  Borins J. applied this reasoning to his
interpretation of s. 725(1) in making a compensation order that
included interest.
[44] In my view, that reasoning cannot be applied to the wording
of s. 725(1).  Unlike s. 35(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts
Act, 1973, compensation for loss under s. 725(1) of the Criminal
Code is limited to a particular kind of loss, namely loss of or
damage to property as a result of the commission of the offence.
In making an order under this section, compensation is restricted
to the loss of the property itself and does not extend to loss of
the use of the property or interest on it.  The wording of
s. 725(1) does not permit the inclusion of interest in a
compensation order made under this section.
[45] The balance of the compensation order comprised the loss of
the $100,000 loan with respect to which the complainant had
already obtained a judgment in 1989.  The trial judge did not
give reasons why she was of the view that a compensation order
should nonetheless be made for the same loss.  Presumably, the
reason the trial judge included this amount as part of the order
was to address the possibility that the complainant would not be
able to enforce her civil judgment against the appellant given
his subsequent bankruptcy in 1993.
[46] As indicated earlier, the $100,000 debt that formed the
basis of the civil judgment was also the subject-matter of the
conviction on count 2 for the offence of making a false statement
contrary to s. 362(1)(c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
Section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provides
that an order of discharge does not release a bankrupt from any
debt or liability for obtaining property by false pretenses or
fraudulent misrepresentation.  The complainant's civil judgment
against the appellant appears to come within the wording of this
section and to survive the appellant's discharge from bankruptcy.
However, it is not apparent from the record whether this outcome
was specifically addressed either in the civil proceedings or at
the bankruptcy discharge hearing.  In these circumstances, it was
entirely appropriate for the trial judge to make a compensation
order for the amount of $100,000 so as to obviate any necessity
for further civil proceedings.
[47] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.  The compensation order
for $73,534.83 is set aside and the compensation order for
$128,000 is reduced to $100,000.

_______________________________
1 This decision was varied on appeal.  By way of a brief
endorsement, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as to
conviction and allowed the sentence appeal but only to the extent
that the sentence on the second count was made concurrent rather
than consecutive to the first count: (1991), 9 C.C.L.S. 82.
Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused: (1992), 9
C.C.L.S. 82n.</pre></td>
