</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from  the order of the Honourable Mr.  Justice  Dyson</pre>
    <pre>dated February 24, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  charges  giving  rise  to  this  appeal  stem  from  a
confrontation  between  the respondent and  his  neighbour.   The
respondent was convicted of assaulting his neighbour, Mr. Puiczek
and  his  neighbour&#146;s  elderly  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith.    He
received a sentence of 30 days intermittent on each count  to  be
served  concurrently and was placed on probation for three years.
The   respondent&#146;s  convictions  were  quashed  by  the   summary
conviction  appeal court and he was acquitted  on  both  charges.
The Crown seeks leave to appeal from that order.</pre>
    <pre>The Assault on Mr. Puiczek:</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  summary conviction appeal court judge  held  that  the
trial  judge  had expressed a doubt as to the respondent&#146;s  guilt
prior  to  his  cross-examination  and  that  the  trial  judge&#146;s
subsequent conviction of the respondent indicated that the  trial
judge had been &#147;so incensed with the demeanour of the respondent&#148;
in  cross-examination that he lost sight of his  earlier  doubts.
The  summary conviction appeal court judge ruled that  the  trial
judge had failed to direct himself to &#147;his considerable doubts as
expressed aforesaid.&#148;  The court went on to quash that conviction
and enter an acquittal.
[3]  The summary conviction appeal court judge misapprehended the
thrust of the trial judge&#146;s observations prior to the cross-
examination of the respondent.  The trial judge was concerned
that neither party had called Ms. Puiczek who was present during
the altercation.  The trial judge indicated that in the light of
the three conflicting versions he had heard to that point in the
trial, he had &#147;a lot of doubt as to exactly what transpired.&#148;
[Emphasis added.]  Clearly, the trial judge was concerned that he
have all of the information available before proceeding to making
his findings of fact on which his verdicts would be based.  The
trial judge was not expressing any view as to his ultimate
verdict.  This was made clear in an exchange between counsel and
the trial judge which followed immediately after the passage
relied on in the court below:
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. RUSONIK [Counsel for the respondent]:    Just a second. Your
          Honour, your curiosity as to what actually happened is admirable,
          but what Your Honour has just expressed is that &#150; this is the
          main point, if you&#146;re left in doubt by the case the Crown is
          chosen to call&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:     I&#146;m not suggesting  I&#146;m  left
          with  any  doubt, sir.  I haven&#146;t  heard  the
          testimony yet.  How can I be in doubt,  if  I
          haven&#146;t  even  seen the cross-examination  of
          your client yet?
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. RUSONIK:   What I mean is&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT::    But I feel that this  was  an
          essential witness that was present throughout
          the  situation  and  that witness  should  be
          brought here.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[4]   After  further consideration, the trial judge  agreed  with
counsel&#146;s submission that the court should not call Ms. Puiczek.
[5]  In his reasons, the trial judge reviewed the evidence at
some length and made findings of fact.  Those reasons fully
support his verdicts and reveal no misapprehension of the
evidence.  Nor do they suggest that he decided the case entirely
on his assessment of the respondent&#146;s demeanour.  The summary
conviction appeal court judge erred in quashing the conviction
and we would set aside that order.</pre>
    <pre>The Alleged Assault on Mr. Smith:</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In quashing this conviction, the court said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          With respect to the assault of Mr. Smith  the
          evidence  clearly reveals  the  blow  by  the
          Appellant   on  Mr.  Smith  was  a  reflexive
          movement in the part of the Appellant to  Mr.
          Smith&#146;s   touching   the  Appellant&#146;s   neck.
          Accordingly,  this  blow was  accidental  and
          without any intent.  Therefore the conviction
          with  respect  to the assault charge  against
          the  Appellant with respect to Mr.  Smith  is
          also  dismissed  because  a  conviction   was
          unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   It was certainly the respondent&#146;s position that any contact
with Mr. Smith was accidental.  There was, however, evidence from
the  complainants  that  the respondent deliberately  struck  Mr.
Smith,  knocking him backward into a wall so violently  that  Mr.
Smith  hit  his  head and lost consciousness.   The  trial  judge
accepted  that  evidence and rejected the respondent&#146;s  evidence.
For reasons which are not apparent, the summary conviction appeal
court  judge  chose to believe the respondent&#146;s  version  of  the
events.   His conclusion runs directly against the trial  judge&#146;s
assessment  of the credibility of the witnesses and his  findings
of fact.
[8]  On the evidence adduced before the trial judge, it cannot
possibly be said that the trial judge&#146;s conclusions were
unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.  The finding that
the verdict was unreasonable reflects a misconception of the
limited scope of appellate review permitted under the
reasonableness standard.  The summary conviction appeal court
judge retried the case and accepted the evidence of the
respondent.  It is only on that basis that it could possibly be
said, that the evidence &#147;clearly reveals&#148; that Mr. Smith was
struck accidentally.  The summary conviction appeal court judge
was not entitled to make a de novo assessment of the case and he
erred in law in doing so:  R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122.
The order must be set aside on that count as well.
[9]  The respondent raised additional alleged errors by the trial
judge in an effort to sustain the order made below.  We see no
merit in those arguments.
[10] The respondent also appealed the sentence imposed at trial.
The summary conviction appeal court understandably did not
address the sentence appeal in the light of its determination
that the convictions should be quashed.  We are asked to consider
the fitness of the sentence imposed.
[11] In many ways it would be better for all concerned if we were
able to do so.  However, having reviewed the statute and the case
law, we are satisfied that we do not have jurisdiction to
consider in effect an appeal from the trial judge&#146;s imposition
from the sentence imposed by the trial judge:  R. v. Broda
(1984), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (Sask. C.A.).  Our jurisdiction is
directed at orders made by the summary conviction appeal court
and not orders made by the trial court.
[12] It was pointed out by counsel that this court did consider a
sentence appeal in similar circumstances in R. v. Van Santen (May
11, 1999).  It does not appear that the jurisdiction of the court
to consider the appeal was argued in Van Santen and indeed the
Crown conceded that this court should adjust the sentence.  In
our view, Van Santen cannot be relied on as authority for the
proposition of this court has jurisdiction to consider a sentence
appeal in these circumstances.  The sentence appeal must be
considered in the summary conviction appeal court.
[13]  The  order of the summary conviction appeal court judge  is
set  aside,  the  convictions  are restored  and  the  matter  is
remitted to the summary conviction appeal court for consideration
of the sentence appeal brought by the respondent.
