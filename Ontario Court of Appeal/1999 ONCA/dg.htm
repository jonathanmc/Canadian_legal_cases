    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Brownstone J. dated

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged that on or about November 8, 1997
he had a weapon in his possession for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace.  This weapon was a pool table ball in a sock.  The
same facts gave rise to a second charge of carrying a concealed
weapon.
[2]  At the time of his arrest, the appellant was found to have
had this item in his back pocket.  He explained to the police
officers that he held it for protection.
[3]  The trial judge found the appellant guilty of both offences
and imposed a disposition of probation with community service.
The appellant appeals conviction alone.
[4]  Accepting that a pool ball in a sock is capable of being a
weapon, it is apparent from the reasons of the trial judge that
he misperceived the appellant&#146;s evidence as brought out in the
statement of the police and in his testimony at trial as to his
intention for having the item in his possession.  Contrary to the
reasons of the trial judge, the appellant did not testify that he
was carrying the pool ball to intimidate nor did he state that
that he had never lost a fight.  To the contrary, the appellant
testified that he had won a particular fight with the two
specific youths and he was concerned that the two would return
for revenge, perhaps with reinforcements.  According to the
evidence then of the appellant, the pool ball was being carried
for defensive purposes.  It was intended as a deterrent against
possible reprisal, not as an offensive weapon as the trial judge
held.
[5]  In the light of this misperception of critical evidence, the
convictions cannot stand.  The appeal is allowed, the convictions
are set aside and a new trial is ordered.
