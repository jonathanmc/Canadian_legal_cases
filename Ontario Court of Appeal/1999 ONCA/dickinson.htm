    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  The appellant appeals from the decision of Festeryga J.
wherein he varied an order of the assessment officer concerning
Mr. Roach=s fees to Ms. Dickinson for services concerning her
son=s extradition proceedings. Before us, Ms. Dickinson requested
an adjournment in order to cross-examine Mr. Roach with respect
to an affidavit he filed in another proceeding. That proceeding
was a motion by Mr. Roach to remove himself from the record in a
matter where he was acting for Ms. Dickinson on a contempt
proceeding concerning Charleston Apartments. We reserved our
decision on the request for an adjournment and heard argument on
the appeal itself.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Ms. Dickinson did not seek to cross-examine Mr. Roach on his
affidavit when she appeared before the assessment officer or when
she appeared on the appeal before Festeryga J. In our opinion it
would not be proper at this stage to grant the request for an
adjournment.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  With respect to the appeal itself, we are not satisfied that
the allegations of Ms. Dickinson concerning the alteration of a
mortgage given as security for the payment of fees are well
founded. In our opinion, Festeryga J. did not err in his
conclusion as to the amount owing by Ms. Dickinson and the appeal
is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
