    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an appeal by one of the defendants in this action,
Bertram Bramwell Sharpe, from a judgment of the Honourable Judge
E. F. West, requiring the appellant to pay $55,482.40 plus costs,
for breach by the appellant of the trust provisions of the
Construction Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30 (&quot;the Act&quot;).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial proceeded on an Agreed Statement of Facts, which
is quoted below:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   Dietrich Steel Ltd. (&quot;Dietrich&quot;) is a
          reinforcing steel contractor operating in
          south-western Ontario.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   Shar-Dee Towers (1987) Ltd. (&quot;Shar-Dee
          Towers&quot;) and Shar-Dee Contracting Limited
          (&quot;Shar-Dee Contracting&quot;) are private Ontario
          corporations formerly operating as
          contractors in Ontario.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   The personal Defendants Donald Joseph
          Desrochers (&quot;Desrochers&quot;) and Bertram
          Bramwell Sharpe (&quot;Sharpe&quot;) were at all
          material times officers and directors of Shar-
          Dee Contracting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.   A.M.D. Investments Ltd. (&quot;A.M.D.&quot;) was
          the developer of a substantial condominium
          project in Windsor, Ontario, in the late
          1980's called &quot;Waterford Park&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5.   The Plaintiff obtained default judgment
          against A.M.D. and Shar-Dee Towers on June
          26, 1990, a copy of which is attached, as
          Exhibit &quot;A&quot;. The judgment is in the full
          amount of the Plaintiff's claim plus 15%
          prejudgment interest and costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          6.   Default judgment against the defendants
          Desrochers and Sharpe were set aside by
          Orders obtained by these parties.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          7.   The defendant Dianne Chesterman is no
          longer a party. This action was dismissed

          29, 1993.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.   Title in the project was held by a
          corporation incorporated for that sole
          purpose, Waterford Park Developments
          (Windsor) Inc., (&quot;Waterford Park
          Developments&quot;) who, in turn, contracted all
          development work to A.M.D. A.M.D. contracted
          the construction portion of Waterford Park to
          Shar-Dee Contracting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          9.   Shar-Dee Contracting entered into sub-
          contracts with the trades needed to build the
          project.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          10.  Shar-Dee Towers entered into a sub-
          contract with Dietrich Steel on April 18,
          1988, for the supply of all necessary labour,
          materials and equipment to satisfy all
          reinforcing steel requirements for cast in
          place concrete work on the project.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          11.  Shar-Dee Towers never carried on
          business.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          12.  Dietrich sent the first 20 of its
          invoices to &quot;Share-Dee Towers&quot;, which
          invoices were paid by Shar-Dee Contracting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          13.  Dietrich sent its last 11 invoices to
          &quot;Shar-Dee Contracting&quot; and all but the
          holdback invoice was paid by Shar-Dee
          Contracting.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          14.  Waterford Park Developments and A.M.D.
          ran into financial difficulty on the project
          in the final stages of completion and sale of
          the condominium units. Upon application, at
          the direction of the personal defendants
          Desrochers and Sharpe, in the name of the
          title holder Waterford Park Developments, an
          Order of Justice D. Doherty was made on May
          8, 1990, appointing the Windsor law firm of
          Willson, Barat, Farlam, Millson, as Trustee
          of the project under the authority of the
          Construction Lien Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          15.  The said Court appointed Trustee oversaw
          the completion of the project, sale of the
          units and distribution of all funds. His
          accounts were passed and he was discharged.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          16.  All of A.M.D.'s construction lien
          holdbacks from its general contractor, Shar-
          Dee Contracting, totalling $991,530.31, were
          distributed by Order of Master J. Quinn, at
          Windsor, to those trades of Shar-Dee
          Contracting that had registered Claims for
          Lien under the Construction Lien Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          17.  The Plaintiff did not register a Lien
          Claim under the Construction Lien Act and,
          therefore, did not participate in any Court
          ordered distribution of A.M.D.'s holdbacks.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          18.  At the time of the discharge of the
          Court appointed Trustee all project funds had
          been distributed and there was a shortfall to
          the principal secured creditor, the first
          mortgagee, Financial Trust.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Flow of Funds</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          19.  A.M.D. financed this development with a
          first mortgage from Financial Trust in the
          amount of $12,135,000.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          20.  A.M.D.'s contract with Shar-Dee
          Contracting was on a &quot;cost plus&quot; basis
          totalling approximately $8,000,000.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          21.  At the inception of the project, Shar-
          Dee Contracting opened a segregated bank
          account at the National Bank of Canada, 263
          Queen Street East, Brampton, Ontario, as
          account no. 00-091-029, for the sole purpose
          of paying construction expenses related to
          the project.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          22.  All funds received by Shar-Dee
          Contracting from A.M.D. were deposited to
          National Bank of Canada, 263 Queen Street
          East, Brampton, Ontario, account no. 00-091-
          029 and all such funds were used for direct
          construction costs, either paid to sub-trades
          such as the Plaintiff, for example, or to
          direct overhead expenses such as the cost of
          long distance telephone calls and temporary
          personnel hired to monitor and administer
          expenses exclusively for the project.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          23.  None of the money received by Shar-Dee
          Contracting from A.M.D. and deposited to
          National Bank of Canada account no. 00-091-
          029 was used to cover any internal overhead
          expense such as, for example, rent or
          mortgage payments, or for that matter to
          cover expenses of any other project or
          activity of Shar-Dee Contracting.</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge held the appellant liable as a director and
officer of the contractor, Shar-Dee Towers (1987) Ltd. (&quot;Shar-Dee
Towers&quot;), for breaches by Shar-Dee Towers of the statutory trust
provisions of s. 8 of the Construction Lien Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Before commenting on the issues raised by the appellant, I
should point out that in his reasons, West J. stated that the
sections of the Act particularly relevant to this action are ss.
8, 10, 13(1) and 14(1). I suspect that the inclusion of s.14(l)
was in error since that provision is not referred to elsewhere in
the reasons. However, I wish to make it clear that I do not view
s.14 as being of any assistance in resolving the issues in this
appeal. Section 14 deals with the creation of a lien under the
Act. In this appeal we are not dealing with liens; the respondent
failed to file a lien claim. The lien and the trust provisions of
the Act are quite distinct, and it is important not to confuse
one with the other in dealing with the interpretation of this
rather complicated Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  As noted in the agreed facts, default judgment was obtained
against the contractor, Shar-Dee Towers, so the question of
breach of the s. 8 trust by the contractor was not considered by
the court. For personal liability to be found against the
appellant, it is first necessary that there be a finding of
breach of trust against the contractor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  I should point out at this stage that the corporation
actually contracting with the owner was Shar-Dee Contracting, but
the party contracting with the respondent was Shar-Dee Towers. No
issue was raised in this action relating to those facts. Shar-Dee
Contracting in fact acted as trustee of funds owing to the
respondent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A.   Was there a breach of trust by the contractor?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Section 8 of the Act establishes the trust and the
obligations of the trustee which are involved in this appeal.
That section reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          8.(1)     All amounts,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  owing to a contractor or subcontractor,
               whether or not due or payable; or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  received by a contractor or
               subcontractor,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          on account of the contract or subcontract
          price of an improvement constitute a trust
          fund for the benefit of the subcontractors
          and other persons who have supplied services
          or materials to the improvement who are owed
          amounts by the contract or subcontractor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  The contractor or subcontractor is the
          trustee of the trust fund created by
          subsection (1) and the contractor or
          subcontractor shall not appropriate or
          convert any part of the fund to the
          contractor's or subcontractor's own use or to
          any use inconsistent with the trust until all
          subcontractors and other persons who supply
          services or materials to the improvement are
          paid all amounts related to the improvement
          owed to them by the contractor or
          subcontractor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The appellant takes the position that the contractor, Shar-
Dee Contracting was entitled to pay, out of funds received on
account of its contract with the owner, overhead costs directly
attributable to the contract involved without, as a result of
those payments, being in breach of the s. 8 trust provisions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  This question has been addressed in a number of decisions of
lower courts: see Rudco Insulation Ltd. v. Toronto Sanitary Inc.,
[1996] O.J. No. 5110, (Gen. Div.) (affirmed [1998] O.J. No. 4105
(C.A.)); Heritage Masonry Ltd. v. Building Team Ltd. (1995), 28

of those cases, BPCO Inc. v. Deelstra, held that payment of
overhead costs out of amounts received by the contractors, prior
to paying amounts owed to subcontractors, does not amount to a
breach of the statutory trust. In so finding, the trial judge
cited an annotation to the Emco Supply case which expressed the
view that disallowing such payments, which arise in the normal
course of business, was not only unreasonable, but was not within
the contemplation of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In my view, the majority of the cases express the correct
view. If there were any ambiguity in the terms of the statute,
then considerations of reasonableness, and speculation as to what
was in the contemplation of the legislators, might be
appropriate. However, the provisions of s. 8 are clear and
unambiguous. For the purposes of the facts of this case s.
8(1)(b) constitutes all amounts received by the contractor on
account of the contract price a trust fund for subcontractors
such as the respondent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant presents a number of arguments against this
literal construction of the trust provisions of s. 8. First, he
argues that if this strict interpretation is correct, then
construction lien trusts are unique in requiring the trustee to
bear the costs of administration of the trust. The fact is, that
construction lien trusts are unique. They exist by statute at
each level of the contract pyramid for the benefit of those
adding value to the land involved. The trust imposed on owner,
contractor, and subcontractors is for the benefit of all those on
the next level in the pyramid below the trustee. Each trustee
will have entered into a contract, oral or written, with the
beneficiary of the trust. The statute has super-imposed a trust
on each contract. The contractor in this case would be liable in
contract to its subcontractor for the full amount of the
contract, regardless of the amount of his own overhead costs. I
see no reason why the amount of the trust liability should be
less. To compare this very specific statutory trust with more
usual types of trusts is inappropriate, and does not assist in
understanding its unique nature.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant's second argument against strict
interpretation of s.8 is that the contractor complied with the
policy of the statute by segregating the bank account for this
particular project and should, therefore, not be found to have
breached the statutory trust provisions. The simple answer to
that position is that segregation of accounts does not
necessarily preclude a breach of trust. Segregation of accounts
is for the purpose of enabling an uncomplicated tracing of funds
from the owner to the contractor and from the contractor to its
subcontractors. The contractor, although segregating funds, can
still be in breach of its trust by applying funds improperly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Third, the appellant argues that it did none of the things
which constitute a breach of the trust pursuant to s.8(2). A
breach in this case would require appropriation or conversion of
trust funds &quot;to the contractor's ... own use or any use
inconsistent with the trust&quot;. First, the appellant states that it
is conceded by the respondent that no part of the funds were paid
to &quot;the contractor's own use&quot;, and second, he argues that
application of funds to overhead is not a &quot;use inconsistent with
the trust&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] A review of the Agreed Statement of Facts indicates that
what was conceded by the respondent was that funds received from
the owner and not paid over to subcontractors were used only to
pay overhead expenses specifically related to this project.
Whether or not such use constitutes appropriation or conversion
&quot;to the contractor's own use&quot; is a question of law, and was
certainly not conceded by the respondent. Since the contractor is
liable to pay its own overhead expenses to whomever provided the
materials or services involved, use of trust funds to satisfy
these liabilities is, in my view, appropriation of trust funds
&quot;to the contractor's own use&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Dealing with the question of whether the use made of the
trust funds was not a &quot;use inconsistent with the trust&quot;, I agree
with the appellant that those words are broader than those used
in the predecessor Act -- the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.O. 1980,
c.261. Section 3(1) of the Mechanics' Lien Act prohibited a
trustee from appropriating or converting any part of the trust
fund &quot;to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust&quot;.
There were in the former Act, and there are in the present Act,
uses of trust monies which are specifically &quot;authorized&quot;. I agree
with the appellant that those authorized uses are not what we are
dealing with here. In my view, whether a use is &quot;inconsistent&quot;
with the trust depends on the purposes of the trust as set out in
the statute. The purpose of the s. 8 trust, as applied to the
facts of this case, is to protect the claims of &quot;subcontractors
and other persons&quot; who have provided services or materials to the
improvement and who have claims against the contractor, Shar-Dee
Contracting. The respondents in this case are clearly
subcontractors who have provided services to the improvement, and
who are owed money by the contractor. The persons to whom Shar-
Dee Contracting made payments on account of its own overhead are
not sub-contractors and, therefore, not beneficiaries of the
trust in that category.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] There remains the question of whether they are &quot;other
persons&quot; within the meaning of s. 8. &quot;Other persons&quot; must also
have provided services or materials to the improvement and be
owed money by the contractor, even though they may not come
within the statutory definition of &quot;subcontractors&quot;. Persons who
provided overhead services to the contractor were not providing
services or materials to the improvement but, rather, they were
providing them to the contractor and are not, therefore,
protected by the s.8 trust provisions. Their protection comes
through the contractor, as part of its contract price with the
owner. The contractor is protected by a separate trust fund
provision in s.7 of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Thus, in my view, payment of overhead costs is payment
inconsistent with the trust, and any such payments made out of
trust funds are made in breach of trust.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The appellant's last argument on this issue is that the
overhead payments, even if inconsistent with the trust, are,
nonetheless, authorized by the Act in s.10, which reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          10.  Subject to Part IV (holdbacks), every
          payment by a trustee to a person the trustee
          is liable to pay for services or materials
          supplied to the improvement discharges the
          trust of the trustee making the payment and
          the trustee's obligations and liability as
          trustee to all beneficiaries of the trust to
          the extent of the payment made by the
          trustee.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Section 10 merely permits the trustee/contractor to
reimburse itself from trust monies for any of its own monies
which it has paid over to beneficiaries of the trust. The section
in no way creates new beneficiaries.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Thus, I consider that all of the overhead payments,
including the unexplained cheque for $20,000 from Shar-Dee
Contracting to itself, are payments made in breach of the s. 8
trust, for which the contractor is liable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">B.   If there was a breach of trust by the trustee/contractor,
     was the breach a merely technical one for which the trustee
     should be granted relief from liability?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] It is clear that there is no relief from liability provided
in the Act for trustees who have committed merely technical
breaches of trust. The appellant takes the position, however,
that s. 35 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23, should be
applied in this situation to provide relief to the trustee.
Section 35 reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          35.  If in any proceeding affecting a trustee
          or trust property it appears to the court
          that a trustee, or that any person who may be
          held to be fiduciarily responsible as a
          trustee, is or may be personally liable for
          any breach of trust whenever the transaction
          alleged or found to be a breach of trust
          occurred, but has acted honestly and
          reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused
          for the breach of trust, and for omitting to
          obtain the directions of the court in the
          matter in which the trustee committed the
          breach, the court may relieve the trustee
          either wholly or partly from personal
          liability for the same.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The respondent argues first that s.35 has no application in
this case, where a specific statutory trust has been breached
and, second, that even if s.35 applies, the behaviour of the
contractor does not fulfil the three requirements of s.35 that it
&quot;has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be
excused for the breach of trust&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] A decision of this court in the case of Guarantee Trust Co.
of Canada v. Beaumont et al., [1967] l O.R. 479, was cited by the
appellant as a case where the court considered whether it should
grant relief under s.35 in a breach of trust situation arising
under the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c.233. Actually, that
case, although it involved a construction situation, dealt with
the duties of a trustee under an assignment by the contractor to
a trustee for the benefit of the contractor's creditors. Section
35 was appropriately applied in that situation. The question of
its application to a Mechanics' Lien Act trust situation was not
relevant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In a later decision of this court - Crighton v. Roman,
[1968] 1 O.R. 769 - the court considered the application of s.35
to liability of a constructive trustee. Laskin J.A., speaking for
the court, held that the words &quot;any person who may be held to be
fiduciarily responsible as a trustee&quot; extend the protection of
the provision to constructive trustees, although relief from
liability was not given on the specific facts of that case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Assuming, without deciding the question, that s. 35 could
apply to a breach of a specific statutory trust, I have
difficulty in seeing how the provisions of s. 35 could apply to
give relief to a contractor who becomes a trustee by virtue of
the provisions of s. 8 of the Construction Lien Act. The whole
purpose of the Act is to protect persons supplying services and
materials to an &quot;improvement&quot; to real property, and s. 8(2) sets
out specific duties of a trustee. The trustee must not
appropriate funds to its own use or to a use inconsistent with
the trust until all amounts owed money by the trustee for
services or materials supplied to the improvement are paid. If we
assume that a trustee passes the test of honesty required by s.
35, I do not see how the trustee could pass the test of
reasonableness if it has acted contrary to the specific
provisions of s. 8(2). To say that the trustee's actions could be
reasonable in such a situation would be to subvert the whole
raison d'etre of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">C.   Personal liability of the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Based on my reasons to this point, I agree with West J. that
the contractor in this case was liable for a breach of the s.8
trust. However, I have some difficulty with the finding of
personal liability against the appellant. Given the breach by
Shar-Dee Contracting, the respondent takes the position that the
appellant, as a director and officer, is liable for Shar-Dee
Contracting's breach pursuant to the provisions of s. 13(1) of
the Act. Section 13(1), and s. 13(2), which is also relevant, are
reproduced below:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          13. (1) In addition to the persons who are
          otherwise liable in an action for breach of
          trust under this Part,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a)  every director or officer of a
               corporation; and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b)  any person, including an employee or
               agent of the corporation, who has
               effective control of a corporation or
               its relevant activities,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          who assents to, or acquiesces in, conduct
          that he or she knows or reasonably ought to
          know amounts to breach of trust by the
          corporation is liable for the breach of
          trust.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2)  The question of whether a person has
          effective control of a corporation or its
          relevant activities is one of fact and in
          determining this the court may disregard the
          form of any transaction and the separate
          corporate existence of any participant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The sole reason given by West J. for his finding of personal
liability was stated as follows, on p. 8 of his reasons:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The material before the Court satisfies it
          that the personal defendants were the persons
          having effective control of the corporations.
          A finding against them is therefore
          warranted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] The basic evidence before this court was the Agreed
Statement of Facts, and miscellaneous previous court orders which
are of little assistance. We were not informed of other evidence
which was before West J. From the Agreed Statement of Facts it is
not clear that the personal defendants did have &quot;effective
control of a corporation [Shar-Dee] or its relevant activities&quot;
within the meaning of s. 13(1)(b) of the Act. We do know that
both were directors and officers. However, neither being an
officer and director, nor being a person with &quot;effective control
of a corporation or its relevant activities&quot; is sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of s. 13(1). To be liable under that
provision, it is also necessary to show that the personal
defendant is one &quot;who assents to, or acquiesces in, conduct that
he or she knows or reasonably ought to know amounts to breach of
trust by the corporation&quot;. There were no such facts included in
the Agreed Statement of Facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] The respondent argues that the notice of appeal did not set
out the appellant's position that there was nothing in the Agreed
Statement of Facts which would justify liability of the personal
defendants. Given the fact that the totality of the respondent's
argument for personal liability was based on s. 13, if the notice
of appeal is inadequate in setting out the appellant's position
on that provision I would grant leave to amend the notice of
appeal as required. The respondent could not have been taken off
guard on this issue, which was the only issue remaining after a
breach of trust by the contractor was established.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">RESULT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment against the
appellant, Bertram Bramwell Sharpe, and dismiss the action
against him, and allow him his costs below and of the appeal.
