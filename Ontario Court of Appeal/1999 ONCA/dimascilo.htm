    <pre>HEARD:   April 21, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Matlow,
Ferrier, Sedgwick JJ.), dated February 24, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue on this appeal involves the interpretation of s.
270(10) of the Education Act.
[2]  The section deals with the circumstance where a teacher has
been granted a board of reference but the chair of the board has
died after the hearing and before he or she has reported to the
Minister.  The relevant portion of s. 270(10) provides that a new
board of reference may be granted where, &#147;within 90 days after
the death&#133;of the chairman&#133;the person who applied for the board of
reference requests the Minister in writing to grant another board
of reference.&#148;
[3]  The appellant submits that the Divisional Court erred in
concluding that the 90-day period in s. 270(10) is mandatory and
that there is no discretionary power available to the Minister to
relieve against the applicant&#146;s failure to comply with the
requirements.
[4]  We are of the opinion that the Divisional Court did not err.
The appellant&#146;s main submission is that the 90-day period is not
a binding limitation period or condition precedent to the
granting of a new board of reference. In support of his position
the appellant has directed our attention to ss. 270 (3) and (4).
Those subsections apply in the circumstances where the initial
decision to grant a board of reference has been made. Section
270(3) states that the notice granting the board of reference
shall require the teacher to name a representative to the board
within twelve days of receiving the notice.  Section 270(4)
states that if the applicant fails to name a representative, the
application is deemed to be abandoned.
[5]  The appellant submits that the absence of any stipulated
consequences for failure to comply with s. 270(10) is indicative
that the subsection is intended to be directory only and not
mandatory.  With respect, we do not agree.  Section 270(10) does
not oblige the applicant to do anything.  The subsection merely
provides that the applicant may request another board of
reference within 90 days.  Inasmuch as the subsection places a
discretion or power in the applicant, it is not necessary to
stipulate any consequences if no application is made.
[6]  Section 270(10) was enacted to deal with the very situation
which arose in this case. After the death of the chair on
February 26, 1996, the appellant&#146;s solicitor met with the school
board&#146;s counsel and Regional Senior Justice Carnwath on May 7,
1996.  At that meeting, the appellant&#146;s counsel indicated that
the &#147;Federation may not be prepared to fund another hearing&#148;. It
was therefore not at all clear as of that date that the appellant
wished to request a new board of reference. The appellant was in
control of the process. In fact, no such request was made until
July 31, 1996, some sixty-six days beyond the expiration of the
90-day period. In these circumstances, the Minister was correct
in taking the position that he was without jurisdiction to grant
a new board of reference in response to the belated request.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent
Minister of Education, including costs reserved to this panel,
fixed in the total sum of $2,500.
