Roberts J., sitting with a jury, and from the sentence imposed by
Roberts J., dated April 22, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was tried in Toronto before Roberts J. sitting
with a jury, on an indictment alleging that he, from August 1,
1992 to December 31, 1994, sexually assaulted the complainant
contrary to s.271 of the Criminal Code (count 1); that he, being
in a position of trust or authority towards the complainant, a
young person, for a sexual purpose invited, counselled or incited
her to touch a part of the appellant&#146;s body contrary to s.153
(count 2); and that he, on August 6, 1994, assaulted M.B.
contrary to s.266 (count 3).
[2]  The jury found the appellant guilty on all counts. The trial
judge sentenced him to six years imprisonment on the charge of
sexual assault and sixty days imprisonment, to be served
consecutively, on the charge of simple assault. The charge of
sexual exploitation was conditionally stayed.
[3]  The appellant appeals against the conviction registered
against him on the charge of sexual assault. No appeal is taken
against the conviction for simple assault. The appellant further
applies for leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals
against the sentence imposed.</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The theory of the Crown was that the complainant was
sexually assaulted and exploited by the appellant, her mother&#146;s
boyfriend, until the appellant&#146;s arrest in August 1994. While the
appellant did not testify, it was the position of the defence
that serious inconsistencies and inherent implausibilities in the
complainant&#146;s own evidence demonstrated that the sexual acts in
issue were done with the complainant&#146;s full consent (count 1),
and that the appellant was not in a position of trust or
authority towards the complainant (count 2).
[5]  A significant part of the complainant&#146;s claim was that she
not only resisted the sexual activity but, to the extent to which
she participated, did so out of fear for her own physical safety.
In support of the complainant&#146;s position, the Crown was permitted
to tender, over the objection of the defence, considerable
evidence of the appellant&#146;s alleged physical abuse (on non-sexual
occasions) not only upon the complainant, but also upon other
members of her family. Some of this alleged physical abuse upon
other family members was unwitnessed by and unknown to the
complainant.
[6]  On appeal, the appellant submitted, inter alia, that the
trial judge erred in admitting evidence of alleged physical
abuse, unwitnessed by and unknown to the complainant. He further
submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury, despite objection in this regard, as to the limited use
that could be made of the evidence of physical abuse &#150;
specifically, that the evidence of physical abuse, even if
proven, could not be used as proof that the appellant was the
kind of person likely to commit the offences charged. Counsel
submitted that other misdirections and evidentiary rulings
further contributed to an unsatisfactory verdict. In the
alternative, the appellant submitted that the sentence imposed
was harsh and excessive in the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[7]  We propose to deal first with the complaints regarding
rulings made by the trial judge in the course of the proceedings.
None of them is of any substance.  They related to interference
with cross-examination and have some technical merit but no
practical significance in the last analysis.  Trial counsel was
able to obtain the information that she considered important
although that importance was not demonstrated in this court. This
court&#146;s supervisory function should not be exercised by reviewing
the minutia of a trial where there is nothing to demonstrate that
the trial judge committed reversible error in the exercise of his
discretion.
[8]  The main argument that counsel for the appellant pressed
related to the admission of evidence of physical but non-sexual
abuse by the appellant directed to other members of the
complainant&#146;s family, some of it without the knowledge of the
complainant.  In order to understand the significance of this
evidence it is necessary to set out two sections of the Criminal
Code:
               153. (1) Every person who is in a position of trust or
          authority towards a young person or is a person with whom the
          young person is in a relationship of dependency and who
                    (a) for a sexual purpose, touches,
          directly or indirectly, with a part of the
          body or with an object, any part of the body
          of the young person, or
                    (b) for a sexual purpose, invites,
          counsels or incites a young person to touch,
          directly or indirectly, with a part of the
          body or with an object, the body of any
          person, including the body of the person who
          so invites, counsels or incites and the body
          of the young person,
               is guilty of an indictable offence  . .
          .
               (2)  In  this section, &#147;young person&#148;
          means a person fourteen years of age or more
          but under the age of  eighteen years.
               273.1. (1) Subject to subsection (2) and
          subsection 265(3), &#147;consent&#148; means, for the
          purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, the
          voluntary agreement of the complainant to
          engage in the sexual activity in question.
               (2) No consent is obtained, for the
          purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
                                  &#133;
                    (b)  the complainant is incapable
          of consenting to the activity;
                     (c) the accused induces the
          complainant to engage in the activity by
          abusing a position of trust, power or
          authority;
                                  &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[9]  It is to be noted that the allegation that the appellant was
in a position of trust or authority is an essential averment of
the charge of sexual exploitation under s.153 and is central to
the issue of consent with respect to the charge of sexual assault
under s.271 for a complainant 14 years of age or more.
Accordingly, evidence that the appellant was the de facto head of
the household and that he was not reluctant to exercise his
authority is cogent evidence that he was in a position of trust,
authority and power with respect to the entire family. Aside from
this, it is also relevant to explain the lack of timely reporting
of the abuse by the complainant.
[10] The only concern raised in this appeal relates to the
instruction to the jury of the use that it could make of this
evidence.  In this case, the trial judge did tell the jury why
the evidence of the appellant&#146;s violence towards the
complainant&#146;s family members was relevant and they were
instructed as to what use they could make of it.  Unfortunately,
he did not give a companion instruction on what use they could
not make of it, notably that they could not make use of evidence
of discreditable conduct as proof that the appellant was the sort
of person to commit the offences with which he was charged.
[11] Counsel submits that this failure to give a complete
instruction on the limited use of this evidence of violence,
combined with what the appellant perceived as a lack of balance
in describing the theory of the defence and the evidence in
support thereof, warrants a new trial.  We do not agree.
[12]  While the trial judge should have given the standard
warning as to the prohibited use of evidence of violence, we
agree with the submissions of the Crown that this and other
relatively minor complaints as to the conduct of the trial did
not amount to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
Given the concessions that the appellant did live with the
complainant&#146;s family for ten years and that he had a lengthy
sexual relationship with the complainant when she was between the
ages of 14 and 17, the only live issue before the jury was
whether the appellant was in a position of trust or authority or
power described in ss.153 and 273.1 of the Code. There is an
abundance of evidence from which the jury could conclude that the
appellant was in such a position of trust, authority or power.
The appellant&#146;s trial counsel did attempt to establish through
cross-examination that the complainant had consented to the
sexual conduct, but if the jury was satisfied that the
relationship was within the prohibited range, her consent becomes
irrelevant under the sexual assault count and is not available
under the sexual touching count. Accordingly, we would invoke the
proviso in s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code and dismiss the appeal
against conviction.</pre>
    <pre>     Sentence</pre>
    <pre>[13] This court has accepted that the range of sentencing for an
incestuous relationship between a parent and a young child
involving full acts of sexual intercourse is between three to
five years in the penitentiary (R. v. B. (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307
(C.A.)).  Specifically, the court stated at p.308:
               The length of sentence within the range of three to five
          years depends on a number of factors.  These include the age of
          the victim, the duration and frequency of the sexual assaults,
          the criminal record of the offender, the effects on the victim
          and the presence or absence of collateral violence or remorse.
                               . . . .
               This court&#146;s decision in R. v. Tomigo,
          unreported June 30, 1981, demonstrates that
          the ordinary range will be exceeded where the
          circumstances cry out for a more severe
          penalty.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge in R. v. B. imposed a term of eight years
where the accused had commenced having sexual intercourse with
his stepdaughter when she was only six years of age and this
continued on a regular basis (except when he was in prison) until
she was more than fourteen.  The accused was a violent man and a
heavy drinker with a significant criminal record including the
attempted rape of an eight-year-old friend of his stepdaughter
during a sexual assault while she was staying at his home
overnight. He had two other convictions for assault, two for
drinking and driving offences and one conviction for wilful
damage, theft and failure to comply with a probation order.  This
court did not interfere with this sentence on appeal.
[15] In the case in appeal, the trial judge imposed a sentence of
six years in the penitentiary.  While stating that &#147;the facts of
this case cry out for the protection of society&#148;, he did not
identify what factors took the case out of the ordinary range of
three to five years.  He did not seem to recognise that the
factors he referred required him to impose a sentence within the
range.  The trial judge erred in principle in this regard.
[16] In our view, while this is a serious offence, there is
nothing to take it outside of the very serious sentences that are
within the range.  The range was not suggested as a minimum.
Accordingly, in these circumstances we would reduce the sentence
to five years in the penitentiary.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[17] For the reasons given, we would dismiss the appeal against
conviction, allow leave to appeal sentence and allow the appeal
to reduce the sentence of six years to five years.  The sentence
of sixty days for assault will not be interfered with.
