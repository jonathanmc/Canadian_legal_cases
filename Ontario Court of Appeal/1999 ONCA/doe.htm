    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Roger Doe, appeals from the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Beaulieu of the Ontario Court (General
Division) dated March 10, 1999 dismissing the appellant&#146;s
application to vary an order for spousal support payable to the
respondent, Joyce Doe.  The order for spousal support was made
pursuant to a Decree Absolute dated June 16, 1981 granted by
Chartrand J. which incorporated terms of a separation agreement.
The Decree Absolute was varied on June 8, 1987 by order of Oyen
J. increasing the quantum of spousal support payable to the
respondent from $3,000.00 to $4,500.00 per month.
[2]  In dismissing the application, the motions judge concluded
that the appellant&#146;s financial circumstances following his
retirement from the practice of law did not give rise to a
material change in circumstances justifying a reduction in his
support obligations to the respondent.  For reasons which follow,
we are of the view that the motions judge erred in so concluding.
[3]  In arriving at his decision, the motions judge placed
considerable emphasis on the appellant&#146;s choice to withdraw from
the law firm partnership and take a lump sum payment and two
years&#146; salary before retiring at age 65 rather than opting for
the firm&#146;s retirement plan and receiving a substantially reduced
amount of income to age 75 and thereafter.  It is significant, in
our view, that at age 65, the appellant was no longer able to
continue employment with the firm and earn the substantial income
which he had been earning for many years.  He was required to
make a choice.  In the opinion of the motions judge, the
appellant&#146;s choice was sinister and designed to frustrate his
support obligations to the respondent.
[4]  With respect, that finding is not borne out by the evidence.
Indeed, counsel for the respondent fairly conceded, correctly in
our view, that there were economic pros and cons associated with
either option.  Rather than focusing on the retirement options
available to the appellant, the motions judge should have
concentrated on the economic implications of his retirement and
the substantial reduction in his income occasioned by it.
[5]  The motions judge also found that the appellant&#146;s motive in
transferring title in the home he owned to his second wife, some
six years before the application, was sinister and designed to
frustrate his support obligations. Again, in our view, the record
simply does not bear out that finding.
[6]  The motions judge also considered it important that in 1987,
when the respondent succeeded in having her monthly support
payments increased from $3,000.00 to $4,500.00, the appellant
recognized that he would have to provide support to the
respondent after his retirement.  In our view, to the extent that
this concession on his part was relevant, it only goes to rebut
his alternative submission that he should be relieved completely
from any further support obligations.  Manifestly, it had no
relevance to the issue of reducing his support payments if, at
the time of retirement, such a reduction was justified by his
economic circumstances.
[7]  Finally, the motions judge took issue with the appellant&#146;s
submission that the respondent had sufficient means to support
herself.  He found this argument surprising because in his view,
there was nothing in the financial material before the court
which suggested that the respondent was able to support herself
or contribute to her own support. With respect, the motions judge
misapprehended the evidence on this issue.  According to the
record, the respondent&#146;s net worth at the time of the application
was approximately $550,000.00, comprised mostly of liquid assets.
[8]  The cumulative effect of these errors leads us to conclude
that the decision of the motions judge cannot stand.  In our
view, the record supports the appellant&#146;s contention that his
retirement gave rise to a material change of circumstances
warranting a reduction in the support payments to the respondent.
In the final analysis, we believe that the support payments
should be reduced from $4,500.00 to $2,500.00 per month.
[9]  We are also of the view that in the circumstances, the
appellant should be relieved of his obligation to maintain life
insurance for the respondent.  In its place, there will be a term
that the support payments shall be a first charge on the
appellant&#146;s estate for the balance of the respondent&#146;s life.
[10] In the result, the appeal is allowed and paragraph 1 of the
order of Oyen J. dated June 8, 1987 and paragraph 7 of the order
of Chartrand J. dated June 16, 1981 shall be varied in accordance
with these reasons.
[11] The parties shall bear their own costs of the motion and the
appeal.
