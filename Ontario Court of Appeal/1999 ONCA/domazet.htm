</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Michael Domazet appeals, with leave granted by Goudge J.A.
on December 1, 1998, from the decision of Farley J. on November
20, 1998, dismissing his appeal from conviction by His Honour
Judge Khoorshed of the Ontario Court (Provincial Division) on a
charge of &#147;driving over .80&#148; contrary to s. 254(3)(b) of the
Criminal Code.
[2]  This appeal was argued together with a Crown appeal (R. v.
David Coutts, Court of Appeal File C30535) as they both raised a
question with respect to consideration by a trial judge of
evidence of the result of the A.L.E.R.T. or roadside test in
dealing with &#147;evidence to the contrary&#148; adduced pursuant to s.
258(1)(c) of the Code.
[3]  In the instant case, the appellant failed the A.L.E.R.T.
test and the breathalyzer test yielded two readings of 120 mg.
The appellant and a friend gave evidence that he had consumed
three bottles of beer in the relevant period.  The defence
adduced expert evidence to the effect that, on that basis, the
appellant&#146;s blood alcohol content should not have exceeded 18 mg.
The expert&#146;s report stated that &#147;Based on the information
provided, either the breath readings were incorrect or the
accused under-estimated the quantity of alcohol consumed&#148;.  The
Crown did not attack this report.
[4]  The trial judge rejected the evidence of the appellant&#146;s
friend on the basis that he was not always in a position to see
how much the appellant had to drink.  The trial judge disbelieved
the appellant&#146;s evidence as to the amount he had consumed and
found him guilty.
[5]  In upholding the conviction, the summary conviction judge,
Farley J., said that in dealing with the &#147;evidence to the
contrary&#148; led by the defence, the trial judge could have relied
upon the appellant&#146;s failure of the roadside test.  This position
is in issue as between the appellant and the respondent in this
case and in Coutts.
[6]  In our view, however, it is not necessary to resolve this
issue in order to deal with the instant case.  There is no
indication that the trial judge relied on the result of the
roadside test in dealing with the &#147;evidence to the contrary&#148;.
[7]  The appellant argues that if the trial judge did not rely on
the result of the roadside test, then there was no basis for the
rejection of the appellant&#146;s evidence as to consumption.  This is
so, it is argued, particularly in light of the fact that the
expert&#146;s evidence was to the effect that during a controlled test
that he had administered to the appellant, he observed that when
the blood alcohol content was between 80 and 125 mg, there was no
doubt the appellant was impaired.  The significance of this
evidence, however, is very much limited by the expert&#146;s
qualification that the appellant&#146;s &#147;physical demeanour and
general appearance did not suggest significant impairment,
however, the formal sobriety tests left no doubt&#148; of his
consumption.  Thus, the expert evidence can be reconciled with
the evidence of the police officer who testified that he observed
no signs of impairment in the appellant on the day in question.
[8]  The trial judge was therefore entitled to reach the
conclusion he did.  The appeal is therefore dismissed.
