    <pre>On Appeal from the judgment of Binks J. dated January 15, 1998,
without a jury.
</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant Duncan MacTavish appeals from the judgment  of
Binks  J.  awarding  the  respondent Domicile  Developments  Inc.
$97,975.88 for damages for breach of an agreement of purchase and
sale.  The  appeal  raises the question of the  obligation  of  a
vendor  under an agreement making time of the essence,  when  the
purchaser  is  in  default but the vendor also is  not  ready  to
complete the transaction on the closing date.

</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]   On  February  1,  1995, MacTavish and  Domicile  signed  an
agreement of purchase and sale by which MacTavish agreed to buy a
semi-detached  house  in  Ottawa to be  built  by  Domicile.  The
purchase  price was $450,000. The agreement called for  a  $5,000
deposit  on  execution  of the agreement and  a  further  $15,000
deposit  on  notice  that a building permit  had  been  obtained.
MacTavish  was  to obtain vacant possession on the closing  date,
September  15, 1995. If the house was substantially completed  on
September  15,  1995,  MacTavish  was  obliged  to  complete  the
transaction. The agreement provided that the house was deemed  to
be  substantially completed when a municipal occupancy permit was
issued.  Typically, and importantly in this case,  the  agreement
stated  that  &#147;time  shall  in all respects  be  of  the  essence
hereof&#148;.
[3]  MacTavish paid the $5,000 deposit when he signed the
agreement. However, two and one-half months later, on April 13,
1995, he repudiated the agreement. His lawyer wrote Domicile that
&#147;our client has no intention of proceeding with the purchase of
the property&#148; and asked for the return of the $5,000 deposit.
Domicile chose not to accept MacTavish's anticipatory
repudiation. Instead its lawyer wrote that the deposit would not
be returned and that &#147;Domicile remains ready, willing and able to
perform its side of the bargain.&#148;
[4]  On July 7, 1995, Domicile obtained a building permit for the
house. On July 19, 1995, Domicile&#146;s lawyer wrote MacTavish&#146;s
lawyer reiterating that Domicile did not accept MacTavish&#146;s
anticipatory repudiation of the agreement, that Domicile
considered the agreement in force and that it would &#147;pursue the
remedies available to it under these circumstances.&#148;  The letter
also notified MacTavish of the building permit and asked for the
further $15,000 deposit required by the agreement. MacTavish did
not pay this deposit.
[5]  On August 15, 1995, Domicile&#146;s lawyer wrote another letter
to MacTavish&#146;s lawyer, again saying that Domicile did not accept
the repudiation and that it considered the agreement to still be
in effect. On the same day Domicile issued a statement of claim,
seeking specific performance of the agreement or alternatively,
damages. The trial judge found that &#147;Domicile did not accept
MacTavish&#146;s repudiation, but elected to keep the contract alive
and proceed with the construction which commenced on July 15,
1995, after approvals were obtained from the city.&#148;
[6]  However, on the closing date, September 15, 1995, Domicile
had not substantially completed the house. Therefore neither
party tendered on the closing date. MacTavish did not intend to
close and Domicile had not finished the house. Indeed the house
was not substantially completed until May 1996. At no point did
Domicile give MacTavish notice of a new closing date.
[7]  Meanwhile housing prices in Ottawa declined in late 1995 and
early 1996. On February 21, 1996, Domicile agreed to sell the
house to one of its shareholders for $365,000 - $85,000  less
than the price MacTavish had agreed to pay. A municipal occupancy
permit for the house was issued in early May. Thus, as the trial
judge found:  &#147;the house was not completed and ready for
occupancy until May 3, 1996.&#148;  Domicile closed the transaction
with its shareholder that day.
[8]  At trial Domicile sought damages. The trial judge awarded
Domicile damages of $97,975.88, representing the difference in
the sale price less the $5,000 deposit ($80,000) and Domicile&#146;s
cost of carrying the house between September 15, 1995 and May 3,
1996 ($17,975.88). MacTavish appeals against the finding of
liability and raises several grounds of appeal against the award
of damages. I will deal only with liability because in my view
the trial judge erred in finding MacTavish liable.</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>[9]   In  April 1995, MacTavish stated that he did not intend  to
close  the  transaction. His conduct amounted to an  anticipatory
repudiation  of  the agreement. On being notified of  MacTavish&#146;s
anticipatory  repudiation, Domicile, the innocent  party,  had  a
choice: it could &#147;accept&#148; or reject the repudiation. Had Domicile
&#147;accepted&#148;  the  repudiation it would have been  discharged  from
closing  the  transaction and could have  sued  for  damages  for
breach of contract.1  Domicile, however, rejected the repudiation
and  therefore the agreement remained in effect. Because  of  the
view  I take of this case, I need not consider the difficult  and
important  question  whether in April 1995 Domicile  should  have
taken  reasonable steps to reduce its losses, instead of ignoring
the repudiation and waiting for the closing date.2
[10] Because Domicile&#146;s rejection of MacTavish&#146;s anticipatory
repudiation kept the agreement alive, time remained of the
essence. A time is of the essence provision means that on the
closing date an innocent party may treat the contract as ended
and sue the defaulting party for damages or it may keep the
contract alive and sue for specific performance or damages.3  In
order to take advantage of a time of the essence provision the
innocent party must itself be &#147;ready, desirous, prompt and eager&#148;
to carry out the agreement.4  Domicile could not satisfy this
requirement on the closing date. Because it had not yet
substantially completed construction of the house it could not
carry out the agreement. Equally MacTavish could not rely on the
time of the essence provision to end the agreement. A time of the
essence provision can be raised as a defence only by a party who
is ready, willing and able to close on the agreed date and
MacTavish was not ready, willing and able to close on September
15, 1995.5
[11]
Therefore, on the closing date neither Domicile nor MacTavish was
entitled to enforce or end the agreement. A similar situation
arose in King v. Urban and Country Transport Ltd. et al., a
decision of this court relied on by Binks J. In King v. Urban the
purchaser was not in a position to close on the closing date; but
the vendor was also in default and not entitled to rely on the
time of the essence provision in the contract. Arnup J.A.
resolved the stalemate by applying two propositions:6
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.        When time is of the essence and neither party is
               ready to close on the agreed date the agreement remains in
               effect.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.    Either party may reinstate time of
               the  essence by setting a new  date  for
               closing and providing reasonable  notice
               to the other party.</pre>
    <pre>[12] An important corollary of Arnup J.A.&#146;s second proposition is
that a party who is not ready to close on the agreed date and who
subsequently terminates the transaction without having set a  new
closing  date and without having reinstated time of  the  essence
will itself breach or repudiate the agreement.7
[13] The corollary applies to the facts of this case. Domicile
did not give MacTavish reasonable notice of a new closing date.
Instead it unilaterally ended the agreement by selling to a third
party and seeking damages from MacTavish. Because it did not
reinstate time of the essence by setting a new closing date,
Domicile was not entitled to end its agreement with MacTavish.
Therefore, in failing to give MacTavish an opportunity to close
the transaction after September 15, Domicile itself breached the
agreement. Because of Domicile&#146;s breach, MacTavish could no
longer be held liable. The trial judge came to the opposite
conclusion because he did not consider the effect of Domicile&#146;s
inability to close on September 15th. As a consequence, he did
not consider Domicile&#146;s obligation to set a new closing date on
reasonable notice to reinstate time of the essence.
[14] Domicile&#146;s conduct is similar to the conduct of the vendor
in Kwon v. Cooper8, another decision of this court dealing with a
real estate transaction in which time was of the essence. In Kwon
the purchaser was not ready to close on the closing date. The
vendor, in a letter delivered the day before closing, said that
he would rely on the terms of the contract requiring closing the
following day. When the agreement did not close the vendor sued
for damages. However, this court held that on the closing date,
the vendor also was not ready, willing and able to close because
he did not have a discharge of the existing first mortgage or the
guarantee required by the agreement of purchase and sale. The
vendor, therefore, could not rely on King v. Urban and his action
for damages failed.
[15]
Similarly, Domicile&#146;s action must fail. Having decided to keep
the agreement alive and then having been unable to carry out its
part of the bargain on closing, Domicile could not continue to
hold MacTavish liable without also giving MacTavish a further and
reasonable opportunity to perform.
[16] Requiring that time of the essence be reinstated by giving
notice of a new closing date is sensible and produces a just
result. This requirement also ensures that the cost of carrying
the property will be properly allocated between the vendor and
the purchaser. To be effective the new closing date must be
reasonable. And, although a provision making time of the essence
may be implied from the surrounding circumstances or from the
conduct of the parties, to avoid any dispute the notice should
state that time is of the essence for this new date.9
[17] I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of Binks
J. In its place I would issue a judgment dismissing Domicile&#146;s
action with costs and ordering it to return to MacTavish his
$5,000 deposit together with accrued interest. MacTavish is also
entitled to his costs of the appeal.</pre>
