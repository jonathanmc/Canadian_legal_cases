[1]  The Highway Traffic Act provides that before turning left, a
driver shall first see that that movement can be made in safety.
If the driver turning left moves partly into a lane where a
vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, the driver of the
latter vehicle is not relieved of the duty to avoid an accident
if he can do so reasonably.

[2]  The jury in the present case was fully instructed as to the
law and concluded that the plaintiff was 10% at fault and the
defendant 90% at fault.  The jury found that the appellant was
speeding, impaired and not in control of his vehicle.  There was
evidence to support these conclusions which we take as indicating
that, but for his speed or his impairment or his lack of control,
the defendant could and should have avoided the collision.

[3]  Accordingly, we are not in the position to vary that
division of responsibility.  The appeal is therefore dismissed
with costs.</pre></td>
