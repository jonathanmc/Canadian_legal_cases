    <pre>On appeal from sentence of R. Khawley J. dated December 8, 1998</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged with two counts of fraud over
$5,000. He pled guilty to one count of fraud over and in respect
of the second count to the lesser and included offence of fraud
under $5,000. The Crown accepted his pleas. After the facts were
read in His Honour Judge Khawley convicted the appellant of one
count of fraud over and one count of fraud under. He sentenced
the appellant to imprisonment for 20 months on his fraud over
conviction and 6 months concurrent on his fraud under conviction.
This sentence was in addition to 8 months of pre-trial custody.
The trial judge also imposed a restitution order of $94,000 in
respect of the fraud over conviction and $1,100 in respect of the
fraud under conviction.
[2]  The appellant appeals his sentence. His principal ground of
appeal is that the trial judge erred in not accepting a joint
submission made to him by Crown and defence counsel. The joint
submission was that the appellant be sentenced to imprisonment
for 7 months. The joint submission made no provision for a
restitution order.</pre>
    <pre>The circumstances of the offences and the joint submission</pre>
    <pre>[3]  With respect to count 1, in September 1997, an elderly
Saskatchewan man received a telephone call from a male person who
identified himself as Daryl Thompson. The victim was told that he
had won a prize of $947,382. Over the following months the victim
was repeatedly contacted, by collect telephone calls, about the
prize and told that in order to get his winnings he had to come
up with funds to pay taxes, shipping, insurance and exchange
rates. The telephone calls were verified by the victim&#146;s
telephone records. In the end, the victim made numerous payments,
ostensibly to cover these costs. The total loss to the victim was
about $94,000. This represented his life savings and some money
he borrowed in the hope of collecting his winnings.
[4]  The second victim was also an elderly man. He was telephoned
and told that he had won $50,000 (U.S.) in a sweepstake. To
collect his winnings he wired about $1,100 to the appellant and
his associates in Toronto. He also paid for collect calls made to
his residence.
[5]  The appellant was not the only person involved in this
fraudulent scheme. The case against the appellant was largely
circumstantial. The Crown only had direct evidence to prove that
two of the money orders were picked up by the appellant. The
Crown acknowledged that it had no evidence to establish that the
appellant was the &#147;mastermind&#148; behind the scheme. However, the
Crown also did not accept the converse proposition, that the
appellant was a &#147;minor player.&#148;  In the result, the matter
proceeded on the basis that the appellant was a middle management
player in the two frauds.
[6]  In making the joint submission that the appellant be
sentenced to imprisonment for 7 months, Crown counsel described
the fraudulent scheme as &#147;heinous.&#148;  She noted that all of the
money was gone and that there was no hope of restitution. We
assume that this latter comment was intended to explain why the
joint submission did not include a restitution order.
[7]  Upon being advised that there would be a joint submission,
and before the appellant entered his pleas, the trial judge spoke
directly to the appellant to confirm that he had been told that
there would be a joint submission and to advise the appellant
that he was not bound by it. The trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               All right. Mr. Dorsey, I just want you to be clear about
          what you are doing. You have excellent counsel, but I just want
          you to be sure you understand that both your lawyer and the Crown
          came to see me in my office, as you know, but they may &#133; from
          what I understand they may have a joint submission. Is my
          understanding correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Defence Counsel:  That&#146;s correct, Your
          Honour.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Crown Counsel:  Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The joint submission will be put to me.
          I am not bound by it. In other words, I can
          either accept it or reject it. I can go lower
          or higher or I can simply accept that. Do you
          understand that, sir?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:  Yes, sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[8]  It was at that point that the appellant was arraigned and
entered his pleas.</pre>
    <pre>The Sentencing</pre>
    <pre>[9]  After hearing counsels&#146; submissions and statements from the
victims, the trial judge adjourned the sentencing for one day so
that he could further consider the joint submission, a submission
that obviously troubled him. As the trial judge put it:
          </pre>
    <pre>               One of the reasons that I adjourned the Sentence to this
          morning was not only to research the cases on sentencing, but
          also because my initial impression was that this called for five
          years in the penitentiary. I felt it prudent, therefore, to
          adjourn the matter to give me time for reflection.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] The next day, the Crown called the two victims and counsel
made some further submissions. The trial judge then rejected the
joint submission and, as we have said, sentenced the appellant to
imprisonment for a total of 20 months. He also imposed a
restitution order totalling $95,100.
[11] It is well established that a trial judge is not bound by a
joint submission. The trial judge must, of course, give serious
consideration and respect to a joint submission. The submission
should be departed from only where the trial judge considers the
joint submission to be contrary to the public interest and a
submission which, if accepted, would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.
[12] The appellant has a significant criminal record. It includes
convictions for narcotic offences, assault, aggravated assault,
escaping lawful custody, theft, failing to comply, obstructing
police and impersonating with intent. The longest sentence served
by the appellant was a four year sentence consequent upon his
conviction for a robbery in 1989. Most significantly, in 1996,
the appellant pled guilty to a charge of fraud over $5,000 which
involved the same fraudulent scheme that was used to defraud the
two victims to whom we have referred. The appellant was sentenced
to imprisonment for 14 months. In the 1996 fraud the victim lost
$76,000.
[13] It is obvious that the trial judge gave considerable weight
to counsels&#146; joint submission. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I also appreciate that this is a joint submission and that
          the Court must accept it unless it offends the administration of
          justice. I come to the unfortunate conclusion that my position
          yesterday has not changed all that much. When all is said and
          done a five year penitentiary sentence is justifiable.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; Either way, he is facing today either
          twenty-two months or twenty-eight months.
          That is a far, far different sentence than
          the five year sentence I feel is justified,
          which subtracting one year for the guilty
          plea, would bring it to a four year sentence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; In sum, I am rejecting the joint
          submission because, in my view, based on the
          comments I have made it would bring the
          administration of justice into disrepute.
          However, I must still give it some weight
          because there is no question that at times
          the Crown arrives at a joint submission for
          reasons that I am not privy to.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; The fair and proper sentence, in my
          view, is still one of thirty-two months.
          However, mindful, as I said of the joint
          submission, the sentence will be as follows &#150;
          mindful of eight months of pre-trial custody,
          twenty months in jail. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[14] When he rejected the joint submission, the trial judge
emphasized the appellant&#146;s lengthy criminal record. He reviewed
the more than 30 convictions recorded on the appellant&#146;s record
since 1978. He was understandably troubled by the appellant&#146;s
conviction on October 30, 1996 for fraud over $5,000. That fraud,
as we have said, involved the same scheme as was brought into
play in this case. In rejecting the joint submission the trial
judge also turned his mind to the fact that the circumstantial
nature of the case may have adversely affected the likelihood of
the Crown securing a conviction. This was not, however, a case
where there was a concession by the Crown that the Crown could
not secure a conviction were the case to go to trial. Indeed,
defence counsel conceded in the course of her submissions that,
&#147;there is circumstantial evidence clearly establishing his
involvement.&#148;
[15] We are of the view that it was open to the trial judge, in
the particular circumstances, to reject the joint submission. The
trial judge advised Crown counsel, defence counsel and the
appellant of that prospect before the appellant entered his plea.
Having received the joint submission, he adjourned the sentencing
to consider the matter more thoroughly in light of his concern
about the joint submission. He rejected the joint submission, in
the final analysis, on appropriate grounds. He was entitled to
conclude that the joint submission, if accepted, would be
contrary to public interest and would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. He considered all of the applicable
aggravating and mitigating factors. The sentence imposed was
within an acceptable range and we see no basis upon which to
interfere with it.
[16] We would not interfere with the restitution order. In total,
it represented the losses of the two elderly victims of the
fraudulent activity in which the appellant played a role. The
fact that the appellant is, as matters now stand, unable to pay
the restitution order or any meaningful part of it, is not a
determinative factor.  It was open to the trial judge to impose a
restitution order, even though the joint submission did not
include such an order.
[17] For these reasons, we would grant leave to appeal but would
dismiss the appeal against sentence.
