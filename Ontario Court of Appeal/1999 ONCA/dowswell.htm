    <pre>                 IN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUTCY
                       OF ROSS E. DOWSWELL
          carrying on business as Dowswell Investments
                 of the Village of Point Edward
      in the County of Lambton, in the Province of Ontario

    <pre>                              Heard: May 26, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice J.C.
Kennedy dated December 1, 1997</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the trustee in bankruptcy of Ross E.
Dowswell (the &#147;trustee&#148;) from the decision of Kennedy J. (the
&#147;bankruptcy judge&#148;) dismissing an appeal from the decision of the
Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy Robert C. Stevens (the &#147;Deputy
Registrar&quot;).
[2]  The trustee sought a declaration that the purchase of a
property by the bankrupt, Ross E. Dowswell (&quot;Dowswell&quot;), was void
against the Trustee as a settlement under s. 91(2) of the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the &quot;Act&quot;).
The Deputy Registrar and the bankruptcy judge concluded that
despite being a settlement, the transaction was not void against
the trustee under s. 91(2) by the operation of s. 91(3)(b) of the
Act.  The trustee appeals from that decision.
[3]  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Dowswell operated Dowswell Investments, a stock and bonds
investment business.  Dowswell did not maintain a separate trust
account for his business dealings, but deposited all investors&#146;
monies in his general accounts, from which he repaid prior
investors, paid personal living expenses and business operating
expenses, and made advances or gifts to family members.
[5]  In July 1992, Barbara Dowswell asked her husband to purchase
a certain cottage for her.  Dowswell negotiated a purchase price
of $95,000 with the vendors.  He then arranged a loan of $100,000
from his friend Tony Bogart (&#147;Bogart&#148;) to cover the purchase
price, land transfer tax, lawyer&#146;s fees, and the cost of some
improvements.  The vendors&#146; solicitor prepared an agreement of
purchase and sale showing Bogart as the purchaser.  Dowswell
retained Ronald Rowcliffe as his solicitor and instructed him to
amend the offer to show the purchaser as &quot;Tony Bogart in trust&quot;.
Bogart signed the offer, which was accepted by the vendors, and
Dowswell paid the deposit of $1,000.
[6]  By way of a cheque dated July 13, 1992, Bogart loaned
$100,000 to Dowswell.  The cheque was deposited in a Dowswell
Investments account and part of the monies were spent on other
objects and co-mingled with funds from other sources.  Dowswell
paid the closing funds of $95,434.37 for the cottage purchase
from a Dowswell Investments account to Rowcliffe, and directed
him to request a deed from the vendors made out to &quot;Tony Bogart
in trust for Barbara Dowswell.&quot;
[7]  The advance of the $100,000 from Bogart to Dowswell produced
no paper trail.  There are no written terms of the trust.  Bogart
was not represented by a solicitor; he never met or dealt with
Rowcliffe; and he never discussed the matter with Barbara
Dowswell.  Nor did Barbara Dowswell have discussions with
Rowcliffe.  Dowswell orchestrated the whole transaction.  After
closing, all taxes, maintenance costs and living expenses were
paid by Dowswell.
[8]  It was common ground among Bogart, Dowswell, Barbara
Dowswell and Rowcliffe that title to the cottage was taken in the
name of &quot;Tony Bogart in trust for Barbara Dowswell&quot; as a simpler
method of securing Bogart&#146;s loan than providing Bogart with a
mortgage on the property.  It was their collective position that
title would remain in Bogart&#146;s name until he was repaid the
monies he had advanced, failing which he could sell the property
to recover the debt.  It was also agreed that when the loan had
been repaid in full, legal title to the property would pass to
Barbara Dowswell.
[9]  Dowswell was petitioned into bankruptcy on September 15,
1995.  There is no issue that the purchase of the cottage
occurred within five years of the initial bankruptcy event, or
that Dowswell was insolvent at the time of the purchase.</pre>
    <pre>RELEVANT LEGISLATION</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The relevant sections of the Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency Act
are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.  &quot;settlement&quot; includes a contract, covenant, transfer,
          gift and designation of beneficiary in an insurance contract, to
          the extent that the contract, covenant, transfer, gift or
          designation is gratuitous or made for merely nominal
          consideration;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               91.(2)   Any settlement of property made
          within the period beginning on the day that
          is five years before the date of the initial
          bankruptcy event in respect of the settlor
          and ending on the date that the settlor
          became bankrupt, both dates included, is void
          against the trustee if the trustee can prove
          that the settlor was, at the time of making
          the settlement, unable to pay all the
          settlor's debts without the aid of the
          property comprised in the settlement or that
          the interest of the settlor in the property
          did not pass on the execution thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)   This section does not extend to
          any settlement made
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  before and in consideration of
               marriage;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  in favour of a purchaser or
               incumbrancer in good faith and for
               valuable consideration; or
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (c)  on or for the spouse or
               children of the settlor of property that
               has accrued to the settlor after
               marriage in right of the settlor's
               spouse or children.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>DECISIONS LEADING TO THIS APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[11] The Deputy Registrar found that the purchase of the cottage
by Dowswell constituted a settlement in favour of Bogart.
However, the Deputy Registrar concluded that the transaction was
not void against the trustee under s. 91(2), but was saved by s.
91(3)(b) as a settlement made in good faith and for valuable
consideration.
[12] The bankruptcy judge effectively endorsed the reasons of the
Deputy Registrar and dismissed the trustee's appeal.  Like the
Deputy Registrar, he found that the transaction was a settlement
in favour of a purchaser in good faith and for valuable
consideration and, therefore, was saved by s. 91(3)(b).</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[13] The central questions raised by this appeal are whether the
transaction consisting of the purchase of the cottage property
constituted a settlement and, if this is the case, whether it is
void against the trustee.
[14] As stated above, both the Deputy Registrar and the
bankruptcy judge found that the purchase of the cottage was a
settlement by Dowswell in favour of Bogart.  However, they
concluded that the settlement was made in good faith, and for
valuable consideration, under s. 91(3)(b) and, as a result, was
not void against the trustee as otherwise required under s.
91(2).
[15] While I agree that the transaction between Bogart and
Dowswell is not void against the trustee, I am unable to agree
with the analysis undertaken by the Deputy Registrar and affirmed
by the bankruptcy judge.
[16] Section 2 of the Act provides that, to be viewed as a
settlement, the contract, covenant, transfer, gift or designation
in question must be &#147;gratuitous or made for merely nominal
consideration.&#148;
[17] In Houlden and Morawetz, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of
Canada, 3rd ed., rev., (Toronto: Carswell, 1998) (looseleaf),
Vol. 2, the learned authors state at p. 4-7:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is important to distinguish between a settlement and a
          fraudulent preference.  A settlement involves a gift to a
          stranger to the bankruptcy.  A preference involves a transaction
          with a creditor whereby the creditor is preferred over other
          creditors.  A settlement involves the idea of a clear gift or a
          situation where provision is made for a trust of some sort; it
          does not include a business transaction between a debtor and
          creditor.</pre>
    <pre>And at p. 4-8:
          </pre>
    <pre>               If a third party has given consideration for property that
          he has received from the bankrupt, the transaction cannot be
          attacked as a settlement, since a settlement has reference only
          to a gratuitous disposition of property.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[18] The transaction between Bogart and Dowswell was not a
gratuitous disposition of property.  It was a business
transaction between a creditor and a debtor whereby Bogart made a
loan to Dowswell.  In return, Bogart, in the capacity of a
trustee, received as security for the loan title to the cottage
purchased with the money loaned.  A transaction of this nature is
not a settlement for the purposes of the Act.
[19] Accordingly, there is no support for the conclusion that the
transaction, as it was characterized by the Deputy Registrar and
the bankruptcy judge, amounted to a settlement by Dowswell on
Bogart.  The transfer of legal title to the property to Bogart
therefore stands against the trustee.
[20] Any discussion of whether a transaction is exempted from s.
91(2) under s. 91(3)(b), as a settlement made in favour of a
purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith and for valuable
consideration, is only required if the transaction is found to be
a settlement within s. 91(2).  In my view, it was not a
settlement.  In light of the finding that the loan transaction
from Bogart to Dowswell was not a settlement, it is not necessary
to proceed to s. 91(3) as the Deputy Registrar and the bankruptcy
judge did.  Since the transaction between Bogart and Dowswell was
not a settlement, s. 91(3) was never engaged.
[21] Up to this point, I have dealt with the transaction between
Bogart and Dowswell.  However, this does not end the matter.
There is another transaction that must be considered.
[22] Neither the Deputy Registrar nor the bankruptcy judge
considered whether the transaction consisting of the acquisition
of the beneficial ownership of the cottage for Barbara Dowswell
could be attacked as a settlement under s. 91(2) of the Act.
Indeed, it would appear that both were misled by the confusing
way in which title to the cottage was acquired, and as a
consequence did not see the necessity to address this issue.
[23] If the acquisition of the beneficial interest in the
property for Barbara Dowswell constituted a settlement, then to
that extent the transaction is void against the trustee under s.
91(2), unless it qualifies for one of the exemptions listed in s.
91(3).
[24] Before turning to the issue of whether Dowswell conferred a
settlement on Barbara Dowswell, a preliminary question exists as
to whether she had proper notice of these proceedings to permit
this court to deal with this issue in her absence, as she was not
represented on this appeal.  On a review of the court record, I
am satisfied that she received proper notice.  In reaching this
conclusion, I note the following:</pre>
    <pre>    It would appear that Barbara Dowswell was served with the
  Notice of Motion dated October 25, 1996 and made returnable
  October 28, 1996 before the Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy;</pre>
    <pre>    She was represented by counsel at her examination for
  discovery on December 16, 1996  (The same counsel, Mr. Highley,
  represented both Barbara Dowswell and the bankrupt, Dowswell.);</pre>
    <pre>    She was represented by Mr. Highley at the hearing before the
  Deputy Registrar on July 7, 1997;</pre>
    <pre>    The Notice of Appeal was served on Mr. Highley on December
  11, 1997;</pre>
    <pre>    On January 21, 1999, the Registrar of the Court of Appeal
  sent Mr. Highley the usual notice to fix a date for the hearing
  of the appeal;</pre>
    <pre>    On February 4, 1999, Mr. Highley wrote to the Registrar that
  the bankrupt, Dowswell, had instructed him not to attend at the
  hearing of the appeal.  No mention was made of Barbara Dowswell;</pre>
    <pre>    On March 23, 1999, the Registrar wrote to Mr. Highley
  advising him that the appeal was to be heard on May 28, 1999;</pre>
    <pre>    On April 26, 1999, Mr. Highley wrote to the Registrar
  enclosing a Notice of Intention to Act in Person from the
  bankrupt, Dowswell.  Again no mention is made of Barbara
  Dowswell; and</pre>
    <pre>    There is no indication that Mr. Highley brought a motion to
  be removed as counsel of record for Barbara Dowswell.</pre>
    <pre>[25] There is no doubt that the main thrust of the trustee&#146;s
attack in these proceedings has been directed against Bogart.
However, the trustee has also challenged Barbara Dowswell&#146;s
beneficial interest in the cottage.  In his factum, at para. 13,
the trustee stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Trustee submits that subsection 91(3)(b) of the Act has
          no application to the circumstances of this situation.  The
          Deputy Registrar found that the Bankrupt made a settlement
          (defined in s. 2) under section 91(2) of the Act and the learned
          Judge agreed.  The Trustee submits the settlement was in favour
          of the Bankrupt's wife Barbara Dowswell.    Section 91(3)(b)
          exempts a settlement made in favour of a purchaser or
          encumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration.
          Barbara Dowswell was not found by the Deputy Registrar or the
          learned Judge to be a purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith and
          for valuable consideration and there is no evidence to support
          such a finding.  There is no evidence that Barbara Dowswell is
          indebted to Bogart.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[26] Although Barbara Dowswell has filed no material on this
appeal and did not participate at the hearing, she is still
represented by counsel of record and she must have been aware of
the allegation made against her by the trustee.  She must have
known that her interest in the cottage property was put at risk
in these proceedings.  I see no valid reason why this court
cannot consider on this appeal whether there was a settlement on
her by her bankrupt husband, and it is to that issue which I now
turn.
[27] In Re Bozanich, [1942] 2 D.L.R. 145 at 153 (S.C.C.), Rinfret
J. expressed the opinion that &#147;generally speaking, &#145;settlement&#146;
involves the idea of a clear gift, or that type of case where
provision is made for a trust of some sort.&#148;
[28] That a settlement can include the granting of a beneficial
interest in property created through a trust was also recognized
in Re Cohen &amp; Lyons Can. Credit Men&#146;s Trust Ass&#146;n v. Spivak,
[1926] 3 D.L.R. 942 (Alta. S.C.), reversed on other grounds
[1927] 1 D.L.R. 577 (Alta. C.A.).  There Tweedie J. defined
settlement as follows at p. 952:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#147;Settlement&#148;&#133;means a disposition of property
          by the settlor either directly, or through
          the intervention of a trustee, for the
          benefit of the person on whose behalf the
          settlement is made.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>See, also, Amex Bank of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion Bank (1997),
146 D.L.R. (4th) 55 (Alta. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[29] Thus, as indicated by the foregoing authorities, the concept
of a settlement extends to a disposition of property through a
trust creating a gift in the form of a beneficial interest in the
property.  That is the case here, where Dowswell has obtained the
beneficial interest in the cottage for Barbara Dowswell.
[30] In Re Bozanich at p. 151 Rinfret J. also said, &#147;The end and
purpose of the thing must be a settlement, that is, a disposition
of property to be held for the enjoyment of some other person.&#148;
See, also, Royal Bank of Canada v. North American Life Assurance
Co. (1996), 132 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 203 (S.C.C.).
[31] Also, in Re Bozanich, Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. stated the
following at p. 148:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the treatise on Bankruptcy and Insolvency in the 2nd
          edition of Halsbury [vol. 2, para. 487] by Lord Justice Luxmoore
          it is stated that the term &#147;settlement&#148; &#147;implies an intention
          that the property shall be retained or preserved for the benefit
          of the donee in such a form that it can be traced.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[32] Accordingly, to be properly viewed as a settlement, a
disposition of property must be held for the enjoyment of another
person where it was the intention of the settlor that the
property would be retained for the benefit of that person in such
a form that it could be traced.
[33] Applying these considerations to the present case, it is
clear that the purchase of the cottage, through the intervention
of a trust, was made for the enjoyment of Barbara Dowswell.  As
the beneficiary of the trust, she is able to use and enjoy the
property.  There can be no denying that the cottage is held in
trust for her.
[34] In my view, it is equally clear that the transaction was
made with the intention that the property would be retained for
the benefit of Barbara Dowswell.  I note that proof of intention
does not require that there be restrictions on what the recipient
can do with the property.  See Re Vansittart, [1893] 1 Q.B. 181
(Eng. Q.B.); Re Tankard, [1899] 2 Q.B. 57 (Eng. Q.B.); and Re
Kostiuk (1998), 6 C.B.R. (4th) 46 (B.C.S.C.).  Rather, as
observed by the court in Re Kostiuk at p. 58, &#147;intention is to be
determined by a review of the whole of the evidence and the
surrounding circumstances.&#148;
[35] While Bogart holds legal title to the property in trust for
Barbara Dowswell, he holds title only as security for the loan he
made to Dowswell.  Indeed, the Deputy Registrar found that Bogart
advanced the funds based upon a genuine belief that repayment was
secured by his taking title to the property.  It is beyond
dispute that once the loan has been repaid, legal title is to be
transferred to Barbara Dowswell.  There is nothing to indicate
that the cottage will be alienated or disposed of in the meantime
but, if it is, any equity over and above the amount payable to
Bogart will belong to the trustee.
[36] I therefore conclude that the acquisition of the beneficial
interest in the cottage for Barbara Dowswell was a settlement by
Dowswell on her.
[37] Given this conclusion, the acquisition of the beneficial
interest in the property is void against the trustee under s.
91(2) unless it falls into one of the exemptions listed in s.
91(3).  In particular, under s. 91(3)(b) there is no
nullification of a settlement made in favour of a purchaser in
good faith and for valuable consideration.
[38] The acquisition of the beneficial interest in the cottage to
Barbara Dowswell was a gratuitous disposition of property through
the imposition of a trust.  It was not a settlement for good
consideration.  As such, it is not exempted from s. 91(2) by
s. 91(3)(b) and is void against the trustee.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[39] Bogart is the registered owner of the cottage as trustee for
Barbara Dowswell.  It is agreed, even by Bogart, that Barbara
Dowswell is the owner of the beneficial interest in the property.
Beyond that, she has no interest apart from the agreement that
she would be entitled to a conveyance of the cottage if the
amount owed by Dowswell is repaid to Bogart.  She is not entitled
to a conveyance absent repayment.
[40] The trustee is entitled to step into the shoes of Barbara
Dowswell and to acquire her interest in the property.  She has an
equitable interest in the cottage subject to the repayment of the
$100,000 to Bogart.  That is all that the trustee is entitled to
receive.
[41] In the result, the appeal is allowed.  There will be a
declaration that the trustee is entitled to  Barbara Dowswell's
beneficial interest in the cottage registered in the name of
&quot;Bogart in trust for Barbara Dowswell&quot;.  In light of the
disposition of the appeal, there will be no order as to costs.
