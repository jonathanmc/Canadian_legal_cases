    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by McLean J. sitting with a
jury, dated November 20, 1996 and on appeal from the sentence
imposed by McLean J. dated March 24, 1997.

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged with attempted murder.  He was
acquitted by the jury of that charge but found guilty of the
lesser and included offence of aggravated assault.  He was
sentenced to five years in jail.  He appeals his conviction and
seeks leave to appeal his sentence.
[2]  The appellant submits that the trial judge did not properly
place the theory of the defence before the jury.  The position of
the defence was that the complainant&#146;s throat was cut as a result
of an accident.  The appellant testified that the complainant&#146;s
throat was sliced during the struggle he had with her over a
knife she had in her hand, which she may have been using to
commit suicide.
[3]  Although the trial judge placed the defence of accident
before the jury, the trial judge did not review with the jury the
evidence of Dr. Chiasson, the doctor who examined the
complainant&#146;s wound.  The defence submits he erred in this
regard.  The medical evidence was, on the whole, favourable to
the Crown&#146;s position.  The doctor testified that the wound was
more characteristic or more likely to have been inflicted by an
assailant than it was to have been accidentally self-inflicted,
although he conceded the latter was possible.
[4]  We are of the opinion the defence was not prejudiced in any
way because the trial judge did not review the evidence of Dr.
Chiasson with the jury.  In addition, the trial judge reviewed
the theory of the defence with the jury and pointed to the other
salient features of the evidence in support of that position.  We
would dismiss this ground of appeal.
[5]  The appellant abandoned the second ground of appeal:
unreasonable verdict.  The appeal as to conviction is therefore
dismissed.
[6]  With respect to sentence, we are of the opinion that the
trial judge did not err in principle in imposing a sentence of
five years, nor are we of the view that the sentence is
manifestly unfit.  Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence
is granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</pre>
