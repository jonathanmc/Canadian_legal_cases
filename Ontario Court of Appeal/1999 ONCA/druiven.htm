COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            LILIAN DRUIVEN, ANNE BOARDMAN, PATRICIA KOEPPE,

               (Plaintiffs/Respondents) and BRUCE WARRINGTON,
               ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PLANNERS LIMITED and MONEYSEM
               FINANCIAL CONSULTANTS INC. (Defendants/Appellants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN and WEILER JJ.A. and FARLEY J. (Ad hoc)</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Ross F. Earnshaw, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Paul J. Bates and John V. Kranjc, for the plaintiffs/respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 20, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Cavarzan J. concluded that:
     (a)  the appellant owed to the respondents a duty of care to
       adequately and properly supervise Warrington's financial planning
       activities;
     (b)   the dealings between Warrington and the respondents fell
       within the scope of such activities;
     (c)   with  appropriate supervisory techniques, Warrington's
       improper personal financial dealings with the respondents would
       have come to light; and
     (d)  the appellant was liable to the respondents for the loss
       they suffered by reason of its failure to take the required
       action.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  There was evidence to support those conclusions and we
agree with them.

[3]  Cavarzan J. further found that the respondents were
unsophisticated investors who were induced  by Warrington  to
repose trust and confidence in him as a financial planning
adviser and that they could not reasonably be expected to
appreciate the significance of the differences between their
investments in Warrington's business and their purchase of mutual
funds. Again, there was evidence to support those findings and,
in consequence, we would not reduce the respondents' recovery on
the basis of contributory negligence.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
