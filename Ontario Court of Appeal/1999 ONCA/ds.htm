               YOUNG OFFENDER) (Appellant)</pre>

               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 27, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge M. Morten
on February 25, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  It is agreed that the sentence imposed at trial was illegal
in that it exceeded the two-year maximum permitted by s. 20(3) of
the Young Offenders Act.
[2]  The appellant served some 68 days in secure custody before
his release on bail pending appeal and the Crown agrees that it
would not be appropriate to require the appellant to serve the
rest of the secure custody term imposed by the trial judge.
[3]  The Crown does submit, however, that the appellant should
serve the 3 months open custody imposed by the trial judge.
Certainly, the offence warranted a period of open custody.  We
are, however, concerned that the imposition of that open custody
at this time would do much more harm than good.  The appellant
has completed high school and is employed on a full-time basis.
He is required to work nights and it may be that he would lose
his job if required to serve the open custody period.  It is best
for all that the appellant keep his employment.  Hopefully that
employment and the support of his family will allow him to become
a productive member of the community.
[4]  We would, therefore, vary the sentence to one of time served
to be followed by 18 months probation.  The terms of the
probation are those imposed by the trial judge plus the
following:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>the appellant will do 100 hours of community service during
his probationary term as directed by his probation officer;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>between this date and March 1st, the appellant will not be
outside of his residence after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m.,
except for purposes related to his employment;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>the appellant will reside with his parents or at some other
place approved by the probation officer.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul></td>
