    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) &#150;and&#150; ROBERT
               DUNCAN (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, WEILER and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       John McInnes, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Gary T. Trotter, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         September 8, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Meehan J. dated January
7, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The only argument raised in this appeal was that the
appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at
trial.  The same counsel represented the appellant at the
preliminary hearing and the trial.  No transcript of the
preliminary hearing was ordered.  This failure to order a
transcript is the sole basis for the appellant&#146;s assertion that
he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial.
[2]  We do not agree with this assertion.  The suggestion that
this single oversight demonstrated incompetence such that the
appellant is entitled to a new trial is problematical at best.
Moreover, if he is relying on this isolated act as representing
conduct that amounts to incompetence, there is a burden on the
appellant to show prejudice.  In the words of Doherty J.A. in R.
v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 at p.63, where the
appellant is alleging incompetence related to specific decisions
made or actions taken during the course of the trial, &#147;the effect
on the fairness of the trial of counsel&#146;s incompetence is
measured by reference to the impact of the error or errors on the
reliability of the result.&#148;
[3]  In this case, it is not even submitted that there was
prejudice. It is not suggested that the cross-examination of
trial counsel was hindered by the lack of the transcript.  It is
simply asserted that the failure to obtain the transcript is per
se of the same all pervasive order as the intoxication of counsel
referred to by Doherty J.A.
[4]  In any event, on the assumption that prejudice might be a
live issue, the Crown has made an examination of the transcript
of the preliminary hearing and that at trial and it appears that
any variations between the evidence recorded at the two hearings
is insignificant.  No prejudice could be established even if it
was asserted.
[5]  Under these circumstances, we would not give effect to this
argument.  The appeal is dismissed.</pre>
