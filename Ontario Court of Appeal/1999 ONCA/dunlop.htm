    <pre>HEARD:         May 27, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decisions of Madam Justice C. J. Robertson
dated August 6, 1998 and September 18, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The parties are in agreement that there is a discretion in
the courts to vary the terms of a separation agreement.  The real
issue on this appeal is whether the circumstances were such as to
warrant the court's exercise of its discretion to vary the terms
of the agreement and, in refusing to exercise its discretion,
whether the court erred in law.
[2]  On reading the motions judge's reasons as a whole, we are
satisfied that she recognized that she had a discretion, but in
the circumstances of this case refused to exercise it to vary the
terms of the agreement.
[3]  Although the motions judge placed considerable weight on the
terms contained in the separation agreement, she nevertheless
applied correct legal principles in reaching her decision.
[4]  In light of the clear and unambiguous wording of the
separation agreement, the evidence relating to the husband's
employment history, the evidence of the wife, and the conduct of
the husband, we see no error in the exercise of her discretion.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
