    <pre>HEARD:         December 7-8, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Madam Justice Van Camp, with a jury,
dated December 22, 1994 and sentence January 26, 1995</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals against his conviction on charges of
second degree murder and attempt murder. He also appeals against
the 12 year sentence imposed for the offence of attempt murder.</pre>
    <pre>     CONVICTION APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Of the various grounds of appeal pursued by the appellant,
we only called on the Crown with respect to the following two
issues:
     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.  Did the trial judge misdirect the jury on the use that
could be made of the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact conduct? and
2.  Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury
that Rendall&#146;s guilty plea to the offence of accessory after the
fact to murder could not be used as evidence against the
appellant?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>     After-the-fact conduct</pre>
    <pre>[3]  On the charge of attempt murder, the appellant admitted to
shooting the victim Ray Burden. Accordingly, the only live issue
for the jury was whether at the time of the shooting, the
appellant had the requisite intent to kill.
[4]  The appellant submits that in view of his admission, the
trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that his after-
the-fact conduct (flight, concealment of evidence, altering his
appearance and attempting to concoct evidence) could not be
considered in deciding whether he had the requisite intent to
kill. While it is true that the trial judge did not specifically
instruct the jury to disregard the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct in deciding whether he had the requisite intent, she made
it clear that in deciding that issue, the jury was only to look
to the facts and circumstances leading up to the shooting. That,
in our view, is a complete answer to the submission that the jury
may have taken the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact conduct into
account in deciding whether the requisite intent for attempt
murder had been proved. Added support for this conclusion comes
from the fact that defence counsel raised no objection to this
alleged deficiency. Accordingly, we see no merit in this ground
of appeal.
[5]  With respect to the charge of murder, it was the appellant&#146;s
position at trial that he did not shoot the deceased Sean
Gallagher. Rather, he maintained that Jamie Rendall was
responsible for the shooting.
[6]  In her charge, the trial judge specifically instructed the
jury that the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact conduct could not be
considered in deciding whether he, as opposed to Rendall, was the
shooter; nor could the after-the-fact conduct be used to
determine the appellant&#146;s intent at the time of the shooting in
the event the jury concluded that he was the shooter.
[7]  The trial judge then went on, however, to instruct the
jurors that they could look to all of the evidence in deciding
whether the Crown had proved that the appellant was the shooter.
She also told the jurors that if they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant was the shooter, in deciding
whether he had the requisite intent for murder, they could look
to the facts and circumstances before, during, and after the
event.
[8]  The appellant submits that these latter instructions had the
effect of negating the earlier limiting instruction. With
respect, we do not agree.
[9]  Beginning with the instruction that the jury should consider
all of the evidence in deciding whether the appellant was the
shooter, the record indicates that after the events in question,
the appellant, by his own admission, confessed to several of his
friends that he had shot both Burden and Gallagher. Before the
jury, the appellant maintained that he had falsely confessed to
shooting Gallagher in an effort to reassure his friend Rendall
that he would take responsibility for what had happened.
[10] Against this backdrop, the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct was admissible as part of the narrative. In deciding
whether to give effect to the appellant&#146;s explanation for having
confessed to both shootings, the jury was entitled to consider
that explanation in the context of all of the surrounding facts
and circumstances. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jurors that in deciding
whether the Crown had proved that the appellant was the shooter,
they were entitled to consider the entirety of the evidence,
including the appellant&#146;s after-the-fact conduct.
[11] As for the trial judge&#146;s general instruction concerning the
evidence the jury should consider in deciding whether the
appellant had the requisite intent for murder, including &#147;what
was happening afterwards,&#148; while this instruction was
unfortunate, we are not persuaded that it had the effect of
undermining the earlier specific instruction to the contrary.
Defence counsel&#146;s failure to object lends support to this
conclusion. At worst, in our view, the general instruction may
have led to some confusion on the part of the jury. In the
circumstances, however, we do not consider this deficiency to be
fatal.
[12] As indicated, the appellant&#146;s primary defence to the charge
of murder was that he was not the shooter. Once the jury
determined otherwise, it was but a short step for the jury to
conclude that he had the requisite intent for murder. Indeed, the
evidence in this regard was overwhelming.
[13] The deceased Gallagher was shot in the chest at point blank
range with a .380 automatic handgun. The appellant gave no
evidence as to his intent at the time of the shooting and the
jury was entitled to infer that he intended the natural
consequences of his act. In these circumstances, we are satisfied
that no jury, acting reasonably, could have come to any other
conclusion but that the appellant, at the very least, intended to
cause bodily harm to Gallagher which he knew was likely to cause
death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. Accordingly,
if necessary, we would apply the curative proviso to sustain the
conviction. It follows that we would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Rendall&#146;s guilty plea</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits, for the first time on appeal, that
the trial judge was obliged to instruct the jury that Rendall&#146;s
guilty plea to the offence of accessory after the fact to murder
could not be used as evidence against the appellant and that her
failure to do so constituted reversible error.
[15] In support of his position, the appellant submits that the
jury may have used Rendall&#146;s guilty plea to infer that the
appellant was the shooter and further, that if the appellant was
the shooter, he must be guilty of murder.
[16] No doubt, it would have been preferable had the trial judge
given the standard limiting instruction. We are not, however,
persuaded that in this case, her failure to do so constituted
reversible error.
[17] Rendall testified at length and he was effectively cross-
examined with a view to showing that he, not the appellant, was
the shooter, that as a result of his guilty plea to accessory
after the fact, the charge of first degree murder against him was
withdrawn and that his reason for falsely implicating the
appellant as the shooter was to save himself. In view of this, we
fail to see how the jury could have been left with the mistaken
impression that Rendall&#146;s guilty plea could somehow be used to
infer that the appellant was the shooter. Admittedly, the second
of the two possible inferences is more problematic. However, the
inference in question relates to the issue of the appellant&#146;s
intent at the time of the shooting. Bearing in mind that the
evidence on this issue was overwhelming, we are satisfied that
the verdict would inevitably have been the same had the standard
limiting instruction be given. Accordingly, we would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.
[18] The other grounds of appeal pursued by the appellant are
without merit. In the result, the appeal against conviction must
be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant submits that the sentence of 12 years for the
offence of attempt murder was manifestly unfit and beyond the
range of sentence normally meted out in like circumstances. We
disagree.
[20] While the sentence was certainly at the upper end of the
range, we are not persuaded that it was so high as to warrant our
intervention. Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted
but the appeal is dismissed.
