    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Lissaman dated
September 16, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  only  issue on this appeal is whether  the  respondent
insurer  is  obliged to defend the appellant Municipality  in  an
action  claiming that the appellant breached its duty of care  in
administering the tendering process for construction of a  sewage
pumping station in the municipality.
[2]  On September 16, 1998, Lissaman J. answered this question in
the negative, finding that this claim is within the exclusion
clause of the insurance policy as a claim &quot;arising out of tenders
for contracts&quot;. For the reasons that follow, I agree.
[3]  The insurance policy in this case insures the appellant
Durham for any compensatory damages it is obliged to pay because
of liability imposed upon it by a court because of a wrongful
act. &quot;Wrongful act&quot; is defined to include any breach of duty by
Durham or its employees. It is agreed that the claim in this
action brought against Durham comes within this coverage.
[4]  The duty of the respondent to defend is set out in the
following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               To defend in the name and on behalf of, any Corporation or
          person insured by this policy and at the cost of the Insurer,
          that part of any civil action claiming compensatory damages
          covered by this policy, even if any of the allegations in the
          action are groundless, frivolous, false or fraudulent;</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In declining to provide a defence, the insurer relied on the
exclusion  clause relating to claims arising out of  tenders  for
contracts. The clause containing this exclusion reads in full  as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Nor does this policy apply to:
          </pre>
    <pre>        6.   Any claim arising out of:
             (i)   the liability of others assumed by the Insured(s)
	           under the terms of an agreement orally or in writing;
             (ii)  a breach of contract;
             (iii) negotiation for a contract;
             (iv)  tenders for contracts;
             (v)   the selection and/or the awarding of a contract;
             (vi)  the failure to proceed with a contract.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The action that the respondent declined to defend on behalf
of the appellant was commenced by Ontario Electrical Construction
Company Limited (&quot;Ontario Electrical&quot;), an electrical contractor.
The defendants were Durham and Sutherland-Schultz Inc., a general
contractor.
[7]  The facts pleaded in the claim that are relevant to this
appeal are as follows:
[8]  In May of 1996, Durham called for tenders from contractors
and sub-contractors for the construction of a sewage pumping
station. Durham stipulated that tenders for the electrical work
were to be submitted through the Durham Bid Depository. It
further stipulated that the tender process was to be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Bid Depository
Standard Rules and Procedures.
[9]  Sutherland-Schultz tendered a bid for the general contract
and Ontario Electrical tendered a bid for the electrical sub-
contract. Both turned out to be the lowest bids respectively.
Sometime thereafter Sutherland-Schultz requested that Durham
allow it to breach its bid contract with Ontario Electrical and
use its own forces to perform the electrical work on the project.
Durham consented to this and as a result Ontario Electrical was
not awarded the electrical sub-contract with the general
contractor.
[10] The claim against Durham is set out in the statement of
claim in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Durham as the tender calling authority has a duty to
          enforce the Rules and Regulation of the Ontario Bid Depository
          Standard Rules and Procedures.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Durham had a duty of care to ensure
          that all subcontractors who submitted bids to
          the  Durham  Bid Depository on the Carruthers
          Creek  Project  were treated  fairly  and  in
          accordance with the good faith principle.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  discharging its  duty  as  the
          tender calling authority, Durham owed a  duty
          of   care   to   Ontario  Electrical   as   a
          participating electrical subcontractor in the
          tender  process.  Ontario Electrical  was  in
          sufficiently close proximity to  Durham  such
          that   Ontario  Electrical  was  in  Durham's
          contemplation as likely to be injured by  any
          breach [of] its duty of care.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In allowing Sutherland-Schultz  to
          substitute   its  own  forces   for   Ontario
          Electrical's force, Durham breached its  duty
          of care as the tender calling authority.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Additionally, Durham owed a duty of
          good faith to Ontario Electrical to ensure as
          tender  calling  authority  that  Sutherland-
          Schultz    entered   into   the    electrical
          subcontract with Ontario Electrical  for  the
          Carruthers Creek Project.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      By   acquiescing  in  Sutherland-
          Schultz's  high-handed and blatant  disregard
          for  the rights of Ontario Electrical and for
          the  propriety of the tender process,  Durham
          breached its duty of care to protect  Ontario
          Electrical's  rights.  Durham's  failure   to
          require   Sutherland-Schultz  to  award   the
          electrical  subcontract to Ontario Electrical
          has   deprived  Ontario  Electrical  of   its
          rightful  and reasonable expectation  arising
          out of Ontario Electrical's participation  in
          the  Durham  Bid  Depository,  namely,  being
          awarded  the  subcontract for the  electrical
          portion of the Carruthers Creek Project.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Durham,  as  the  tender  calling
          authority, has the responsibility  to  ensure
          the  integrity  of the Bid Depository  System
          and  to  ensure that any contract it  entered
          into  arising  out  of its  use  of  the  Bid
          Depository  System has complied with  Ontario
          Bid  Depository Standard Rules and Procedures
          and has been entered into in good faith.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant says that this claim does not come within  the
exclusion  clause  of  the policy  and  that  the  respondent  is
therefore  obliged to provide it with a defence. It  argues  that
the  exclusion clause is ambiguous in that &quot;any claim arising out
of tenders for contracts&quot; could encompass claims arising directly
or  indirectly  out of such tenders, or it could  be  limited  to
claims that arise directly from those tenders.
[12] Using the contra proferentem rule buttressed by the
principle that exclusion clauses should be construed narrowly,
the appellant urges that this exclusion be limited to claims
arising directly out of tenders for contracts.
[13] It then argues that the exclusion thus narrowed means that
it applies only to tenders for contracts made by the insured
Durham. Because the tender by Ontario Electrical was for a
contract with the general contractor, Sutherland-Schultz, this
claim does not come within this exclusion.
[14] In my view, it is unnecessary to determine whether this
exclusion is ambiguous or indeed what its outer reaches are.
[15] I say this because I think this claim is very clearly one
arising directly out of Ontario Electrical's tender for contract.
The claim asserts that Durham did not fulfill its legal
obligations in running the tendering process. Those obligations
are said to be owed by Durham to the tenderer, Ontario
Electrical, qua tenderer. They only arise because of Ontario
Electrical's tender for contract. The claim is for damages for
wrongful acts done to a tenderer for contract. The linkage
between the plaintiff's claim and the plaintiff's tender for
contract could not be more direct.
[16] Moreover, there is no basis for limiting this exclusion to
tenders for contracts with Durham. Firstly, the language of the
exclusion clause does not have this limitation. Secondly, to
limit the exclusion in this way would be redundant and
unnecessary, given the exclusions for breach of contract,
negotiation of a contract, and the awarding of a contract. The
exclusion covers tenders for contract, whether with Durham or
others, where Durham has a legal duty to the tenderer qua
tenderer which is breached.
[17] In summary, this claim is within the exclusion clause.
Hence, the insurer has no obligation to provide a defence.
[18] The appeal must be dismissed with costs.
