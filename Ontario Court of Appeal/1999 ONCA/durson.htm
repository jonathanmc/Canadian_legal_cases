    <pre>On appeal from the judgments of Matlow J. with a jury, dated 
November 1, 1995.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant Oliver Durson appeals the judgments in two
actions tried together before Matlow J. and a jury awarding him
damages for injuries sustained in two motor vehicle accidents.
The appellant also appeals the order of the trial judge fixing
the costs of the trial.

[2]  By agreement of counsel, the damages flowing from both
accidents were assessed on a global basis and equally divided
between the two actions.

[3]  The appellant relies on two grounds of appeal: the failure
of the trial judge to outline to the jury the medical evidence
called by the appellant and the perversity of the verdict.   In
his supplementary factum, the appellant argues a third ground of
appeal (not contained in the notice of appeal) dealing with the
refusal of the trial judge to allow the appellant to call a
witness.

[4]  With respect to the first ground of appeal, the trial judge
fairly outlined the theories of the parties and adequately
referred to the medical evidence in support of the respective
theories.  No objection was taken by experienced counsel as to
any inadequacy in the review of the evidence of the appellant&#146;s
medical witnesses.  This speaks loudly, in our view, of the
merits of this ground of appeal.

[5]  With respect to the second ground of appeal, there was ample
evidence upon which the jury could conclude that the appellant
had not sustained a serious head injury as a result of the motor
vehicle accidents as contended. Consequently, the jury&#146;s modest
award of damages is supported by the evidence. In our view, the
verdict is not unreasonable.

[6]  As to the third ground of appeal, we are of the view that
the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing to
allow the witness to testify.  In any event, the evidence of this
proposed witness could not have affected the outcome of the
trial.   We see no merit in this ground of appeal.

[7]  The appellant also argues that the trial judge was in error
in his disposition of the costs of the actions.   After hearing
full argument from the parties, the trial judge fixed the costs
of the actions.

[8]  Both judgments exceeded the offers to settle (Rule 49) made
by the respondents.    The trial had lasted twenty-two days and
counsel for the appellant submitted a party and party bill of
costs in the amount of $141,698.09.  The trial judge fixed the
costs at $30,000 plus disbursements of $7,500.

[9]  The trial judge appears to have based his very modest cost
award on his conclusion that the appellant had &quot;misled&quot; and
&quot;manipulated&quot; many of his doctors.  He also referred to the
&quot;extravagant&quot; steps taken by counsel which, in his view, were
&quot;excessive&quot; and responsible for the length of the trial.  In our
view, the record discloses no basis for any of these conclusions.

[10] The vigorous cross-examination by the respondent's counsel
of the doctors at trial may have created the impression that
material information was not disclosed by the appellant.
However, the record reveals no evidence of misinformation, denial
of relevant information, or manipulation.  No doctor complained
that information he or she requested or required was withheld,
and we see no evidence to support a finding of manipulative
conduct on the part of the appellant. Nor can we see anything in
the record to substantiate the trial judge's attribution of
unreasonable conduct on the part of counsel.  He should not be
faulted for protecting his client's interests by bringing forward
the relevant evidence in the way he did.

[11] There being no evidentiary foundation for the trial judge's
conclusions, we are of the view that he erred in basing his low
costs award on those unsupported conclusions.

[12] The appeal with respect to costs is therefore allowed, the
costs order of the trial judge is set aside, and there will be an
order giving the appellant his costs of the trial.  As success
was divided before us, we would make no order as to costs of this
appeal.</pre></td>
