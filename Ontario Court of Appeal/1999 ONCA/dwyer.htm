    <pre>HEARD:         June 7, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the acquittal by The Honourable Judge D. C. Downie
on July 23, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  In our view the trial judge erred in law in holding that
these machines were not kept for gambling because they were kept
for amusement.  The Crown established all the elements of the
offence contrary to s. 202 of the Criminal Code, including the
element of chance of winning and losing money or money's worth.
The exchange of accumulated credits for use of the pool table,
which the customers would otherwise have to pay for, constitutes
money's worth.  The exemption for amusement devices in s. 198(3)
of the Criminal Code had no application as the credits dispensed
were not used only for  free games on that machine.
[2]  The trial judge misconstrued the effect of the decisions in
R. v. Kent (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 344 (S.C.C.) and R. v. J.B.L.
Amusements Ltd., [1998] N.J. No. 59 (Nfld. C.A.).  In those cases
there was no evidence that the credits were exchanged for money's
worth.  On the evidence in this case, the amount of credits that
could be accumulated was not so insubstantial as to render this a
case of de minimus.
[3]  In our view, the facts of this case are most accurately
reflected in convictions for the offence contrary to s. 202 of
the Criminal Code.  The Crown brings this appeal to clarify a
question of law and is not seeking anything more than a nominal
penalty.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal with respect to Gary Dwyer and
745073 Ontario Ltd. is allowed.  A finding of guilt with respect
to Mr. Dwyer is entered on the offence contrary to s. 202, and an
absolute discharge imposed.  A conviction is entered for the
company for the offence contrary to s. 202 and a fine of $10.00
is imposed.
[5]  The appeal with respect to Carrie Dwyer is dismissed.</pre></td>
