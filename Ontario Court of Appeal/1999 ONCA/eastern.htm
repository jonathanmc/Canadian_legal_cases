    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]      This is an appeal from the judgment of Juriansz  J.
dated  November  26, 1998 in which he set aside  service  in
Italy  of  a  statement of claim by an Ontario  company  and
stayed  the  company&#146;s  action  in  Ontario  on  forum   non
conveniens grounds.  In addition to the standard  forum  non
conveniens  factors  that need to be addressed,  the  appeal
poses the interesting question of where a contract is formed
when the acceptance of an offer is communicated by facsimile
transmission.   Is the contract formed, in  accordance  with
the  general  rule of contract law, in the place  where  the
acceptance  is received?  Or should the postal exception  to
the  general rule, which says that a contract is formed when
and  where  an  acceptance is placed in the mail,  apply  to
acceptances communicated by facsimile transmission?</pre>
    <pre>A. Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>[2]       The appellant, Eastern Power Limited (&#147;EP&#148;), is  a
corporation  organized under the laws of  Ontario  with  its
principal place of business in Toronto.  Its business is the
generation of power from non-conventional sources of  energy
such as landfill gas.</pre>
    <pre>[3]      Azienda Communale Energia and Ambiente  (&#147;ACEA&#148;) is
a  corporation  under the laws of Italy with  its  principal
place of business in Rome.  ACEA provides power to the  City
of  Rome. ACEA generates some of its own power; however,  it
also purchases power from other sources.</pre>
    <pre>[4]      In September 1994 representatives of ACEA came to
Toronto to learn about EP&#146;s operations and to explore the
possibility of developing power from non-conventional
sources in Rome.  In order to facilitate these discussions,
a confidentiality agreement was prepared and signed.  ACEA
agreed to maintain
as confidential any information specific to the proposed
joint venture or related to proprietary processes and
systems developed by EP.  ACEA also agreed that it would not
utilize such information and proceed independently or apart
from EP.</pre>
    <pre>[5]       In  December 1994 EP met with ACEA in Italy.   The
parties  drafted a Co-Operation Agreement.  ACEA signed  the
agreement  on December 9 and faxed it to EP in Ontario.   EP
signed the agreement in Ontario and faxed it to ACEA in Rome
on  December  21.  It was an express term of  the  agreement
that  the two companies would co-operate and use their  best
efforts  to enter into a project agreement.  This agreement,
relating  to  the  implementation of the alternative  energy
project, would be based on proposals to be developed  by  EP
and  submitted  to  ACEA  for  approval.   The  project  was
described  as  &#147;an electricity generating  plant  fueled  by
landfill gas, sewage sludge and fossil fuel(s) located  near
Rome, Italy.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[6]       On January 29, 1996 ACEA signed a Letter of Intent
relating to the project.  The Letter of Intent was faxed  by
ACEA  to  EP  in  Ontario.  On February 14 EP  accepted  and
signed the Letter of Intent in Ontario and faxed it back  to
ACEA  in  Rome.   The  Letter of Intent indicated  that  the
parties  wanted to proceed with the project and set out  how
EP  would structure itself in order to be permitted to carry
out its work in Italy.  The Letter of Intent contained these
two provisions:</pre>
    <pre>        6. The terms of reference between the parties of the new
          company are governed according to the Joint Venture
          Agreement which will be later signed by the parties.
        </pre>
    <pre>        7. The intended contents of the present letter are subject
          to conditions such as:</pre>
    <pre>           a) The acquisition of a favourable written opinion from the
             Ministry of Industry regarding the award of CIP 6 subsidy to
             the plant to be built, and also in relation to the Italian
             Law N. 481 dated 14.11.95 and every subsequent change and
             integrations which could occur in the meanwhile;
     </pre>
    <pre>[7]       The  parties  worked to conclude a  Joint  Venture
Agreement.   Many drafts were prepared.  However,  none  was
ever  signed.   During  these further  negotiations  EP  was
concerned   that  ACEA  was  not  diligently  pursuing   the
important  CIP 6 subsidy.  On January 24, 1997 the  Ministry
of  Industry amended the subsidy program in a way that  made
it inapplicable to the proposed joint venture.</pre>
    <pre>[8]       On  February  14,  1997,  ACEA  wrote  to  EP  and
effectively  terminated  their  relationship.   The  letter,
signed  by ACEA&#146;s General Manager, Mario Diaco, cited  three
reasons:  an inability to agree on some terms of  the  Joint
Venture  Agreement,  the  apparent  inapplicability  of  the
government subsidy to the project, and the legal requirement
that  ACEA  award  large contracts, like the  proposed  Rome
generating plant, by way of public tender.</pre>
    <pre>[9]       On March 19, 1997 EP forwarded an invoice to  ACEA
for $478,547 for development and legal costs relating to the
project.  The time frame for this invoice was stated  to  be
October 1994 &#150; March 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[10]         On September 11, 1997 ACEA filed a summons with
the  Rome  Civil  Court.  The summons  essentially  seeks  a
declaration that ACEA has no liability whatsoever to EP.  EP
was  served  with a copy of this claim about a  week  later.
There is nothing in the record to indicate whether the court
in Rome has disposed of the matter.</pre>
    <pre>[11]         On  December  4, 1997 EP commenced  its  action
against ACEA in Ontario.  EP sought damages of $750,000  for
development  costs  incurred and $160,000,000  for  loss  of
profits as a result of the alleged negligence and breach  of
contract by ACEA with respect to the Co-operation Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[12]         On  January 19, 1998 ACEA was served  with  the
statement  of  claim.   ACEA did not serve  a  statement  of
defence  and  on  March 25 was noted in  default.   EP  then
brought  a  motion for default judgment.   This  motion  was
adjourned  to permit ACEA to bring its motion to  set  aside
service of EP&#146;s statement of claim and to stay the action.</pre>
    <pre>[13]         Juriansz J. heard ACEA&#146;s motion on October  27,
1998.   On November 26, 1998  he released his judgment.   He
set  aside the service in Italy of EP&#146;s statement  of  claim
and he stayed EP&#146;s action in Ontario on forum non conveniens
grounds.   By endorsement released on February 9,  1999,  he
awarded ACEA its costs of the motion fixed at $44,000.</pre>
    <pre>[14]        EP appeals from both components of Juriansz J.&#146;s
order  of  November  26, 1998 and from his  costs  award  of
February 9, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>B. Issues</pre>
    <pre>[15]        The issues on this appeal are:

1. Was  the  motions judge correct to stay  EP&#146;s  action  in
   Ontario on the basis of forum non conveniens?
2. Was  the  motions judge correct to set aside  service  in
   Italy of EP&#146;s statement of claim?
3. Was  the motions judge correct to award ACEA costs of the
   motion fixed at $44,000?</pre>
    <pre>[16]          In  the  view  I  take  of  the  appeal,   the
disposition  of  the  first issue makes  it  unnecessary  to
consider the second issue.  Accordingly, in these reasons  I
will address only the forum non conveniens and costs issues.

C.  Analysis

(1)   Forum non conveniens

[17]        On a motion to stay a proceeding on the basis of
forum non conveniens, the test is whether there is clearly a
more  appropriate jurisdiction in which the case  should  be
tried  than the domestic forum chosen by the plaintiff:  see
Amchem   Products   Inc.  v.  British   Columbia   (Workers&#146;
Compensation  Board),1 [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 at 921  and  931;
Frymer v. Brettschneider (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 60 (C.A.); and
Mutual  Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Peat Marwick, [1998]
O.J. No. 5119 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[18]        In determining which forum, domestic or foreign,
is  the  more appropriate forum, the courts will look  at  a
wide  range of factors.  The general approach was enunciated
by Arbour J.A. in Frymer v. Brettschneider, at p. 79:</pre>
    <pre>          The  choice of the appropriate forum  is
          designed  to ensure that the  action  is
          tried  in the jurisdiction that has  the
          closest  connection with the action  and
          the  parties. All factors pertaining  to
          making   this  determination   must   be
          considered.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[19]         What,  then, are the relevant factors?   Amchem
mentions several of them &#150; the connection of the parties  to
the  competing jurisdictions, where the acts  that  are  the
foundation of the claim took place, and legitimate juridical
advantage  in  the  domestic forum.  A useful  catalogue  of
factors  which  various Ontario courts  have  considered  is
contained   in  SDI  Simulation  Group  Inc.  v.   Chameleon
Technologies  Inc., (1994), 34 C.P.C. (3d)  346  (Ont.  Gen.
Div.), wherein Borins J. stated, at pp. 350-51:</pre>
    <pre>          The   law  with  respect  to  forum  non
          conveniens has been subject to a  number
          of recent cases: Amchem Products Inc. v.
          British  Columbia (Workers&#146; Compensation
          Board), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897; Upper Lakes
          Shipping  Ltd.  V.  Foster  Yeoman  Ltd.
          (1993),  14  O.R. (3d) 548 (Gen.  Div.),
          leave  to appeal refused; Guarantee  Co.
          of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.
          (1994),  18  O.R. (3d)  9  (Gen.  Div.),
          leave  to  appeal  refused;  Frymer   v.
          Brettschneider (1994), 19 O.R.  (3d)  60
          (C.A.).   In  my view, on the  basis  of
          these authorities the test is not one of
          convenience,   but  one   of   &#147;a   more
          appropriate  jurisdiction based  on  the
          relevant  factors in which  to  litigate
          the  plaintiff&#146;s claim&#148;.  In the  Gordon
          Capital  case  Ground J. identified  the
          following   as   the   factors   to   be
          considered     in    determining     the
          appropriate  forum and, in the  case  of
          two  appropriate forums,  which  is  the
          more appropriate:
          </pre>
    <pre>             (a)   the location where the contract in dispute was signed,</pre>
    <pre>             (b)   the applicable law of the contract,</pre>
    <pre>             (c)   the location in which the majority of witnesses
                  reside;</pre>
    <pre>             (d)   the location of key witnesses,</pre>
    <pre>             (e)   the location where the bulk of the evidence will come
                  from,</pre>
    <pre>             (f)   the jurisdiction in which the factual matters arose,
                  and</pre>
    <pre>             (g)   the residence or place of business of the parties.
</pre>
    <pre>[20]         In  his judgment, Juriansz J. focussed on  this
catalogue  of factors from Gordon Capital and SDI Simulation
Group.  He added to this list one other factor, the loss  of
juridical  advantage,  because  it  was  identified  as   an
important  factor by the Supreme Court of Canada in  Amchem.
The appellant does not quarrel with the relevance of any  of
these  factors, and indeed has made submissions  on  all  of
them.  Hence, I will review these factors.</pre>
    <pre>(a)     Location where the contract was signed</pre>
    <pre>[21]         The  contract  which forms the  basis  of  EP&#146;s
action in contract and tort against ACEA is the Co-operation
Agreement: see Statement of Claim, paragraphs 5, 26, 30  and
31.  The motions judge found that the Co-operation Agreement
was  made  in Italy because &#147;acceptance was communicated  to
Italy.&#148;  Since EP&#146;s acceptance was communicated by facsimile
transmission,  this raises the interesting question  of  the
legal  relationship between a faxed acceptance of  an  offer
and the place where a contract is formed.</pre>
    <pre>[22]         The  general rule of contract  law  is  that  a
contract  is made in the location where the offeror receives
notification  of the offeree&#146;s acceptance: see Fridman,  The
Law of Contract in Canada, 3rd ed., (1994), at p. 65; and Re
Viscount  Supply  Co., [1963] 1 O.R. 640  (S.C.).   However,
there  is  an  exception to this general rule.   It  is  the
postal  acceptance  rule.  As expressed  by  Ritchie  J.  in
Imperial Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Colmenares,  [1967]
S.C.R. 443 at 447:</pre>
    <pre>          It  has  long been recognized that  when
          contracts  are to be concluded  by  post
          the  place of mailing the acceptance  is
          to  be  treated as the place  where  the
          contract was made.
</pre>
    <pre>See  also:  Fridman,  The Law of Contract in Canada,  supra,
at pp. 67-68.</pre>
    <pre>[23]         EP  contends  that the  rule  with  respect  to
facsimile  transmissions should follow the postal acceptance
exception.   With  respect, I disagree.   EP  has  cited  no
authority  in  support of its position.  There is,  however,
case  authority  for  the  proposition  that  acceptance  by
facsimile transmission should follow the general rule, which
would  mean  that  a  contract  is  formed  when  and  where
acceptance is received by the offeror.</pre>
    <pre>[24]         In  Brinkibon  Ltd. V. Stahag  Stahl  G.m.b.H.,
[1983]  2 A.C. 34 (H.L.), a contract was concluded when  the
buyer in London transmitted its acceptance to the seller  in
Vienna.  The mode of acceptance was a message sent by telex,
a  form  of  instantaneous communication like the telephone.
The law lords were unanimous in concluding that the contract
was  formed  in Vienna where the acceptance was received  by
the offeror.  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook analyzed the issue in
this fashion, at p. 48:</pre>
    <pre>          Mr.  Thompson&#146;s  second and  alternative
          case, that the contract was concluded by
          the  buyers transmitting to the  sellers
          their telex of May 4, 1979, seems to  me
          to   be  the  correct  analysis  of  the
          transaction.  On this analysis, however,
          the buyers are up against the difficulty
          that  it  was  decided by the  Court  of
          Appeal in Entores Ltd. v. Miles Far East
          Corporation [1955] 2 Q.B. 327 that, when
          an  offer  is  accepted  by  telex,  the
          contract  thereby made is to be regarded
          as  having  been so made  at  the  place
          where  such telex was received (in  this
          case  Vienna) and not in the place  from
          which such telex was sent (in this  case
          London).
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr.  Thompson invited your Lordships  to
          hold  that the Entores case was  wrongly
          decided   and   should   therefore    be
          overruled.  In this connection  he  said
          that  it was well-established law  that,
          when acceptance of an offer was notified
          to  an offeror by post or telegram,  the
          concluding  of the contract  took  place
          when  and where the letter of acceptance
          was posted or the telegram of acceptance
          was despatched.  He then argued that the
          same  rule  should apply to cases  where
          the   acceptance   of   an   offer   was
          communicated   by   telex,   with    the
          consequence  that the contract  so  made
          should  be regarded as having been  made
          at  the  place from which the telex  was
          sent  and  not  the place where  it  was
          received.
          </pre>
    <pre>          My  Lords, I am not persuaded  that  the
          Entores  case  [1955] 2  Q.B.  327,  was
          wrongly decided and should therefore  be
          overruled.   On  the contrary,  I  think
          that  it was rightly decided and  should
          be  approved.  The general principle  of
          law  applicable  to the formation  of  a
          contract by offer and acceptance is that
          the  acceptance  of  the  offer  by  the
          offeree  must be notified to the offeror
          before  a  contract can be  regarded  as
          concluded,  Carlill  v.  Carbolic  Smoke
          Ball  Co.  [1893] 1 Q.B. 256,  262,  per
          Lindley L.J.  The cases on acceptance by
          letter   and   telegram  constitute   an
          exception  to  the general principle  of
          the  law of contract stated above.   The
          reason  for  the exception is commercial
          expediency:  see, for example,  Imperial
          Land  Co. of Marseilles.  In re (Harris&#146;
          Case)  (1872) L.R. 7 Ch. App.  587,  692
          per   Mellish  L.J.   That   reason   of
          commercial expediency applies  to  cases
          where there is bound to be a substantial
          interval  between  the  time  when   the
          acceptance is sent and the time when  it
          is   received.    In  such   cases   the
          exception  to the general rule  is  more
          convenient, and makes on the  whole  for
          greater fairness, than the general  rule
          itself   would  do.   In   my   opinion,
          however,   that  reason  of   commercial
          expediency does not have any application
          when the means of communication employed
          between  the offeror and the offeree  is
          instantaneous in nature, as is the  case
          when  either the telephone or  telex  is
          used.    In   such  cases  the   general
          principle  relating to the formation  of
          contracts remains applicable,  with  the
          result  that the contract is made  where
          and  when  the  telex of  acceptance  is
          received by the offeror.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[25]         In my view, this analysis is equally applicable
to  facsimile  transmissions, another form of  instantaneous
communication.   Indeed,  there is  at  least  one  Canadian
authority that has reached this conclusion.  In Joan  Balcom
Sales  Inc. v. Poirier (1991), 49 C.P.C. (2d) 180 (N.S.  Co.
Ct.),  an  acceptance  of a real estate  listing  offer  was
communicated  by  two vendors in Ottawa  to  a  real  estate
company  in Berwick, Nova Scotia.  The mode of communication
was  a  facsimile transmission.  The vendors&#146;  position  was
that the contract was formed in Ottawa; they argued that the
&#147;mailbox  doctrine&#148;  should be applied to  communication  by
facsimile transmission.</pre>
    <pre>[26]         Haliburton  Co.  Ct.  J.  did  not  accept  the
vendors&#146; argument.  He reviewed the English academic writing
about the postal acceptance exception to the general rule of
contract formation.  He then concluded, at p. 187:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  writers then discuss the  practical
          need  of special rules to be applied  to
          contracts  entered into by post  in  the
          age when post was the primary method  of
          commercial      communication.       The
          considerations  which  made  it   highly
          practical,  if  not imperative,  in  the
          interests  of commerce, for the  offeree
          to  have  knowledge in a timely  fashion
          that he had a firm contract do not apply
          to    facsimile   transmissions.     The
          communication  is  instantaneous.    The
          offeree   could  easily  have  confirmed
          within  minutes that they had a  binding
          contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I, therefore, find that the contract was
          executed   at  Berwick.   [Emphasis   in
          original]</pre>
    <pre>[27]         I  agree  with  this  analysis,  and  with  the
analysis  of the law lords in Brinkibon.  I would hold  that
in  contract  law  an  acceptance by facsimile  transmission
should  follow  the general rule of contract formation,  not
the postal acceptance exception.</pre>
    <pre>[28]         I  do  not  say  that this rule  should  be  an
absolute  one; like Lord Wilberforce in his separate  speech
in  Brinkibon, &#147;I think it a sound rule, but not necessarily
a  universal rule.&#148; (p. 42). Lord Wilberforce discussed some
of the factors that might suggest caution about applying the
general rule to telex communications in all cases, including
the  many  variants in such communications and  whether  the
message  was  sent  and received by the  principals  to  the
contemplated contract.  However, he concluded, at p. 42:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  present case is ... the simple case
          of  instantaneous communication  between
          principals, and, in accordance with  the
          general rule, involves that the contract
          (if  any)  was made when and  where  the
          acceptance was received.</pre>
    <pre>[29]         In  my  view, the present appeal is  also  &#147;the
simple case.&#148;  The acceptance was faxed by the principals of
EP  in Ontario to the principals of ACEA in Italy.  There is
nothing  to  suggest  that the communication  between  these
principals  was  not  instantaneous.   Hence,  applying  the
general rule, the contract was formed in Italy.</pre>
    <pre>(b)   The applicable law of the contract</pre>
    <pre>[30]          The   Co-operation  Agreement   contained   no
provision specifying which system of law, Ontario or  Italy,
was to govern issues arising under it.  In such a situation,
a  court must infer which jurisdiction should be the  proper
law of the contract.  In reaching a conclusion on the proper
law,  the  court  will  consider  a  number  of  direct  and
contextual factors.  Many of these factors are contained  in
a  passage in Professor Castel&#146;s book, Canadian Conflict  of
Laws, 4th ed., (1997), at pp. 596-98:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If  there  is no express choice  of  the
          proper  law,  the  court  will  consider
          whether it can ascertain that there  was
          an  implied choice of law by the parties
          ...  [I]f  the  parties agree  that  the
          courts  of a particular unit shall  have
          jurisdiction over the contract, there is
          a  strong inference that the law of that
          legal  unit  is the proper  law.   Other
          factors from which the courts have  been
          prepared to infer the intentions of  the
          parties  as  to the proper law  are  the
          legal  terminology in which the contract
          is  drafted,  the form of the  documents
          involved   in   the   transaction,   the
          currency in which payment is to be made,
          the  use  of  a particular  language,  a
          connection with a preceding transaction,
          the  nature and location of the  subject
          matter  of  the contract, the  residence
          (but  rarely  the  nationality)  of  the
          parties,   the   head   office   of    a
          corporation  party to the  contract,  or
          the  fact that one of the parties  is  a
          government.
</pre>
    <pre>[31]         In my view, the motions judge was alive to  the
full range of factors as he determined the proper law of the
Co-operation Agreement between EP and ACEA.  He made a  full
and careful analysis of the factors (Reasons, p. 10):
         </pre>
    <pre>         In  my  view, the applicable law  of  the
         cooperation  agreement  and   letter   of
         intent  is  Italian.  While there  is  no
         express  choice  of  governing  law,  the
         cooperation agreement provided  that  the
         Italian  version  would  &#147;bear  witness&#148;,
         only  the  Italian version of the  letter
         of  intent  was  executed,  currency  was
         expressed in lira, the subject matter  of
         the  contracts  was  the  building  of  a
         power  plant  near Rome, the project  was
         subject   to   Italian  regulation,   the
         plaintiff  was  to  participate  in   the
         project   through  a  company   organized
         under Italian law, and the defendant  was
         associated  with the municipal government
         of   Rome.  The  plaintiff&#146;s  intent  and
         recognition   that  Italian   law   would
         govern  is  indicated  by  the  fact   it
         regarded  as  finalized the  draft  joint
         venture  agreement  which  provided  that
         Italian  law would govern and the Italian
         courts      would     have      exclusive
         jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[32]         Some of these factors are direct &#150; they involve
an  interpretation  of  the  Co-operation  Agreement.  Other
factors,  including those relating to the Letter  of  Intent
(which  the  parties  signed) and the  draft  Joint  Venture
Agreement (which was never signed) are contextual.  All,  in
my  view,  are relevant.  They point overwhelmingly  to  the
conclusion reached by the motions judge: the proper  law  of
the contract was Italian law.</pre>
    <pre>(c)   Location where the majority of witnesses reside</pre>
    <pre>[33]         The motions judge did not address this  factor.
There  is little in the record on EP&#146;s side to indicate  how
many  witnesses it would call.  In the affidavit of  Gregory
Vogt,  a  director of EP, dated September 2, 1998, there  is
this  brief allusion in paragraph 30: &#147;None of the witnesses
who  would  be  called  to testify on  behalf  of  EP  speak
Italian,   with   the   exception   of   Mr.   De    Vuono.&#148;
Unfortunately, all this establishes is the unsurprising fact
that EP intends to call more than one witness at the trial.</pre>
    <pre>[34]         The  record on ACEA&#146;s side is better.   In  his
supplementary  affidavit dated October  21,  1998,  Vincenzo
Puca, the Head of the Legal Department at ACEA, stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          20.   [T]he persons that ACEA would call to testify in this
             proceeding reside in Italy, and the majority of them do not
             speak English.  Besides the undersigned, the following ACEA
             employees would be probably called to testify as witnesses:
             none of them speaks English fluently, and the services of an
             interpreter would become necessary to receive their
             testimony: Francesco Sperandini, Alfonso Messina, Massimo
             Cortesi, Biagio Eramo and Maria Gemma Pisano.  The testimony
             of some Italian public officials may also be necessary.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[35]         Based  on  the  record,  it  appears  that  the
majority of witnesses reside in Italy.  Having said that, in
a  case  involving two large corporations  and  hundreds  of
millions  of dollars it does not strike me that this  factor
is a particularly important one.
(d)   Location of key witnesses</pre>
    <pre>[36]         Presumably, the key witnesses for EP  would  be
Canadians  and the key witnesses for ACEA would be  Italian.
This factor is neutral.</pre>
    <pre>(e)      The  location where the bulk of the  evidence  will
  come from</pre>
    <pre>[37]         The  motions judge concluded that the  location
where the bulk of the evidence will come from is Italy.   He
offered no reasons for this conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>[38]        In my view, this is a difficult factor to assess
on  the  record  before  the motions  judge.   There  is  no
question that EP performed its part of the contract in  both
Ontario   and  Italy.   ACEA&#146;s  performance  obviously   was
anchored  in  Italy;  however, its representatives  made  at
least one trip to Ontario.  Without knowing the identity  of
the  witnesses  and  something  about  the  evidence  to  be
tendered,  it would be wrong to reach a conclusion  on  this
factor.</pre>
    <pre>(f)   The jurisdiction in which the factual matters arose</pre>
    <pre>[39]         The motions judge did not consider this factor.
EP  argues that it performed some of the development work on
the  power  plant in Toronto.  This preliminary  work  would
have been done, likely in Toronto, even if the Joint Venture
Agreement had been finalized.</pre>
    <pre>[40]         However, the design, construction and operation
of  the  plant  would  have taken place almost  entirely  in
Italy.   The  Letter of Intent required  EP  to  acquire  an
Italian  construction company to undertake the  project.   A
new Italian company, owned 51 percent by ACEA and 49 percent
by  EP,  was  to acquire the construction firm.   The  final
draft  of the Joint Venture Agreement proposed that meetings
of  the  board of directors of the new company were to  take
place  in Rome.  In addition, throughout the two and a  half
year  relationship between EP and ACEA, almost  all  of  the
negotiating sessions for the project took place in Italy; it
appears  that only one meeting, in October 1994, took  place
in Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[41]         Moreover,  a  significant part  of  EP&#146;s  claim
relates  to  the alleged failure of ACEA to secure  a  major
subsidy  for  the project from the Italian  government.   No
part  of  this sequence of events took place in Ontario  and
none  of the persons responsible for the subsidy program  or
ACEA&#146;s  attempt to secure a subsidy has any connection  with
Ontario.   EP  had nothing to do with that  portion  of  the
project.</pre>
    <pre>[42]         For these reasons, I conclude that this  factor
tells  in  favour  of  Italy as the  proper  forum  for  the
litigation between the parties.</pre>
    <pre>(g)     The residence or place of business of the parties</pre>
    <pre>[43]         EP&#146;s  place of business is Ontario;  ACEA&#146;s  is
Italy.  This is a neutral factor.</pre>
    <pre>(h)   Loss of juridical advantage</pre>
    <pre>[44]        A substantial portion of EP&#146;s claim against ACEA
is  for  damages for alleged loss of profits.  These damages
flow,  asserts EP, from ACEA&#146;s breach of contract  and  from
its negligence.  EP asserts that Italian law does not permit
a  claim for loss of profits.  This is, EP concludes, a huge
juridical disadvantage.</pre>
    <pre>[45]        Accepting, arguendo, the truth of EP&#146;s assertion
that Italian law does not permit a claim for loss of profits
does  not,  in my view, assist EP.  The proper  law  of  the
contract between the parties is, as discussed above, Italian
law.  If the action is heard in a court in Ontario the court
will  have  to apply Italian law, including the Italian  law
with respect to damages flowing from breach of contract.</pre>
    <pre>[46]         EP&#146;s  tort  claim suffers the  same  fate.   In
Tolofsen  v.  Jensen, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, a  case  dealing
with  conflict  of  laws principles in a  tort  context,  La
Forest J. said, at pp. 1049-1050:
          </pre>
    <pre>          From  the general principle that a  state
          has exclusive jurisdiction within its own
          territories  and that other  states  must
          under  principles of comity  respect  the
          exercise  of its jurisdiction within  its
          own  territory, it seems axiomatic to  me
          that, at least as a general rule, the law
          to  be applied in torts is the law of the
          place  where the activity occurred, i.e.,
          the  lex loci delicti ...  In short,  the
          wrong  is governed by that law. It is  in
          that  law  that we must seek its defining
          character;  it  is that  law,  too,  that
          defines its legal consequences. [Emphasis
          added]
 </pre>
    <pre>[47]         In  paragraph 31 of its Statement of Claim,  EP
sets out the conduct which it alleges constituted negligence
on the part of ACEA.  All of the impugned conduct relates to
ACEA&#146;s  efforts, or lack thereof, in relation to the Italian
government&#146;s  subsidy  program  and  ACEA&#146;s  position   with
respect  to  the negotiation and finalization of  the  Joint
Venture  Agreement.   ACEA&#146;s activities  in  both  of  these
domains took place in Italy.</pre>
    <pre>[48]          EP makes one other argument, a procedural one,
on  the  juridical advantage point. It is that  Italian  law
does  not  permit  a jury trial, whereas  a  jury  trial  is
possible if this action proceeds in Ontario.  I must confess
my  surprise that EP would advance this argument; it did not
file a jury notice when it served its Statement of Claim and
it has not done so in the 20 months since then.</pre>
    <pre>[49]        For these reasons, I would conclude, as did  the
motions  judge,  that EP will suffer no juridical  loss,  in
contract  law,  tort law or procedure, if its  dispute  with
ACEA is resolved by the Italian courts.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[50]         Of  the  eight factors I have considered,  five
tell  in  favour  of ACEA.  Four of the five  strike  me  as
particularly  important  factors &#150; the  location  where  the
contract   was   formed,  the  law  of  the  contract,   the
jurisdiction in which factual matters arose, and the absence
of  a  loss of juridical advantage for EP.  The other  three
factors  are  neutral.   No factors  favour  EP&#146;s  position.
Accordingly,  the  motions judge was correct  to  stay  EP&#146;s
action in Ontario on forum non conveniens grounds.</pre>
    <pre>[51]        In light of this conclusion, it is not necessary
to  consider  the motions judge&#146;s second basis  for  staying
EP&#146;s  action in Ontario, namely that EP could not serve  its
statement  of  claim on ACEA  ex juris in Italy  because  EP
could not bring itself within rule 17.02(h) of the Rules  of
Civil Procedure which requires that the plaintiff&#146;s claim be
&#147;in  respect of damage sustained in Ontario.&#148;  If, as I have
concluded, EP&#146;s action cannot be brought in Ontario, then it
is  irrelevant how EP effected service of its  statement  of
claim.</pre>
    <pre>(2)    Costs</pre>
    <pre>[52]        In supplementary reasons dated February 9, 1999,
the motions judge fixed costs of the motion payable by EP to
ACEA  at  $44,000.  EP does not object to the fact that  the
motions  judge  fixed costs; it appears  that  both  parties
agreed to this format.  EP does object to the $44,000 amount
of  the  award,  which it characterizes  in  its  factum  as
&#147;grossly excessive&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[53]         A trial or motions judge has a large discretion
as  to costs: see Murano v. Bank of Montreal (1998), 41 O.R.
(3d) 222 (C.A.).  The motions judge in the case under appeal
was  familiar  with  the  issues and he  received  extensive
submissions  on  costs.   In his supplementary  reasons,  he
described the motion as &#147;a moderately complex matter  in  an
action in which some $163,000,000 was claimed.&#148;  (p. 2).  He
also   characterized  the  motion  as  &#147;a  matter  of  great
importance  to  the  parties and  counsel  for  both  sides,
justifiably, devoted time to it.&#148; (p. 2).</pre>
    <pre>[54]         Both  parties  submitted  bills  of  cost   and
supporting  affidavits  and dockets to  the  motions  judge.
ACEA  asked  for  a costs order of $50,014.50  inclusive  of
disbursements and GST.</pre>
    <pre>[55]         In  my view, there is nothing to indicate  that
the  motions judge did not properly consider the submissions
made  by the parties or the factors in rule 57.01.  Although
his  costs  award was a substantial one, he did  not  simply
rubber stamp ACEA&#146;s request.  Accordingly, in my view  there
is  no  basis on which this court should interfere with  the
motions  judge&#146;s discretion in ordering EP to pay  costs  of
$44,000 inclusive of disbursements and costs.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition

[56]     I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

    <pre>_______________________________
1   Amchem  was a case dealing with what is called an  anti-
suit injunction, not a motion to stay an action on the basis
of  forum  non conveniens.  The difference between  the  two
types of proceeding was set out clearly in Amchem by Sopinka
J., at pp. 912-13:</pre>
    <pre>          The  courts have developed two forms  of
          remedy to control the choice of forum by
          the   parties.   The  first   and   more
          conventional  device  is   a   stay   of
          proceedings.  This enables the court  of
          the forum selected by the plaintiff (the
          domestic  forum) to stay the  action  at
          the   request   of  the   defendant   if
          persuaded that the case should be  tried
          elsewhere.  The second is the  anti-suit
          injunction,  a  more aggressive  remedy,
          which  may  be  granted by the  domestic
          court  at the request of a defendant  or
          defendants,  actual or potential,  in  a
          foreign  suit.   In the usual  situation
          the  plaintiff  in  the  domestic  court
          moves  to  restrain  the  defendant   or
          defendants  from launching or continuing
          a  proceeding in the courts  of  another
          jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>    In spite of the factual difference between the two types
of  proceeding,  there is substantial  overlap  in  the  law
relating  to them.  In particular, central to both  remedies
is  a careful consideration of a range of factors, including
the  place where the parties carry on business, the  law  of
the  transaction  and  the  notion of  juridical  advantage.
Moreover,  it is clear that in Amchem the Supreme Court  was
trying    to    articulate   jurisprudence   for   anti-suit
injunctions that would be consistent with the case  law  for
motions  for  stays on forum non conveniens grounds.   Thus,
when  commencing his formulation of the test for the  former
(&#147;the  closest  connection with the  action  and  parties&#148;),
Sopinka J. stated, at p. 931:</pre>
    <pre>          
          I  would modify this slightly to conform
          with  the  test relating  to  forum  non
          conveniens.  Under that test  the  court
          must  determine whether there is another
          forum that is clearly more appropriate.
          
</pre>
    <pre>    It  follows,  in my view, that Amchem is  an  important
authority,  not  only  in anti-suit injunction  cases,  but
also in cases, such as this appeal, where the context is  a
motion for a stay on forum non conveniens grounds.</pre></td>
