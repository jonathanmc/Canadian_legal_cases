    <pre>               James A. Skinner, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 17, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Rivard J. dated September 14, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  a  motion for summary judgment, Petro Partners obtained
judgment  against Eastside Management 94 Inc., 220 Eglinton  East
Limited  and 2551 Lakeshore Limited in the amount of $101,909.46,
together with prejudgment interest and costs.
[2]  The motion for summary judgment was made in the context of a
referral by Master Cork to the motions judge.  The motions judge
had jurisdiction to deal with the motion for summary judgment.
[3]  The appellants&#146; submission is that the motions judge could
not give judgment against Eastside Management 94 Inc. (&#147;Eastside
94&#148;) because the contract was made with Eastside Management (&#147;old
Eastside&#148;). The appellants&#146; submission is based, in part, on the
alleged inadequacy of the pleadings in the statement of claim.
We are of the opinion that the statement of claim as amended is
not deficient.
[4]  The appellants submit that the motions judge found that a
new contract was formed with Eastside 94 and not that Eastside 94
assumed the contractual obligations of old Eastside. He relies on
the motions judge&#146;s statement:</pre>
    <pre>          I  am  satisfied that Eastside 94 did by  its
          conduct, contract with the plaintiffs to  pay
          for the fuel oil delivered.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Either  way, we are satisfied that, viewed in context,  the
conclusion  of the motions judge was that Eastside 94 was  liable
on  the contract.  In our opinion, the motions judge did not  err
in  his conclusion that there was no genuine issue for trial with
respect to the liability of Eastside 94.
[6]  With respect to damages, the motions judge found there was
no real issue as to the amount claimed and we concur.
[7]  The motions judge held that Eastside 94 was acting as agent
for the owners of 220 Eglinton East Limited and 2551 Lakeshore
Limited and that this was admitted in the statement of defence.
He also found that Petro Partners was entitled to judgment
against 220 Eglinton East Limited and 2551 Lakeshore Limited.
[8]  The general rule of liability where, as here, there is a
disclosed principal-agent relationship is that only the principal
is liable on the contract.  If, however, the parties expressly
intend, or it may be inferred that the agent should be solely
liable on the contract, the general rule will not apply:  Lang
Transport v. Plus Factor International Trucking Ltd. et al.
(1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 1 at 11(C.A.). All of the evidence here
points to the agent being solely liable on the contract.
[9]  The appeal is dismissed as against Eastside Management 94
Inc.  However, for the reasons stated, the appeal is allowed with
respect to 220 Eglinton East Limited and 2551 Lakeshore Limited
and the judgment against them is set aside. In the circumstances,
the respondent will have the costs of the appeal.
