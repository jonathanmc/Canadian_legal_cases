    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Zuber J. dated December 4, 1997</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The position of Minister of the Crown in Canadian government
today  is  a  complex, difficult and, I suspect, exhausting  one.
There are political, legislative and executive components to  the
position and a Minister is often engaged in the exercise of these
components  on  local,  national and even  international  stages.
Almost  every  day  most Ministers make a  myriad  of  decisions.
Those  decisions  affect not only Canadian public  policy;  often
they have a direct impact on individuals as well.
[2]  In many domains, statutes require Ministers of the Crown to
make decisions.  An important question which occasionally arises
is: must the Minister make a particular decision himself or
herself, or can the decision be made by someone authorized by the
Minister?  That is the question which arises in this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant, Dorothy Edgar, is 70 years old and resides in
the  United States.  From 1976 to 1979 she worked as an executive
secretary  for Edward Engel (&#147;Engel&#148;), who was the vice-president
of finance at Amway Corporation (&#147;Amway&#148;).
[4]  In 1977, while Engel was employed at Amway in the United
States, he discovered that Amway and its Canadian subsidiary,
Amway of Canada Limited, were defrauding Canadian customs
authorities through an elaborate system of dummy invoices and
books.  The fraud was extensive, incriminating the highest ranks
of the corporation.  Through its fraudulent representations,
Amway gained and the Government of Canada lost many millions of
dollars.
[5]  In January 1979, Engel resigned from Amway and Edgar left at
the same time.  In April 1979 Canadian customs authorities became
aware of fraudulent activity at Amway.  Dwight St. Louis (&#147;St.
Louis&#148;), the Regional Manager of Customs Investigations in the
London region, telephoned Engel and asked him to help with the
investigation of the Amway fraud.  Engel refused.  St. Louis then
contacted Edgar who agreed to meet him.  At the meeting Edgar
provided St. Louis with crucial documents.  For example, Edgar
gave St. Louis a copy of a memorandum to Amway&#146;s chairman of the
board that outlined the fraudulent scheme and contained the
chairman&#146;s handwritten comments, thereby evidencing his knowledge
of, and complicity in, the fraudulent practices.  Later, in an
internal memorandum to the Minister of National Revenue, a senior
departmental official underlined the significance of the
documents provided by Edgar by saying that they &#147;revealed the
modus operandi employed to perpetrate the fraud.&#148;
[6]  The RCMP eventually became involved and gained access to the
documents that had been provided to Canada Customs.  Both Engel
and Edgar co-operated with the RCMP in the criminal prosecution
of Amway and its Canadian subsidiary.  On November 10, 1983 the
two companies pleaded guilty to the criminal charges and were
fined $25,000,000. For her assistance, Edgar was paid $31,000 by
the RCMP.  She in turn signed a release discharging the RCMP from
any further obligation to her.
[7]  Soon thereafter, the Ministry of National Revenue launched a
civil action against the Amway companies.  The Ministry asked
Engel to co-operate in the preparation of its case and to stand
ready to testify if requested.  Engel agreed and signed a formal
contract with the Ministry.  He ultimately received $320,000 for
his assistance.  The Ministry did not ask Edgar to provide any
assistance in the civil suit.
[8]  In September 1989 the Amway companies settled the civil
action for $45,000,000.   The &#147;net proceeds&#148; (the settlement
monies minus administrative costs and duties and taxes payable)
the government actually received were $16,184,294.
[9]  At all material times, regulations under the Customs Act and
the Excise Act authorized the payment of an award to an
individual who &#147;contributed substantially to the detection of a
violation of the customs laws or the Excise Act.&#148;  For purposes
of this appeal, the relevant portions of the Customs and Excise
Award Payment Regulations, C.R.C., C. 457 (1978), were:
</pre>
    <pre>             2. In these Regulations,
         </pre>
    <pre>                  &#147;Minister&#148;  means the  Minister
                  of National Revenue; &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>             3.(1) Subject to these Regulations, where
                </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  it is shown to the satisfaction
	            of the Minister that information
	            or other aid received from any person
		    has contributed substantially to the
                    detection of a violation of the
                    customs laws or the Excise Act,
                    and
             </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  in the opinion of the Minister an award
                    is merited,
                    </pre>
    <pre>               the  Minister  may,  in  his  sole
               discretion, authorize  payment  of
               an  award  in  an amount  that  he
               considers appropriate.
                 </pre>
    <pre>                (2) A decision of the Minister pursuant to
		    subsection (1) authorizing the payment
		    of an award in an amount or rejecting a
                    recommendation for the payment of an award
		    is final.
                 </pre>
    <pre>             4. (1) Where a seizure, forfeiture or
                    penalty has been effected  or
                    imposed  and  there  are  net
                    proceeds,  an  award  may  be
                    paid  in respect of such  net
                    proceeds  in an amount  equal
                    to &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>                (C)  $2,000 plus 10 percent of the
		     amount by which the net
                     proceeds exceed $10,000 if the
	             net proceeds exceed $10,000.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  On  December  31, 1986, within weeks  of  Engel  requesting
payment  for  his assistance in the civil action,  Edgar  made  a
written request for &#147;the maximum award&#148;.   She did so in a letter
to  Edward  Sojonky, Q.C., senior counsel in  the  Department  of
Justice.   Her  request was supported by St. Louis,  the  customs
investigator  she  had met and to whom she had  given  the  vital
Amway  documents.  Indeed, on July 9, 1980, more than  six  years
before   Edgar   requested  an  award,  St.  Louis   prepared   a
confidential  Investigator&#146;s Report for senior officials  in  the
Ministry  in which he said this about Edgar and her role  in  the
Amway matter:</pre>
    <pre>                25.  A confidential informant  has
                been   instrumental  in  providing
                information or advising  where  it
                could be obtained, assisting  this
                department   and   the   RCMP   to
                prepare  the  civil  and  criminal
                cases  respectively.  In so doing,
                this  person has suffered personal
                harassment  and in  light  of  the
                scope   of   this  fraud   it   is
                recommended   that   the   maximum
                Informant&#146;s Award be considered.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Edgar&#146;s request for an award was referred to James Johnston,
the  Director  of  Investigations in the Department  of  Customs.
Johnston  concluded  that Edgar was merely a conduit  for  Engel;
accordingly, he advised her that she would not receive  an  award
separate from the one granted to Engel.
[12] Edgar pursued her claim within the Ministry.  Eventually, it
arrived on the desk of Ruth Hubbard, the Deputy Minister.
Hubbard met with Effie Triantafilopoulos, a lawyer acting on
behalf of Edgar&#146;s solicitor.  No decision regarding Edgar&#146;s claim
was made at this meeting.  Hubbard met with Triantafilopoulos
again in April 1990.  Either at that meeting or shortly
thereafter by telephone, Hubbard advised Triantafilopoulos that
Edgar&#146;s claim would not be paid, although a reconsideration was
possible if additional information was presented to the Ministry.
[13] In 1993, Edgar commenced an action against the Ministry.
She claimed damages under four headings &#150; (1) breach of contract,
on the basis that St. Louis, on behalf of the Ministry, had
promised her an award; (2) breach of warranty of authority by St.
Louis; (3) negligence, in that personnel within the Ministry
failed to bring St. Louis&#146; recommendation to the Minister&#146;s
attention for his decision; and (4) quantum meruit, because the
Crown had received the full benefit of Edgar&#146;s work product for
which she was not fairly compensated.
[14] The trial of the action took place before Zuber J. on
November 24, 25 and 27 and December 1 and 2, 1997.  On December
4, 1997 Zuber J. rendered his decision,  dismissing all of
Edgar&#146;s claims.  He held that there was no evidence of a specific
offer and acceptance; hence there was no contract.  Moreover, he
held that St. Louis had no actual or ostensible authority to
commit the Ministry to an award, so there would be no  breach of
warranty of authority. On the negligence issue, he held that the
Ministry was not negligent in failing to refer the matter to the
Minister for his decision.  His reason for this conclusion was
that the Deputy Minister, Ruth Hubbard, made the decision and
that this was permitted by section 24(2)(c) of the federal
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I &#150; 21, which provides that &#147;a
Minister of the Crown&#148; includes &#147; his &#133; deputy&#148;.  Finally, Zuber
J. dismissed the quantum meruit claim on the basis that the
Ministry was not unjustly enriched at Edgar&#146;s expense since in
its civil suit against Amway it had merely recovered what was
lawfully owing to it.
[15] Although he dismissed all of Edgar&#146;s claims, Zuber J. did
direct his mind to the question of damages.  He stated that if
the quantum meruit claim had succeeded, an award of $200,000
would have been appropriate.  He also indicated that if the
negligence claim had succeeded, he would have assessed damages
for Edgar&#146;s lost opportunity to obtain a decision from the
Minister at $25,000.
[16] On the issue of costs, Zuber J. did not order Edgar to pay
the Ministry&#146;s costs because &#147;she could have been treated a
little better by the Ministry than she has been&#148; (Reasons, at p.
22).  However, he did not accept Edgar&#146;s argument that the
Ministry should pay her costs of the action because this was not
&#147;one of those rare cases in which the loser should receive costs&#148;
(Reasons, at p. 24).
[17] Edgar appeals Zuber J.&#146;s judgment.  She does not challenge
his conclusions on the breach of contract or breach of warranty
of authority issues.  However, she maintains that Zuber J. erred
in not allowing her to recover damages based on the negligence of
the Ministry and on the equitable doctrine of quantum meruit.
She also appeals the trial judge&#146;s decision not to award her the
costs of the action even though she was the losing party.

</pre>
    <pre>B.   Legal Issues</pre>
    <pre>[18] The issues which must be addressed on this appeal are:
</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Did  the  trial  judge err in finding that s.  3(1)  of  the
     Customs and Excise Award Payment Regulations did not require the
     Minister  himself to authorize or refuse a  payment  to  the
     appellant?</pre>
    <pre>(2)  If  the  answer  to  Question  (1)  is  Yes&#148;,  what  is  the
     consequence of the Minister&#146;s failure to make a decision with
     respect to a possible award to the appellant?</pre>
    <pre>(3)  Did the trial judge err in refusing to award Edgar her costs
     of the action?
</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis</pre>
    <pre>(1) Who was required to make the decision?</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Edgar  dealt with several people within the  Government  of
Canada  in  her attempt to obtain an award for her assistance  in
the  Amway  matter.  She received $31,000 from the RCMP  for  her
assistance  in the criminal case, so obviously she  had  dealings
with  personnel in that institution.   With respect to the  civil
action, Edgar had discussions with St. Louis, an employee of  the
Ministry of National Revenue, about an award.  She made her first
formal request for an award in a letter to Edward Sojonky,  Q.C.,
senior  counsel  in the Department of Justice.  Her  request  was
referred  to, and considered by, James Johnston, the Director  of
Investigations  in  the Department of Customs;  he  rejected  her
claim.   However, Edgar pursued her claim higher in the Ministry.
Ultimately,  the Deputy Minister, Ruth Hubbard, met on  at  least
two  occasions  with  an  agent for Edgar&#146;s  solicitor;  she  too
rejected Edgar&#146;s claim.
[20] It is obvious that several people within the Government of
Canada were involved in the consideration of whether Edgar should
receive an award.  The trial judge concluded that the final
decision was made by the Deputy Minister, Ruth Hubbard.  In my
view, he was correct.
[21] The question which arises from this conclusion is: could the
Deputy Minister make the decision concerning an award to Edgar?
Or was this decision one that had to be made by the Minister
personally?
[22] The starting point for analysis on this central issue is s.
3(1) of the Customs and Excise Award Payment Regulations which,
for ease of reference, I set out again:</pre>
    <pre>          
          3.(1)  Subject to these Regulations, where

            (a)  it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister that
                 information or other aid received from any person has
	         contributed substantially to the detection of a 
 	         violation of the customs laws or the Excise Act, and</pre>
    <pre>           (b)  in the opinion of the Minister an award is merited,</pre>
    <pre>           the   Minister   may,   in   his   sole
           discretion,  authorize  payment  of  an
           award  in  an amount that he  considers
           appropriate. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[23]  Edgar  contends  that the words &#147;in  his  sole  discretion&#148;
require  the  Minister to make decisions about awards personally.
The  Ministry&#146;s position is that the Minister&#146;s decision in  this
domain,  as in most domains, is one that can be properly made  by
the deputy minister.
[24] There is in public law a principle known as &#147;the Carltona
principle&#148;.  It takes its name from the famous decision of the
English Court of Appeal in Carltona, Ltd. v. Commissioners of
Works, [1943] 2 All E.R. 560 (C.A.), a wartime case dealing with
the requisition by the government of a factory that manufactured
food products. Carltona stands for the proposition that decisions
entrusted by statute to a Minister of the Crown can also be made
by the Minister&#146;s representatives or officials if properly
authorized to do so.  The reason for this is that in modern
government there are simply so many decisions to be made that the
wheels of government would grind to a halt if they all had to be
made by the Minister personally.  As expressed by Lord Greene,
M.R., at p. 563:</pre>
    <pre>          In  the administration of government  in
          this  country  the functions  which  are
          given to ministers (and constitutionally
          properly given to ministers because they
          are  constitutionally  responsible)  are
          functions   so  multifarious   that   no
          minister could ever personally attend to
          them.   To  take  the  example  of   the
          present  case no doubt there  have  been
          thousands   of  requisitions   in   this
          country  by  individual ministries.   It
          cannot  be supposed that this regulation
          meant  that, in each case, the  minister
          in  person should direct his mind to the
          matter.    The   duties   imposed   upon
          ministers  and  the  powers   given   to
          ministers  are normally exercised  under
          the   authority  of  the  ministers   by
          responsible officials of the department.
          Public business could not be carried  on
          if    that    were   not    the    case.
          Constitutionally, the decision  of  such
          an  official is, of course, the decision
          of   the  minister.   The  minister   is
          responsible.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  In  Canada,  the Carltona principle has  been  affirmed  by
statute and in the case law.  At the federal level, the statutory
affirmation is found in s. 24(2) of the Interpretation Act  which
provides:
</pre>
    <pre>          24(2)  Words  directing or empowering  a
          minister  of the Crown to do an  act  or
          thing, regardless of whether the act  or
          thing is administrative, legislative  or
          judicial, or otherwise applying to  that
          minister  as  the holder of the  office,
          include &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>            (c)  his or their deputy</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The  leading case affirming the Carltona principle  in  the
context  of Canadian government is Regina v. Harrison,  [1977]  1
S.C.R. 238.  In that case, Dickson J. stated, at pp. 245-46:</pre>
    <pre>          [W]here  the exercise of a discretionary
          power is entrusted to a Minister of  the
          Crown  it may be presumed that the  acts
          will  be  performed, not by the Minister
          in  person, but by responsible officials
          in  his  department: Carltona,  Ltd.  v.
          Commissioners of Works.  The tasks of  a
          Minister  of  the Crown in modern  times
          are  so  many  and  varied  that  it  is
          unreasonable  to  expect  them   to   be
          performed  personally.   It  is  to   be
          supposed  that the Minister will  select
          deputies  and departmental officials  of
          experience and competence, and that such
          appointees,   for  whose   conduct   the
          Minister   is   accountable    to    the
          Legislature, will act on behalf  of  the
          Minister,  within the  bounds  of  their
          respective grants of authority,  in  the
          discharge         of         ministerial
          responsibilities.   Any  other  approach
          would  but lead to administrative  chaos
          and inefficiency.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Neither s. 24(2) of the Interpretation Act nor the case  law
establishes the Carltona principle as an absolute rule.  Thus, s.
3(1) of the Interpretation Act potentially qualifies s. 24(2):</pre>
    <pre>   3.   (1) Every provision of this Act applies, unless a contrary
        intention appears, to every enactment, whether enacted before or
        after the commencement of this Act.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28]   With  respect  to  the  case  law,  the  leading  Canadian
authorities  establish that several factors  must  be  considered
before determining whether the general maxim delegatus non potest
delegare, or the Carltona exception to this maxim, applies  in  a
particular  situation.  In Harrison, supra, Dickson J. identified
those  factors as &#147;the language, scope or object of a  particular
administrative  scheme&#148; (at p. 245).  In Ramawad v.  Minister  of
Manpower  and Immigration, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 375 at 381, Pratte  J.
said:</pre>
    <pre>          In  R.  v. Harrison, my brother Dickson,
          speaking for the court said, at p.  245,
          that  &#147;a  power  to  delegate  is  often
          implicit   in  a  scheme  empowering   a
          Minister  to act.&#148;  Whether  such  power
          exists   however  or,  in  other  words,
          whether it may be presumed that the  act
          will  be  performed not by the  Minister
          but   by  responsible  officers  in  his
          Department will depend on the intent  of
          Parliament  as  it may be derived  from,
          amongst other things, the language  used
          in  the  statute as well as the  subject
          matter  of  the discretion entrusted  to
          the Minister. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[29]  With  respect to the language of the statute,  the  pivotal
words in s. 3(1) of the regulation are &#147;the Minister may, in  his
sole  discretion&#148;.  There is no doubt that if s. 3(1) said simply
&#147;the Minister may&#148;, a decision could be made by the Minister  and
by  the Deputy Minister.  Both s. 24(2) of the Interpretation Act
and the case law would support this result.  However, s. 3(1)  of
the   regulation  employs  the  additional  words  &#147;in  his  sole
discretion&#148;.  What do the words mean?
[30] A good starting point is the dictionary. In The New Oxford
Dictionary of English  (1998), the adjective &#145;sole&#146; is defined as
&#147;one and only&#148; or &#147;belonging or restricted to one person or group
of people.&#148;  The adverb &#145;solely&#146; is defined as &#147;not involving
anyone or anything else; only&#148; (at p. 1771).  It seems to me that
these definitions strongly support the appellant&#146;s contention
that the words &#147;in his sole discretion&#148; in s. 3(1) require the
Minister personally to make the decision.
[31] There is also strong case authority supporting the
appellant&#146;s contention.  In Ramawad v. Minister of Manpower and
Immigration, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted the
words &#147;in the opinion of the Minister&#148; in the Immigration Act as
requiring that only the Minister or someone specifically
authorized elsewhere in the statute could make a deportation
order.  It is worth noting that s. 3(1) of the regulation in
issue in the present appeal contains not only the words &#147;in his
sole discretion&#148;; in s. 3(1)(b) there are also the words &#147;in the
opinion of the Minister.&#148;  These latter words are identical to
the words interpreted by the court in Ramawad.
[32] An equally strong case supporting the appellant&#146;s position
is Attorney General (Quebec) v. Carrières Ste-Thérèse Ltée,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 831. In that case a Deputy Minister of Social
Affairs in the Government of Quebec declared that a company&#146;s
asphalt and crushing plants were a public nuisance under the
Public Health Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 161.  One of the bases on
which he purported to act was s. 55 of the Act which provided:
</pre>
    <pre>    55.  The Minister may himself exercise directly the powers vested
         in the municipal authorities by sections 46 to 55, in the cases
         which he deems to be urgent.</pre>
    <pre>[33]  The Attorney General of Quebec supported the order made  by
the  Deputy Minister of Social Affairs.  Before the Supreme Court
of  Canada  he referred to &#147;the general principles of the  common
law, according to which the powers of a Minister of the Crown are
allegedly delegated by implication to a Deputy Minister&#148;  (at  p.
837).
[34] In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court rejected this
submission.  In its per curiam reasons, the court said, at p.
838:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Section 55 provides that, in cases which
          he  deems to be urgent, the Minister may
          exercise  directly the powers vested  in
          the  municipal authorities by ss. 46  to
          55,  but  he  must  then  exercise  them
          himself.
          </pre>
    <pre>          When  questioned at the hearing  on  the
          meaning and scope of the word &#147;himself&#148;,
          counsel for the appellant answered  that
          this was a redundancy.  We cannot agree.
          The legislator does not speak in vain. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          [W]e feel that he can only exercise  the
          emergency powers conferred by s.  55  if
          he  is exercising them himself, that is,
          in  person.   This is the usual  meaning
          and  the  one generally given to  it  by
          dictionaries.</pre>
    <pre>[35]  Turning  to  the  second factor  mentioned  in  Ramawad  v.
Minister of Manpower and Immigration, supra, namely &#147;the  subject
matter  of the discretion entrusted to the Minister&#148;, the subject
matter of s. 3(1) of the regulation is awards to individuals  who
help  the  government recover unpaid customs and  excise  duties.
This is an important matter, but is it one requiring the personal
attention of the Minister?
[36] In my view, it is impossible to answer this question in the
abstract.  In many instances, if an individual&#146;s assistance leads
to the recovery of a small or even modest recovery of unpaid
duties, common sense would suggest that the Minister should not
have to be involved in the award decision.
[37] On the other hand, it is worth recalling s. 4(1)(c) of the
regulations which provides for potential awards of $2,000 plus 10
percent of the amount by which the net proceeds exceed $10,000.
In cases where the government makes a substantial recovery of
unpaid duties, thus giving rise to the possibility of a
substantial award, common sense might suggest that a Minister of
the Crown should make the decision because it involves public
funds.  The present case might fit within this category.  The
government recovered $16,184,294 in &#147;net proceeds&#148; from Amway.
Accordingly, Edgar is eligible for a maximum potential award of
more than $1.6 million.
[38] In the end, however, I do not suggest that s. 3(1) of the
regulation should be interpreted in a variable fashion, requiring
the Minister to make decisions when a large amount of money is at
stake and letting the Deputy Minister make the decisions with
respect to small or modest amounts.  Rather, I conclude that &#147;the
subject matter of the discretion entrusted to the Minister&#148;, the
second factor in Ramawad, supra, is a neutral factor in the
present appeal.
[39] The respondents&#146; argument on this issue is that the
interpretation of s. 3(1) of the regulation as requiring the
Minister to make the decision about an award to Edgar could lead
to an anomalous result.  That is because s. 8(2) of the Excise
Act during the time in question provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>          8(2)   The  Minister may  authorize  the
          Deputy  Minister  to  exercise  on   his
          behalf  any  of the powers conferred  on
          the Minister by this Act.
</pre>
    <pre>[40]  Based on this provision, the respondents make this argument
in their factum:</pre>
    <pre>      
   39.  Given that the Awards Regulations in effect applied to both
        the Customs Act and the Excise Act, if the Carltona principle as
        codified in subsection 24(2) of the Interpretation Act was not
        applied so that the term &#147;Minister&#148; in the Regulations extended
        to include the Deputy Minister, it is respectfully submitted that
        an anomaly would have resulted: claims of individuals who
        detected a violation of the Customs Act would have been entitled
        to consideration by the Minister personally whereas claims
        arising out of the detection of a violation of the Excise Act
        could properly be considered and determined by the Deputy
        Minister.  It is submitted that there was nothing in the Awards
        Regulations or the two statutes themselves which indicated that
        this was intended by Parliament.</pre>
    <pre>[41] My response to this is a simple one.  Although the potential
for  an  anomalous result was present, in fact none was  created.
The  Customs  and  Excise Award Payment Regulations,  promulgated
under both the Customs Act and the Excise Act, authorized, in  s.
3(1),  the  Minister &#147;in his sole discretion&#148; to  make  decisions
concerning awards.  The regulation is silent about a role for the
Deputy  Minister.  Hence the anomaly that might have been created
if the government had acted pursuant to s. 8(2) of the Excise Act
did not arise.
[42] In conclusion, the Interpretation Act provides that
&#147;Minister&#148; includes &#147;his or their deputy&#148; (s. 24(2)).  However,
this is subject to a limitation: &#147;unless a contrary intention
appears&#148; (s. 3(1)).
[43] The leading cases establish that a contrary intention does
appear when Parliament uses language that modifies the basic
words &#147;the Minister may&#148;.  In Ramawad v. Minister of Manpower of
Immigration, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the
words &#147;in the opinion of the Minister&#148; require the Minister
personally (or someone else specifically authorized by the
statute) to make the decision.  Those precise words are also
present in s. 3(1) of the regulation in issue in the present
appeal.  In Attorney General (Quebec) v. Carrières Ste-Thérèse
Ltee, supra, the court held that the word &#147;himself&#148; qualifying
Minister meant &#147;in person&#148;.  It is difficult for me to see any
logical difference between &#147;himself&#148; and &#147;in his sole discretion&#148;
which is the second set of relevant words in s. 3(1).  Both, in
common parlance, suggest exclusivity.
[44] Accordingly, on the first issue my conclusion is that the
trial judge did err in finding that s. 3(1) of the Customs and
Excise Award Payment Regulations did not require the Minister
himself to authorize or refuse a payment to the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  Consequences of Minister&#146;s failure to make a decision
</pre>
    <pre>[45] The appellant contends that the Minister&#146;s failure to make a
decision  about  an  award for Edgar constitutes  negligence.  In
other  words, the government had a duty to ensure that a decision
was  made  by the appropriate person, it breached that duty,  and
Edgar  was  injured through the &#145;lost opportunity&#146; to receive  an
award.
[46] I disagree with these propositions.  Throughout the 1980s
and 1990s it appears that all parties were unaware of the
relevant regulation.  In fact it was repealed in 1986, long after
the facts giving rise to Edgar&#146;s claim arose, but before her
application for an award.  Edgar and the Ministry placed the
matter before various officials in government including,
ultimately, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue.  Edgar
played a full and active role in this process.  She did so
without objection.  In such circumstances, it would be wrong, in
my view, to enunciate an absolute rule to the effect that a
decision unintentionally made by the wrong person in a government
department constitutes negligence.
[47] The appellant also contends that the government was unjustly
enriched by not making an award to Edgar and that, therefore, the
trial judge erred in not compensating her on a quantum meruit
basis.
[48] Again, I disagree.  The problem with this submission is that
it misses the point that an award to Edgar was only a possible
award; it depended on the exercise of the decision-maker&#146;s
discretion.  The Minister, the lawful decision-maker, could have
decided to make no award to Edgar.
[49] At this juncture, the situation is this: Edgar&#146;s legal
claims grounded in breach of contract, breach of warranty of
authority, negligence and unjust enrichment are without
foundation.  However, Edgar has never received what in law she
was entitled to receive &#150; a decision by the Minister concerning
her formal application for an award under the regulations in
force at the relevant time.  In light of this unusual conjunction
of entitlements and non-entitlements, the ultimate question is:
what should be done?
[50] The first option, advanced by the respondents, is to dismiss
the appeal.  This option has the conceptual advantage of
conforming to the way the action was pleaded since Edgar chose to
proceed by way of action rather than by judicial review of the
decision made by Hubbard.
[51] The obvious downside of this option is that a 70-year-old
woman who clearly helped the government 20 years ago and was
involved in negotiations with the government for almost 15 years
and in litigation for six years will have to commence litigation
again.  And what is the probable result of the new litigation
grounded in judicial review?  In light of the analysis in part
(1) of this section, it can be presumed that the result would be
reversal of the Hubbard decision on jurisdictional grounds and a
declaration that the award decision must be made by the Minister.
In short, a straight dismissal of this appeal would be both
unfair and an unnecessary waste of judicial resources.
[52] The second option, flowing from the logic of the appellant&#146;s
quantum meruit claim, is that this court should exercise its
discretion and, based on the record, fix the amount of an award
for Edgar.
[53] The primary attraction of this option is that it brings to
an end a 20-year saga.  Unfortunately, it suffers from several
defects.  First, and dramatically, it is inconsistent with the
conclusion reached on the principal issue in the appeal.  If this
court concludes that the award decision is the Minister&#146;s &#147;in his
sole discretion&#148;, it would be startling to make the decision
ourselves before the Minister has had a chance to exercise his
discretion.
[54] Second, there is an evidentiary problem.  This court has
before it a record in a legal action.  That record may be very
different from the material that would be placed before a
Minister called upon to make a decision in person.
[55] Third, there is a conceptual problem with this option.  The
courts cannot, as a general rule, issue mandatory injunctions
against the Crown.  Yet, if this court were to act &#147;as if it were
a properly informed Minister&#148; it would, in effect, be issuing
just such an order.  The court would be saying that the
Minister&#146;s discretion must be exercised in this way and take into
account these factors and that the government must therefore pay
this amount of public money to this person.  In other words, the
court would be doing indirectly what it could not do directly.
[56] For these reasons, grounded in administrative law and Crown
immunity principles, this option seems to be an unwarranted
interference with the separation of powers between government and
the courts, and especially with the Minister&#146;s jurisdiction to
make an award decision &#147;in his sole discretion.&#148;
[57] The third option, the appellant&#146;s &#145;fallback&#146; submission, is
that the court should simply declare that the Minister must
personally make the decision concerning an award to Edgar.
[58] In my view, this is the best of the three options. Legally,
it is permitted by s. 97 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C.43.  As to whether a declaration should be made in
this case, the parameters for issuing a declaratory order were
stated succinctly by Dickson J. in Solosky v. Canada, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 821 at 832 (quoting from Hudson, &#147;Declaratory Judgments in
Theoretical Cases: The Reality of the Dispute&#148; (1977), 3 Dal. L.
J. 706):
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  declaratory action is discretionary
          and the two factors which will influence
          the   court  in  the  exercise  of   its
          discretion  are  the  utility   of   the
          remedy, if granted, and whether,  if  it
          is  granted it will settle the questions
          at issue between the parties.
</pre>
    <pre>[59]  Both these factors are present in this appeal.  The  remedy
is  both useful and necessary in that it settles conclusively the
crucial  issue  of  who must make a decision  respecting  Edgar&#146;s
claim.   It  informs everyone, including the Minister (who  is  a
party  to  the  action) that, under the Customs and Excise  Award
Payment Regulations, only he can decide the appellant&#146;s claim and
that  he has not in fact done so in the past.  Thus, in my  view,
the   issuance  of  the  declaration  is  logically  and  legally
defensible;  it  strikes a proper balance between the  privileged
position  of  a  Minister of the Crown and the  unusual,  perhaps
exceptional, facts of this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  The costs issue at trial</pre>
    <pre>[60]  The  trial judge held that this was not &#147;one of those  rare
cases  in which the loser should receive costs&#148; (Reasons,  at  p.
24).   Although this issue is moot in light of the disposition  I
propose  for this appeal, I want to record that I agree with  the
trial judge&#146;s analysis on this point.
</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[61]  The  appeal  is  allowed.  It is  declared  that  only  the
Minister  can  make a decision under s. 3(1) of the  Customs  and
Excise  Award  Payment Regulations.  It is further declared  that
the  Minister  has not yet made a decision with  respect  to  the
application  for  an  award submitted by the  appellant,  Dorothy
Edgar.
[62] I add this postscript.  Ms. Edgar is now 70 years old.  Her
activities which were of assistance to the government took place
in 1979 and 1980.  She applied for an award in 1986.  The
Ministry&#146;s decision not to make an award to her was not made
until 1990.  Litigation was commenced in 1993.  The trial
decision was rendered in 1997; the appeal decision is rendered in
November 1999.  This chronology invites the suggestion &#150; I put it
no higher &#150; that steps be taken within the Ministry of National
Revenue to place all of the relevant material before the Minister
so that he, in the midst of a busy schedule and onerous duties,
can exercise &#147;his sole discretion&#148; as expeditiously as possible.
[63] The appellant is entitled to her costs of the appeal and the
trial.
