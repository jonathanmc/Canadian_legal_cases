</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of aggravated assault pursuant
to s.268 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to 14 months
imprisonment.  He appeals both his conviction and sentence.
[2]  During an argument with the complainant, the appellant
picked up and threw a candle and a brass candleholder.  The
candleholder hit the complainant and broke her arm. The candle
became embedded in the wall. The only issue was the intent of the
appellant. The appellant testified that he did not mean to hit
the complainant and that the candleholder accidentally separated
from the candle and hit the complainant.
[3]  The trial judge considered the after-the-fact conduct of the
appellant in concluding that he had intended to injure the
complainant.  There was a significant divergence between the
evidence of the complainant and that of the respondent as to what
happened after she was injured.  The complainant said that the
appellant kicked, choked and threatened her.  There was evidence
of a handprint on the side of her neck.  The appellant said that
he only attempted to restrain the complainant in order to examine
her arm.  The trial judge accepted the complainant&#146;s evidence as
to what happened afterwards.
[4]  With respect to conviction, the appellant submits that the
trial judge erred in limiting the cross-examination of the
complainant and in excluding the evidence proffered by the
defence relating to the complainant&#146;s conduct.  Defence counsel
wished to explore prior separations between the appellant and the
complainant.  In addition, defence counsel submitted that the
complainant attempted, on numerous occasions, to contact the
appellant after the incident. The appellant submits that cross-
examination on these matters was relevant to the complainant&#146;s
credibility.
[5]  The trial judge did hear evidence about prior incidents of
violence within the relationship and the complainant was also
cross-examined regarding contact with the appellant after the
charges were laid.  While the opportunity to cross-examine
witnesses is of fundamental importance to providing a fair trial,
it is not unlimited.  The trial judge was in the best position to
assess the extent to which further cross-examination on the areas
proposed by counsel would have been of assistance to the court
and deference must be given to his conclusion.
[6]  The trial judge stated that the complainant&#146;s credibility
was not in issue. The appellant submits that the credibility of
the complainant was in issue and that further cross-examination
of the complainant as to her prior relationship and her attempts
to contact the appellant after the altercation were important
with respect to her credibility concerning the after-the-fact
conduct.
[7]  In our opinion, evidence of subsequent phone calls and
further exploration of the couple&#146;s relationship were of tenuous
relevance in assessing the complainant&#146;s credibility with respect
to the after-the-fact conduct. The appellant admitted to pushing
the complainant&#146;s neck to the floor even though he was aware that
she did not want him to touch her.  The appellant was not
entitled to examine the complainant&#146;s arm without her consent.
[8]  The trial judge was alive to the contradiction in the
evidence between the complainant and the appellant&#146;s version of
the after-the-fact conduct. In stating that the credibility of
the complainant was not in issue, the trial judge was referring
to the fact that the complainant had not accused the appellant of
intentionally throwing the candleholder at her.
[9]  We think that the trial judge was entitled to rely on his
findings with respect to the after-the-fact conduct in coming to
his conclusion that the appellant had the requisite intent to
commit the offence of aggravated assault.
[10] We did not call upon the Crown to respond to the other
grounds of appeal as we were of the view there was no merit to
them.  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.
[11] With respect to sentence, the sentence imposed by the trial
judge was not outside the appropriate range of sentence for this
type of offence. The appellant submits that the trial judge
should have imposed a conditional sentence.  The trial judge was
of the opinion that the appellant was a danger to the community
because of his personal antecedents and that he, therefore, did
not meet the necessary requirements for a conditional sentence.
In our opinion, he did not err in this regard.  Accordingly,
although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal as to
sentence is dismissed.
