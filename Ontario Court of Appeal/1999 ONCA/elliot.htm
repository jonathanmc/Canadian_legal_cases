    <pre>MORDEN A.C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Four  separate  applications were  heard  together  by  Mr.
Justice Gans on February 10 and 11, 1998 and determined by him in
judgments  dated February 13, 1998.   Each of the four  judgments
has  been appealed to this court.  Before describing each appeal,
I shall set forth the nature of each application and the terms of 
the judgment given in it.  The applications relate to a tax  sale
proceeding  under the Municipal Tax Sales Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.
M.60 (&quot;the Act&quot;) commenced by the City of North York (amalgamated
into  the City of Toronto on January 1, 1998) in August  of  1996
with  respect  to  39 McGlashan Road, a residential  property  in
North  York  registered in the name of Veronica Lynn Elliott.   I
shall now describe each application.</pre>
    <pre>Veronica Elliott's Application</pre>
    <pre>[2]   By  notice of application dated December 17, 1997  Veronica
Lynn Elliott sought against the City of North York:</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  an   interim  and  permanent  injunction
               restraining the respondent from selling,
               transferring, vesting, registering a tax
               deed,   or  dealing  with  ........   39
               McGlashan Road, North York;</pre>
    <pre>                              ...</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  a   Declaration  that  the  pending   or
               completed transaction of the property is
               void or voidable;</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  relief  from forfeiture upon such  terms
               as are considered just;</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  a    mandatory   Order   requiring   the
               Treasurer of the Respondent to  register
               a  Tax  Arrears Cancellation Certificate
               in the prescribed form;</pre>
    <pre>          (f)  an   interim  and  permanent  injunction
               restraining    the    Respondent    from
               initiating,  continuing, maintaining  or
               concluding  any proceedings or  sale  of
               the  Property pursuant to the provisions
               of the Municipal Tax Sales Act; and</pre>
    <pre>          (g)  an   order  cancelling  any  proceedings
               commenced,   continued   or   maintained
               pursuant  to the provisions of  the  Act
               upon  payment of the Cancellation Price,
               as  that term is defined in the Act,  or
               such  other amount as determined by this
               Honourable Court,</pre>
    <pre>together  with  other relief, which is not now material  to  this
appeal.  On January 14, 1998 Spiegel J. made an order adding Lone
Star Realty Limited as a respondent in this application.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Gans J. dismissed this application.  In his judgment he made
orders respecting costs and other matters to which I shall  refer
later.   Veronica  Elliott  appeals from  the  dismissal  of  her
application and from the costs order.</pre>
    <pre>Douglas Elliott's Application</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Douglas  Elliott  is the husband of Veronica  Elliott.   By
notice  of  application  dated  February  3,  1998  he  sought  a
declaration  that  the  pending or  completed  tax  sale  of  the
property  located at 39 McGlashan Road was void or voidable  and,
also,  some  of  the  other relief sought by  Veronica.   In  his
judgment Gans J. added Lone Star Realty Ltd. as a respondent,  on
consent, dismissed the application &quot;insofar as such is necessary,
without  prejudice  to  any  action the  applicant  might  launch
against  the  City of Toronto for damages only, occasioned  as  a
result  of the alleged misrepresentation or claims for legitimate
expectations asserted in the application&quot;, and made a costs order
similar  to  the  one  made in Veronica's  application.   Douglas
appeals from the dismissal of his application and from the  costs
order.</pre>
    <pre>Bettyann Elliott's Application</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Bettyann  Elliott is the mother of Douglas  Elliott  and  a
mortgagee  of the property in question.  By notice of application
dated  February 3, 1998 she sought the same relief as was  sought
by  Douglas  Elliott.  In his judgment Gans J.  added  Lone  Star
Realty  Ltd.  as a respondent, dismissed the application  without
prejudice to an application being commenced against the  City  of
Toronto,  and  ordered  that there be no  costs  as  against  the
applicant.  Bettyann appeals from this decision.</pre>
    <pre>Lone Star's Application</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Lone Star is the purchaser of the property in the tax  sale
proceedings.   By notice of application dated January  19,  1998,
which  is described as a &quot;counter-application&quot; to the application
of  Veronica Elliott, Lone Star sought &quot;a declaration  that  upon
registration of the tax deed the applicant is entitled to  vacant
possession of the premises municipally known as 39 McGlashan Road
...&quot;.   In his judgment, Gans J. ordered that Douglas Elliott  be
added  as a respondent and granted the declaration sought -  that
Lone  Star  be  granted leave to issue a writ  of  possession  in
respect  of the property upon registration of the tax  deed,  and
that  the  respondents pay Lone Star's costs of the  application.
Veronica appeals from this judgment.</pre>
    <pre>Brief Outline of the History of the Tax Sale Proceeding</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Veronica  Elliott purchased the property  in  September  of
1985.  On March 27, 1986 a first mortgage, securing $500,000, was
registered in favour of Bettyann Elliott.  On August 6, 1996  the
City  registered  a tax arrears certificate,  Form  1  under  the
Municipal  Tax  Sales Rules, Regulation 824,  R.R.O.  1990  (&quot;the
Rules&quot;),  certifying that tax arrears in the amount of $23,417.94
were  owing  on December 31, 1995.  It set out that the  property
&quot;will  be  sold by public sale if the cancellation price  is  not
paid within one year&quot;, that is, by  August 6, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[8]   On September 6, 1996, under s. 4(1) of the Act, notices  of
registration  of  tax  arrears  certificate  were  sent  by   the
municipality  by registered mail to Veronica at the property,  to
Douglas at the property, and to Bettyann at 5 Belton Road,  North
York, which was the address for service for Bettyann set forth in
her mortgage registered on the title to the property.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Douglas admitted receiving this notice.  Veronica signed  an
acknowledgement of receipt card with respect to  the  notice  and
three  others which she received at the same time.  She  did  not
read  the notice.  Bettyann did not receive the notice.  She  had
moved from 5 Belton Road in 1989.  The notice to her was returned
to the municipality marked &quot;Return to sender ... unclaimed.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[10]  On  May 23, 1997, under s. 9(1) of the Act, the second  and
final notice was sent by registered mail to Veronica, Douglas and
Bettyann  at the addresses to which the first notices were  sent.
The  second  notice stated that the &quot;land will be advertised  for
public sale unless the cancellation price is paid or an extension
agreement  between the municipality  ... and  the  owner  of  the
land,  is arranged before the 6th day of August, 1997.&quot;  Bettyann
happened to be at the property when the four notices sent  to  it
arrived  and  she  signed acknowledgement of receipt  cards  with
respect  to these notices.  The notice which was sent to Bettyann
at  5  Belton  Road, North York, was returned marked  &quot;Return  to
sender ... moved.  Address unknown.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The  property was advertised for sale in November of  1997.
On  December 10, 1997  789588 Ontario Inc. (trustee for Lone Star
Realty Ltd. and hereafter referred to as &quot;Lone Star&quot;) submitted a
tender.   The  tender opening was on December 10,  1997  and  the
highest  bid was that of Lone Star, at $521,300.  The tender  was
accompanied  by  a  deposit of $108,600.   On  December  11,  the
municipality's Director of Tax Revenue, Margo Brunning, by  faxed
letter  notified Lone Star that its bid was the highest and  that
under  the  legislation  it had 14 days to  pay  the  balance  of
$412,700.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  On December 15, 1997 Lone Star delivered a certified cheque
for  $412,700   to the municipality, together with a  cheque  for
land transfer tax.</pre>
    <pre>[13] On December 16, 1997 the solicitors for Veronica and Douglas
wrote to the municipality to advise that they had just heard that
the property had been sold by way of tax sale, to request certain
information, and to advise that &quot;[o]ur client wishes to  pay  the
arrears or enter into an arrangement satisfactory to you for  the
repayment  of the arrears prior to the registration  of  the  tax
deed.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[14]  On  December  17, 1997 Veronica commenced  her  application
against the City and on the same date Cullity J. granted an order
on  a  motion  made  by  Veronica, without notice  to  the  City,
restraining  the  City  &quot;from  selling,  transferring,   vesting,
registering  a tax deed, or dealing with&quot; the property  and  from
&quot;initiating,   continuing,   maintaining   or   concluding    any
proceedings or sale of the Property pursuant to the provisions of
the Municipal Tax Sales Act&quot;.  The order provided that it was  to
expire on December 24, 1997 unless extended by further order.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  On  December  24, 1997, Wilkins J. extended  the  order  to
January  19,  1998,  on condition that Veronica pay $50,000  into
court.  On January 14, 1998 Spiegel J. made an order adding  Lone
Star  as a respondent in Veronica's application.  On January  16,
1998  Veronica paid the $50,000 into court.  On January 23, 1998,
Mandel J. adjourned the hearing to February 10, 1998 and extended
the  injunction to that date.  (There does not appear  to  be  an
injunction  order  covering the period  between  January  19  and
January 23.)</pre>
    <pre>[16]  I  have,  at the beginning of these reasons, described  the
three other applications -  Lone Star's commenced on January  19,
1998  and those of Douglas and Bettyann commenced on February  3,
1998.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  As  I  have indicated, the hearing of the four applications
took place before Gans J. on February 10 and 11, 1998 and he gave
his oral reasons for judgment covering all of the applications on
February  13,  1998.   Each  of  the  Elliott  applications   was
dismissed and the Lone Star application was granted.</pre>
    <pre>[18]  I shall now deal with each of the four appeals in turn  and
then,  separately,  the Veronica and Douglas costs  appeals.   In
doing so, I shall refer to further facts than those set forth  in
the  brief outline set forth above.  Bettyann's appeal was  dealt
with  at  greater  length during the hearing  and  involves  more
difficult issues than do the others.  I shall deal with it first.
I  set  forth  the most material provisions in  the  Act  in  the
appendix  to these reasons in order to minimize undue  repetition
in these reasons.</pre>
    <pre>Bettyann Elliott's Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[19] This appeal turns, in the main, on the proper interpretation
and  application of s. 12(2) of the Municipal Tax Sales Act which
reads:</pre>
    <pre>          12(2)      Subject to subsection (4)  and  to
          section 13,</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  a  failure  on the part of the treasurer
               to  substantially comply with section  4
               or subsection 9(1); or
          (b)  an error or omission in the registration
               or sale of the land, other than an error
               or omission mentioned in subsection (5),</pre>
    <pre>          renders   the  proceedings  under  this   Act
          voidable.</pre>
    <pre>[20]  Before addressing the specific points raised by the parties
to  this  appeal,  it may be useful to address  some  matters  of
general  context.  One matter is concerned with the  time  within
which  a  person has the right to &quot;redeem&quot; simply on  paying  the
cancellation  price.  I quote the word &quot;redeem&quot; because  it  does
not  appear in the Act but is the word that is commonly used.   I
think  it is clear that there is no such right under the  statute
after the year following the date of the registration of the  tax
arrears certificate under s. 3.</pre>
    <pre>[21]  This does not mean that if s. 12(2) is applicable a  person
with an interest may not successfully challenge sales proceedings
and  thereafter  redeem the property on paying  the  cancellation
price.  It is also not intended to involve the expression  of  an
opinion  on  the discretionary power the treasurer  may  exercise
under s. 12(6).  At this point I should refer to Deverell v.  The
Corporation of the Townships of Anson, Hindon and Minden  (1998),
110  O.A.C.  372 (C.A.).  In this decision a panel of this  court
granted relief to the defaulting taxpayers under s. 12(6) of  the
Act.   It was not clear from the appellants' factum in the appeal
before  us whether Bettyann was seeking relief under s. 12(6)  in
addition  to  relief under s. 12(2).  If she were seeking  relief
under  s.  12(6)  Deverell would, of course,  be  relevant.   The
respondents  submitted  that Deverell was  wrongly  decided.   In
these  circumstances,  a  five-judge  panel  of  the  court   was
constituted to hear the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[22]  On the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Murray made it clear that
the  appellant  was not seeking relief under  s.  12(6)  in  this
appeal.   In fact, she has commenced an application for  judicial
review seeking this relief in the Divisional Court.  Accordingly,
there  is no proper basis for our considering the correctness  of
Deverell.</pre>
    <pre>[23] I am of the view that there is no right to redeem after  the
one-year period simply upon paying the cancellation price because
ss. 3(2), 5(1) and 9(2) make it clear that the cancellation price
may  be  paid within the year but that thereafter the land &quot;shall
be sold&quot;.  The cut-off point is clearly expressed and there is no
reasonable basis for thinking that the right which existed during
the year continues after its expiration.  At this point &quot;the land
shall be offered for public sale&quot; (s. 9(2)).</pre>
    <pre>[24]  It  may be that some municipalities will, in fact, allow  a
redemption  after  one  year.   In her  cross-examination,  Margo
Brunning, who had been the Director of Tax Revenue for  the  City
of  North York for 14 years, said that the City accepted payments
of  tax arrears more than one year after the registration of  the
tax  arrears certificate but only before the advertising  of  the
sale  of  the  property.   The matter is  canvassed  in  Tansley,
&quot;Municipal Tax Sales&quot;, Municipal World (September 1995) 3 at 4:</pre>
    <pre>          Many  municipalities take the path  of  least
          resistance  and  exercise  discretion   under
          subsection  12(6) whenever someone  wants  to
          redeem  the property and a sale has  not  yet
          occurred.   Other municipalities may  take  a
          different  approach and refuse to permit  the
          taxes   to   be  paid  after  the   statutory
          redemption period has expired and forge ahead
          with the tax sale.</pre>
    <pre>          The  most  prudent position is  a  compromise
          between    these    two   strategies.     The
          municipality   should  allow  redemption   by
          anyone  entitled  to do so, even  though  the
          statutory  period for redemption has  passed,
          but  only until advertising has begun.  After
          that  time,  there  is a bidding  process  in
          place,  which  must be completed  in  a  fair
          manner.    Potential  bidders  may   have   a
          legitimate complaint if they have spent  time
          and   money  investigating  a  property   and
          submitting  a  bid, including a 20%  deposit,
          only  to  find  that  the property  has  been
          redeemed  on the date of the auction  or  the
          date when the tenders are opened.</pre>
    <pre>It  appears  that  North York followed the  compromise  position.
Before  concluding on this point, I note that  there  is  a  good
policy  reason why there should be no right after the  expiration
of  the  year.  It is suggested in the quotation set forth above.
The   integrity  of  the  sale  process  would  be  substantially
impaired.  There would be fewer potential purchasers and the bids
could well be lower.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Still  in  the  realm of time restrictions,  the  arguments
before us were in conflict on when tax sales proceedings could be
effectively  challenged  under ss.  12(2)  and  (3).   Lone  Star
submitted  that  the  period comes to an end  when  a  successful
purchaser  is determined under s. 9(3) of the Act.  I agree  with
the  contrary  argument of the appellants and the City  that  the
right to challenge exists up to the registration of the tax  deed
(or notice of vesting).  This view is consistent with the wording
of s. 12(3) which contains the term &quot;before the registration of a
tax  deed  or  notice  of vesting&quot; and s. 13(1)  which  commences
&quot;[s]ubject  to  proof  of fraud, every tax  deed  and  notice  of
vesting,  when  registered, is final, binding and conclusive  and
not  subject  to  challenge  for any  reason  ...&quot;   It  is  also
consistent with the decision in Perry Township Tax Sale No.  92-1
(Re) (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 45 (Gen. Div.).</pre>
    <pre>[26] It will also be useful at this point to deal briefly with  a
municipality's specific obligations respecting the s. 4(1) notice
of  the registration of a tax arrears certificate and the s. 9(1)
final  notice.  The statutory obligation of the treasurer  is  to
&quot;send&quot; these notices.  The obligation does not extend to &quot;giving&quot;
or  &quot;serving&quot; the notices.  In this regard, the Act is  like  the
one  considered in E.J.S. Holdings v. City of Calgary (1982), 139
D.L.R. (3d) 756 (Alta. C.A.) and Ompah Mines Ltd. v. Township  of
Clarendon and Miller (1987), 36 D.L.R. (4th) 560 (Ont. H.Ct.) and
unlike the ones considered in  Gray v. Langley (Township) (1986),
9  B.C.L.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.) and Angled Enterprises Ltd. v.  Quesnel
(City) (1988), 39 M.P.L.R. 170 (B.C.C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Section  11(1) provides for the methods of sending  notice.
One  method  is  to  give the notice by personal  delivery.   The
alternative method is to send it by certified or registered mail.
Section  11(5)  makes it clear that actual receipt  of  a  notice
properly sent is not a legal requirement.</pre>
    <pre>[28]  In this latter regard, Bettyann referred to and placed some
reliance on s. 11(4)(a) which states that a statutory declaration
registered  under s. 4(4) or made under s. 9(2)(c) &quot;is  proof  in
the absence of evidence to the contrary that the notices required
to  be  sent  were  sent to the persons named  in  the  statutory
declaration and received by them&quot;.  Whatever the full meaning and
effect of this provision may be, it does not state that it  is  a
requirement of the Act that the s. 4(1) and s. 9(1) notices to be
legally  effective must be received.  Receipt is not a  necessary
element of the concept of &quot;send to&quot; (ss. 4(1) and 9(1)) and would
be  inconsistent with s. 11(5).  See Bay Colony  Ltd.  v.  Wasaga
Beach  (Town)  (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 637 (C.A.) at 639,  leave  to
appeal to S.C.C. refused, February 12, 1998.  I can envisage that
in  some  circumstances it might be useful to a  municipality  to
submit  that there was, in addition to the sending of the notice,
receipt - and s. 11(4)(a) allows this submission to be made.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  Bettyann  has submitted, quite specifically,  that  she  is
entitled  to relief under s. 12(2)(b) because the fact  that  she
did  not receive the notice is an &quot;error or omission&quot; under  that
clause.  She submits that the error or omission does not have  to
be  that of the treasurer; it can be that of anyone or of no one.
It could be that Bettyann herself, in failing to keep her address
up  to  date in the mortgage, as provided for in s. 42(2) of  the
Registry Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.20, or its counterpart under  the
Land  Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4, committed  an
error or omission of the kind contemplated by this provision.   I
shall  discuss  s.  42(2)  and  its counterpart  under  the  Land
Registration Reform Act in greater detail later in these reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[30]  In  support of this interpretation the appellant relies  on
the  expressio  unius  principle. She  submits  that  because  s.
12(2)(a)  refers to a &quot;failure&quot; on the part of the treasurer  the
words  &quot;error  or omission&quot; in s. 12(2)(b) must be understood  to
mean  something  different from a failure  on  the  part  of  the
treasurer.  With respect, because of other contextual features, I
do  not  think  that this necessarily follows.  I  refer  to  the
exceptions to s. 12(2)(b) provided for in s. 12(5), which clearly
include failures or errors on the part of the treasurer or  those
made  on  the treasurer's behalf.  These exceptions are a  cogent
indication of the scope of the general rule in s. 12(2)(b).</pre>
    <pre>[31]  Bettyann also refers to the following statement of  Riddell
J.A.  in  Re Bayack (1929), 64 O.L.R. 14 (App. Div.) at 19  which
relates to a provision in the Assessment Act R.S.O. 1927, c. 238,
s. 72, relating to a &quot;person complaining of an error or omission&quot;
in the assessment roll:</pre>
    <pre>          I  can find no reason to hold that the errors
          and  omissions  there  referred  to  are  the
          original  errors or omissions of the assessor
          or  anything  for  which he was  responsible;
          there does not seem to be any reason to think
          that  any error or omission, by the fault  of
          any  one  or  of no one, is not  to  be  made
          right.</pre>
    <pre>[32]  The context of the issue in Bayack is quite different  from
that  in the present case.  In Bayack it is clear that the  issue
was, rightly, the objective correctness of the assessment roll  -
with  the  result  that the source of the error or  omission  was
irrelevant.   In  the present case, s. 12(2)(b)  would  not  make
practical sense, and the Act would be unworkable, if the error or
omission  did  not  involve, in some way, a  departure  from  the
requirements of the Act leading to a tax sale.</pre>
    <pre>[33]  The  appellant  also  relies upon  the  statement  of  S.D.
Loukidelis J. in Perry Township Tax Sale No. 92-1, supra,  at  p.
50:</pre>
    <pre>          Subsection  (2)(b)  speaks  of  an  error  or
          omission in the registration or sale  of  the
          land  other than those enumerated in s-s (5).
          That  error or omission is not restricted  to
          an  error or omission by the treasurer alone.
          The  treasurer or another may make the  error
          or  omission which will make the remedies  in
          subsection 12(3) applicable.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  The  meaning  of  this  is  elaborated  upon  in  the  next
paragraph:</pre>
    <pre>          It is clear that the notices were sent to the
          wrong   address.   The  regional   assessment
          office had used the address 630 Euclid Avenue
          as  found  in Box 12 of the transfer,  rather
          than  s. C in the land transfer tax affidavit
          which  is  the  &quot;mailing address  for  future
          Notices  of  Assessment under the  Assessment
          Act   for  property  being  conveyed.&quot;   This
          address  error by the treasurer was  probably
          founded   on   the  error  in  the   regional
          assessment  office, but, nevertheless  having
          been   adopted,  became  the  error  of   the
          treasurer and the applicant municipality.</pre>
    <pre>From this it appears that S.D. Loukidelis J. was of the view that
the  sending of the notices to the wrong address was, ultimately,
an  error on the part of the treasurer.  I do not think  that  he
would  have made this specific point had it not been material  to
his decision.</pre>
    <pre>[35]  For  the purpose of deciding this case it is not  necessary
for  me to determine the full reach of &quot;error or omission&quot; in  s.
12(2)(b).  It is sufficient to say that I do not think  that  the
words  include  something that does not involve a departure  from
the  statutory  requirements relating to a tax  sale  proceeding.
Further, even if an error or omission under s. 12(2)(b) were  not
restricted to an error or omission in which the municipality  was
implicated,  the failure of Bettyann to correct  an  address  for
service  on the registered mortgage is clearly not an  error  &quot;in
the  registration or sale of the land&quot; under the Act.  It  is  no
more  an  error or omission than Veronica's failure to  read  the
notices sent to her, which will be considered in the next part of
these reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  The foregoing argument, based on s. 12(2)(b), was  the  one
advanced by the appellant before Gans J.  It was advanced on  the
assumption,  for  the purposes of argument,  that  the  City  had
complied  with the statutory notice requirements.  In this  court
the  appellant advanced the argument that the treasurer  breached
s.  12(2)(a) in that there was a failure to substantially  comply
with  both  s. 4(1) and s. 9(1).  The submitted failure  was  not
sending  the  notices  to the appellant's solicitors  whose  name
appeared  on the mortgage.  The relevant provision is s. 11(1)(b)
of the Act which reads:</pre>
    <pre>          11  (1)    Any notice required to be sent  to
          any  person  under this Act may be  given  by
          personal delivery or, in the alternative, may
          be sent by certified or registered mail,</pre>
    <pre>                              ....</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  in the case of any person whose interest
               is  registered against the title of  the
               land,  to  the  address  of  the  person
               furnished under section 166 of the  Land
               Titles Act or section 42 of the Registry
               Act  or  where no such address has  been
               furnished,  addressed to  the  solicitor
               whose  name  appears on  the  registered
               instrument by which that person  appears
               to have an interest;</pre>
    <pre>[37]  When Bettyann's mortgage was registered on March 27,  1986,
the  property was under the Registry Act system.  Section  42  of
the  Registry Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.20, since repealed  by  S.O.
1998,  c. 18, Sched. E., s. 230, effective December 18, 1998,  in
so far as it is relevant to this case, reads:</pre>
    <pre>          42     (1)    A  land  registrar  shall   not
          register,</pre>
    <pre>                              ....</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  a mortgage or assignment thereof;</pre>
    <pre>                              ....
          unless  there  is endorsed on the  instrument
          the   address  for  service  of  each  person
          obtaining or claiming an interest  in  or  in
          respect of land under the instrument.</pre>
    <pre>               (2)   An  address  for service  provided
          under   this   section  may  be  changed   by
          registering a notice in the prescribed  form.
          R.S.O. 1980, c. 445, s. 37.</pre>
    <pre>               (3)   Subsections (1)  and  (2)  do  not
          apply  to an instrument affecting land  in  a
          part  of Ontario designated under Part  I  of
          the Land Registration Reform Act.</pre>
    <pre>[38]  No mention was made in the argument before us that s. 42(3)
of  the Registry Act provides that subsections (1) and (2) do not
apply  to  an  instrument affecting land in  a  part  of  Ontario
designated  under  Part  I of the Land Registration  Reform  Act,
R.S.O.  1990,  c. L.4.  All of Ontario is designated:  Regulation
688, R.R.O. 1990, s.1.  At our request, the parties filed written
submissions on the effect of s. 42(3).</pre>
    <pre>[39] The Land Registration Reform Act,  ss. 3(1)(a) and 14(j) and
the  regulation  made under it (Regulation 688, R.R.O.  1990,  s.
2(2)  and  Form  2,  Box 15; s. 9 and Form 8) contain  provisions
which give effect to what is provided for in s. 42 (1) and (2)  -
the   requirement  that  the  registered  mortgage  contain   the
mortgagee's  address  for service and a  provision  enabling  the
mortgagee to change the registered address for service.</pre>
    <pre>[40]  In  these  circumstances, with respect to  land  designated
under  Part  I  of  the Land Registration Reform  Act,  the  only
sensible interpretation of s. 11(1)(b) of the Municipal Tax Sales
Act  is to read it as referring to the substituted provisions  in
the  Land  Registration Reform Act and the regulation made  under
it:  the  Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990,  c.  I.11,  s.  15(b);
Sullivan,  Driedger  on  the Constitution  of  Statutes  3rd  ed.
(1994),  pp.  85-86 and 104-110; and Côté, The Interpretation  of
Legislation  in Canada, 2nd ed. (1991), pp. 326-327.   In  short,
the address for service set forth in Bettyann's mortgage must  be
regarded as the address for service contemplated by s. 11(1)(b).</pre>
    <pre>[41] The section 4(1) notice which was sent by registered mail to
5  Belton  Road, North York, the appellant's address for  service
stated in the mortgage, was returned marked &quot;Return to sender ...
unclaimed.&quot;   The  s. 9(1) notice sent to the  same  address  was
returned marked &quot;Return to sender ... moved.  Address unknown.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[42]  The  issue is whether the City substantially complied  with
the  notice  provisions  in the Act - specifically  s.  12(2)(a).
This  takes  us directly to s. 11(1)(b).  Did the City  send  the
notices to the appellant to the address for service furnished  by
the appellant in her mortgage?  The answer, no doubt, is that  it
did.  Is this substantial compliance?  The appellant submits that
it  is not because the treasurer knew that the appellant was  not
at  5 Belton Road, North York, and that she had not received  the
notices.  The appellant submits that in the circumstances it  was
the treasurer's obligation to send the notices to the appellant's
solicitor, whose name appears on the mortgage.</pre>
    <pre>[43] The issue is one of the interpretation and application of s.
11(1)(b).   Before this task can be satisfactorily performed  the
facts  as  they  appear must be closely examined.  The  treasurer
clearly  cannot  be  faulted at all with  respect  to  the  first
notice.  There is no basis for thinking that the treasurer should
have  sent  this  to the solicitor.  It was sent to  the  address
furnished by Bettyann in the mortgage to her.  Further,  it  does
not  appear  to  me that the return of notice marked  &quot;unclaimed&quot;
necessarily  told  the  treasurer that the appellant  had  moved,
particularly when the stamp form on which &quot;unclaimed&quot; was  marked
had, lower down, &quot;moved address unknown&quot;, which was unmarked.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  In  these circumstances, I do not think that the  treasurer
can  be  faulted  for  sending the s. 9(1)  notice  to  the  same
address.   This  one  was returned marked as  I  have  indicated,
&quot;moved ... address unknown&quot;.  Did these circumstances require the
treasurer  to  take further action to send the  notice,  such  as
sending it to the solicitor?  I do not think so.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  Part  of  the  context in which  this  question  should  be
examined is the form of the mortgage and the legislation relating
to  it.   In Box 15 of the mortgage form the appellant's  address
for  service appeared - 5 Belton Road, North York.  This must  be
taken  to be her statement to anyone examining the document  that
she  could  be served with documents relating to the mortgage  by
sending them to that address.  Further, she was not forever bound
by  that address if she moved from it because, by using Form 8 in
Regulation 688, she could have furnished the land registrar  with
her  new  address.  This was not done in this case.  I would  not
say  that  this  consideration, by itself, should  determine  the
issue  against  the  appellant but it is  a  relevant  factor  in
considering  the  fairness  of the procedure  followed  when  the
treasurer follows the direction of s. 11(1)(b).</pre>
    <pre>[46] In Excelsior Mining Co. v. Lochead (1915), 35 O.L.R. 154 (H.
Ct.  Div.) an action to set aside a sale of the plaintiff's  land
for  taxes  in arrears, the owner had not received  a  notice  to
redeem under the Assessment Act, 1904, 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 165.
It  was noted at p. 159 by Boyd C. that &quot;[t]he sale was completed
without any notice coming home to the plaintiffs as to the  state
of  the arrears and the impending tax-deed&quot;.  He then said on the
same page:</pre>
    <pre>          The machinery of taxation moves; and if a non-
          resident owner does not avail himself of  the
          simple  means  afforded  by  the  statute  of
          lodging  his proper address where all notices
          may be sent by the municipal officers, he can
          only blame himself if disaster ensues.</pre>
    <pre>[47]       As  far as principles of statutory interpretation  are
concerned,  I accept that where a person's interest  in  property
may  be  taken pursuant to statutory provisions relating  to  the
sending  of notice these provisions should be liberally construed
in  favour of the person.  (Gray v. Langley (Township) (1986),  9
B.C.L.R.  (2d) 1 (C.A.) at 29-30) and, the converse, that  strict
compliance  is required of the municipality (Bay Colony  Ltd.  v.
Wasaga Beach (Town) (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 637 (C.A.) at 639).</pre>
    <pre>[48]  How  does  this  approach apply to the  interpretation  and
application of s. 11(1)(b)?  I would say that if it is reasonably
capable  of an interpretation that requires a properly  addressed
s.  9(1) notice which is returned to the treasurer marked &quot;moved&quot;
to  be  re-sent to the solicitor, then this interpretation should
be  adopted.   I  do not think that the wording of  s.  11(1)(b),
particularly  in  the  context of  the  scheme  of  the  Act,  is
reasonably capable of this interpretation.</pre>
    <pre>[49]  The notice is to be sent to the solicitor where no  address
for  service has been furnished.  In the present case an  address
for  service was furnished.  The fact that Bettyann did not  keep
it  current, as she was required to do if she wished  to  receive
notices affecting her interest, does not alter this.  When the s.
9(1)  notice was sent out, the treasurer did not have notice that
she had moved.</pre>
    <pre>[50]  Further, the section 4(1) and 9(1) notices are to  be  sent
within specific time periods.  What if the treasurer cannot  send
the  second,  re-addressed, notice to the  solicitor  within  the
specified  time?   Should this abort the proceeding?   I  do  not
think  so.   The  Act  contains &quot;a carefully crafted  legislative
scheme&quot;  (Zeitel v. Ellscheid, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 142 at 152)  which
is  capable of reasonable implementation in accordance  with  its
expressed  terms.   It  may  well not be  capable  of  reasonable
implementation if unexpressed terms are read into it.  Reading in
of  this  kind  is a method of statutory interpretation  for  the
Municipal Sales Tax Act which has been clearly proscribed by  the
Supreme Court of Canada in Zeitel v. Ellscheid, supra, at p.  152
per Major J.:</pre>
    <pre>          Recognition  of  the  proper  roles  of   the
          legislature  and the judiciary requires  that
          the  courts give effect to the plain  meaning
          of  the words of a duly enacted statute.   It
          is  beyond  the power of a court to interfere
          in  a  carefully  crafted legislative  scheme
          merely  because  it does not approve  of  the
          result  produced by a statute in a particular
          case.</pre>
    <pre>[51]  The  appellant has also submitted, relying upon  Knight  v.
Indian  Head  School Division No. 19, [1990] 1 S.C.R.  653,  that
under  a  general  right  to procedural fairness,  the  treasurer
should  have sent the notices to the solicitor.  It is not  clear
to  me that the doctrine of procedural fairness in administrative
law,  which  involves  the opportunity of  persons  to  influence
administrative decisions affecting their rights, is applicable to
the   situation  in  the  case  before  us  which  involves   the
administration  of  a statutory scheme.  This  is  &quot;a  carefully-
crafted legislative scheme&quot; which, of course, must be interpreted
fairly  in  favour of persons whose rights are  affected  by  it.
However,  as  I  have indicated in the preceding  paragraph,  the
importation of the obligation now suggested, that is, to  re-send
a  s.  9(1)  notice  following  its  return  marked  &quot;moved&quot;,  is
inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</pre>
    <pre>[52]  I  wish to make it clear that I leave open what the  proper
result would be if the treasurer had had clear notice, before the
s.  9(1)  notice  was  to be sent out, that  Bettyann  no  longer
resided at the address for service in the registered mortgage.</pre>
    <pre>Actual Prejudice</pre>
    <pre>[53]  Section  12(2)  of  the Act, according  to  its  terms,  is
&quot;[s]ubject to subsection (4) ...&quot;.  Subsection 4 provides:</pre>
    <pre>          (4)   Proceedings for the sale of land  under
          this  Act are not voidable unless the  person
          complaining of any neglect, error or omission
          establishes  that he or she  suffered  actual
          prejudice  as a result of the neglect,  error
          or omission.</pre>
    <pre>[54]  By  reason  of this provision, even if Bettyann  had  shown
neglect, error or omission under s. 12(2), it would not avail her
unless  she established actual prejudice as a result of it.   The
issue  of Bettyann's actual prejudice was raised by the City  and
Lone  Star but it received comparatively little attention in  the
argument  before  us.  The issue is whether  the  sale  price  is
sufficient to pay the debt owing under the mortgage. If  Bettyann
were to have her mortgage fully paid from the proceeds of sale it
could  not  be  said  she would have suffered  actual  prejudice.
Bettyann's  mortgage is in the face amount of $500,000  plus  12%
per  annum.  The evidence shows, however, that only $300,000  was
advanced  by  Bettyann to Douglas on the mortgage.  The  mortgage
was due in December of 1987.  Nothing has been paid on account of
principal  or  interest.   Accepting  these  facts,  the   amount
advanced and interest to 1997 would total an amount that  clearly
could not be paid by the net sale proceeds of $521,300 minus  tax
arrears  and  related  expenses of  approximately  $50,000.   She
would, accordingly, suffer prejudice.</pre>
    <pre>[55]  Lone  Star has submitted that Bettyann has been  unable  to
produce  contemporaneous or independent evidence of the  advances
which  total  $300,000,  that she did not  know  the  lawyer  who
prepared  the  mortgage,  that she did not  receive  a  reporting
letter,  that  she  was  not aware she even had  a  copy  of  the
mortgage  in  her possession, and that it was her  evidence  that
Douglas  was to repay the loans secured by the mortgage  &quot;if,  as
and when he could&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[56]  Based  on  this,  Lone  Star  has  submitted  that  it   is
speculative   whether  Bettyann  will  suffer  prejudice   as   a
mortgagee.   Because of the evidence that the loans  were  to  be
repaid  on an &quot;if, as and when&quot; basis, Lone Star submits that  it
may  be inferred that the transaction was, fundamentally, one  of
gift.</pre>
    <pre>[57] I think that Bettyann has put forward sufficient evidence to
establish actual prejudice as a result of the tax sale - but  not
as  a  result of any neglect, error or omission which would  make
the  sale  voidable.   Although  the  evidence  is  open  to   an
interpretation along the lines suggested by Lone Star, I think it
is  fair to observe that the prejudice issue was not developed in
detail  or  treated as a major one.  The case was fought,  almost
entirely, on the proper application of s. 12(2).</pre>
    <pre>[58] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Veronica Elliott's Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[59] Veronica raised three issues in her factum.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The proposed sale of the property was not advertised in
          accordance with the requirements of s. 9(2)(d)  of  the
          Act.
     2.   The  City  did not comply with s. 11(1) of  the  Rules,
          which  require  the  Treasurer of the  Municipality  to
          &quot;notify the higher tenderer, by ordinary mail ..., that
          the  tenderer  will  be declared to be  the  successful
          purchaser&quot; if the balance of the amount tendered,  land
          transfer  tax and accumulated taxes are paid within  14
          days.</pre>
    <pre>     3.   The costs order was wrong in more than one respect.</pre>
    <pre>[60]  On the hearing before us, additional issues were raised  on
behalf of Veronica:</pre>
    <pre>     4.   The  City did not follow s. 11(1) in the Rules  in  one
          additional  respect - in that the deposit was  paid  by
          certified cheque and not cash.</pre>
    <pre>     5.   Veronica never knew about the tax arrears and the  sale
          proceedings.   This should entitle her to relief  under
          s. 12(2)(b) of the Act as an &quot;omission&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[61] I address these issues as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  The non-advertising issue was not argued on the hearing
of  the appeal by reason of fresh evidence, which we admitted  at
the  opening  of  the hearing, showing full compliance  with  all
requirements.  Further, in any event, I think that  Gans  J.  was
right  in  proceeding on the basis that the advertising condition
had  been satisfied - in view of the position Veronica's  counsel
(not  Mr.  Murray) adopted before him, a position  that  did  not
challenge  the City's evidence that all procedural pre-conditions
to  the  sale  had  been  met.  The issue  was  first  raised  by
Veronica's counsel during argument.  Gans J. said that  he  would
then  have  granted  leave to the City to file  evidence  of  the
advertisements actually placed had this been requested.
     (2)   Non-compliance with the ordinary mail provision of  s.
11(1)  the  Rules, by reason of the notification of the purchaser
by  fax is not something upon which Veronica may properly rely in
showing  a  s.  12(2)(b) error or omission because, clearly,  she
cannot show that she suffered any prejudice as a result of it, as
required by s. 12(4) of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>     (3)   I  shall  deal  with the costs order  later  in  these
reasons  when  considering  the same point  raised  in  Douglas's
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     (4)   The payment of the deposit by certified cheque was  in
compliance with the Rules.  Section 24 in the Rules provides that
any  payment required by the Rules to be made in cash may be made
by   certified  cheque.   In  any  event,  the  form  of  payment
occasioned no actual prejudice to Veronica.</pre>
    <pre>     (5)   There  is no doubt that the two notices were  properly
sent  to Veronica.  According to her evidence, she chose  not  to
read them, leaving such matters to her husband.  Whatever may  be
the  scope of &quot;error&quot; and &quot;omission&quot; in s. 12(2)(b) it cannot  be
so elastic as to make room for this argument.  Were it otherwise,
the effective operation of the Act would be frustrated.</pre>
    <pre>[62] I would not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Douglas Elliott's Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[63]  Douglas  concedes  that he received  both  of  the  notices
although,  apparently, he did not look at the  second  one  until
some time in December of 1997, when he found it among his papers.
His basic ground of appeal, apart from that relating to the costs
order  against  him,  is that Gans J. erred in  refusing  him  an
adjournment of the hearing of the application.  Related  to  this
ground, he submits that Gans J. erred in not directing the  trial
of  an  issue and in holding that there was no genuine issue  for
trial.  I mention at this point that this latter holding was made
in  the  context  of  considering Douglas's submissions  that  he
should  have the opportunity to file reply affidavit material  in
response to the City's responding material.  The judge held  that
Douglas's  affidavit,  on  its own, did  not  show  that  he  was
entitled to the relief on the basis he sought it - so he did  not
need to consider the City's materials.</pre>
    <pre>[64]   I  am  not  persuaded  that  Gans  J.,  in  refusing   the
adjournment, exercised his discretion on any improper ground that
would  justify or require this court's interference.  He reviewed
the   circumstances  carefully  and  observed  that  Douglas  had
commenced  his  proceeding late - in relation to when  Veronica's
application  would  be  coming  on  for  hearing.   Douglas   had
originally sought to participate in Veronica's application as  an
intervener.  He did not pursue this.  On January 23, 1998 he  was
ordered  to  file  response material to the  City's  material  by
February  5.   He did not do this.  Gans J., in response  to  the
argument that Douglas was out of town on urgent business, thought
that  there  was no good reason why a faxed affidavit  could  not
have been prepared and submitted.</pre>
    <pre>[65]  There is the further point that if the judge were to  grant
the  adjournment  sought  by Douglas,  it  would  not  have  been
effective  to  preserve Douglas's right to the remedy  he  sought
unless  the completion of the tax sale to Lone Star was  enjoined
by  a  further interim injunction, which could have been  granted
only  if Douglas had given an undertaking as to damages.  Douglas
was  not able to do so, nor did he offer, according to Gans  J.'s
reasons, to post any security as a condition for the direction of
the trial of an issue.
[1]</pre>
    <pre>[66] To repeat, without an interim injunction, an adjournment was
of  no value to Douglas.  Refusal of the adjournment did not  end
his  right  to claim damages should the conduct of the City  give
rise  to  a  cause of action and, as noted, Douglas's application
was dismissed &quot;without prejudice&quot; to any action he might commence
against the City for damages.</pre>
    <pre>[67]  The  foregoing  is sufficient to deal with  the  ground  of
appeal  that  Gans  J.  erred  in refusing  an  adjournment  and,
accordingly, I need not deal fully with the question  of  whether
Douglas's material, on its own, raised a genuine issue for trial.
I  must observe, however, that I am not persuaded that Gans  J.'s
analysis of this issue is wrong.  It was Douglas's position  that
the  City officials had promised him that the house would not  be
sold.  This first took the form of assurances and representations
that   &quot;the  City  would  co-operate  with  me  in  my  financial
difficulties  and  would  'go along'  with  me  until  times  got
better.&quot;   This was reflected in an &quot;agreement&quot; in June  of  1994
&quot;whereby  I  would  make  partial  payments  on  account  of  tax
arrears&quot;.  This resulted in payments in June, July and August  of
1994.   No further payments were made after these - &quot;as a  result
of  further  deteriorating  financial circumstances.&quot;   In  these
circumstance,  the agreement which was the basis  of  the  City's
&quot;going along&quot; with Douglas was breached.
[1]</pre>
    <pre>[68]  Douglas, nonetheless, deposed that this caused  no  serious
concern to the City.  The City was comfortable with the situation
and  Douglas was told not to be concerned and to get back to  the
City &quot;when I could make or discuss a repayment&quot; plan.</pre>
    <pre>[69]   In   these  circumstances,  Gans  J.  was  not  wrong   in
characterizing Douglas's position as &quot;the City officials promised
him that the house would not be sold out from under him - he says
-  forever  and  a day&quot; and that &quot;[t]his position  stretches  the
limits of credulity in all respects&quot;.  Objection is taken to  the
description  &quot;forever and a day&quot;.  While this  is  not  literally
what  Douglas  said,  it  is, substantially,  what  his  position
amounted to.  The matter was to ride along until Douglas got back
to  the  City when he felt he could &quot;make or discuss&quot; a repayment
plan.   In  effect,  he  says the City would  defer  the  process
indefinitely.</pre>
    <pre>[70]  Douglas is a lawyer who received the two notices which said
that  the  property  would be sold unless the cancellation  price
were  paid, or, in the absence of an extension agreement, at  the
end of the one-year period following the date of the registration
of  the  tax  arrears certificate.  Surely,  he  could  not  have
thought that the City had any legal right to ignore its statutory
obligations to sell the property in the absence of payment of the
taxes  within  the  year or within the time provided  for  in  an
extension agreement.
[1]</pre>
    <pre>[71] For these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Appeal from the Judgment on Lone Star's Application</pre>
    <pre>[72]  In the notice of appeal from this judgment Veronica is  the
only  appellant.  Her factum states that the appeal is by herself
and  Douglas  Elliott.  This discrepancy can,  if  necessary,  be
corrected.</pre>
    <pre>[73]  The  ground  of appeal is that Lone Star's application  was
premature  in  that there was no evidence whatsoever  before  the
court to suggest, if the judgments of Gans J. became final and  a
tax  deed  were registered, that Veronica and Douglas  would  not
vacate the property in favour of Lone Star.</pre>
    <pre>[74]  While  the right to possession should follow  automatically
upon  registration of the tax deed and, accordingly, there should
be no issue with respect to the right to possession at that time,
I  think  there  is  substance  in the  appellants'  point.   The
affidavit in support of Lone Star's application does not  attempt
to  make out a case for the granting of a conditional order  now,
and  Gans  J. does not deal with this application at all  in  his
reasons, apart from stating that the relief sought was granted.
[1]</pre>
    <pre>[75]  The respondent submits that the prematurity issue  was  not
raised  before  Gans J.  This may be so, but this does  not  mean
that  there  is no need for a factual basis for the  order.   The
bases  for  the order suggested now are speculative.  I recognize
that  this  is a relatively small issue in the total  context  of
these  applications  and  that  this  explains  why  it  probably
received  little attention in the court below.  Nonetheless,  for
the  reasons  I  have  given, I think  that  this  appeal  should
succeed.</pre>
    <pre>The Costs Appeals</pre>
    <pre>[76]  Veronica  Elliott  appeals from  that  part  of  the  costs
disposition  in  the judgment of Gans J. which,  in  addition  to
ordering  that  she  pay  to the respondents  the  costs  of  her
application,  also  orders her to pay the respondents'  costs  of
Bettyann   Elliott's   application  and  of   Douglas   Elliott's
application.   The judgment also provided that &quot;the  damages  and
costs  awarded to be paid by this judgment shall be paid  in  the
first instance out of the $50,000 paid into court pursuant to the
order of Wilkins J. pronounced December 24, 1997&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[77]  A  similar costs disposition was made in the judgment  that
dismissed Douglas's application, i.e., Douglas was ordered to pay
the respondents' costs relating to his application and also those
relating to Bettyann's and Veronica's applications.  (The  formal
order, in paragraph 3 of the judgment, wrongly refers to his  own
application (98-CV 140926) instead of Veronica's application (97-
CV-138161).</pre>
    <pre>[78]  The  grounds of appeal are (1) these appellants should  not
have been ordered to pay the costs of Lone Star because it was  a
respondent  as a result of its motion to be added as a  party  in
each  proceeding and (2) because the appellants were  non-parties
in  Bettyann's application and in each other's applications  they
should  not have been required to pay the respondents'  costs  in
those applications.</pre>
    <pre>[79]  The respondents before us submit that since leave to appeal
has not been sought, or granted, under s. 133(b) of the Courts of
Justice  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, this court lacks jurisdiction
to hear these appeals.  The appellants' response to this is that,
because the costs orders were made without jurisdiction, no leave
is required.</pre>
    <pre>[80]  I  shall  deal first with the issue relating to  the  costs
orders  in  favour of Lone Star.  In the circumstances  of  these
applications, I am satisfied that Lone Star was a necessary party
to  enable the court to adjudicate effectively and completely  on
the  issues  in  these proceedings (rule 5.03(4)).   Clearly,  it
could have been adversely affected by the judgment sought in  the
proceedings (rule 13.01(1)(b)).  No doubt the Elliotts would have
so  asserted had judgment been granted in their favour.  In these
circumstances,  Gans  J.  did not err  in  the  exercise  of  his
discretion in making the costs orders in Lone Star's favour.</pre>
    <pre>[81] The appellants rely upon Friction Division Products Inc.  v.
E.I.  Du  Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Inc. et al. (1985), 51 O.R.  (2d)
244  (H. Ct.) at 250 where Barr J. held that &quot;[t]here will be  no
order as to the costs of Du Pont Canada Inc. as it intervened  in
the  proceedings at its own request and for the protection of its
own  interests  and was not brought into the proceedings  by  the
applicant&quot;.   This  states  the basis  of  Barr  J.'s  particular
disposition.  I do not regard it as enunciating a  general  rule,
particularly where the added party is a necessary one.</pre>
    <pre>[82]  I  think  that there is substance in the  other  ground  of
appeal,  that  relating to Veronica Elliott and  Douglas  Elliott
being  ordered  to  pay  the  respondents'  costs  in  Bettyann's
application  and in each other's application.  It is clear  that,
subject  to certain exceptions which are not applicable  to  this
case,  a court does not have jurisdiction under s. 131(1) of  the
Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 to make a costs order
against  a  non-party in a proceeding; see Rockwell  Developments
Ltd.  v.  Newtonbrook Plaza Ltd., [1972] 3 O.R. 199 (C.A.).   The
respondents  submit  that the orders in question  were  not  made
against  non-parties.  They were made in the Veronica and Douglas
applications against, respectively, Veronica and Douglas.</pre>
    <pre>[83]  With respect, this is what appears on the surface.  I think
that  there  can  be  no  doubt that there  would  have  been  no
jurisdiction to make orders against Veronica and Douglas  in  the
judgment  in the Bettyann application.  I do not think  that  the
substance of the matter is at all altered because they were  made
in  the  judgments  in  the  Veronica and  Douglas  applications.
Veronica  and  Douglas  were  ordered  to  pay  the  costs  in  a
proceeding  in which they were not parties.  The same  point  may
be  made  by  confining the analysis to the Veronica and  Douglas
applications and the judgments made in them.  Under s. 131(1) the
judge's  power was confined to awarding costs &quot;of and  incidental
to&quot;  these  proceedings  -  and  not  the  costs  of  some  other
proceeding.  Accordingly, although under this analysis the orders
were  not  made  against non-parties they included  the  separate
costs  of other proceedings.  The judge gave no reasons for these
particular costs dispositions and, we are told, they were made on
his  own  motion.   While I can appreciate that  if  the  Elliott
family is looked upon as one party there may be some sense to the
orders but, on the plain facts, they were made without authority.</pre>
    <pre>[84]  Accordingly, I would allow these particular  appeals,  with
costs,  and  make orders striking out those parts  of  the  costs
dispositions  in the judgments against Veronica and Douglas  that
ordered  them  to  pay  the  respondents'  costs  in  the   other
proceedings.   There  is  no reason why Bettyann  should  not  be
liable  to  pay to the respondents the costs of her  application.
Accordingly,  I would grant whatever amendments are necessary  to
give effect to this disposition.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[85]  For the foregoing reasons, and subject to what I have  said
in  the preceding paragraph respecting the appeals from costs,  I
would  dismiss,  with  costs, the appeals  of  Veronica  Elliott,
Douglas  Elliott and Bettyann Elliott from the judgments  against
them.   I  would  allow  Veronica Elliott's  appeal  against  the
judgment in Lone Star's application, with costs, and dismiss Lone
Star's application with costs.</pre>

                              ....</pre>
    <pre>     3.   Where the land is registered under the Land Titles Act,
     every person appearing by the register of title and by the
     index of executions to have an interest in the land as of
     the time of closing of the land registry office on the day
     the tax arrears certificate was registered other than a
     person who has an interest referred to in clause 9(5)(a) or
     (b).</pre>
    <pre>                              ....</pre>
    <pre>4(2) Where a notice is sent under this section to a person
appearing by the records of the land registry office to be the
owner of the land or to a person who is an assessed tenant in
occupation of the land, a notice shall also be sent to the spouse

    <pre>4(5) A person is not entitled to notice under this section if,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  after a reasonable search of the records mentioned in
     subsection 11(1), the treasurer is unable to find the
     person's address and the treasurer is not otherwise aware of
     the address; or</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  the person has expressly waived the right to notice,
     either before or after the notice should have been sent.</pre>
    <pre>5(1) Before the expiry of the one-year period mentioned in
subsection 9(1), any person may have the tax arrears certificate
cancelled by paying to the municipality the cancellation price as
of the date the payment is tendered and after the expiry of the

expiry of the 280 day period, shall send or cause to be sent to
the persons entitled to receive notice under section 4 a final
notice in the prescribed form that the land will be advertised
for public sale unless the cancellation price is paid before the
end of the one-year period following the date of the registration
of the tax arrears certificate.</pre>
    <pre>9(2) If, at the end of the one-year period following the date of
the registration of the tax arrears certificate,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  the cancellation price remains unpaid; and</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  there is no subsisting extension agreement,</pre>
    <pre>the land shall be offered for public sale by public auction or
public tender, as the treasurer shall decide, and the treasurer
shall forthwith,</pre>
    <pre>     (c) make a statutory declaration in the prescribed form
     stating the names and addresses of the persons to whom
     notice was sent under subsection (1);</pre>
    <pre>     (d)  advertise the land for sale once in The Ontario Gazette
     and once a week for four weeks in a newspaper that, in the
     opinion of the treasurer, has such circulation within the
     municipality as to provide reasonable notice of the sale or,
     where there is no such newspaper, the treasurer shall post
     notice in the municipal office and one other prominent place
     in the municipality and the advertisement shall be in the
     prescribed form.</pre>
    <pre>9(3) The treasurer, in accordance with the prescribed rules,

     in the name of the successful purchaser or in such name as
     the successful purchaser may direct; or</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  where there is no successful purchaser, the treasurer
     shall prepare and register, in the name of the municipality,
     a notice of vesting in the prescribed form.</pre>

     to the land at least one year before the land was advertised
     for sale;</pre>
    <pre>     (b) notices were sent and the statutory declarations were
     registered in substantial compliance with this Act and the
     regulations made under this Act;</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  the cancellation price was not paid within one year
     following the date of the registration of the tax arrears
     certificate; and</pre>
    <pre>     (d)  the land was advertised for sale, in substantial
     compliance with this Act and the regulations made under this
     Act.</pre>
    <pre>                              ....</pre>
    <pre>9(10)     Despite anything in the prescribed rules, except the
rules relating to the determination of the successful purchaser,
the treasurer, in conducting a sale under this Act, may do all
things as are, in his or her opinion, necessary to ensure a fair
and orderly sale.
                              ....</pre>
    <pre>11(1)     Any notice required to be sent to any person under this
Act may be given by personal delivery or, in the alternative, may
be sent by certified or registered mail,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  in the case of the assessed owner, to the address of
     the person as shown on the last returned assessment roll of
     the municipality;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  in the case of any person whose interest is registered
     against the title of the land, to the address of the person
     furnished under section 166 of the Land Titles Act or
     section 42 of the Registry Act or where no such address has
     been furnished, addressed to the solicitor whose name
     appears on the registered instrument by which that person
     appears to have an interest;
                              ....</pre>
    <pre>11(4)     A statutory declaration,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  registered under subsection 4(4) or made under clause
     9(2)(c) is proof in the absence of evidence to the contrary
     that the notices required to be sent were sent to the
     persons named in the statutory declaration and received by
     them;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  registered under subsection 9(4) is conclusive proof of
     the matters referred to in clauses 9(4)(a) to (d).</pre>
    <pre>11(5)     Nothing in this Act requires the treasurer to ensure
that a notice that is properly sent under this Act is received by
the person to whom it was sent. 1984, c. 48, s. 11(2-5).
</pre>
    <pre>12(1)     No proceedings for the sale of land under this Act are
void by reason of any neglect, omission or error but, subject to
this section and to section 13, any such neglect, omission or
error may render the proceedings voidable.</pre>
    <pre>12(2)     Subject to subsection (4) and to section 13,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  a failure on the part of the treasurer to substantially
     comply with section 4 or subsection 9(1); or</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  an error or omission in the registration or sale of the
     land, other than an error or omission mentioned in
     subsection (5),
renders the proceedings under this Act voidable.</pre>
    <pre>12(3)     Where, before the registration of a tax deed or notice
of vesting, the treasurer becomes aware of a failure, error or
omission referred to in subsection (2), the treasurer shall
forthwith register a tax arrears cancellation certificate in the
prescribed form but this subsection does not apply so as to
prevent the treasurer from registering a new tax arrears
certificate and proceeding under this Act.</pre>
    <pre>12(4)     Proceedings for the sale of land under this Act are not
voidable unless the person complaining of any neglect, error or
omission establishes that he or she suffered actual prejudice as
a result of the neglect, error or omission.</pre>
    <pre>12(5)     No proceedings under this Act are rendered voidable by
reason of,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  a failure on the part of the treasurer to distrain for
     any reason or take any other action for the collection of
     taxes;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  an error in the cancellation price other than a
     substantial error;</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  any error in the notices sent or delivered under this
     Act if the error has not substantially misled the person
     complaining of the error;</pre>
    <pre>     (d)  any error in the publishing or posting of
     advertisements if the error has not substantially misled the
     person complaining of the error; or</pre>
    <pre>     (e)  any error in the description of the land in the tax
     arrears certificate if the error has not substantially
     misled the person complaining of the error.</pre>
    <pre>12(6)     Where, in the opinion of the treasurer,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  it is not in the financial interests of the
     municipality to continue with proceedings under this Act; or</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  because of some neglect, error or omission, it is not
     practical or desirable to continue proceedings under this
     Act,</pre>
    <pre>the treasurer may register a cancellation certificate in the
prescribed form, but this subsection does not apply so as to
prevent the treasurer from registering a new tax arrears
certificate and proceeding under this Act.
</pre>
    <pre>13(1)     Subject to proof of fraud, every tax deed and notice of
vesting, when registered, is final, binding and conclusive and
not subject to challenge for any reason including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  the invalidity of any assessment upon which the tax
     arrears were based; and</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  the breach of any requirements, including notice
     requirements, imposed by this or any other Act or otherwise
     by law,</pre>
    <pre>and no action may be brought for the recovery of the land after
the registration of the tax deed or notice of vesting if the
statutory declaration required by subsection 9(4) has been
registered.</pre>
    <pre>13(2)     Subsection (1) does not apply so as to prevent a person
from bringing an action for damages against the municipality.</pre></td>
