    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge G. A.
Pockele on June 24, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We are all of the view that this appeal must be dismissed.
These offences were committed only twenty days after the
appellant was released from custody after serving a sentence for
similar offences.  At the time, the appellant was in breach of a
court order and a probation order.  His conduct, including the
driving, was threatening and menacing.
[2]  This is pre-eminently a case where the trial judge's
decision must be accorded great deference.  He had the
opportunity to observe the appellant and the victim.  He had the
advantage of a great deal of information including an expert
report indicating that without treatment &#150; and the appellant was
resisting treatment &#150; the appellant would be a continuing danger
to the victim and her husband.  Given the history of the
proceedings and the appellant's record we are satisfied that the
total sentence was fit.
