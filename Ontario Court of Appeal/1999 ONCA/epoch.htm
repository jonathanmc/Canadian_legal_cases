    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Peter C. Williams, for the appellant

[1]  Although the trial judge found that the respondent was</pre>
    <pre>involved in three incidents of misconduct, she also found that in</pre>
    <pre>all of the circumstances the respondent had not acted</pre>
    <pre>dishonestly. She had the advantage of seeing and hearing the</pre>
    <pre>witnesses and we are not in a position to conclude that she was</pre>
    <pre>wrong in her finding in this respect.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We do not consider that the trial judge=s interventions in</pre>
    <pre>questioning two of the appellant's witnesses indicated bias on</pre>
    <pre>her part.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs. The cross-appeal is</pre>
    <pre>withdrawn without costs.</pre></td>
