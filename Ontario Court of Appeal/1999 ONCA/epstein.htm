    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Gotlib J. dated June 18, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent, Joel Epstein, a Type I diabetic, suffered a
12-hour period of unconsciousness caused by hyperglycemia while
he was a patient in the defendant hospital in early November
1990. The respondent Margaret Gaum is his mother. The respondents
brought an action in negligence for damages against the hospital,
the defendant nurses and the three defendant physicians. Prior to
the commencement of trial, the respondents accepted $50,000 from
the hospital and the defendant nurses in full settlement of their
claim against those defendants.  Following a trial before Gotlib
J. without a jury, Mr. Epstein and his mother recovered judgment
for damages in the amounts of $40,000 and $1,000, respectively,
against Drs. Gorman, Fell and Hamilton. Mr. Epstein also
recovered judgment for costs fixed at $40,000 and for pre-
judgment interest. The three physicians appeal against the
findings of negligence, the assessment of damages, and the
refusal of the trial judge to set-off, against the damage award
or the costs, the respondents&#146; $50,000 pre-trial settlement with
the hospital and its employees.
[2]  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the findings of
negligence against the appellants cannot stand.  While it may not
be necessary to do so, I also find the assessment of damages
excessive.  In light of my conclusions, the issue of set-off
becomes moot and, accordingly, I will refrain from dealing with
that issue.</pre>
    <pre>The events during Mr. Epstein&#146;s hospitalization at the defendant
hospital</pre>
    <pre>[3]  As the trial judge set out the facts at considerable length
in her reasons reported at (1997), 35 O.T.C. 811, I will only
give a brief outline of the facts that are most relevant to this
appeal.
[4]  Mr. Epstein was born September 23, 1961.  He was 29 years
old at the time of admission to the defendant hospital and 35 at
the time of trial. Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with Type I diabetes
at approximately age 10. In general terms, this means that he is
insulin dependent and suffers from an acute form of diabetes
known as diabetes mellitus which requires careful monitoring.
Between the ages of 6 and 35, he suffered a myriad of conditions
leading to medical treatment.  The trial judge lists over 60
admissions and attendances at a variety of hospitals during that
period. Mr. Epstein&#146;s attendance at emergency departments of
hospitals for treatment of hypoglycemia on eight separate
occasions over the years are the only attendances relevant to
this appeal. The patient&#146;s history of hypoglycemic events is
relevant because it played a role in the physician&#146;s treatment of
his diabetic condition during his hospitalization in the
defendant hospital.
[5]  Mr. Epstein attended at the emergency department of the
defendant hospital on the evening of October 31, 1990 with
complaints of abdominal pain. Dr. James Hamilton, a general
surgeon whose particular area of interest is colo-rectal surgery,
assessed Mr. Epstein on November 1, 1990. Dr. Hamilton&#146;s clinical
impression was that Mr. Epstein was suffering from
diverticulitis, an infection of the small sacs of the colon.  Dr.
Hamilton admitted Mr. Epstein to hospital for treatment with
antibiotics. He arranged to have Dr. Charles Gorman see Mr.
Epstein in consultation with respect to his diabetes. Dr.
Hamilton had dealings with diabetic patients but did not have the
expertise to manage a patient with Mr. Epstein&#146;s condition.
[6]  Dr. Gorman is an expert in internal medicine with particular
expertise in the management of diabetic patients. Dr. Gorman
first saw Mr. Epstein approximately nine years before the events
in question in this litigation. From that time, he saw Mr.
Epstein periodically over the years for management and follow-up
of his diabetes.  Dr. Gorman saw Mr. Epstein in consultation at
the defendant hospital at Dr. Hamilton&#146;s request on November 1,
1990. He ordered an insulin drip and gave orders to the nurses to
monitor Mr. Epstein&#146;s blood glucose levels four times daily using
a glucometer. Shortly following his admission, Mr. Epstein&#146;s
blood glucose levels were found to be abnormally low. Insulin was
discontinued on Dr. Gorman&#146;s order because of this hypoglycemic
reaction to a minimal infusion of insulin. In light of this
reaction and of Mr. Epstein&#146;s history of hypoglycemic episodes in
the past, Dr. Gorman considered it to be appropriate to
discontinue Mr. Epstein&#146;s insulin and to continue to monitor his
blood glucose levels. Insulin was not to be restarted without
physician consultation. Dr. Gorman made the following notation to
Mr. Epstein&#146;s chart on November 1: &#147;well known to me re: diabetes
and emotional status &#150; will follow with you.&#148; The policy at the
hospital at that time was that the nurses would contact the
physician if a patient&#146;s blood glucose levels rose above the 12
to 14 range. Dr. Gorman did not hear from anyone at the hospital
until he was urgently called in the early morning hours of
November 5, 1990 to attend upon Mr. Epstein who had fallen into a
hyperglycemic coma.
[7]  Dr. Hamilton visited Mr. Epstein on November 2, 3 and 4. By
November 4, Mr. Epstein&#146;s abdominal symptoms were improving. Dr.
Hamilton testified that he would not necessarily have reviewed
Mr. Epstein&#146;s diabetic record on those visits because he was
relying on Dr. Gorman for the diabetic management of the patient.
[8]  Dr. David Fell was on call at the hospital for internal
medicine between 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, November 4 and 8:00 a.m. on
Monday November 5, 1990. Dr. Fell is a physician with a specialty
in internal medicine and a sub-specialty in cardiology. At all
relevant times, he was on active staff at the hospital as a
cardiologist and internist. Dr. Fell has also had experience
treating many patients with diabetes.
[9]   At 10:00 p.m. on November 4, Dr. Fell received a telephone
call from the nurse on Mr. Epstein&#146;s ward informing him that Mr.
Epstein had a blood glucose level of 16.2. Dr. Fell made further
inquiries of the nurse and was informed that Mr. Epstein suffered
from diabetes mellitus, that his diabetic condition was managed
by Dr. Gorman and that his insulin had been discontinued by Dr.
Gorman because of a significant hypoglycemic reaction shortly
following his admission to hospital. Dr. Fell was also told about
Mr. Epstein&#146;s history of hypoglycemic reactions in the past. Dr.
Fell inquired about the blood glucose readings and concluded that
the readings, although increasing and mildly elevated, were in
the safe range. Dr. Fell also inquired about the clinical
condition of the patient and was told that the patient had
improved since admission, that he had exhibited uncooperative
behaviour and that he had a history of emotional and behavioural
problems. Dr. Fell was not told of any complaints by the patient
of thirst or of any symptoms of hyperventilation. Based on the
information received, Dr. Fell was concerned that the renewed
administration of insulin might precipitate a hypoglycemic
reaction. Because the patient&#146;s condition was reported as stable
and his blood glucose level was considered to be in a safe range,
Dr. Fell told the nurse to continue to monitor Mr. Epstein&#146;s
blood glucose levels but did not order insulin.
[10] At 11:30 p.m. on November 4, a nurse contacted Dr. Hamilton
at home to report that Mr. Epstein&#146;s intravenous had come out and
that she was unable to start it again because of the patient&#146;s
uncooperative behaviour. Dr. Hamilton was told that the patient
was tolerating clear liquids. Dr. Hamilton instructed the nurse
that the intravenous could be left out for the time being. He
could not recall whether or not he was told that Mr. Epstein had
a blood sugar of 16.2, but said that he would have deferred to
his colleagues in internal medicine regarding the management of
this patient&#146;s diabetes. He told the nurse to contact the
internist on call if there were any further problems with
Mr. Epstein.
[11] At 2:30 a.m. on November 5, Mr. Epstein was maintaining that
he was hypoglycemic. A glucometer reading of 6.9 was obtained at
that time. No call was made to any physician at that point. The
nurse did not consider this fluctuation to be any cause for
concern.
[12] At 3:15 a.m. on November 5, Dr. Fell received another
telephone call from a nurse on Mr. Epstein&#146;s ward. At the time,
Dr. Fell was resuscitating a patient with serious cardiac
problems in the emergency room. The nurse told Dr. Fell that Mr.
Epstein was lying in bed moaning, avoiding eye contact and had
been agitated. She told him that his intravenous had come out and
that it could not be put back in because of his uncooperative
behaviour. He was further advised that the most recent glucometer
reading registered at 6.9. Dr. Fell was not told that Mr. Epstein
had been complaining of thirst or that he was hyperventilating.
Given that the previous reading had been 16.2, the present result
of 6.9 reinforced to Dr. Fell that precipitous hypoglycemia was a
concern for this patient and that, had he given insulin earlier,
there would have been a significant chance of having provoked a
hypoglycemic reaction. Reassured by the more recent normal blood
glucose reading, Dr. Fell prescribed Ativan to help settle Mr.
Epstein.
[13] At 6:00 a.m. Dr. Fell was contacted by a nurse and notified
that the glucometer was reading &#147;hi&#148;. He ordered a laboratory
testing of the blood glucose level and the prompt administration
of 6 units of insulin. At 7:30 a.m. Dr. Fell was advised that the
reported glucose level was 69. Dr. Fell was shocked to hear this
and asked the nurse to check the patient&#146;s clinical status
immediately. The nurse reported that the patient could not be
aroused and that he had a blood pressure of only 70. Dr. Fell
immediately ordered insulin at 4 units per hour and ran to the
patient&#146;s bedside. He immediately instituted resuscitative
measures. Dr. Gorman arrived shortly thereafter.
[14] Mr. Epstein was transferred to the intensive care unit and
monitored closely. He remained in a state of unconsciousness for
approximately 12 hours. He responded well to treatment over the
12 hour period and eventually regained consciousness. He
recovered and was transferred to the regular ward on November 7.
His claim of brain damage caused by this episode was rejected by
the trial judge. Mr. Epstein was found to have fully recovered
from the hypoglycemic coma without  sequelae other than some
bruising and leg swelling.</pre>
    <pre>The expert opinion at trial</pre>
    <pre>[15] There was no issue at trial with respect to the treatment
that Mr. Epstein received from the time he became unconscious
until his recovery. The sole issue was whether the care provided
by the three physicians fell below the requisite standard of care
thereby resulting in the hyperglycemic reaction which caused Mr.
Epstein to be in a coma for 12 hours.
[16] The determination of this issue turned entirely on the
expert evidence called at trial and did not depend on Mr.
Epstein&#146;s testimony.  Mr. Epstein was found by the trial judge to
be &#147;a highly manipulative man&#148; of &#147;no credibility&#148; and his
testimony was totally rejected.  Six medical experts testified at
trial, including the three appellants. Drs. John William Hare,
Anne Beatrice Kenshole and  Peter Vertner Clarke were qualified
to give expert opinion evidence in the field of endocrinology and
more particularly with respect to the treatment and management of
diabetes. Dr. Hare was called by the plaintiff, the other
witnesses were called by the defence. Two of the appellants, Drs.
Gorman and Fell, were also qualified to give opinion evidence as
experts in internal medicine, including the assessment and
treatment of patients with diabetes, and were each found to have
&#147;impressive medical credentials.&#148; The third appellant, Dr.
Hamilton, was qualified as an expert in the area of general
surgery.
[17] The trial judge has reviewed the medical evidence in her
reasons and, for the purpose of this appeal, it is only necessary
to review this evidence as it relates to the trial judge&#146;s
findings of liability.</pre>
    <pre>Applicable principles of law</pre>
    <pre>[18] The trial judge correctly instructed herself on the law. She
quoted from Crits and Crits v. Sylvester, [1956] 1 D.L.R. (2d)
502 (Ont. C.A.) at 508 on the standard of care required of a
physician:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Every medical practitioner must bring to his task a
          reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a
          reasonable degree of care. He is bound to exercise that degree of
          care and skill which could reasonably be expected of a normal,
          prudent practitioner of the same experience and standing, and if
          he holds himself out as a specialist, a higher degree of skill is
          required of him than of one who does not profess to be so
          qualified by special training and ability.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge then correctly noted various cases that
reiterate the principle that an error of  judgment will not
constitute negligence unless that error also amounts to a failure
to meet the above-noted standard of care. Differences of opinion
and practice exist in the medical profession as in other
professions and a physician is not negligent simply because his
conclusion may differ from that of others in his profession.
Finally, the trial judge correctly noted that the onus is on the
plaintiff to prove a breach of the duty of care and that there
must be a causal nexus between the breach and the alleged loss;
that is to say, the negligence must have resulted in the alleged
loss.
[20] Certain additional principles must be borne in mind in the
disposition of this appeal.
[21] It is important that the court guard against the perfect
vision of hindsight. The Supreme Court of Canada in LaPointe v.
Hôpital Le Gardeur (1992), 90 D.L.R. (4th) 7 at 14 reiterates the
principle that a physician is not to be judged by the result and
states as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In order to evaluate a particular exercise of judgment
          fairly, the doctor&#146;s limited ability to foresee future events
          when determining a course of conduct must be borne in mind.
          Otherwise, the doctor will not be assessed according to the norms
          of the average doctor of reasonable ability in the same
          circumstances, but rather will be held accountable for mistakes
          that are apparent only after the fact.</pre>
    <pre>[22] It is also important that the court guard against reaching
conclusions on technical matters outside its own competence based
on personal opinions rather than on the evidence from qualified
witnesses.
[23] Finally, the standard of appellate review must be kept in
mind. It is not the role of this court to substitute its own view
of the evidence for that of the trial judge. It is trite law that
this court should not interfere with the findings of fact and the
conclusions of  the trial judge in the absence of manifest error
or unless it can be shown that the evidence cannot reasonably
support the conclusion.
[24] With all respect to the trial judge, it is my view that the
following errors necessitate appellate intervention in this case:
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)  The evidence fails to establish any nexus between the fault,
as found by the trial judge, and the loss. The trial judge failed
to consider this element of causation in her determination of
liability with respect to the three appellants.
(b)  There is no evidence that the conduct of Dr. Gorman, on
which the trial judge based her finding of fault, fell below the
standard of care expected of a physician in his position.
(c)  The trial judge misapprehended the expert evidence of Dr.
Clarke and this error contributed in a material way to her
conclusion of liability with respect to Dr. Fell.
(d)  The preponderance of evidence cannot reasonably support the
finding of liability against Dr. Fell.
(e)  The trial judge failed to guard against appreciating the
evidence with the benefit of hindsight and this error was
material in her assessment of the evidence with respect to Dr.
Fell.
(f)  There is no evidence on the standard of care to be expected
of a general surgeon in the position of Dr. Hamilton.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s findings of liability</pre>
    <pre>[25] It is noteworthy, in my view, that the trial judge did not
reject any of the appellants&#146; testimony on the events that
transpired or on the expert opinions that they gave. Nor did she
reject any of the other expert evidence called by either party.
Indeed, the record does not reveal any reason why the trial judge
would have rejected any of the testimony. The trial judge&#146;s
findings therefore appear to be based, and on some points are
expressly stated as being based, not on the preference or
acceptance of the testimony of one expert over the testimony of
others but rather, on the overall preponderance of medical
evidence. As will be discussed below, it is my view that the
preponderance of evidence cannot reasonably support the trial
judge&#146;s conclusions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) Dr. Gorman</pre>
    <pre>[26] In dealing generally with liability, the trial judge said
the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court finds that there is more involved in this case
          than matters of judgment.  The three doctors who treated this
          plaintiff were extraordinarily skilled men doing a difficult job
          in a busy hospital.  The plaintiff was a very difficult patient.
          Dr. Hamilton obviously made the correct diagnosis because after
          the administration of antibiotics, the pain and distention in the
          plaintiff&#146;s abdomen subsided, and his white blood cell count
          returned to normal.  There was a failure of the duty of care of
          the three doctors.  It lies in their handling of the information
          and delegation of duties on a weekend.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The trial judge then made the following findings with
respect to Dr. Gorman:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Gorman knew much about this plaintiff, having treated
          him for his diabetes for a number of years.  The discontinuing of
          insulin when his blood sugar reading was 1.8, according to the
          experts was appropriate.  The decision not to institute a sliding
          scale of administration of insulin was, according to the experts,
          also appropriate.  His instruction to the nurses was apparently
          to call the internist on duty if there were any problems.  This
          too was appropriate.  But Dr. Gorman knew that this was a
          difficult patient and that he had a difficult case of diabetes
          and should have alerted Dr. Fell to possible problems. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge therefore concluded as follows with respect
to Dr. Gorman:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Gorman&#146;s negligence consisted of handing over a patient
          such as Mr. Epstein to the on call physician over the weekend
          without a word to warn him, when he knew or ought to have known
          that the on call internist would likely have a busy weekend.</pre>
    <pre>[29] It is noteworthy that the trial judge found in particular
that Dr. Gorman&#146;s instruction to the nurses to call the internist
on duty if there were any problems was appropriate. Having made
this finding, it is not at all obvious how Dr. Gorman&#146;s failure
to alert that internist of possible problems can be said to fall
below the standard of care to be expected of him in the absence
of expert evidence to that effect. The question whether Dr.
Gorman should have contacted the internist on duty was not
canvassed at all with the witnesses at trial. A court should not
speculate about the adequacy of professional standards in the
absence of expert evidence about those standards. On the facts of
this case, I agree with counsel for the appellants that the trial
judge, in making this particular finding of liability,
effectively imposed her own view of the standard of care to be
expected from Dr. Gorman.
[30] Further, I see no other support in the evidence for the
finding of liability against Dr. Gorman. Dr. Hare&#146;s evidence was
that generally the standard of care was not reached because &#147;the
management of this diabetes was largely ignored&#148;. Quite apart
from the fact that it is difficult to find support for that
general comment on the record2, Dr. Hare does not suggest that it
was Dr. Gorman who was guilty of ignoring the management of the
diabetes. According to the policy in force at the hospital at the
time, nurses would contact a physician if a diabetic patient&#146;s
blood glucose levels rose above the 12 to 14 range.  No criticism
of such a policy was made at trial. In fact, the evidence was
that this was a very safe guideline and that a similar policy was
followed at other hospitals with the precise level sometimes as
high as 15.  Following November 1 and until November 5, 1990 at
7:30 a.m., Dr. Gorman was not contacted by any nurse with respect
to Mr. Epstein&#146;s blood glucose levels, or with respect to any
other issue concerning the patient&#146;s condition. Based on this
record, if there was a failure of communication, it was not a
failure on the part of Dr. Gorman.
[31] Finally, there is no evidence that Dr. Gorman&#146;s failure to
act, as found by the trial judge, caused or contributed to the
loss. The issue of causation was never addressed in the evidence
and no analysis is provided by the trial judge on that element of
the alleged tort.
[32] Consequently, it is my view that the finding of liability
against Dr. Gorman is not supported by the evidence and cannot
stand.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) Dr. Fell</pre>
    <pre>[33]  The trial judge made the following findings with respect to
Dr. David Fell:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Fell was engaged in a cardiac emergency when the
          dangerous level of blood sugar readings was developing, in the
          early morning hours of November 5.  He was correct in assuming
          that Dr. Gorman, by not ordering sliding scale insulin
          administration, wanted physician judgment before the
          administration of that remedy.  Dr. Fell&#146;s actions, however, fell
          below the standard of care required of a specialist in not
          responding to the numbers which were furnished to him and which
          should have caught his attention.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[34] The trial judge then reviewed the evidence of the &#147;numbers&#148;
furnished to Dr. Fell and the expert opinion with respect to
these numbers:
          </pre>
    <pre>               That is, the 13.1 glucometer reading at 11:15 a.m. on
          November 4, the 12.4 reading at 4:30 p.m. on November 4, the 16.2
          glucose reading at 10:00 p.m. on November 4 and the 6.9 reading
          at 2:15 a.m. on November 5. He did in fact, respond to the &#147;high&#148;
          reading at 6:00 a.m. on November 5, ordered the lab test which
          showed a glucose reading of 69, clearly an emergency situation&#133;
          Dr. Hare would have administered insulin once the reading reached
          11 blood sugar being then clearly elevated. Dr. Clarke would have
          administered insulin for readings over 10. Dr. Kenshole said that
          a blood sugar reading of 15 was not clearly elevated even though
          a blood sugar reading of 11 could garner a diagnosis that would
          involve the administration of insulin. In her view at a reading
          of 15, the doctor should be called but she has had patients with
          a reading greater than 30. Where patients are insulin dependant,
          it is a highly individual assessment.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge then concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This Court finds that the preponderance of medical evidence
          is such that clearly steps ought to have been taken by Dr. Fell
          which he did not do.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Later in her reasons, the trial judge also made the
following finding concerning  Dr. Fell:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Both Drs. Fell and Hamilton failed to notice and react to
          signs of ketoacidosis.  Both being experienced specialists, they
          ought to have seen and acted on those signs.  Notwithstanding
          this plaintiff&#146;s bizarre and violent behaviour in hospital, he
          was entitled to proper care for his diabetic condition.  In fact,
          his treatment for diabetes fell between the slats and was not
          properly attended to until there was an emergency.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Hence, the trial judge based her finding of liability
against Dr. Fell on the fact that he failed to restart the
administration of insulin sooner, presumably at the time of the
first call to him at 10:30 p.m. on November 4, or at the time of
the second call at 3:15 a.m. on November 5. She appears to have
arrived at this conclusion mainly on the basis of the glucometer
readings and on other &#147;signs of ketoacidosis&#148; that Dr. Fell
failed to respond to.
[38] In my view, there are several difficulties with this finding
of liability.
[39] First, it is based in part of a misapprehension of Dr.
Clarke&#146;s evidence that he would have administered insulin when
Mr. Epstein&#146;s blood glucose level exceeded 10 when that clearly
was not the opinion he gave at trial. When the complete
information possessed by Dr. Fell and his course of conduct were
described to Dr. Clarke, he was unequivocal in his responses that
he would &#147;not have done other than what he [Dr. Fell] did.&#148; Dr.
Clarke&#146;s opinion is entirely supportive of Dr. Fell&#146;s treatment
of Mr. Epstein. His statements with respect to the administering
of insulin when the blood glucose reading is over 10 were given
in response to a series of questions put to him in cross-
examination based on the assumption that a sliding scale approach
would be used.3 Dr. Clarke, however, was clearly of the view that
such an approach was inappropriate in the case of a patient such
as Mr. Epstein. Drs. Gorman and Kenshole shared that opinion and
the trial judge held that Dr. Gorman&#146;s decision not to use a
sliding scale was appropriate.
[40] Second, the preponderance of evidence does not, as the trial
judge concluded, support a finding that Dr. Fell failed to take
steps that he ought to have taken, but rather  supports the steps
that he took. In my view, the trial judge&#146;s erroneous conclusion
on this point can only be explained by her misapprehension of the
testimony of Dr. Clarke. The record clearly reveals that both Dr.
Clarke and Dr. Kenshole unequivocally supported the decision made
by Dr. Fell. Further, Dr. Gorman indicated that while he would
have given Mr. Epstein a small dose of insulin when the level of
blood glucose reached 16.2, he was not at all critical of Dr.
Fell. Dr. Gorman viewed this simply as a difference in judgment
that, in his view, would not have changed the ultimate result.
Finally, Dr. Hare was the only expert witness who was critical of
Dr. Fell&#146;s decision. However, nowhere in his testimony does Dr.
Hare give the opinion that the failure to re-institute the
administration of insulin at an earlier point in time was
something more than an error in judgment and that it constituted
a breach of the standard of care to be expected of a physician
like Dr. Fell. Rather, he stated that he would &#147;quarrel&#148; with Dr.
Fell&#146;s &#147;judgment&#148; in failing to re-institute insulin on the
evening of November 4, conceding that this was an issue &#147;on which
reasonable people can disagree.&#148;
[41] Third, the evidence does not support a finding that Dr. Fell
was informed of &#147;signs of ketoacidosis&#148; to which he failed to
react. For our purposes, it is sufficient to describe
ketoacidosis as a condition that occurs when there is a severe
lack of insulin. It is the condition that, in this case,
eventually led to Mr. Epstein&#146;s period of unconsciousness. The
various signs of ketoacidosis were described by the experts at
trial.
Generally, they include excessive urination followed by thirst
then nausea, vomiting, fatigue and in later stages,
hyperventilation. However, all the experts recognized that none
of these symptoms is specific to ketoacidosis and that they must
be considered in context.
[42] The evidence is uncontradicted that Dr. Fell was not
informed of any of these signs by the nurses at the relevant
times although he inquired of the patient&#146;s clinical condition at
the time. A question arose at trial whether Dr. Fell should have
specifically inquired whether the patient was thirsty or whether
he was hyperventilating. Neither Dr. Kenshole or Dr. Clarke saw
any reason why Dr. Fell would have made that specific inquiry.
While it is implicit from Dr. Hare&#146;s testimony that he was of the
opinion that Dr. Fell should have inquired about those specific
symptoms, Dr. Hare was not aware of the information given to Dr.
Fell and was not aware that Dr. Fell had inquired about the
patient&#146;s clinical condition.
[43] In any event, it is my view that the preponderance of
evidence does not support a finding that the patient was
exhibiting signs of ketoacidosis during the relevant period of
time. Drs. Gorman, Fell, Kenshole, and Clarke, all experts in the
field, saw no reason to suspect the onset of ketoacidosis at the
time on the basis of this record and Dr. Hare expressly
recognized that he was attributing the patient&#146;s symptoms to the
onset of ketoacidosis through the use of a &#147;retrospectoscope&#148;,
that is with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, it is
noteworthy that, during the period of time both Drs. Fell and
Hamilton were called in the late evening hours of November 4, the
patient was uncooperative and highly agitated. Dr. Kenshole was
of the opinion that this behaviour was &#147;completely atypical&#148; of a
ketoacidotic state. Dr. Clarke also testified that being agitated
and combative was not part of ketoacidosis. Rather, he stated
that one would expect the patient to be &#147;difficult to rouse,
semiconscious, stuporous, excessively drowsy.&#148; Dr. Gorman was of
the same view. Dr. Hare agreed that agitation was &#147;atypical of
ketoacidosis&#148; but, in his view, it was not inconsistent with it.
Likewise, when Dr. Fell was called for the second time at 3:15
a.m., the patient was exhibiting uncooperative behaviour, was
moaning and avoiding eye contact. Also, of significance at the
time of the second call was the fact that Dr. Fell was informed
that the last glucometer reading was 6.9. This brings us to the
next point.
[44] Fourth, the trial judge failed to consider the effect of the
6.9 reading on the overall course of action taken by Dr. Fell.
This, in my view, provides a further example of the improper use
of hindsight in the assessment of the evidence. The hospital
records indicate that, at 2:15 a.m. on November 5, Mr. Epstein
was complaining that he felt hypoglycemic. A glucometer reading
was taken at the time and it indicated 6.9, seemingly confirming
that the patient&#146;s blood glucose level was going down.  Dr. Fell
was informed of this reading when he was called at 3:15 a.m. As
indicated earlier, this reading confirmed in Dr. Fell&#146;s mind that
precipitous hypoglycemia was a real concern for this patient and
that there would be a significant chance that the administration
of insulin could provoke a hypoglycemic reaction. All the experts
at trial agreed that the glucometer reading of 6.9 must have been
erroneous because it was simply inconsistent with the course of
events in the hours that followed. However, all the experts,
except Dr. Hare, testified unequivocally that they would not have
had any reason to suspect that the reading was in error at the
time it was taken. It is only in retrospect that they would
conclude that it had to be erroneous. Dr. Hare is the only
witness who testified that he would have been suspicious of the
reading at the time and would have asked for another glucose
check.  Again, the preponderance of evidence clearly supports Dr.
Fell&#146;s reliance on that reading and his judgment call at the
time.
[45] Finally, and perhaps more importantly, there is no evidence
that the hyperglycemic coma suffered by Mr. Epstein is causally
connected to the failure to restart the insulin at the relevant
times, either late November 4 or in the early hours of November
5. The trial judge does not address the element of causation in
her reasons. Therefore, even if it could be said that Dr. Fell
was negligent in failing to act sooner, there is no evidence to
support a finding that such conduct was causally linked to the
loss. Indeed, the evidence on this point supports the opposite
conclusion. The issue is not canvassed at all with Dr. Hare and
the other experts testified that the administration of insulin at
an earlier time would not have changed what happened. Dr. Gorman
testified that, in his view, the administration of insulin at the
time of the 16.2 reading would &#147;not have changed the situation.&#148;
Dr. Kenshole agreed that &#147;it would have made no difference.&#148; Dr.
Clarke expressed the view that the rapid rise in Mr. Epstein&#146;s
blood glucose level could not be explained simply by the lack of
insulin. He thought there must have been &#147;something else going
on.&#148;
[46] For these reasons, I am of the view that the finding of
liability against Dr. Fell cannot stand.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c) Dr. Hamilton</pre>
    <pre>[47] The trial judge essentially based her finding of liability
against Dr. Hamilton on his failure to act upon the information
he received from the nurse when he was called at home at 11:30
p.m. on November 4. She concluded as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               When Dr. Hamilton received advice from the nurse of the
          hyperventilation, the 16.2 glucose reading, the fact that the
          plaintiff was rolling from side to side and the intravenous
          problem, he should at that point have called Dr. Gorman, at
          least&#133;.As the admitting physician, Dr. Hamilton had primary
          responsibility for the care of this patient.  Both doctors Fell
          and Hamilton failed to notice and react to signs of ketoacidosis.
          Both being experienced specialists, they ought to have seen and
          acted on those signs.  Notwithstanding this plaintiff&#146;s bizarre
          and violent behaviour in hospital, he was entitled to proper care
          for his diabetic condition.  In fact, his treatment for diabetes
          fell between the slats and was not properly attended to until
          there was an emergency.</pre>
    <pre>[48] I have already indicated that, in my view, the preponderance
of evidence does not support a finding that Mr. Epstein was
exhibiting signs of ketoacidosis at the time the nurse called Dr.
Hamilton.
[49] Further, much as in the case of Dr. Gorman, there is no
expert evidence as to what standard of care would be expected in
the circumstances. None of the experts provided any opinion as to
whether Dr. Hamilton, as a general surgeon, had met or failed to
meet the standard of care required of him. There is also no
evidence that Dr. Hamilton&#146;s conduct in any way caused or
contributed to the loss.
[50] Accordingly, there is no evidentiary basis for the trial
judge&#146;s finding of fault against Dr. Hamilton.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[51] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment below and dismiss the action.
[52] With respect to damages, the trial judge awarded the sum of
$40,000 by way of compensation for the &#147;indignity of the coma&#148;
and &#147;minimal&#148; sequelae in the form of bruising and leg swelling.
In light of my conclusion on the question of liability, it is not
necessary to deal with the assessment of damages. I wish to note
for the benefit of the parties, however, that, having regard to
the jurisprudence respecting claims of this nature, it is my view
that the award is grossly excessive. I would reduce it to, at
most, half that award.
[53] Finally, the jurisprudence on the question of set-off is
minimal and far from unanimous.  As a consequence, I refrain from
dealing with that question now that it has become moot.
[54] I would allow the appellants their costs of the trial and of
the appeal.

                              (signed) &quot;I agree Austin J.A.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>WEILER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[55] I  agree with Charron J.A.&#146;s disposition of the appeal
concerning Drs. Gorman, Fell and Hamilton.  With respect to Dr.
Fell, I agree with Charron J.A. first, that the trial judge
misapprehended the evidence of Dr. Clarke with respect to when he
would have restarted insulin for Mr. Epstein; second, that the
trial judge erred in her conclusion that the preponderance of
evidence supported a finding that Dr. Fell failed to take steps
that he ought to have taken with respect to Mr. Epstein; and
third, that the evidence does not support a finding that Dr. Fell
was informed of signs of ketoacidosis, a stuporous condition
resulting from a lack of insulin. Mr. Epstein was reported by the
nurses to be agitated, not drowsy.
[56] Charron J.A. concludes, fourth, that the trial judge failed
to consider the effect of an erroneous glucometer reading showing
a blood sugar level of 6.9, on the overall course of action taken
by Dr. Fell. I agree with this conclusion, particularly when it
is considered with what Dr. Fell was told at the time of the
preceding glucometer reading of 16.2.   At that time, Dr. Fell
testified he was told by the nurse that Mr. Epstein was
improving; that he had no other complaints or symptoms; that he
had a history of uncooperative behaviour, and emotional and
behavioural problems. When the reading of 6.9 was obtained, Dr.
Fell was told that Mr. Epstein was lying in bed moaning and
avoiding eye contact.  This symptom was consistent with Mr.
Epstein&#146;s initial complaint upon admission, namely, abdominal
cramps. Dr. Fell testified that, at the time he was told about
the 6.9 reading, the nurse did not tell him that Mr. Epstein had
been complaining of thirst and hyperventilating, two symptoms
that would have been consistent with ketoacidosis.
[57] It is with Charron J.A.&#146;s final conclusion concerning Dr.
Fell in paragraph 45 that I respectfully disagree.  She states &#147;&#133;
that there is no evidence that the hyperglycemic coma suffered by
Mr. Epstein is causally connected to the failure to restart the
insulin at the relevant times, either late November 4 or in the
early hours of November 5.  The trial judge does not address the
element of causation in her reasons.&#148;
[58] Farrell v. Snell (1990), 72 D.L.R. (4th) 289 (S.C.C.),
stands for the proposition that it is not essential to have a
positive medical opinion that the plaintiff&#146;s condition was
caused by the treatment in question.  In Anderson and Fischer v.
Wilson et. al., released July 7, 1999, at p.13, Carthy J.A.
commented that, as a result of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s
decision, &#147;The trial judge may apply common sense to the evidence
and draw an inference that the failure to meet the required
standard of competence was the cause of the injury.&#148;
[59] It is implicit in the trial judge&#146;s finding of negligence
against the appellant doctors that she drew the inference that
the hyperglycemic coma suffered by Mr. Epstein was causally
connected to the failure to restart insulin sooner.  As the trial
judge explained in her reasons, diabetes mellitus, the metabolic
disorder from which Mr. Epstein suffered, is caused by abnormally
high blood sugar levels or hyperglycemia.  Diabetes of this type
requires regular insulin injections in order to reduce the level
of blood sugar because the pancreas produces little or no
insulin.  While in the hospital, Mr. Epstein was given a small
amount of insulin and he suffered a hypoglycemic reaction, a
condition in which the blood sugar level is too low.  Insulin was
stopped by Dr. Gorman in order for a physician to judge when to
restart insulin and how much insulin to administer.
[60] Dr. Hare testified that where a patient has insulin-
dependent diabetes, and where insulin has been discontinued
because of a low blood sugar level, once the sugar clearly rises
to a normal level, the insulin should be re-instituted.  In his
opinion, a normal level was 11 and &#147;&#133; once it is above 11, it is
clearly elevated and I think at that point insulin should be re-
instituted.&#148;  That said, by 11:30 a.m. on November 3, the
readings were elevated.  If insulin had not already been started,
Dr. Hare would most definitely have administered it at the time
the reading of 16.2 was attained on November 4. He acknowledged,
however, this was a judgment call.  Dr. Hare testified that the
required standard of care was breached due to the inattention
given to Mr. Epstein&#146;s condition from the time he had the
hypoglycemic episode on November 1 to his hyperglycemic state on
November 5.  He also attributed it to the failure to obtain
laboratory blood work to be certain that the glucometer readings
were correct, particularly the reading of 6.9.  These failures,
he testified, led to Mr. Epstein&#146;s ketoacidosis.
[61] Charron J.A. notes that Dr. Gorman, Dr. Kenshole, and Dr.
Clarke expressed the view that the administration of five units
of insulin at the time of the 16.2 reading would not have
prevented Mr. Epstein from going into a hyperglycemic coma. Their
evidence does not address what would have happened had insulin
been started when Mr. Epstein&#146;s blood sugar level was eleven.
Nor does their evidence address what the result would have been
had the glucometer reading of 6.9 been verified as being
incorrect and appropriate  insulin been started at that juncture.
[62] In view of this, I cannot agree that there was no evidence
on which to conclude that the hyperglycemic coma suffered by Mr.
Epstein was causally connected to the failure to restart insulin
sooner.  I do agree, however, that for the reasons earlier
expressed by Charron J.A., the failure to restart insulin sooner
was not due to a breach of the required standard of care by the
appellant doctors.  The doctors relied on the reports they
received from the nurses as to Mr. Epstein&#146;s condition and
symptoms.  This reliance was in accordance with the established
standard of care.
