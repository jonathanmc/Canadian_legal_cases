    <pre>On appeal from the order of Blair J. dated November 25, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  The order under appeal was granted by Blair J. under
s.187(5) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act which gave him the
discretion to review, rescind or vary any order made by the court
under the Act.
[2]  In our view, Blair J. did not improperly exercise his
discretion in rescinding the order of Chadwick J. appointing an
interim receiver.
[3]  Accordingly the appeal from the order of Blair J. is
dismissed with costs.</pre>
