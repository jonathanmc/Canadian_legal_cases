    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The onus, of course, is on the appellant to establish that
the representation provided by trial counsel was incompetent: R.
v. Joanisse. In our view, this onus has not been met. The trial
counsel was faced with certain tactical decisions and while other
counsel may have conducted the defence differently, incompetent
representation has not been established. In coming to this
conclusion, we have looked at the items of complaint individually
and collectively.

[2]  The other significant issue before us was whether the
included offences should have been put before the jury by the
trial judge. This is somewhat troubling but given the strong
evidence of what took place inside the car, we conclude that it
would have been speculation for a jury to have a doubt based on
what was observed outside the car. It follows therefore that if
the jury was satisfied that the appellant struck the blows inside
the car, that he would have been guilty of manslaughter.

[3]  We see no merit in the other grounds of appeal.

[4]  In relation to the sentence appeal, the sentence was high,
but in our view, not unfit especially in light of the other
serious assault committed by the appellant while on bail on this
charge as well as his lengthy criminal record.

[5]  The appeals as to conviction and sentence are therefore
dismissed.</pre></td>
