    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            FCH WAREHOUSE INC. (Respondent/Plaintiff and
	       Defendant by Counterclaim) &#150;and&#150; AXIS FABRICS LTD.
 	       carrying on business STAR FASHIONS
	      (Appellant/Defendant and Plaintiff by Counterclaim)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, WEILER and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       David M. Sanders, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Lawrence F. Wallach, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 18, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Herold J. dated March 17, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]    The  issue on this appeal is whether Herold  J.  erred  in
dismissing  the defence and counterclaim of Axis and in  granting
judgment in favour of FCH.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  FCH sued Axis and its principals personally on an NSF cheque
and,  at  the same time, served a motion for judgment.  Axis  and
its  principals filed a defence stating that FCH had fraudulently
obtained  the  cheque and that it did not owe any  money  to  FCH
because it had not purchased goods from it.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   On  the return of FCH&#146;s motion for judgment on December  3,
1998, Axis consented to an order that each party pay $20,000 into
court  by January 11, 1999 and that the action be tried the  week
of  March 5, 1999.  An extension of the deadline for payment into
court  was granted to January 30, 1999.  FCH paid its money  into
court on January 29, 1999 and served a motion returnable March 17
seeking  judgment due to the failure of Axis to pay  the  sum  of
$20,000  into  court.  Axis brought a motion  seeking  a  further
extension of time to March 30, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Herold J. dismissed the motion and struck Axis&#146; statement of
defence.   He  then  gave  summary  judgment  against  Axis   but
dismissed   the  motion  for  judgment  against  the   individual
defendants.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   At the time the consent order was made, there was no motion
before  Herold  J.  for  security  for  costs  or  for  a  Mareva
injunction.  There was no evidence before Herold J. that Axis was
dissipating its assets.  FCH was not entitled, at that  stage  of
the  proceedings, to an order that Axis pay into court the amount
of  $20,000.   The  order was made on consent.  In  our  opinion,
Herold  J.  did not give appropriate consideration or  weight  to
this factor in balancing the competing interests of the parties.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   With  respect  to  the question of  prejudice,  the  action
against  the individuals who represent the company is  proceeding
in  any event.  The order striking Axis&#146; statement of defence was
not  warranted.   We  would allow the appeal and  set  aside  the
judgment,  all  without prejudice to FCH to bring  a  motion  for
security for costs, if so advised.  There will be no costs of the
appeal.</pre>
