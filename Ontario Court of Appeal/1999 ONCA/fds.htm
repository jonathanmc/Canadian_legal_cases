    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  After a trial by Simmonds J. and a jury, the appellant was
convicted on ten counts in an indictment alleging that he had
assaulted and abused his wife during a period of approximately
one year. 1  The appellant was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of three and one-half years.
[2]  The appellant appeals his convictions and submits that the
trial judge erred in the following four respects:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  in admitting evidence of discreditable conduct of the
          appellant that did not form part of the allegations in the
          indictment;
     (b)  in admitting expert evidence relating to the behavioural
          characteristics of women who report living in abusive
          relationships;
     (c)  in instructing the jury on the issue of consent under s.
          265(3)(b) of the Criminal Code with respect to the count of
          sexual assault; and
     (d)  in instructing the jury on the issue of self-defence on a
          charge of assault with a weapon.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant and complainant were married in August 1993.
After their honeymoon, they moved into a house that they had
purchased, and lived together until the complainant left the
appellant in early August 1994. The ten charges were based on
allegations made by the complainant of abuse on five separate
occasions during the time they lived together.
[5]  The complainant testified that in November 1993 the
appellant became angry when he learned that she had given a key
for the house to her brother. He held a knife to her throat and
threatened to kill her. The complainant disclosed this incident
to her sister-in-law and mother-in-law the same night it
occurred, and to a priest about a month later. She did not report
it to the police until August 5, 1994, shortly after she had left
the appellant.
[6]  The second incident occurred in April 1994. The complainant
testified that she entered the bedroom and heard the appellant
making sexual comments over the telephone. The appellant hung up,
but the complainant took the phone, pushed the redial button and
screamed at the woman to leave her husband alone. The appellant
punched the complainant a number of times with a closed fist. The
next night the complainant went to a hospital where the doctor
found that there was substantial bruising of the complainant&#146;s
hand. When asked about the origin of the injury to her hand by
the doctor and later by her brother, she stated that she had
fallen down a flight of stairs. The complainant did not report
this incident to the police until August 5, 1994.
[7]  Next, the complainant testified that in July 1994 when she
and the appellant were driving home from a visit with her
brother, the appellant hit her with his hand. Later, at home, he
held her on a loveseat for half an hour and repeatedly head-
butted her. The complainant tried to leave a number of times but
the appellant prevented her from doing so. These events were not
reported to the police on August 5, 1994 when the complainant
reported other abuse. The complainant testified that in December
1994 she had a flashback, after which she first reported this
incident to the police.
[8]  The fourth incident about which the complainant testified
occurred on August 2, 1994. In the course of an argument, the
complainant waved kitchen tongs at the appellant and said she
felt like shoving the tongs down his throat. The appellant
grabbed the complainant and threw her up against the fridge. He
took the tongs and jammed them into her neck causing her neck to
bleed. The appellant put the complainant in a headlock, threw her
to the floor and punched and kicked her for about 10 minutes. The
complainant reported this incident to the police on August 5,
1994. A week later, the complainant went to a walk-in clinic, and
the doctor found that she had a crusted scab on her neck. The
complainant told the doctor about the incident that caused the
injury.
[9]  Lastly, the complainant testified that on the night of
August 3, 1994 she was in bed. The appellant got into bed and
started to fondle her breasts. She told him not to touch her.
When he tried to feel between her legs, she jumped out of bed and
said she was going downstairs. The appellant replied, &#147;if you
leave now I&#146;ll kick both you and your brother out.&#148;  The
complainant started crying and got back into bed. The appellant
held her hands behind her head and had sexual intercourse with
her. The complainant testified that she did not consent to the
intercourse. She did not report this incident to the police until
August 9, 1994.
[10] At trial, the position of the defence was that the
complainant was not a credible witness and that the events that
she described either did not happen at all or did not happen the
way she described them. In arguing that the complainant was not
credible, the defence attached importance to the complainant&#146;s
delay in reporting some of the incidents set out above,  to her
inconsistent description of the cause of the injuries to her hand
in April 1994 and to the fact that she remained in the marital
relationship for a considerable time after some of the incidents
about which she later complained.
[11] The complainant&#146;s explanations for not immediately leaving
the relationship and disclosing the abuse were not complicated.
In some instances, she explained, she was embarrassed, in others
that she was frightened, and on another occasion she thought the
appellant would change.
[12]  The appellant did not testify.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     1. Evidence of Discreditable Conduct</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
permitting the complainant to testify about abusive behaviour of
the appellant that was not included in any of the allegations
covered by the ten counts in the indictment. The appellant argues
that the prejudicial effect of this evidence of discreditable
conduct outweighed any probative value it had in establishing
that the appellant was guilty of the offences with which he was
charged.
[14] In this regard, the complainant testified that shortly after
the marriage, the appellant started calling her names and using
abusive language. Within the first few months of the marriage, he
began to push and shove her and sometimes hit her. After the
incident with the knife in November 1993, the appellant&#146;s conduct
became worse; the appellant would punch, slap and kick her at
least once a week. The complainant also testified that although
the couple had consensual sexual relations throughout the
marriage, on many occasions the appellant had sexual intercourse
with her without her consent.
[15] Further, the complainant described the appellant as a very
controlling person in dealing with the couple&#146;s financial and
social arrangements and also as a person who frequently became
angry. She testified that as a result she was frightened of the
appellant.
[16] In R. v. B. (L.); R. v. G. (M.A.) (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d)
481 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 490 Charron J.A. set out the principles
which govern the admissibility of evidence of discreditable
conduct:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Because of the inherently prejudicial nature of
          evidence of discreditable conduct it is subject to a general
          exclusionary rule unless the &#147;scales tip in favour of probative
          value&#148; (R. v. Morin, supra, at p. 368) [[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, 44
          C.C.C. (3d) 193]. The trial judge who is charged with the
          delicate process of balancing the probative value of the proposed
          evidence against its prejudicial effect should inquire into the
          following matters.
          </pre>
    <pre>               1. Is the conduct, which forms the
          subject-matter of the proposed evidence, that
          of the accused?
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.  If so, is the proposed evidence
          relevant and material?
          </pre>
    <pre>               3. If relevant and material, is the
          proposed evidence discreditable to the
          accused?
          </pre>
    <pre>               4. If discreditable, does its probative
          value outweigh its prejudicial effect?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[17] In this case there is no dispute regarding the first and
third criteria. The evidence in issue described conduct of the
appellant and was discreditable to him. The appellant argues,
however, that this evidence ought to have been excluded under
both the second and fourth prongs of the test in B. (L.).</pre>
    <pre>          Relevance and Materiality</pre>
    <pre>[18] In B. (L.), Charron J.A. described the relevance and
materiality of evidence at p. 492 in the following manner:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is relevant &#147;where it has some tendency as a matter of
          logic and human experience to make the proposition for which it
          is advanced more likely than that proposition would appear to be
          in the absence of that evidence&#148; (Paciocco &amp; Stuesser, supra, at
          p. 19 [Essentials of Canadian Law:  The Law of Evidence (1996)]).
          It is material if it is directed at a matter in issue in the
          case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Generally, this basic threshold of relevance
          and materiality can be tested by asking what
          inference is sought to be made from the
          proposed evidence and whether it has some
          tendency to advance the inquiry before the
          court.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[19] In this case, the trial judge held that the evidence of
discreditable conduct was admissible for three purposes: to
complete the narrative of the complainant&#146;s description of her
relationship with the appellant; to demonstrate the possible
motive or animus of the appellant in committing the offences
alleged; and to bolster the credibility of the complainant by
providing an explanation for her failure to leave the
relationship and report the allegations of abuse earlier than she
did. I will consider each of these purposes separately.
[20] In cases involving allegations of physical and sexual abuse
in the course of an ongoing relationship, courts have frequently
admitted evidence of discreditable conduct to assist the court in
understanding the relationship between the parties and the
context in which the alleged abuse occurred.
[21] In R. v. Litchfield (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 97, the Supreme
Court of Canada held that the evidence of sexual abuse of
different complainants by the accused should have been admitted
with respect to the counts relating to each of the other
complainants. At p. 116 Iacobucci J. reasoned as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While this evidence could be characterized as evidence of
          similar acts or events, the evidence was not tendered solely to
          show that the respondent was a person of bad character or of a
          disposition likely to commit the alleged offences. Rather, the
          evidence provided information highly relevant to understanding
          the context in which the alleged offences occurred and shed light
          on the nature of the respondent&#146;s relationship with his patients,
          particularly the standard of medical treatment he provided.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>     See also R. v. S.B., [1996] O.J. No. 1187 (Gen. Div.); 
R. v. Craigg, [1986] O.J. No. 2123 (C.A.); and R. v. Dovak, [1989] O.J.
No. 2499 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada 
refused [1990] 1 S.C.R. vii.</pre>
    <pre>[22] In this case it was important to put the complainant&#146;s
evidence supporting the charges in the context of the overall
relationship. The complainant&#146;s evidence was that the allegations
underlying the charges were consistent with the attitude and
behaviour that the appellant exhibited towards her throughout the
one year period that they lived together. The challenged evidence
would enable the jury to more fairly evaluate the complainant&#146;s
evidence regarding the specific allegations. Excluding that
evidence would have left the jury with an incomplete and possibly
misleading impression of the relationship. In my view, the
disputed evidence was relevant for the purpose of setting forth
the contextual narrative in the course of which the alleged
events occurred.
[23] The trial judge also held that the discreditable conduct
evidence was admissible for the purpose of demonstrating the
motive or animus of the appellant in committing the offences
alleged. It is well established that evidence of motive is
admissible to prove the doing of an act as well as the intent
with which the act is done. R. v. Jackson (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d)
154 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 167.
[24] On several occasions courts have held that evidence of
discreditable conduct, in particular evidence of abusive
behaviour towards a complainant, is admissible for this purpose.
R. v. Summerbell, [1996] O.J. 795 (C.A.); R. v. MacDonald (1974),
20 C.C.C. (2d) 144 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Pheasant, [1995] O.J. No.
1215 (Gen. Div.) and R. v. S.B., supra.
[25] In this case, the evidence, which in general terms described
a pattern of abusive behaviour towards the complainant, if
accepted, was capable of assisting the jury in understanding why
the appellant did what was alleged in the indictment. This
evidence demonstrated an animus on the appellant&#146;s part towards
the complainant that was consistent with the offences with which
he was charged. The trial judge was correct in holding that the
impugned evidence was relevant for this purpose.
[26] Finally, the trial judge held that the discreditable conduct
evidence could be relevant to the explanation by the complainant
for her failure to leave the relationship and to report the abuse
earlier. The complainant was vigorously challenged in cross-
examination about the delay in reporting some of the allegations
and her delay in leaving the marriage. The complainant&#146;s evidence
about the pattern of ongoing abuse and her fear of the appellant
were important parts of her explanation for her conduct in this
regard. The evidence of discreditable conduct was also relevant
for this purpose.
[27] In my view the trial judge was correct in holding that the
evidence of discreditable conduct was relevant for the purposes
set out above. The evidence was also clearly material, in that it
was directed at the central issue in the case, the credibility of
the complainant.</pre>
    <pre>          Probative Value/Prejudicial Effect</pre>
    <pre>[28] The fourth step in the test set out in B. (L.) is to
determine whether the probative value of the evidence in question
outweighs its prejudicial effect.
[29] In assessing the probative value, Charron J.A. in B. (L.)
indicated that consideration should be given to the strength of
the evidence, the extent to which it supports the inferences
sought to be made and the extent to which the matters it tends to
prove are in issue. The trial judge concluded that the
discreditable conduct evidence in this case had significant
probative value.
[30] The complainant was the only witness who gave evidence of
discreditable conduct. The strength of that evidence obviously
depended on the jury&#146;s assessment of her credibility. However the
evidence, if accepted, was strongly supportive of the Crown&#146;s
case. It helped to show the animus of the appellant without which
the jury may have wondered why, in a seemingly otherwise normal
relationship, the appellant would behave as the complainant
described. The evidence enabled the jury to understand the
relationship and, importantly, strongly supported the
complainant&#146;s explanation for not leaving or reporting sooner. It
therefore related to the central issues in the case. I agree with
the trial judge that the probative value of this evidence was
high.
[31] The trial judge carefully considered the prejudicial effect
of the evidence. The primary concern with this type of evidence
is that the jury may misuse it by inferring guilt based on the
bad character or disposition of an accused.
[32] There are a number of factors which reduce the potential
prejudicial effect of the evidence in this case. First, the
evidence was highly probative of material issues in the case. In
B. (L.) at p. 505, Charron J.A. observed that high probative
value will tend to make it less likely that the evidence will be
used improperly.
[33] Next, the evidence of discreditable conduct was entirely
that of the complainant. This was not a case in which the
complainant&#146;s credibility was bolstered by a third party
testifying about the discreditable conduct of the appellant. If
the jurors did not accept the complainant&#146;s evidence about the
charges, they were unlikely to have been greatly swayed by the
additional evidence of discreditable conduct. See Gregg, &#147;Other
Acts of Sexual Misbehaviour and Perversion as Evidence in
Prosecutions for Sexual Offences&#148; (1965), 6 Ariz. L.R. 212 at p.
220.
[34] Finally, in the charge to the jury, the trial judge gave a
very clear limiting instruction on the purpose for which the jury
could use the evidence, and importantly, the trial judge
instructed the jury that they could not use this evidence to
conclude that the appellant was the type of person who would be
disposed to commit the offences with which he was charged.
[35] In my view, the trial judge correctly concluded that the
probative value of this evidence outweighed its prejudicial
effect and properly held the evidence to be admissible. I
therefore see no merit in this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     2. Expert Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[36] At trial, the Crown sought to call Deborah Sinclair to give
expert evidence about what she referred to in a written report as
the &#147;battered women&#146;s syndrome.&#148; In the course of her evidence on
a voir dire, Ms. Sinclair described this &#147;syndrome&#148; as that
condition experienced by many women who report living in abusive
intimate relationships including the effect of the abuse upon
them and their behaviourial patterns in responding to that abuse.
[37] Ms. Sinclair has a Bachelor&#146;s Degree in psychology and
sociology and a Master&#146;s Degree in social work (with both a
research and clinical component). For approximately 19 years she
had worked, studied, taught and written in the area of violence
and abuse in intimate relationships. She estimated that she had
been involved in counselling approximately 600 families in which
domestic violence had been reported. Her evidence had been
accepted as that of an expert in the area of domestic abuse by
courts in Ontario on approximately 36 different occasions.
[38] After the voir dire, the trial judge ruled that most of the
proposed evidence of Ms. Sinclair was inadmissible. Specifically,
the trial judge excluded Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence that described
the general behavioural pattern or profile of abused persons in
intimate relationships and also her opinion that the complainant
came within this profile and was therefore suffering from having
been in an ongoing abusive marital relationship.
[39] However, the trial judge admitted Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence
with respect to the following matters:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.   a statement of the forms of abuse listed in her report;
2.   opinion evidence as to the observed tendency of persons who
report living in abusive intimate relationships to remain in or
leave a relationship following an incident of abuse;
3.   opinion evidence as to the observed tendency of persons who
report living in an abusive intimate relationship to disclose or
not disclose the fact or extent of alleged abuse or to minimize
or to fabricate in relation to such matters, while continuing in
a relationship; and
4.   the extent to which her evidence concerning the foregoing is
based upon her own experience, surveys, studies and general
literature in the relevant areas.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The trial judge held that this evidence was admissible for
the limited purpose of assisting the jury in evaluating the
complainant&#146;s explanation as to why, following some of the
alleged incidents of abuse, she did not immediately leave the
relationship and accurately report the alleged abuse.
[41] Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence before the jury was extremely brief;
after the description of her qualifications, the examination-in-
chief covered less than four pages of transcript and the cross-
examination one page. In answer to the specific questions
permitted by the ruling of the trial judge, Ms. Sinclair
expressed the opinions that it was quite typical for persons who
are battered or abused in a relationship to remain in the
relationship for a period of time; that it was quite unusual for
persons who are being abused in intimate relationships to report
it to outsiders before they are ready to leave the relationship;
and that it was not unusual for those persons to minimize or
fabricate what has happened to them if they are reporting an
injury to a health care person or someone else.
[42] In her charge to the jury, the trial judge gave a careful
instruction on the limited use that could be made of this
evidence.  She said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The purpose of such evidence is to assist you in determining
          whether an inference adverse to the credibility of the
          complainant should be drawn based on the evidence of the manner
          and timing and consistency of her disclosure. It may or may not
          assist you in that respect. Your duty is to consider the evidence
          of Ms. Sinclair and weigh it in the balance. You must not be
          overwhelmed or unduly swayed by the credentials of a particular
          witness just because he or she is permitted to give expert
          evidence. While her evidence concerning observed behaviours in
          persons who report abuse in intimate relationships may or may not
          assist you in assessing the credibility of the complainant in the
          manner I have described, I emphasize you must not use her
          evidence and it is not relevant for any other purpose. You may
          not, for example, use her evidence to increase or bolster the
          credibility of the complainant. Aside from considering her
          evidence in relation to the credibility of the complainant in the
          manner which I have described, you may not use her evidence for
          the purpose of assessing the likelihood that the events described
          by [the complainant] occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[43] In R. v. Mohan (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 243 (S.C.C.), Sopinka
J. set out the four criteria for the admission of expert evidence
at p. 252:
               (a)  relevance;
               (b)  necessity in assisting the trier of fact;
               (c)  the absence of any exclusionary rule;
               (d)  a properly qualified expert.</pre>
    <pre>[44] The appellant accepts that the expert evidence of Ms.
Sinclair was relevant and that there was no exclusionary rule
that would have prevented her from testifying. The appellant
contends,  however, that the trial judge erred in admitting the
evidence because there was not a sufficient evidentiary
foundation to establish that the evidence was either reliable or
necessary.
[45] The reliability of expert evidence is not one of the four
criteria set out in Mohan, however, it clearly is an essential
requirement for the admission of expert evidence. In some cases,
reliability has been considered as a element of the relevancy
criteria (see for example Mohan) and in others as part of the
need to have a qualified expert (R. v. McIntosh (1997), 117
C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.)).</pre>
    <pre>          Reliability</pre>
    <pre>[46] The appellant makes three arguments about the reliability of
the expert evidence admitted by the trial judge. The first arises
from what the appellant submits is an inconsistency in the
reasoning of the trial judge in excluding some parts of Ms.
Sinclair&#146;s evidence and admitting others.
[47] The evidence that was excluded described the profile or
general behavioural patterns of persons who had been abused, and
included an opinion that the complainant came within this profile
and was therefore suffering from the impact of having been in an
ongoing abusive marital relationship.
[48] In rejecting this evidence the trial judge noted that Ms.
Sinclair&#146;s opinion was based almost entirely on her own
experience. The trial judge held that the absence of evidence of
an objective test of the reliability of such an opinion and of an
objective means of evaluating the reliability of the opinion
disqualified the evidence. The trial judge&#146;s reasoning in this
respect turned on Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence that there was no
existing profile or comprehensive statement of the impacts on or
behaviour patterns of an abused person that would support a
conclusion that one person had been abused and another had not.
[49] In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge was applying,
correctly in my view, the requirement for the admissibility of
expert evidence which was subsequently articulated by Finlayson
J.A. in R. v. McIntosh, supra, at p. 392, as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Paraphrasing freely from the definition of &#147;science&#148; in The
          Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, it
          seems to me that before a witness can be permitted to testify as
          an expert, the court must be satisfied that the subject-matter of
          his or her expertise is a branch of study in psychology concerned
          with a connected body of demonstrated truths or with observed
          facts systematically classified and more or less connected
          together by a common hypothesis operating under general laws. The
          branch should include trustworthy methods for the discovery of
          new truths within its own domain. I should add that it would be
          helpful if there was evidence that the existence of such a branch
          was generally accepted within the science of psychology.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>     See also R. v. B.M., [1998] O.J. No. 4359 (C.A.) per Rosenberg J.A.</pre>
    <pre>[50] The evidence that the trial judge admitted was considerably
narrower in its scope and its purpose than the excluded evidence.
The admitted evidence was limited to the observed tendency of
persons who have been abused to remain in the relationship for
some time and to not immediately disclose the abuse. It was not
admitted to establish that the complainant had been abused, as
she alleged, but rather to put in context her explanation for not
having immediately left the relationship and disclosed the abuse.
The effect of the evidence was that the complainant&#146;s explanation
was not as unusual as it might otherwise seem.
[51] The difference between the excluded evidence and that
admitted by the trial judge was described well in the
respondent&#146;s factum, &#147;... there is a difference between saying
&#145;people who behave this way have been abused&#146; (a diagnosis) and
saying &#145;people who have been abused may behave this way&#146; (an
explanation of behaviour based on clusters of observed
tendencies).&#148;
[52] Ms. Sinclair&#146;s opinion, with respect to this evidence, was
based on her own clinical experience. However, she testified that
her opinion was consistent with the findings of a number of
studies including a Statistics Canada survey of 12,000 women
carried out in 1993, the Report of the Canadian Panel on Violence
which was based on hundreds of interviews, separate studies by
Dr. Murray Strauss and Dr. Richard Gells in the United States and
Dr. Richard Jaffe in Canada.
[53] Although it would have been preferable if these studies had
been produced and evidence had been led with respect to the
methodology employed and the specific conclusions reached, I am
satisfied that there was a sufficient basis to find that the
subject matter of the admitted evidence met the test for
reliability discussed in McIntosh. That, it seems to me, was the
fundamental difference between the evidence that was admitted and
the excluded evidence. I find no inconsistency in the trial
judge&#146;s reasoning in this respect.
[54] Next, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
admitting the evidence because the studies referred to by Ms.
Sinclair had not been produced. Although, as I said above, it
would have been preferable if those studies had been made
available, that is a matter that went to the weight not the
admissibility of Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence. At trial, it was open
to the defence to challenge Ms. Sinclair&#146;s general statements
about the empirical or scientific support for her opinions. It
did not do so. I do not think the trial judge erred in this
respect.
[55] Thirdly, although the appellant accepts that the expert
evidence was relevant, he argues that the evidence should have
been excluded because its reliability was questionable, its
probative value was minimal, and its probative value was
outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The first difficulty with
this argument is that at trial the defence did not seriously
challenge the reliability of the admitted evidence; there is no
basis in the evidence to support the submission that its
reliability was questionable.
[56] In any event, the concern that the jury would use this
evidence for a purpose unfairly prejudicial to the appellant was
minimal. The evidence was straightforward, easily understood and
lasted a matter of minutes in the course of a very lengthy trial.
This was not a case in which there was a danger that the expert
evidence would overwhelm the other evidence and unfairly
influence the jury. Further, as I set out above, the trial judge
gave a clear instruction on the limited purpose for which the
evidence was admitted. I see no merit in this argument that the
probative value of this evidence was outweighed by its
prejudicial effect.
[57] In my view, the trial judge did not err in admitting this
evidence because of concerns about its reliability.</pre>
    <pre>          Necessity</pre>
    <pre>[58] Next, the appellant argues that Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence
failed to meet the necessity criterion set out in Mohan because
the jury did not need this evidence in order to appreciate the
complainant&#146;s explanation for failing to leave the relationship
and disclose the abuse. In this respect, the appellant argues
that Ms. Sinclair&#146;s evidence did not relate to matters that were
outside the normal experience of the jury.
[59] In Mohan, supra, Sopinka J. described the requirement for
necessity at p. 254, in the following manner:
          </pre>
    <pre>               What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the
          sense that it provide information &#147;which is likely to be outside
          the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury&#148;: as quoted by
          Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra [[1982] 2 S.C.R. 24]. As stated
          by Dickson J., the evidence must be necessary to enable the trier
          of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical
          nature. In Kelliher (Village) v. Smith,  [1931] S.C.R. 672, at p.
          684, this court, quoting from Beven on Negligence (4th ed. 1928),
          p. 141, stated that in order for expert evidence to be
          admissible, &#147;[t]he subject-matter of the inquiry must be such
          that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment
          about it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[60] In R. v. Lavallee (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 97, the Supreme
Court of Canada held that the expert evidence of a psychologist
describing &#147;the battered wife syndrome&#148; was admissible to assist
the jury in evaluating Ms. Lavallee&#146;s perception of imminent
danger in the context of her plea of self-defence. In the reasons
of the majority, Wilson J. explained the need for the evidence as
follows at p. 112:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Expert evidence on the psychological effect of
          battering on wives and common law partners must, it seems to me,
          be both relevant and necessary in the context of the present
          case. How can the mental state of the appellant be appreciated
          without it?  The average member of the public (or of the jury)
          can be forgiven for asking: Why would a woman put up with this
          kind of treatment?  Why should she continue to live with such a
          man?  How could she love a partner who beat her to the point of
          requiring hospitalization?  We would expect the woman to pack her
          bags and go. Where is her self-respect?  Why does she not cut
          loose and make a new life for herself?  Such is the reaction of
          the average person confronted with the so-called &#147;battered wife
          syndrome&#148;. We need help to understand it and help is available
          from trained professionals.</pre>
    <pre>     At p. 111, she stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The need for expert evidence in these areas can, however, be
          obfuscated by the belief that judges and juries are thoroughly
          knowledgeable about &#147;human nature&#148; and that no more is needed.
          They are, so to speak, their own experts on human behaviour.</pre>
    <pre>     See also, R. v. C.(G.) (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Nfld. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[61] The appellant argues that Lavallee is distinguishable
because the context was different. In Lavallee, the Supreme Court
reasoned that Ms. Lavallee&#146;s perception of imminent danger was
critical to the issue of self-defence and could not be evaluated
without reference to the history of battering and the expert
opinion as to the psychological impacts of that battering. That,
it is argued, is a more difficult matter to understand than the
complainant&#146;s explanation in this case for not immediately
leaving the relationship and disclosing the abuse. The appellant
submits that the different elements of the complainant&#146;s
explanation, embarrassment, fear and hope are basic human
emotions within the normal experience of the jury.
[62] Although it is correct that the purpose of the evidence in
Lavallee, to support a plea of self-defence, was different from
the purpose for which the evidence of Ms. Sinclair was admitted
in this case, the observations of the court in Lavallee about the
necessity of expert evidence to assist the jury in answering
questions such as why an abused woman would remain in a
relationship are applicable and, in my view, lend support to the
respondent&#146;s argument that these matters are beyond the normal
experience of jurors.
[63] The appellant submits that, rather than relying on Lavallee,
this case should be guided by this court&#146;s decision in R. v. D.D.
(1998), 113 O.A.C. 179. In D.D., it was held that expert evidence
explaining the delayed disclosure by a child sexual abuse victim
was not necessary to assist a jury and should not have been
admitted. At pp. 185-6, Finlayson J.A. said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This brings me to the fourth, and perhaps the most
          compelling, reason for rejecting Dr. Marshall&#146;s evidence:
          necessity. Once the expert concedes that delays in making
          disclosure about unpleasant matters, including the fact of the
          commission of a crime, are not restricted to children and can
          apply with equal force to adults, the question naturally arises:
          what does his testimony supply that is outside the normal
          experience?  This is not a case like R. v. Norman (D.L.) (1993),
          68 O.A.C. 22; 87 C.C.C. (3d) 153 (C.A.), which dealt with a
          syndrome unique to the complainant in that case known as child
          abuse accommodation syndrome. This testimony could apply to any
          complainant and not just in a sexual assault case. It is not
          necessary to assist the trier of fact in deciding any material
          fact. In permitting Dr. Marshall to testify, the trial judge did
          a disservice to the jury. He underestimated its capacity to
          understand this behaviour and to make a judgment based on the
          jurors&#146; collective knowledge of the behaviour of children and
          adults.</pre>
    <pre>     Finlayson J.A. went on to hold that the complainant&#146;s explanation
for not disclosing the sexual assaults, a concern that her mother might
ground her, had nothing to do with a psychological disorder and came 
within the normal experience of the jurors.</pre>
    <pre>[64] In this case, the question is whether the expert evidence
was necessary to enable the jury to properly appreciate the
complainant&#146;s explanation for not immediately leaving the
relationship and disclosing the abuse. This involved more than
simply understanding the meaning of the words used by the
complainant in giving her explanation. It also involved
appreciating the context in which the explanation was given; by
that I mean appreciating that persons who are abused in intimate
relationships may respond differently because of that
relationship than they would in other circumstances.
[65] There is no exact way to draw the line between what is
within the normal experience of a judge or a jury and what is
not. The normal experiences of different triers of fact may
differ. Over time the subject matters that come within the normal
experiences of judges and juries may change. The normal
experiences of those in one community may differ from those in
other communities. In the end, the court in each case will be
required to exercise its best judgment in deciding whether a
particular subject matter is or is not within the normal
experience of the trier of fact.
[66] It seems to me that in cases being tried with a jury, the
trial judge is in a better position than this court to determine
whether expert evidence is necessary to assist the jury in
evaluating evidence or drawing inferences from it. The trial
judge has the advantage of hearing the evidence in issue,
observing the jury and being able to appreciate the dynamics of
the particular trial. In addition, the trial judge may also be in
a better position to determine what may come within the normal
experience of the average juror in the community in which the
case is being tried. For those reasons, in my view, this court
should show some deference to the decisions of trial judges in
this area.
[67] Although I am inclined to think that the expert evidence
admitted in this case would come within the normal experience of
many jurors, I am not prepared to interfere with the decision to
admit the evidence on this basis. The trial judge was obviously
alive to the requirements set out in Mohan. She carefully
reviewed the proposed evidence, the purpose for which it was
being tendered and reached a considered judgment that it was
admissible. I am unable to conclude that she erred in doing so.
In my view, this ground of appeal therefore fails.</pre>
    <pre>     3. Charge to the Jury &#150; Sexual Assault/Consent</pre>
    <pre>[68] The trial judge left the jury with alternate theories of
liability on the charge of sexual assault. First, she instructed
the jury that they could find there was no consent because the
complainant resisted. Alternatively, she directed that if the
jury found that the complainant submitted or did not resist the
appellant by reason of threats or the fear of the application of
force to herself or to her brother, they could find the Crown had
proven a lack of consent under s. 265(3) of the Criminal Code.
[69] Section 265(3)(b) provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               265. (3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is
          obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by
          reason of
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) threats or fear of the application
          of force to the complainant or to a person
          other than the complainant.</pre>
    <pre>[70] The appellant argues that this alternate theory of
culpability should not have been left with the jury because it
lacked an air of reality.
[71] In support of this argument, the respondent relied on the
evidence of the complainant that, when she was leaving the
bedroom because the appellant had been engaging in unwanted
sexual advances, the appellant said to her &#147;if you leave now I&#146;ll
kick both you and brother out.&#148;  At that point, the complainant
testified, she turned around, started crying and came back
because she was afraid for both herself and her brother. Shortly
afterwards the sexual intercourse took place without her consent.
[72] The appellant contends that the words &#147;if you leave now I&#146;ll
kick both you and your brother out&#148; did not constitute a threat
of the application of force within the meaning of s. 265(3)(b).
[73] The trial judge instructed the jury that the threat referred
to in s. 265(3)(b) is a threat to apply force to the complainant
or another person; that they should examine the words objectively
to determine whether those words would convey a threat to apply
force to a reasonable person who found herself in the position of
the complainant with the past history of abuse by the appellant;
that it was necessary that the appellant have intended to
threaten to apply force to the complainant or her brother; and
that the reaction or belief of the complainant as to whether
these words constituted a threat was not an element of their
consideration as to whether or not they in fact constituted a
threat.
[74] In many situations, a threat &#147;to kick someone out of a
house&#148; would not constitute a threat to apply force; it would be
nothing more than a colloquial expression of an intent to cause
that person to leave the house. However, given the complainant&#146;s
evidence and the history of ongoing physical abuse, it was open
to the jury in this case to find that the appellant&#146;s language
did constitute a threat to apply physical force and the
complainant submitted to the act of intercourse by reason of that
threat. Counsel for the appellant (not Mr. Kapoor) did not object
to this evidence being put to the jury as a basis on which they
could find a threat of the application of force. I am not
satisfied that the trial judge erred in leaving the alternate
theory of culpability under s. 265(3)(b) with the jury.</pre>
    <pre>     4. Charge to the Jury &#150; Re Self-Defence</pre>
    <pre>[75] At trial, the appellant argued that if the jury found that
the appellant pushed the kitchen tongs into the complainant&#146;s
neck on August 2, 1994, they should find that he was acting in
self-defence.  The complainant testified that immediately before
the assault by the appellant she had waved the tongs in the
appellant&#146;s face and said that she felt like shoving the tongs
down his throat. The trial judge&#146;s charge on the issue of self-
defence covered eleven pages of the transcript. The appellant
accepts that the charge was proper except for the following
comment which came at the very end of the instruction on this
issue:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Finally, please remember again that lawful self-defence
          proceeds from necessity. The instinctive and intuitive need for
          self-preservation. It cannot be used as a cloak for aggression,
          retaliation or revenge. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[76] The trial judge repeated this instruction in response to a
question from the jury.
[77] The appellant argues that the problem with this instruction
is that it leaves the impression that even if the appellant
complied with the self-defence provisions of the Criminal Code,
the appellant could not avail himself of self-defence if he acted
out of &#147;aggression, retaliation or revenge.&#148;  The appellant
submits that a person acting in self-defence may also act
aggressively, or in a retaliatory manner. Accepting this
submission for purposes of this argument, I do not read the last
sentence set out above as qualifying or limiting the instruction
on self-defence that preceded it.
[78] I note that counsel at trial did not object to this aspect
of the charge on any of the three opportunities he had to do so:
when invited to make a mid-charge comment immediately after the
direction was given, at the conclusion of the charge, or when the
instruction was repeated to the jury in answer to a question. The
failure of defence counsel to comment on the charge &#147;says
something about both the overall accuracy of the jury
instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection.&#148;
R. v. Jacquard (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at p. 19.
[79]
I am satisfied that given the thorough and accurate review by the
trial judge of the law of self-defence there was no possibility
that the jury would have been misled by the reference referred to
above. This ground of appeal therefore fails.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[80] In summary, for all of the above reasons, I would dismiss
the appeal.
