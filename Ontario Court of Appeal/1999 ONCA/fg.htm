    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]       On March 16, 1995, the appellant was convicted of
sexual assault by a court composed of Stayshyn J. and a jury. On
May 1, 1995, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. After
serving almost two and one-half years of that sentence, the
appellant applied for and was released on bail pending appeal.
The successful bail application was prompted by the discovery of
DNA evidence that the appellant argues should be admitted as
fresh evidence on his appeal from conviction. The appellant also
seeks to introduce other “fresh evidence” concerning the
culpability of one S.H. For the reasons that follow, I would
admit portions of the proposed fresh evidence, allow the appeal,
quash the conviction, and order a new trial.

THE FACTS

     The Trial Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[2]       The sexual assault in this case allegedly occurred in
the early morning hours of November 23, 1993 in the complainant’s
bedroom. The complainant was living in a house owned by her
parents. S.H. was renting a bedroom on the second floor of this
house. The appellant was S.H.'s friend. The jury heard evidence
that the complainant and S.H. had been “intimate”. The nature of
the relationship was not further explored at the trial. Defence
counsel did not seek to introduce evidence of that relationship
by way of an application under s. 276 of the Criminal Code.
[3]       On November 22, 1993, S.H., the appellant and the
complainant were painting the walls in the complainant’s home.
They were all drinking. Between 7:00 p.m. and 8:15 p.m., they
consumed twelve bottles of beer. They then went out to buy more
alcohol. They returned with a “mickey” of vodka as well as a 40-
ounce bottle of vodka, and resumed drinking and painting.
[4]       At one point during the evening the complainant was
standing on a ladder, painting. S.H. approached her and pulled
down her track pants and underwear to her knees. According to the
complainant, S.H. laughed and the appellant remarked that he
would:  “like to get ahold of that”. The complainant was angry;
she swore at S.H. and then sat on the couch and telephoned her ex-
boyfriend. The appellant sat beside her and touched her thigh
with his hand three times. The complainant told him not to touch
her. The complainant had her last drink at 10:50 p.m. and went to
bed between midnight and 1:00 a.m. By then, the beer and the
mickey of vodka were finished, and S.H. and the appellant were
starting to drink the remaining 40-ounce bottle of vodka.
[5]       Before the complainant went to bed, she locked her
bedroom door, took out her hearing aid and took off her
eyeglasses. She testified that without her glasses she could not
see distances well. She went to bed wearing a T-shirt, a bra and
pink underwear.
[6]       The complainant testified that in the early hours of
November 23, 1993, she awoke to find a man having sexual
intercourse with her. She testified that his penis was only in
her vagina for a couple of seconds. Her room was dark. She
testified that she placed her left hand on the man’s forehead and
felt no hair. She told him to get out of her room. The
complainant testified that as the assailant left her bedroom, she
could see him because of the light from the other room. She
testified he was wearing blue acid washed jeans and was not
wearing a shirt. She also testified that she could see the
person’s features; the complainant identified him as the
appellant.
[7]       The appellant has a receding hairline and was wearing
blue acid wash jeans on the night of November 22, 1993. S.H. has
a “full head of hair” and was also wearing blue acid wash jeans
that evening.
[8]       The complainant’s underwear had been removed during the
sexual assault. The complainant put on a different pair of
underwear and her housecoat. She went out into the living room
where S.H. and the appellant were sitting and told the appellant
she was calling her mother and then calling the police.
[9]       S.H. insisted that he, not the appellant, had been the
person in the complainant’s bedroom. S.H. tried to persuade her
not to call the police. The complainant testified that S.H.
threatened her, saying: “If you end me up in jail for a long time
I will kill you, I will come after you, me or my friend.”  S.H.
also took the telephone off the hook so that the complainant was
unable to call her mother. When the complainant’s mother did
arrive, she was unable to telephone the police for a time as S.H.
refused to get off the telephone. She testified that throughout
the evening S.H. repeated that he had been the one in the
complainant’s bedroom and that he was going to kill the
complainant if he had to go to jail. She also testified, however,
that she overheard the appellant saying to S.H.:  “I don’t know
why you’re fucking lying for me, you don’t have to lie, I did it,
I had a good time, I think I’ll do it again.”
[10] At 4:18 a.m. Police Constable Eleftheriou arrived at the
complainant’s home and arrested the appellant. After the arrest,
S.H. became hostile and said that the appellant had been sleeping
on the couch and had not done anything. S.H. said that he, not
the appellant, had raped the complainant.
[11] At the time of his arrest, the appellant was not wearing
underwear. The appellant was quiet and reasonably co-operative,
smelled somewhat of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes. At the police
station about three hours later, the appellant was described as
still being intoxicated. His speech was slurred and rambling.
When he was asked whether he knew why he had been arrested, the
appellant said: “I’m a rapist.”
[12] The complainant was examined at a hospital. The vaginal area
was normal and the results as to whether the complainant’s vagina
had been recently penetrated were inconclusive. No evidence of
ejaculation was found inside her vagina. Her clothing, including
two pairs of underwear, the pink pair that she was wearing at the
time of the assault and the white pair that she wore to the
hospital, were also taken for testing. Semen was found on the
white pair of underwear.
[13] The police also conducted an investigation at the
complainant’s bedroom. A police officer found a pair of men’s
underwear bearing the label “K. Beeching” in the complainant’s
bed. At trial, the complainant testified that she had never seen
the underwear before, that she does not know a “K. Beeching” and
that the underwear was not in her bed when she made it the
morning before the assault. The men’s underwear was examined and
tested by the Centre of Forensic Sciences and semen was detected.
The appellant voluntarily provided bodily samples for DNA
testing. DNA testing performed prior to the trial excluded the
appellant from being the donor of the semen. The expert testified
that traces of DNA can remain on clothing even after it has been
washed. No efforts were made by the Crown or the defence to
obtain a bodily sample from S.H. for the purposes of DNA testing.
[14] At trial, the jury heard that the investigating officer was
told that S.H. had made inculpatory statements to the police
officers at the scene. Two days after the assault, the
investigating officer interviewed S.H.. S.H. gave a statement but
refused to sign it. S.H. did not testify at the trial and no
efforts were made by the defence to lead evidence as to the
contents of the statement at the trial.
[15] The appellant testified at his trial. He confirmed most of
the complainant’s testimony as to the events before the
complainant went to sleep. However, he denied saying that he
would “like to get ahold of that” when S.H. pulled down the
complainant’s track pants and he denied touching the
complainant’s leg. His evidence was that he fell asleep on the
couch and woke up to be told the police were coming to the house.
He denied entering the complainant’s bedroom and he denied
sexually assaulting her. He also denied ownership of the K.
Beeching underwear and testified that he was not wearing
underwear at all that night.

     The Fresh Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[16] The fresh evidence falls into two categories:  The first
concerns further DNA testing done after friends of the appellant
were able to obtain bodily samples from S.H.; the other concerns
the proposed testimony of S.H. and his various inculpatory
statements.
[17] Turning to the first category of evidence, the semen found
on the “K. Beeching” underwear belonged to S.H.. Bodily
substances found on the white underwear that the complainant wore
to the hospital contained a mixture of semen from S.H. and bodily
substances from the complainant. Testing of the pink underwear
that the complainant wore to bed before the assault did not yield
any results. The appellant also seeks to introduce a hospital
record relating to the complainant’s examination following the
assault. According to this record, the complainant stated that
she had not had intercourse within a week of the assault.
[18] S.H.'s utterances and proposed testimony may be summarized
as follows. The morning of the assault, S.H. told several police
officers that the appellant was not a rapist, that the appellant
was asleep the whole time and never left the living room, that
S.H. would not have let anyone rape the complainant, that she was
“crazy” and that nothing happened. In the unsigned statement to
the investigating officer, S.H. indicated that the appellant
passed out a short time after the complainant went to bed. S.H.
stayed in the living room and continued to drink. At about 3:00
a.m. the complainant came out of the bedroom yelling that the
appellant had raped her. The appellant had been asleep the whole
time. S.H. admitted telling the other officers that he, not the
appellant, had raped the complainant. He said he did that so the
police would arrest him rather than the appellant.
[19] The appellant also seeks to introduce the evidence of
friends of S.H. who accompanied him to the police station.
According to them, before the interview with the investigating
officer, S.H. said that he had consensual intercourse with the
complainant in her bedroom on the night of the assault, but he
had not raped her. After the interview, S.H. went to the
appellant’s sister’s home where he told her and the appellant’s
mother that he had told the police that he had intercourse with
the complainant but did not rape her and that the appellant had
nothing to worry about. S.H. repeated this story about two years
later.
[20] Prior to the appeal, S.H. was cross-examined by counsel for
the appellant. In summary, S.H. said that he had consensual
intercourse with the complainant on a regular basis and had
intercourse with her the day before the assault. He testified
that the night of the assault he fell asleep on the couch in the
living room. He was then awakened by the complainant yelling that
the appellant had raped her. He never saw the appellant in the
complainant’s room. S.H. claimed to have no memory of most of the
inculpatory utterances he reportedly made to the police that
night. He denied making the statements attributed to him by his
friends and by the appellant’s relatives. S.H. denied the “K.
Beeching” underwear was his, even when confronted with the
results of the DNA testing.
[21] The appellant’s trial counsel also provided an affidavit and
he was cross-examined prior to trial. This evidence principally
relates to the due diligence factor for admission of fresh
evidence. Counsel stated that he originally intended to call S.H.
as a defence witness in the expectation that S.H. would admit
that he, not the appellant, had been in the bedroom with the
complainant. Counsel did not speak directly to S.H. and was
relying on what the appellant told him. Attempts were made to
serve a subpoena upon S.H. without success. As the trial
transcript discloses, counsel was given an opportunity to apply
for a material witness warrant. After consulting with the
appellant, counsel decided not to seek the warrant. Trial counsel
had begun to doubt that S.H. would confess and was concerned that
S.H. would bolster the Crown’s case by denying that he had done
anything to the complainant. Counsel stated that had he had the
new DNA evidence, he would have elected to pursue the application
for a material witness warrant.</pre>
    <pre>     ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[22] In addition to asking this court to consider the fresh
evidence that I have outlined, the appellant also raises grounds
of appeal relating to the charge to the jury. In particular, the
appellant submits that the trial judge did not adequately present
the theory of the defence or the evidence in support of that
defence and failed to adequately direct the jury on the frailties
of the identification evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     The charge to the jury</pre>
    <pre>[23] I would not give effect to either of these grounds of
appeal. There was no objection to the charge to the jury. The
trial judge fully reviewed the evidence at trial, including the
evidence of the appellant and the forensic evidence, which tended
to exculpate the appellant. The trial judge expressly, albeit
briefly, warned the jury about the frailties of the
identification evidence and the risk of mistake. This was not a
classic identification case. If the sexual assault occurred, it
could only have been committed by one of two people both of whom
were known to the complainant and were apparently different in
appearance.
[24] The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in
directing the jury that the complainant’s emotional condition
after the assault was consistent with her evidence that the
appellant assaulted her. The trial judge said:

   Evidence that the incident left the complainant emotionally
   upset or hysterical may be regarded by you as supporting her
   evidence that there was no consent to any sexual assault upon
   her. You will consider whether the physical and emotional
   condition of [the complainant], her appearance and her demeanour
   were consistent with her evidence that the accused had
   intercourse with her against her will.</pre>
    <pre>[25] When this direction is considered as a whole, the jury would
understand that this evidence was relevant only to whether the
act occurred without the complainant’s consent.
[26] The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to
adequately instruct the jury as to the evidence in support of the
theory that S.H. committed the offence. In my view, there was no
misdirection in this respect. The trial judge reviewed most of
this evidence. He specifically drew to the jury’s attention the
statements that S.H. made at the scene when he claimed that he,
not the appellant, had raped the complainant as well as S.H.'s
threats to the complainant. He told the jury that it was a
defence theory that it was S.H. who assaulted the complainant
while the appellant was asleep. The trial judge fully and
accurately summarized the forensic evidence.
[27] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
to direct the jury that the comments made by S.H. were admissible
for their truth. Defence counsel did not make an application at
the trial to have that evidence admitted for its truth. Counsel
for the appellant argues that this evidence was admissible as
part of the res gestae. I do not agree. In R. v. Clark (1983), 7
C.C.C. (3d) 46 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada refused (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 46n, Dubin J.A. reviewed the
res gestae exception to the hearsay rule. In his discussion of
the exception, he adopted the terminology used by Professor
Wigmore of “spontaneous exclamation”. At p. 59 he held:

               The basis of its admissibility as such is
	  discussed in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed. (Chadbourn
	  rev. 1976), vol. VI, p. 195, § 1747, as follows:

                         (1) General principle of the
          exception. This general principle is based on
          the experience that, under certain external
          circumstances of physical shock, a stress of
          nervous excitement may be produced which
          stills the reflective faculties and removes
          their control, so that the utterance which
          then occurs is a spontaneous and sincere
          response to the actual sensations and
          perceptions already produced by the external
          shock. Since this utterance is made under the
          immediate and uncontrolled domination of the
          senses, and during the brief period when
          considerations of self-interest could not
          have been brought fully to bear by reasoned
          reflection, the utterance may be taken as
          particularly trustworthy (or at least as
          lacking the usual grounds of
          untrustworthiness), and thus as expressing
          the real tenor of the speaker's belief as to
          the facts just observed by him; and may
          therefore be received as testimony to those
          facts. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28] In my view, the statements attributed to S.H. at the scene
do not meet this test and were not admissible for their truth
under the res gestae or spontaneous exclamation exception. The
circumstances as revealed at the trial do not indicate that the
statements were made under “the immediate and uncontrolled
domination of the senses”.  S.H. himself had not been subject to
any attack or other event that would show that his statements
were “a spontaneous and sincere response to the actual sensations
and perceptions already produced by the external shock”. The
circumstances do not suggest the application of any other
established exceptions to the hearsay rule, including the penal
interest exception: see R. v. Demeter (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 137
(S.C.C.).
[29] Counsel for the appellant submitted that these utterances
(as well as other utterances that form part of the fresh
evidence) could be admissible under the principled approach to
exceptions to the hearsay rule. However, no application was made
at trial to admit the evidence on this basis. Such a
determination could only be made following a voir dire at which
the circumstances surrounding the making of all of the statements
could be investigated. I will return to this issue when I
consider the admissibility of the fresh evidence. To conclude, I
have not been persuaded that there were any reversible errors at
the trial.

     The fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[30] The Supreme Court of Canada recently considered the test for
fresh evidence in R. v. Warsing, released December 17, 1998. In
that case, Major J., speaking for the court on this issue,
affirmed that the test for admission of fresh evidence is as set
down in Palmer and Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at
775:
               (1) The evidence should generally not
	  be admitted if, by due diligence, it could
	  have been adduced at trial provided that
          this general principle will not be applied
	  as strictly in a criminal case as in civil 
	  cases; [citations omitted]
               (2)  The evidence must be relevant in
          the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
          potentially decisive issue in the trial;
               (3)  The evidence must be credible in
          the sense that it is reasonably capable of
          belief; and
               (4)  It must be such that if believed it
          could reasonably, when taken with the other
          evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
          have affected the result.</pre>
    <pre>[31] Major J. also confirmed, at para. 51, that due diligence is
a factor to be considered, but not a prerequisite to
admissibility:  “It is desirable that due diligence remain only
one factor and its absence, particularly in criminal cases,
should be assessed in light of other circumstances. If the
evidence is compelling and the interests of justice require that
it be admitted then the failure to meet the test should yield to
permit its admission.”  He also adopted the view expressed by
Carthy J.A. in R. v. C. (R.) (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 84 (Ont.
C.A.) at p. 87 that a failure to meet the due diligence
requirement should not “override accomplishing a just result”.
[32] The Crown submits that none of the proposed evidence meets
the test for fresh evidence. Mr. Ashford agrees that the DNA
evidence is credible but argues that the evidence otherwise fails
to meet the Palmer and Palmer requirements. He placed particular
emphasis on the fourth requirement — that the evidence could be
expected to have affected the result. As I would admit the fresh
evidence concerning the results of the DNA testing and allow the
appeal on that basis, I will only briefly consider the
admissibility of Mr. S.H.’s testimony and the evidence of his
statements to the police and others.</pre>
    <pre>     The DNA evidence
          
     i.   Due diligence</pre>
    <pre>[33] In my view, this is manifestly not a case where lack of due
diligence should operate to exclude the DNA evidence. Leading up
to the trial, defence counsel and the appellant reasonably
believed that S.H. would admit to having had intercourse with the
complainant on the night of the assault. He had said as much to
the police, to his friends and to the appellant’s relatives. The
failure to take extraordinary measures to try to obtain bodily
samples from S.H. was not unreasonable. Moreover, defence counsel
repeatedly pressed Crown counsel, in writing, to have the police
conduct a fuller investigation of S.H.’s role in the affair and
suggested to Crown counsel that he should call S.H. as a witness
at the trial so that the full story would be before the jury.
[34] Crown counsel at trial (not Mr. Ashford) rebuffed these
attempts and also stated that he would not call Mr. S.H. as a
witness. His response was unhelpful and insulting:

    As you are well aware, one of the responsibilities and
    duties of the Crown Attorney in this wonderful nation of ours is
    that we can only call those witnesses we consider credible. As a
    result of that I, unfortunately, am not in a position to call Mr.
    S.H. at the trial of this matter. You, on the other hand, are not
    bound by the same moral constraints that we are and you may feel
    free to deal with Mr. S.H. as you choose.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In the result, the police made no attempts to further
investigate Mr. S.H. or attempt to obtain bodily substances from
him. Thus, the Centre of Forensic Sciences had no samples from
S.H. to compare with the test results. Strictly speaking, Crown
counsel may have been correct in stating that he was not required
to call Mr. S.H.:  R. v. Cook, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1113. In
hindsight, however, the failure on the part of both the Crown and
defence to pursue further DNA testing before trial was
unfortunate. On the other hand, if prior to trial the Crown was
not prepared to further investigate S.H.’s culpability, I do not
think it can fairly be said that the defence failed to exercise
due diligence in the same respect, or that this alleged lack of
due diligence should weigh against admission of the fresh
evidence.

            ii.     Relevancy</pre>
    <pre>[36] The forensic evidence at trial established that the semen
stain on the pair of men’s (K. Beeching) underwear was not from
the appellant. The fresh evidence establishes that this stain
came from S.H. and thus tends to establish that S.H. had worn
that underwear. The complainant testified that the underwear was
not in her bed prior to the assault. In my view, it would be open
to the trier of fact to conclude that the person who sexually
assaulted the complainant had been wearing that underwear just
prior to the assault and had left it in the bed. The fresh
evidence tends to show that S.H. had been wearing the underwear.
The evidence is therefore relevant in that it bears upon a
decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial, namely, the
identity of the perpetrator.
[37] The other DNA evidence relates to the complainant’s
underwear. The analysts were able to obtain sufficient material
to detect sperm and a mixture of DNA on the white underwear that
the complainant put on before going to the hospital. This was a
clean pair of underwear. The DNA came from the complainant and
from S.H.. It could not have come from the appellant. This
evidence is of lesser significance. The examinations performed at
the hospital, together with the complainant’s own evidence,
suggest that the perpetrator did not ejaculate during the
assault. Nevertheless, since the DNA mixture could have been
deposited on the underwear after the attack, in my view, it
relates to a potentially decisive issue in the case and therefore
meets the relevancy test. However, as I will explain below, I am
not persuaded that this evidence can meet the fourth Palmer and
Palmer requirement.

               iii. Credibility</pre>
    <pre>[38] The respondent concedes that the results of the DNA testing
are credible.

            iv.     Effect on the verdict</pre>
    <pre>[39] In considering whether the evidence could reasonably be
expected to have affected the result, the court of appeal is
required to place the proposed fresh evidence into the context of
the other evidence adduced at trial. Identity was the only real
issue at trial. The appellant was identified by the complainant
and he made an inculpatory statement, in the presence of the
complainant’s mother, to the investigating officer. In contrast,
the appellant testified and denied committing the offence.
Leaving aside S.H.’s utterances, there was some circumstantial
evidence implicating him in the offence. He had assaulted the
complainant earlier in the day by pulling down her pants. He
threatened the complainant after the assault. He had the same or
better opportunity as the appellant to commit the offence.
[40] As indicated above, if the complainant is correct, the “K.
Beeching” underwear was not in the bed prior to the attack. It
would be open to the trier of fact to find that the perpetrator
had been wearing the underwear prior to the attack on the
complainant. At trial, the forensic evidence showed that the
stain on the underwear did not come from the appellant. It did
not establish who owned that underwear. The DNA evidence
regarding the underwear is significant independent evidence
implicating S.H. in the attack on the complainant.
[41] At trial, the ownership of the underwear was a mystery.
Crown counsel, however, argued before the jury that the underwear
probably did not belong to S.H. and, in my view, suggested that
the underwear belonged to the appellant. Crown counsel opened his
closing address to the jury with the K. Beeching underwear issue:

    Ladies and gentlemen, let’s look at the troubling aspects of
    the evidence. K. Beeching, a name on a pair of male underwear
    found in the bed. Whose underwear is that?  Ladies and gentlemen,
    you aren’t detectives. If there was an answer for you hopefully
    that answer would have come out in the evidence, it didn’t come
    out. You are going to have to work with that as best you can.
    Recall that the underwear with K. Beeching on it is found in the
    bedding. The photographs depict where it is found. It is found
    nearby an Owl’s Roost T-shirt that [the complainant] says is hers
    that she had last worn some three days before this incident and,
    again, that’s also in the bedding.

    The semen stains on the K. Beeching underwear analyzed for DNA.
    The semen stains on the underwear is not Mr. Folland’s, have
    no doubt about that, as the evidence unfolded. The semen stains
    in the underwear do not come from Mr. Folland. Common sense
    would tell you, and again that’s one of the benefits of the
    jury system, if you have 12 people using common sense, common
    sense tells you that you don’t normally wear someone else’s
    underwear. Mr. Folland, on this particular day, was wearing
    some clothing of Mr. S.H.’. The sweat shirt you will recall,
    both testified to by Mr. Folland and [the complainant], had 
    been given to him by Mr. S.H.. Why Mr. Folland doesn’t have
    his own clothing, that matter wasn’t addressed. The underwear
    doesn’t say S.H. or S.H. What would S.H. be doing with male
    underwear that said K. Beeching on it in any event?  Ladies and
    gentlemen, a mystery. What male adult underwear – and again
    you’ll see the photograph that shows the sort of name tag
    that’s in it – has the name in it in any event?  Ladies and
    gentlemen, I can’t help you with that little bit of the puzzle. It
    doesn’t make sense or it makes little sense.  I can only place
    before you the evidence as found at the scene. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[42] The fresh evidence answers the question posed by Crown
counsel to the jury and in a way that tends to undermine the
Crown’s case. Having regard to the importance that Crown counsel
placed upon the underwear problem at trial and the central role
of identity in the case, in my view the appellant has shown that
this evidence, when taken with the other evidence adduced at
trial, could reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict.
The evidence therefore meets the criteria for admission of fresh
evidence.
[43] It may be, as submitted by the Crown, that the underwear has
nothing to do with the assault and that the complainant is
mistaken in her evidence that the underwear was not in her bed
prior to the assault. For that reason, the evidence is not
clearly decisive and I would order a new trial, not an acquittal:
R. v. Stolar (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 11.
[44] I take a different view of the DNA evidence concerning the
white underwear. As indicated, the trial evidence suggests that
the perpetrator did not ejaculate during the assault. The
presence of the stain in the complainant’s underpants may show
nothing more than that the complainant and S.H. had intercourse
on some prior occasion. That issue was not in dispute as the
complainant testified that she and S.H. had been “intimate”. The
expert evidence at trial indicated that DNA can be detected even
after clothing has been washed. No attempt was made at trial to
lead evidence of the complainant’s prior sexual relationship with
S.H. The evidence tendered before this court consists of S.H.’s
testimony that he had intercourse with the complainant the day
before the assault and the hospital record indicating that the
complainant said she had not had intercourse for at least a week
prior to the assault. On either version, I fail to see how other
evidence, such as the DNA analysis of the white underwear showing
a relationship between S.H. and the complainant, could have
affected the verdict. The jury was aware that S.H. and the
complainant had been intimate. They knew that she and S.H. shared
the same house. In the absence of a greater nexus between the
stain and the attack, it is my view that admission of this
evidence could not reasonably be expected to have affected the
result.

               S.H.’s testimony and utterances</pre>
    <pre>[45] An important aspect of the admission of the other category
of proposed fresh evidence is the credibility of S.H. and the
friends and relatives to whom he allegedly confessed. If S.H.
were to tell the same story to the jury as he did under cross-
examination prior to the appeal, and if he were believed, it
would be open to the jury to find that he did not attack the
complainant and that he was asleep before the complainant made
her complaint about the appellant. His testimony as to having
consensual relations with the complainant the day before the
attack would explain the presence of his semen on the white
underwear. On the whole, S.H.’s evidence, if believed, would
assist the Crown rather than the defence.
[46] It seems to me that the appellant is really hoping that a
trier of fact would disbelieve substantial portions of S.H.’s
sworn testimony in favour of his unsworn utterances to the police
officers and others. This raises the difficult question of the
place of the credibility factor in the fresh evidence analysis, a
matter squarely raised in several other appeals pending in this
court. Moreover, we did not have the advantage of seeing either
S.H. or the other witnesses. Further, it is unnecessary to deal
with this second category of proposed fresh evidence to resolve
this appeal. For those reasons, I would prefer not to express an
opinion on the admissibility of this evidence as fresh evidence.
[47] However, since the use of S.H.’s out-of-court utterances may
be an issue at the new trial, I would make these comments for the
assistance of the trial judge. The most likely route by which
those statements would be put before the jury is if either Crown
or defence call S.H. as a witness. At that point, S.H. might
either admit the statements or the party, presumably the defence,
would attempt to prove the statements in accordance with either
s. 9 (if the defence called S.H.) or s. 11 (if the Crown called
S.H.) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, chap. C-5. If the
defence wishes to make substantive use of the statements, it
should proceed in accordance with the procedure set out in R. v.
B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, R. v. Conway (1997), 121 C.C.C.
(3d) 397 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Szpala (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 430
(Ont. C.A.).
[48] In determining whether the defence should be permitted to
make substantive use of this evidence, the trial judge will wish
to bear in mind the comments of Martin J.A. in R. v. Williams
(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 356 (Ont. C.A.) at 378:

    It seems to me that a court has a residual discretion to
    relax in favour of the accused a strict rule of evidence where it
    is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice and where the
    danger against which an exclusionary rule aims to safeguard does
    not exist.</pre>
    <pre>[49] This passage was approved by Cory J. in R. v. Finta (1994),
88 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) at 527. In my view, while the trial
judge must be satisfied that the prior out-of-court utterances
have some reliability, the strict standards set, in the context
of an application by the Crown to make substantive use of prior
inconsistent statements incriminating the accused, in R. v. B.
(K.G.) do not apply: c.f. R. v. Eisenhauer (1998), 123 C.C.C.
(3d) 37 (N.S.C.A.) at 64, application for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada dismissed, August 20, 1998.
[50] The comments by Martin J.A. have particular application to
the statements made by S.H. at the scene. The Crown relied on the
appellant’s inculpatory statements at the scene for their truth.
If S.H. testifies and denies having assaulted the complainant, it
seems only right that his contrary statements also made at the
scene ought to be available for substantive use by the defence.
However, that will be a matter for the trial judge who will have
the advantage of observing S.H. and the other witnesses and will
be in a much better position to make the reliability
determination.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[51] Accordingly, I would admit the fresh evidence concerning the
DNA analysis of the men’s underwear, allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial. I should point out that Mr.
Ashford conceded before this court that even if the conviction
appeal were dismissed, he would agree that the appeal from
sentence be allowed and the sentence reduced to time served. In
all the circumstances, the Crown may wish to consider whether it
is in the public interest to proceed with the new trial.
