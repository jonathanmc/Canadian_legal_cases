    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Paisley J. dated June 23, 1999</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the decision of Paisley J. dated June
23,  1999  in which he refused to order the return of  two  young
children  to Italy pursuant to The Hague Convention on the  Civil
Aspects  of  International Child Abduction1  (&#147;the  Convention&#148;).
The  application hearing before Paisley J. and this  appeal  were
both heard on an expedited basis as required by the Convention:

     Article 11
     </pre>
    <pre>          The judicial or administrative
          authorities of contracting States shall
          act expeditiously in proceedings for the
          return of the children.</pre>
    <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  appellant, Giampiero Finizio (&#147;the  husband&#148;),  is  an
Italian national with landed immigrant status in Canada.   He  is
37 years old.  He and his brother own a steel fabricating factory
in Italy.
[3]  The respondent, Grazia Scoppio-Finizio (&#147;the wife), was born
in Italy and immigrated to Canada in 1977.  She is 36 years old.
Her most recent employment was as a part-time teaching assistant
at the University of Bari in Italy.
[4]  The parties married on October 18, 1990.  They have resided
in Italy since the marriage.  There are two children of the
marriage, Corinne aged 7, and Paola aged 2.  The children have
dual citizenship and are fully bilingual.
[5]  The parties are agreed that there have been serious problems
in their marriage recently.  They also agree that they separated
in 1998.  The wife states that the separation occurred on August
25; the husband says the correct date was October 8.  Nothing
turns on this six-week difference.
[6]  The wife claims that on November 17, 1998 two important,
indeed traumatic, events took place.  First, her husband
assaulted her, punching her in the face.  Second, he withdrew
most of the funds in their joint bank account, leaving her the
equivalent of $1,000 (Cdn) for her expenses.
[7]  On December 26 the wife brought the two children to Toronto,
her previous home before her marriage and the home of her
parents.  She does not intend to return to live in Italy and does
not plan to send the children back there.
[8]  When the husband became aware of what had transpired he took
steps to challenge the wife&#146;s decision and conduct.  On March 22,
1999 he brought an application in the Ontario courts.  The
principal relief he sought was, as expressed in his Notice of
Application:

          a)   a finding and declaration that the children, Corinne
              Finizio, born June 23, 1992 and Paola Finizio, born February 4,
              1997 are being wrongfully retained in Ontario by the respondent,
              Grazia Scoppio-Finizio, and that retention constitutes a wrongful
              removal or detention of the children within the meaning of
              Article 3 of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
              Child Abduction;</pre>
    <pre>          b)   an order for the return of the children, to their habitual
              residence, namely, Giovinazzo, Italy, forthwith;
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The application came before Paisley J.  On June 23, 1999  he
rendered  his  decision.  He did not grant  the  declaration  and
return  order sought by the husband.  He found that the wife  had
wrongfully removed the children from Italy.  However, he  refused
to order their return to Italy because to do so &#147;would place them
in  an inherently intolerable situation as well as exposing  them
to a grave risk of psychological harm.&#148; (Reasons, at p. 5).
[10] The husband appealed from Paisley J.&#146;s decision.</pre>
    <pre>B.   LEGAL ISSUES
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The  husband  challenges Paisley  J.&#146;s  decision  that  the
children should not be returned to Italy because of the potential
harm this might cause to the children.  The wife supports Paisley
J.&#146;s decision on this point.  However, the wife contends that  it
was  not  necessary for the judge to reach this point; he  should
have dismissed the application on the basis that the husband  did
not  have  a  custody right sufficient to anchor his  application
based on the Convention.  Accordingly, on this appeal, as on  the
application  before  Paisley J., there are two  legal  issues  to
consider:

      (1)  Was the removal by the wife of the children from Italy to
          Canada a wrongful removal contrary to Article 3 of  the
          Convention?</pre>
    <pre>      (2)  If the removal of the children was wrongful, should the
          children be permitted to continue to live in Canada because an
          order returning them to Italy would violate Article 13 of the
          Convention?
</pre>
    <pre>C.   ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>(1)       The Article 3 Issue</pre>
    <pre>[12] Article 3 of the Convention provides:
          Article 3
     </pre>
    <pre>          The  removal or the retention of a child
          is to be considered wrongful where:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)   it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a
             person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or
             alone, under the law of the State in which the child was
             habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention;
             and
            </pre>
    <pre>          (b)at  the  time of removal or retention
             those     rights    were     actually
             exercised, either jointly  or  alone,
             or  would have been so exercised  but
             for the removal or retention.
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Paisley  J.  analyzed  this  article.   He  also  carefully
considered the leading Canadian case dealing with the Convention,
namely Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551.  He concluded, at
p. 4:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am  satisfied that, while the  mother
          was  and  has  always been  the  primary
          caregiver,  the  husband was  exercising
          shared  custodial rights of the children
          according   to  Italian   law   in   the
          circumstances, that he has not abandoned
          them,  and that removal of the  children
          from their country of habitual residence
          was  wrongful pursuant to Article  3  of
          the Convention.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The wife challenges this conclusion.  She submits that  her
removal  of  the  children  did not  violate  Article  3  of  the
Convention because the husband was not &#147;actually exercising&#148;  his
custody  rights  at the time of the removal.  The  wife  contends
that  the  husband visited the children infrequently after  their
separation  and  did not challenge in any way the  decisions  she
made  about the children who continued to reside with  her  after
the  separation.   She  also relies on two  legal  opinions  from
Italian  legal  experts stating that the  husband  did  not  have
custody rights under Italian law.
[15] The husband also placed before Paisley J. an expert legal
opinion.  Not surprisingly, this opinion stated that the husband
was exercising custody rights under Italian law.
[16] In an Article 3 analysis, the nature of the custody rights
of the party seeking an order for the return of children must be
determined in accordance with the law of the habitual residence
of the children.  As expressed by L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. in W.(V.) v.
S. (D.), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 108 at 130-31:</pre>
    <pre>          [A]lthough  the  Convention  adopts   an
          original   definition   of   rights   of
          custody,  the question of who holds  the
          &#147;rights  relating to  the  care  of  the
          person  of  the child&#148; or the &#147;right  to
          determine   the   child&#146;s    place    of
          residence&#148;  within the  meaning  of  the
          Convention is in principle determined in
          accordance with the law of the State  of
          the child&#146;s habitual place of residence&#133;
          .</pre>
    <pre>[17] There is no question that the habitual place of residence of
the Finizio children is Italy.  Before December 26, 1998 they had
known  no other permanent home.  Accordingly, the custody  rights
of  their  parents must be determined in accordance with  Italian
law.
[18] In my view, Paisley J. was correct to conclude that &#147;the
husband was exercising shared custodial rights of the children
according to Italian law.&#148;  (Reasons, at p. 4).  On this point,
the conflicting opinions of the Italian legal experts retained by
the parties are not useful.  Rather, the determinative statement
on the relevant Italian law and its application to the
circumstances of the Finizio/Scoppia-Finizio family is found in
the letter from the Italian Central Authority charged with
administering the Convention in Italy.  In a letter to the
Reciprocity Office of the Ministry of the Attorney General dated
June 7, 1998, Magistrate Anna Maria Teresa Gregori of the
Ministry of Justice stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          We  refer to your letter of 3 June 1999,
          which  reached us on June 5, and beg  to
          reconfirm  that  under Italian  law,  as
          already  mentioned in our letter  9.3.99
          children   born  during   marriage   are
          legitimate  issue of both  parents,  who
          have  equal  rights and  duties  towards
          them  under articles 143, 144,  147  and
          316  of  the  Civil Code.  In particular
          according  to article 316  &#147;a  child  is
          subject   to  parental  authority   till
          he/she   comes   of   age   or   becomes
          emancipated.&#148;  Therefore,  at  the  time
          of  abduction custody pertained to  both
          parents as their marriage continued  its
          effect  and  Mr. Finizio  took  constant
          and  effective  part in  his  children&#146;s
          upbringing and education.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  not  material that Mrs.  Finizio
          holds  another view, as referred in  the
          above   letter,   since   she   has   no
          legislative  instruments  to  prove  her
          allegations  and  no  provisions   exist
          under Italian law to the contrary.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  In  light of this clear statement by the Central  Authority
charged  with the administration of the Convention in  Italy,  as
well as the other evidence Paisley J. considered, I conclude that
he  was  correct  to  hold that the husband  had  standing  under
Article  3  to challenge the wife&#146;s removal of the children  from
Italy.
[20] It follows from this conclusion that it is necessary to
consider whether Paisley J. was also correct in refusing to order
the return of the children to Italy.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The Article 13 Issue</pre>
    <pre>[21]  Once  a  Canadian court determines that a  child  has  been
wrongfully removed from a foreign country which is also  a  party
to  the Convention, the court is mandated  to order the return of
the  children to that country.  That is because of Article 12  of
the Convention which provides in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Article 12
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where   a   child  has  been  wrongfully
          removed  or retained in terms of Article
          3  and,  at the date of the commencement
          of  the  proceedings before the judicial
          or   administrative  authority  of   the
          Contracting State where the child is,  a
          period of less than one year has elapsed
          from the date of the wrongful removal or
          retention, the authority concerned shall
          order the return of the child forthwith.</pre>
    <pre>[22]  However,  Article 12 does not provide an absolute  rule  of
return.  There are some circumstances in which a court can refuse
to  make  a  return order.  These circumstances are  set  out  in
Article 13 which provides in relevant parts:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Article 13</pre>
    <pre>          Notwithstanding  the provisions  of  the
          preceding   Article,  the  judicial   or
          administrative    authority    of    the
          requested  State is not bound  to  order
          the  return of the child if the  person,
          institution or other body which  opposed
          its return establishes that: &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>            (b)  there is a grave risk that his or
               her  return would expose the  child
               to  physical or psychological  harm
               or  otherwise place the child in an
               intolerable situation.</pre>
    <pre>[23]  Before  Paisley J. the wife contended  that  Article  13(b)
governed  her situation.  Paisley J. agreed with her  submission.
He reasoned, at pp. 4-5:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am  satisfied that there is  credible
          evidence   that   the  wife   has   been
          subjected  to  an  assault  causing  her
          bodily harm, that the assault took place
          within the home where the children  were
          residing  with  their  mother,  that  no
          safeguard  was  put  in  place  for  the
          protection of the mother by the judicial
          system  of Italy prior to her departure,
          although  she had reported her complaint
          to   the   police  and  supported   that
          complaint with medical records, and that
          she has a well founded and credible fear
          for   the  safety  of  herself  and  the
          wellbeing of her children as a result.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  children are infants, and it  would
          be  intolerable for them to be forced to
          return  to  Italy without their  mother.
          It  is  a  matter of common  sense  that
          returning  these children to  a  violent
          environment  would  place  them  in   an
          inherently intolerable situation as well
          as  exposing  them to a  grave  risk  of
          psychological harm.  The respondent  has
          satisfied the onus of establishing  that
          the  children should not be  ordered  to
          return  to  Italy  pursuant  to  Article
          13(b) of the Convention.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  assault to which Paisley J. refers in this passage  is
one which the wife alleges took place at her parents&#146; summer home
in  Italy on November 17, 1998.  The wife states that her husband
punched  her  in the face. Her claim is supported by her  mother,
Michelina  Luzopone, who was present at the summer home  on  that
date.  In her affidavit Ms. Luzopone states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.   I was present on November 17, 1998, when my son-in-law
            Giampiero came over to my summer home to pick up some more of his
            belongings.  He went to the garage with my daughter Grazia.  I
            could hear Giampiero&#146;s raised voice from the house.  When I went
            to investigate, I saw Grazia on the floor with her hand on the
            side of her face.  It was apparent to me that Giampiero struck
            Grazia.  I told Giampiero to leave.  I immediately took Grazia to
            the hospital in Bitonto.  She was extremely upset and was crying.
            Subsequently there were bruises on the side of her face.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  husband denies that the assault took place.  The  wife
did  not  file any medical report to support her claim.  She  did
file  a  copy of a report she made to the police on November  17,
1998.  However, it is a standard police report; it simply records
what the wife says happened.
[26] In spite of the sparse record, I see no reason to question
Paisley J.&#146;s conclusion that there is &#147;credible evidence&#148; that an
assault took place.  The question which flows from this factual
finding is whether it was sufficient to justify Paisley J.&#146;s
invocation of Article 13(b) of the Convention as the basis for an
order refusing the return of the children to Italy.
[27] It seems to me that this question must be addressed in light
of what the Supreme Court of Canada said in Thomson v. Thomson,
supra.  In that case a Scottish court made an interim order for
custody in favour of the mother.  However, the court also ordered
that the child was to remain in Scotland until further court
order.  The mother disobeyed the order and took the child to
Manitoba.
[28] In arriving at its decision to order the return of the child
to Scotland, the Supreme Court conducted an extensive study of
the Convention and set out the general principles governing its
interpretation by Canadian courts.  With respect to Article 13(b)
La Forest J. stated, at pp. 596-97:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  has been generally accepted that the
          Convention  mandates  a  more  stringent
          test   than   that   advanced   by   the
          appellant.  In brief, although the  word
          &#147;grave&#148;  modifies &#147;risk&#148; and not &#147;harm&#148;,
          this  must  be read in conjunction  with
          the clause &#147;or otherwise place the child
          in  an intolerable situation.&#148;  The  use
          of    the    word   &#147;otherwise&#148;   points
          inescapably to the conclusion  that  the
          physical    or    psychological     harm
          contemplated by the first clause of art.
          13(b)  is  harm  to a degree  that  also
          amounts to an intolerable situation&#133;  In
          Re  A.  (A Minor) (Abduction), supra,  2
          Nourse   L.J.,  in  my  view  correctly,
          expressed  the approach that  should  be
          taken, at p. 372:
          </pre>
    <pre>             &#133; the risk has to be more than
             an ordinary risk, or something
             greater than would normally be
             expected  on  taking  a  child
             away   from  one  parent   and
             passing  him  to  another.   I
             agree &#133; that not only must the
             risk  be  a weighty  one,  but
             that   it  must  be   one   of
             substantial, and not  trivial,
             psychological harm.  That,  as
             it  seems to me, is the effect
             of  the  words  &#145;or  otherwise
             place   the   child   in    an
             intolerable situation&#146;.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  Does the situation faced by the wife in Italy in  the  late
fall of 1998 come within this description of Article 13(b) of the
Convention?   In  my view, it does not.  I reach this  conclusion
for several reasons.
[30] First, there is no evidence that the husband has ever done
anything to harm the children.  The wife makes no allegation that
he has ever struck the children or otherwise abused them in any
way.  On this point, the fact that the father continued to visit
the children after the alleged assault on November 17, 1998
indicates that the wife does not fear that contact between the
husband and children will be detrimental to the children.
[31] Second, the alleged single incident of assault at the summer
home in Italy is, even on the wife&#146;s evidence, the only incident
of a physical altercation between the spouses in their eight-year
marriage.
[32] I think there is no question that in certain circumstances a
physical attack on a mother could cause psychological harm to
children.  Indeed, this court said as much recently in Pollastro
v. Pollastro (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 485 (C.A.).  However, the
situation in the Finizio/Scoppio-Finizio family is far removed
from the terrifying situation chronicled by Abella J.A. in
Pollastro.
[33] In his reasons Paisley J. said that &#147;no safeguard was put in
place for the protection of the mother by the judicial system of
Italy prior to her departure&#148; (Reasons, at p. 4).  With respect,
I do not think that this is a fair criticism of the Italian
judicial system.  With respect to the police, the matter is in
their hands.  The fact that no charges have been laid against the
husband should not give rise to speculation that the police are
not performing their duties properly. With respect to the courts,
it needs to be emphasized that the wife took no steps to raise
issues of support or custody in the Italian courts before
removing the children to Canada.  Accordingly, there was simply
no role the Italian courts could play.
[34] Third, there is simply no basis for suggesting that the
Italian courts are not well-suited to deal with matrimonial
issues, including support, custody and access.  I agree with
Jennings J. who said in Medhurst v. Markle (1995), 17 R.F.L.
(4th) 428 at 432 (Ont. Gen. Div.):
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is to be presumed that the courts of
          another  Contracting State are  equipped
          to   make,   and  will  make,   suitable
          arrangements for the child&#146;s welfare.</pre>
    <pre>[35]  The  English courts have taken a similar position  on  this
issue.   In  C.  v. C. (Abduction: Rights of Custody),  [1987]  1
W.L.R. 654 at 664 (C.A.), Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  will be the concern of the court  of
          the  State to which the child is  to  be
          returned  to minimize or eliminate  this
          harm  and,  in the absence of compelling
          evidence  to  the contrary  or  evidence
          that  it  is beyond the powers of  those
          courts in the circumstances of the case,
          the courts of this country should assume
          that  this  will be done.   Save  in  an
          exceptional case, our concern, i.e., the
          concern  of  these  courts,  should   be
          limited  to giving the child the maximum
          possible protection until the courts  of
          the  other country &#150; Australia  in  this
          case  &#150; can resume their normal role  in
          relation to the child.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Fourth, in Thomson v. Thomson, supra, the Supreme Court  of
Canada indicated that Canadian courts can impose undertakings  on
parties to deal with the transition period between the time  when
a  Canadian court makes a return order and the time at which  the
children  are  placed before the courts in the country  of  their
habitual residence.  As expressed by La Forest J. at p. 599:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Through  the  use  of undertakings,  the
          requirement  in  Article   12   of   the
          convention that &#147;the authority concerned
          shall  order  the return  of  the  child
          forthwith&#148;  can  be complied  with,  the
          wrongful  actions of the removing  party
          are  not  condoned, the  long-term  best
          interests  of the child are left  for  a
          determination  by  the  court   of   the
          child&#146;s  habitual  residence,  and   any
          short-term   harm  to   the   child   is
          ameliorated.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  It  does not appear that the parties addressed the question
of  undertakings  before  Paisley J.  In  my  view,  this  is  an
important  factor  which counsel should place squarely  before  a
judge  hearing a Convention application.  The strong language  of
the Convention, coupled with what I view as the height of the bar
set  by  the Supreme Court in Thomson v. Thomson, will inevitably
result in many children being returned to the country from  which
they  have  been  wrongfully removed.  Given that prospect,  both
counsel  should be prepared to deal fully with the issue  of  how
the  children are to be returned, and to do so before  the  judge
hearing the initial Convention application.
[38] In this case, the wife raised this issue on the appeal and
it was addressed by both counsel in their oral submissions. The
wife made this submission in her factum:
          </pre>
    <pre>        51.  &#133;[T]he Respondent mother requests that this court order the
            husband to undertake to provide the following:
             </pre>
    <pre>             (1)  the husband should provide airline tickets for the wife and
                children,</pre>
    <pre>             (2)  the husband should provide suitable housing that
                approximates the accommodation the parties enjoyed prior to
                separation for the wife and children exclusively,</pre>
    <pre>             (3)  the husband should pay a lump sum of $35,000 Cdn. as prepaid
                support for six months,</pre>
    <pre>             (4)  the husband should be ordered to refrain from annoying,
                harassing or molesting the wife, despite the limits of the
                jurisdiction of the Ontario Court.
</pre>
    <pre>[39]  Before  this  court, the husband agreed to  the  first  and
second  undertakings.  He also agreed to the fourth  undertaking,
with the caveat that he was not admitting that he had engaged  in
such  conduct  in Italy.  With respect to the third  undertaking,
the  husband  pointed  out  that  on  May  5,  1999  he  filed  a
Petition/Claim  for  Judicial Separation in the  court  in  Bari,
Italy.   This  petition places the issue of the  custody  of  the
children  before the Italian court.  The matter will come  before
the  court  on October 20, 1999.  In light of this schedule,  the
husband  undertook to pay the wife $5,000 immediately  to  assist
her  and  the children upon their return to Italy and  to  pay  a
further $5,000 on October 20, 1999 if for some reason the Italian
court  has not heard his application.  Bearing in mind that  when
the  wife  returned to Canada she brought with her  approximately
$200,000  which  had been designated for the purchase  of  a  new
home,  the  husband&#146;s undertaking to provide $10,000  as  interim
support strikes me as fair.
[40] For these reasons, it has not been established that the
return of the children to Italy would constitute a &#147;weighty risk
of  substantial harm&#148; to the children.
[41] I conclude with a final observation.  In W. (V.) v. S.(D.),
supra, L&#146;Heureux-Dubé engaged in an extensive analysis of the
Convention and of the Quebec statute implementing the Convention
in that jurisdiction.  She stated, at pp. 135-36:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The     automatic    return    procedure
          implemented  by  the Act  is  ultimately
          intended  to  deter  the  abduction   of
          children  by depriving fugitive  parents
          of   any  possibility  of  having  their
          custody  of  the children recognized  in
          the country and thereby legitimizing the
          situation    for    which    they    are
          responsible.   To  that  end,  the   Act
          favours  the restoration of  the  status
          quo   as  soon  as  possible  after  the
          removal  of  the child by  enabling  one
          party  to  force the other to submit  to
          the  jurisdiction of the  court  of  the
          child&#146;s habitual place of residence  for
          the purpose of arguing the merits of any
          custody   issue.   The  Act,  like   the
          Convention, presumes that the  interests
          of  children  who  have been  wrongfully
          removed are ordinarily better served  by
          immediately repatriating them  to  their
          original jurisdiction, where the  merits
          of  custody  should have been determined
          before their removal.</pre>
    <pre>[42] In my view, this is a clear and powerful articulation of the
philosophy and implications of The Hague Convention on the  Civil
Aspects of International Child Abduction.  In the present appeal,
a  proper reading of the Convention, and of the decisions of  the
Supreme  Court  of  Canada in Thomson v. Thomson  and  W.(V.)  v.
S.(D.),   requires  that  the  Finizio  children  return   almost
immediately  to Italy, the country of their birth  and  of  their
habitual residence until they were wrongfully removed.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[43] The appeal is allowed.  It is ordered that Corinne and Paola
Finizio  return to Italy by October 15, 1999 so that the  Italian
courts can assume jurisdiction over them at the hearing scheduled
for October 20, 1999.
[44] The husband is to abide by the following undertakings within
10 days:

     (1)  The husband will provide airline tickets and other travel
         expenses for the wife and two children;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (2) The    husband   is   to   provide   suitable   housing,
         approximating  the  accommodation  the  parties  enjoyed
         prior  to separation, for the exclusive use of the  wife
         and children;
    </pre>
    <pre>     (3) The  husband  is to provide $5,000 to the wife  for  the
         support  of  her  and the children,  and  an  additional
         $5,000  on  October 21 if the court in Bari,  Italy  has
         not become seized with the issue of support;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (4) Without  admitting that he has done so in the past,  the
         husband  is  to  provide an undertaking  not  to  annoy,
         harass or molest the wife.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[45]  I note that Paisley J. made no order with respect to costs,
perhaps because the wife did not seek an order.  Bearing that  in
mind,  if the appellant seeks its costs of the appeal, it may  do
so  by  way  of  written  submission by October  15,  1999.   The
respondent may make its submission by October 22, 1999.
