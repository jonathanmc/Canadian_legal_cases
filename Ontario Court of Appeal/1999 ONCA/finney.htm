</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of assault with  a  weapon  by</pre>
    <pre>Justice  R.G.  Masse, sentenced to pay a fine  of  $1,000.00  and</pre>
    <pre>placed on probation for 18 months.  He appeals his conviction and</pre>
    <pre>sentence.</pre>
    <pre>
[2]  The charge arose out of a longstanding, ongoing, bitter

dispute between the appellant and his neighbours, one of whom was

the complainant.  The dispute centered on the extent of the

neighbours&#146; entitlement to use a right of way across the

appellant&#146;s property to gain access to and egress from their

property.  The facts were hotly contested at trial.  Fortunately,

Masse J. made clear findings of fact, none of which is attacked

on appeal.  My summary comes from those findings of fact.

[3]  On the day of the alleged assault, the appellant was working

on his property clearing stumps with an axe.  He saw the

complainant approaching along the right of way riding an all-

terrain vehicle (ATV).  The appellant decided to stop the

complainant to inform him that he was not entitled to pass along

the right of way on an ATV and also to inform him that he was in

violation of certain provincial laws relating to the operation of

an ATV.  The appellant walked to the road and stood in the middle

of the road signaling the complainant to stop.  The complainant

slowed down, but did not stop.  He drove around the appellant.

As the vehicle moved around the appellant, he suddenly but

intentionally struck out at the ATV with his axe, hitting the

vehicle.  The complainant had to shift on the seat of the ATV to

avoid being hit with the axe.  The trial judge found that the

appellant intended to strike the vehicle.  This incident was

referred to as the first altercation in the course of the

argument of the appeal.

[4]  After the vehicle had been struck, the complainant stopped,

got off the ATV and &#147;went after&#148; the appellant.  He struck the

appellant at least once.  After the complainant hit the

appellant, he &#147;pushed at&#148; the complainant with the axe striking

him on the head.  He did not swing the axe at the complainant,

but instead pushed it forward to fend off the complainant&#146;s

attack.  The complainant had a bump on his head, but no other

injuries.  This incident was referred to as the second

altercation in the course of the argument of the appeal.

[5]  The trial judge held that the appellant was guilty as

charged if, without justification or excuse, he assaulted the

complainant during either the first or second altercation.  The

trial judge concluded that the appellant had unlawfully assaulted

the complainant during both altercations.  To succeed on the

conviction appeal, the appellant must demonstrate reversible

error with respect to both findings.
                                
</pre>
    <pre>                                  II

</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Counsel  for  the appellant, in an effective  presentation,</pre>
    <pre>advanced  four grounds on the conviction appeal.  The  first  two</pre>
    <pre>attack the finding with respect to the first altercation and  the</pre>
    <pre>last  two  challenge  the  finding with  respect  to  the  second</pre>
    <pre>altercation.  Counsel submits that the trial judge erred:
</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  by concluding that the appellant assaulted the complainant
  within the meaning of s.265(1)(b) when he swung the axe at the
  ATV;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  by holding that the defence of property as defined in s. 41
  of the Criminal Code did not provide a legal justification for
  the appellant&#146;s actions during the first altercation;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  in failing to consider the defence of self-defence as
  defined in s. 37 of the Criminal Code in deciding whether the
  appellant had committed an assault during the second altercation;
  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  in holding that the defence of self-defence as defined in s.
  34(1) of the Criminal Code was not available as a defence to the
  alleged assault during the second altercation.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>The finding that the appellant assaulted the complainant during

the first altercation
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  appellant  did not strike the complainant  during  the</pre>
    <pre>first  altercation.   However, as the trial  judge  observed,  s.</pre>
    <pre>265(1)  defines an assault so as to include threatening  conduct.</pre>
    <pre>The section provides in part:</pre>
    <pre>          
               A person commits an assault when
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   he  &#133; threatens, by an act  or  a
          gesture to apply force to another person,  if
          he  has,  or  causes  that  other  person  to
          believe upon reasonable grounds that he  has,
          present ability to effect his purpose;
</pre>
    <pre>[8]   Counsel argues that s. 265(1)(b) requires that  an  accused</pre>
    <pre>intend  that the conduct threaten the complainant:  R.  v.  Nurse</pre>
    <pre>(1993),  83 C.C.C. (3d) 546 at 557 (Ont. C.A.).  He submits  that</pre>
    <pre>the  trial  judge  made no specific finding  that  the  appellant</pre>
    <pre>intended  to threaten the complainant when he struck the vehicle.</pre>
    <pre>He  further  contends that the trial judge&#146;s  findings  that  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant  swung  at the vehicle suddenly with the  intention  of</pre>
    <pre>stopping  the  vehicle negate any finding  that  he  intended  to</pre>
    <pre>threaten the complainant.</pre>
    <pre>
[9]  I would reject these submissions.  Intentions can be formed

on the sudden.  When the complainant did not stop as directed by

the appellant, the appellant clearly formed the intention to

swing at the vehicle in order to get the complainant to stop the

vehicle.  An intention to threaten the complainant by hitting the

vehicle on which he was sitting with an axe is entirely

consistent with an intention to cause the appellant to stop the

vehicle.  The blow itself would not stop the vehicle, however, a

threat directed at the driver might well achieve that purpose.

The trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the appellant threatened the

complainant by striking the vehicle is certainly a reasonable

one.  Indeed, when the appellant&#146;s actions are placed in the

context of his heated ongoing dispute with the complainant and

others over the use of the right of way, the only reasonable

inference is that the appellant intended to threaten the

complainant when he struck the vehicle with the axe.</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre>The applicability of s. 41 of the Criminal Code
</pre>
    <pre>[10] Section 41(1) provides that a person in peaceable possession</pre>
    <pre>of  real  property  is justified in using force  to  prevent  any</pre>
    <pre>person  from  trespassing  on  that  property  or  to  remove   a</pre>
    <pre>trespasser from that property.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge found that the complainant was returning

home along the right of way when the incident occurred.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [H]e [the complainant] was trying to gain access to his
          property by way of the right of way as he had a legal right to
          do, therefore he was not a trespasser.
</pre>
    <pre>[12]  I  see no basis upon which to interfere with this  finding.</pre>
    <pre>Nothing  in  the  trial record supports the contention  that  the</pre>
    <pre>complainant&#146;s right to use the right of way to gain access to  or</pre>
    <pre>egress  from  his  property was somehow limited  to  the  use  of</pre>
    <pre>certain types of motor vehicles.  Nor, in my view, does the  fact</pre>
    <pre>that  the  complainant  may  have  been  operating  the  ATV   in</pre>
    <pre>contravention  of  provincial  safety  regulations  make  him   a</pre>
    <pre>trespasser.   Finally,  I see no merit  to  the  claim  that  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant&#146;s  right to stop the ATV (assuming that  right  existed</pre>
    <pre>under the provincial laws) made the complainant a trespasser when</pre>
    <pre>he  declined  to  stop.   I would not interfere  with  the  trial</pre>
    <pre>judge&#146;s finding that the complainant was not a trespasser.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Counsel further submits that even if the complainant was not

a trespasser, the appellant was entitled to rely on the defence

established in s. 41 of the Criminal Code if he honestly believed

that the appellant was a trespasser.  It is said that the

appellant had that belief based on legal advice he had been given

as to the nature of the complainant&#146;s right of passage along the

right of way.  According to that advice, the complainant was not

entitled to use an ATV to come and go from his property along the

right of way.

[14] An accused may rely on a mistaken belief that a person is a

trespasser in advancing a s. 41 defence.  The mistake must,

however, be a mistake of fact.  An accused may not rely on a

mistake of law:  see R. v. Born with a Tooth (1992), 76 C.C.C.

(3d) 169 at 180 (Alta. C.A.).  While the distinction between a

mistake of fact and a mistake of law is often difficult to make,

the appellant&#146;s mistake was clearly a mistake of law.  He was not

mistaken as to any of the relevant facts, but was, on his

evidence, mistaken as to the scope of the complainant&#146;s legal

right to use the right of way.

[15] As neither of the first two grounds of appeal succeeds, I

would hold that the trial judge properly found that the appellant

assaulted the complainant when he struck the complainant&#146;s

vehicle with the axe.  It follows, regardless of what happened

during the second altercation, that the appellant was properly

convicted.  I will, however, go on to consider one of the grounds

of appeal relating to the second altercation, as a determination

of whether the appellant also assaulted the complainant during

the second altercation is relevant in determining the fitness of

the appellant&#146;s sentence.</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre>The failure to consider s. 37 of the Criminal Code
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  trial judge considered the appellant&#146;s claim  that  he</pre>
    <pre>acted in self-defence during the second altercation, on the basis</pre>
    <pre>that the appellant had provoked the complainant&#146;s assault on  him</pre>
    <pre>during  the  second altercation by his assault on the complainant</pre>
    <pre>during  the first altercation.  The trial judge tested the  self-</pre>
    <pre>defence  claim against only the criteria in s. 35 of the Criminal</pre>
    <pre>Code.   That  section provides a defence to those who provoke  an</pre>
    <pre>assault, but only where they react to the provoked assault  under</pre>
    <pre>&#147;a  reasonable  apprehension of death or grievous  bodily  harm.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>The appellant was under no such apprehension when the complainant</pre>
    <pre>confronted him after the appellant had struck the ATV.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Counsel contends that the trial judge should have considered

the defence of self-defence as described in s. 37 of the Criminal

Code:
          </pre>
    <pre>               37(1)     Every one is justified in using force to defend
          himself or any one under his protection from assault, if he uses
          no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the
          repetition of it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Nothing in this section shall be
          deemed to justify the wilful infliction of
          any hurt or mischief that is excessive,
          having regard to the nature of the assault
          that the force used was intended to prevent.
</pre>
    <pre>[18]  The  meaning  and  interaction  of  the  various  statutory</pre>
    <pre>provisions in the Criminal Code providing for the defence of self-</pre>
    <pre>defence are notoriously confusing and illogical:  R. v. McIntosh,</pre>
    <pre>[1995]  1 S.C.R. 686 at 696-97;  R. v. Pintar (1996), 110  C.C.C.</pre>
    <pre>(3d)  402  at  412  (Ont. C.A.).  Part of  the  confusion  arises</pre>
    <pre>because while s. 34 and s. 35 describe three very specific  forms</pre>
    <pre>of  the defence of self-defence, s. 37 seems so broadly worded as</pre>
    <pre>to   be   potentially  applicable  to  the  specific   situations</pre>
    <pre>contemplated by s. 34 and s. 35:  R. v. McIntosh, supra at 708.</pre>
    <pre>[19] As indicated above, the trial judge found that the

appellant&#146;s conduct during the first altercation provoked the

complainant&#146;s assault on him during the second altercation.  In

the light of this finding, s.34(1) was not available to the

appellant.  Section 34(2) and s. 35 are available to an accused

who provokes an assault, however, both require that the accused

respond to the provoked assault under a &#147;reasonable apprehension

of death or grievous bodily harm&#148;:  s. 34(2)(a) and s. 35(a)(i).

Consequently, neither section could assist the appellant in this

case.

[20] Unless s. 37 has application, it must be concluded that an

accused who provokes an assault cannot justify defending himself

from that assault unless the assault reaches the level where the

accused reasonably apprehends death or grievous bodily harm.

This makes no sense.  It ignores human nature. Even persons who

provoke assaults cannot realistically be expected to submit to

retaliation short of that which causes a reasonable apprehension

of death or grievous bodily harm.  Furthermore, an interpretation

which would deny self-defence to a provoked assault except in

cases covered by s. 34(2) or. s.35  would effectively invite the

escalation of a confrontation until it reached the level where

those sections could be triggered.  This is hardly good criminal

law policy.

[21] An accused who has provoked an attack may be criminally

liable for that provocation if it is a criminal act, as in this

case.  The accused may also have difficulty convincing a trier of

fact that his subsequent conduct was defensive if he in fact

provoked the assault.  I see no sound policy reason, however, for

denying an accused the possibility of the defence of self-defence

in cases where the accused provoked the attack, but the attack

has not yet reached the level where the accused has a reasonable

apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm.

[22] Section 37 is available to an accused who has provoked the

assault:  R. v. Pintar, supra, at 423-24.  As Lamer C.J.C. said

in R. v. McIntosh, supra, at 708:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Although Parliament&#146;s intention in enacting s. 37 is
          unclear, at the very least the provision must serve a &#145;gap
          filling&#146; role, providing the basis for self-defence where ss. 34
          and 35 are not applicable.
</pre>
    <pre>[23] As neither s. 34 nor s. 35 address the situation in which an</pre>
    <pre>accused  reacts to protect himself from a provoked assault  which</pre>
    <pre>has  not  reached the level of creating a reasonable apprehension</pre>
    <pre>of  death or grievous bodily harm, there is a &#147;gap&#148; in s. 34  and</pre>
    <pre>s.35.  As Lamer C.J.C. said in R. v. McIntosh,  s. 37 can be used</pre>
    <pre>to fill that gap.  Moreover, resort to s. 37 in this circumstance</pre>
    <pre>does not create any inconsistency with s.34(2) or s. 35, although</pre>
    <pre>it  must  be  said that it may render the distinction  between  a</pre>
    <pre>provoked  and  unprovoked assault drawn in  s.  34(1)  of  little</pre>
    <pre>consequence.  This may be yet another inconsistency  arising  out</pre>
    <pre>of  various descriptions of the defence of self-defence  provided</pre>
    <pre>in the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Section 37 had application in this case.  The Crown

concedes, quite properly in my view, that on the trial judge&#146;s

findings, the force used by the appellant to prevent the

complainant&#146;s assault was no more than was necessary in the

circumstances. The appellant&#146;s response was sufficiently

proportional to the complainant&#146;s assault so as to justify the

appellant&#146;s conduct under s. 37.</pre>
    <pre>Was s. 34(1) available to the appellant?
</pre>
    <pre>[25] Given my conclusion with respect to s. 37, it is unnecessary</pre>
    <pre>to consider this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>                                </pre>
    <pre>                                 III.

</pre>
    <pre>[26]  Although  I would affirm the conviction on  the  charge  of</pre>
    <pre>assault  with a weapon, I would do so only on the basis that  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant&#146;s  conduct during the first altercation constituted  an</pre>
    <pre>assault   with  a  weapon.   His  behaviour  during  the   second</pre>
    <pre>altercation was justified under s. 37.</pre>
    <pre>                                </pre>
    <pre>                                  IV
</pre>
    <pre>Was the sentence fit?
</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Counsel for the appellant makes two arguments.  He  submits</pre>
    <pre>first  that  the trial judge should have granted the appellant  a</pre>
    <pre>conditional  discharge.   He contends that  this  submission  has</pre>
    <pre>added  force  if  the appellant&#146;s liability  rests  only  in  his</pre>
    <pre>conduct during the first altercation.  Counsel next submits  that</pre>
    <pre>several of the terms of the probation order imposed by the  trial</pre>
    <pre>judge were inappropriate.  These terms were intended to establish</pre>
    <pre>a  peace  along  the  right  of way and hopefully  avoid  further</pre>
    <pre>confrontations between the appellant and his neighbour.   Counsel</pre>
    <pre>submits  that concerns relating to the ongoing dispute  over  the</pre>
    <pre>use  of  the  right of way could not be resolved by  terms  of  a</pre>
    <pre>probation  order, but rather had to be addressed  in  appropriate</pre>
    <pre>civil  litigation.  Finally, counsel argues that one of the terms</pre>
    <pre>imposed  by  the trial judge impacted on property  owned  by  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant&#146;s wife.</pre>
    <pre>
[28] I will deal first with the suitability of the probation

terms.  I do not propose to set these terms out.  Suffice it to

say that they are not the kind of terms normally found in a

probation order.  I also do not think that the trial judge would

have imposed them but for counsel for the appellant&#146;s invitation

to do so.  The trial judge took up counsel&#146;s invitation and tried

to fashion terms which would establish an environment along the

right of way that would diminish the risk of further

confrontation.

[29] It is clear from a review of the transcript that counsel for

the appellant (not counsel who appeared on the appeal) promoted

and suggested the very terms which the appellant now attacks.  In

the circumstances of this case and, given the appellant&#146;s

position at trial, I do not regard any of the terms as

inappropriate, or beyond the scope of s. 732.1(3)(h) of the

Criminal Code.  If new information has come to light which

affects the propriety of any of these terms, then the appellant

should go back to the trial judge and apply for a variation of

the terms he advocated during the sentencing proceedings.
</pre>
    <pre>[30]  The  question  of whether the appellant  should  receive  a</pre>
    <pre>conditional discharge on the same terms as those set out  in  the</pre>
    <pre>probation order is a difficult one.  The trial judge was asked to</pre>
    <pre>grant  a  conditional discharge, but declined to do so.   On  the</pre>
    <pre>facts  as  found by him, I can see no error in principle  in  his</pre>
    <pre>decision  to  refuse a discharge.  Things are, however,  somewhat</pre>
    <pre>different  now.   The appellant stands convicted  solely  on  the</pre>
    <pre>basis  of  his  conduct  during  the  initial  altercation.   The</pre>
    <pre>incident  which  led to the minor injury to the  complainant  was</pre>
    <pre>justified and cannot count against the appellant on sentencing.</pre>
    <pre>[31] The appellant is 67 years old.  He is a retired engineer and

worked his entire adult life until his retirement.  He also

served in the military.  He has no criminal record and is, but

for his confrontation with his neighbours, a valuable and

responsible member of the community.

[32] It is clear, however, that the appellant has his own

entrenched views concerning this right of way and the steps that

he is entitled to take to enforce those views.  He has made life

difficult for his neighbours and it is clear that his trial and

conviction have not caused him to change his attitude.  The

author of the pre-sentence report wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Given that the subject failed to accept responsibility for
          his present situation and expresses a negative attitude towards
          the criminal justice system, it remains questionable as to
          whether a term of supervised probation would be of any benefit to
          the subject.
</pre>
    <pre>[33]  I  am  very  concerned that a variation of the  appellant&#146;s</pre>
