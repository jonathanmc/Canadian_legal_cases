<h1>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h1>
<p>RE: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and L. F. (Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE: FINLAYSON, AUSTIN AND MOLDAVER JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL: Anthony Moustacalis, for the appellant Philip A. Downes, for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD: April 14, 1999 </p>
<p>On appeal from the judgment of Zelenski J., dated January 13, 1997. </p>
<p class="boldcenter"> ENDORSEMENT </p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his convictions for sexual assault and for sexual 
  touching. The facts in overview are as follows:</p>
<p>[2] In the spring of 1993 the complainant was 13 years old and living in Toronto 
  with her mother. The appellant was her mother's boyfriend who spent a lot of 
  time at the complainant's house, and whom both the complainant and the appellant 
  viewed as her step-father. Towards the end of 1992, the appellant started to 
  touch the complainant by patting her on the bum as she went upstairs. Some time 
  after that, he started to kiss her, and try to fondle her breasts. His conduct 
  became more and more sexually intrusive, until around about May, 1993 he had 
  sex with her against her will. The touching continued on and off, until the 
  appellant made a second attempt to have intercourse with the complainant, but 
  was interrupted when the complainant's cousin came to the door. In July 1993 
  the complainant moved to Timmins to live with her aunt. The complainant's relationship 
  with her mother was, to say the least, strained. Towards the end of 1993, the 
  complainant's mother telephoned her, and accused her of wanting her boyfriend, 
  and of ruining her life. The complainant was upset by the call, and shortly 
  thereafter disclosed the assaults by the appellant to her aunt. The appellant 
  denied the accusations. It was the clear position of the defence that the complainant 
  had fabricated the allegations in an attempt to get back at her mother, who 
  had mistreated her for years, and who was now threatening to send her back to 
  Jamaica.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant raised ten grounds of appeal against conviction in his factum. 
  Without dealing with each in detail, we feel confident in stating that, for 
  the most part, they relate to rulings made by the trial judge with respect to 
  the admissibility of evidence and in imposing restrictions on the manner in 
  which both counsel for the Crown and the defence conducted their cross- examinations. 
  It is not the function of this court to critique the performance of a trial 
  judge, particularly in areas that involve an exercise of discretion. Any objection 
  we would give effect to in this area would have to carry substance. None of 
  the objections here falls within that category.</p>
<p>[4] It is also contended that there were errors in the trial judge's instructions 
  to the jury. We feel it necessary to identify only one, and that was the submission 
  that the trial judge failed to follow the instructions later laid down by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3rd) 1. We have 
  considered the charge on this issue as a whole and note that it conforms to 
  charges in common use in this province prior to Lifchus. The jury was adequately 
  instructed on the meaning of &#147;reasonable doubt&#148; and we are not prepared 
  to give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>[5] In the last analysis, while there are other grounds relating to the jury 
  charge, we are satisfied that the appellant received a fair trial and that the 
  charge to the jury was balanced and impartial.</p>
<p>[6] A final ground of appeal raised as to conviction relates to the reasonableness 
  of the jury's verdict. The appellant testified and his evidence was clearly 
  rejected. However, his testimony and other evidence adduced in cross-examination 
  put forward fully the theory of the defence, particularly that there was animosity 
  between the complainant and her mother and that the complainant turned on the 
  appellant when she perceived that he had stopped supporting her against her 
  mother. This is not an unreasonable verdict.</p>
<p>[7] As to sentence, the trial judge committed no error in principle nor was 
  the sentence manifestly unfit. It was acknowledged that the appellant was in 
  a position of trust with respect to the complainant and the trial judge found 
  as a fact that he was aware of her vulnerability as a young person with a difficult 
  past. He addressed the applicable principles of sentencing, focusing his concern 
  on the principle of general deterrence. Notwithstanding the absence of any record, 
  the sentence of four years in the penitentiary was within the appropriate range.</p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted but the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
