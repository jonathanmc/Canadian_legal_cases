    <pre>On appeal from the Certificate of Assessment Officer M. Kane
dated February 15, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The issue on this appeal is the extent to which self-
represented lawyers are entitled to recover costs in litigation
to which they are parties.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS AND HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>[2]       The costs at issue arise from an earlier proceeding
before this court.  The firm of Genest Murray DesBrisay Lamek
appealed an order that it pay solicitor/client costs of an
unsuccessful motion to remove the solicitors representing the
respondents.  The appeal was successfully argued by Eric Murray,
Q.C., counsel to the firm, and Genest Murray was awarded party
and party costs.  The costs were assessed.  Genest Murray claimed
an allowance for counsel fee for Mr. Murray&#146;s work and also
claimed an allowance for the work of certain salaried associates,
a partner, and an articling student, all of whom assisted Mr.
Murray in preparing the appeal.  It was common ground before both
the Assessment Officer and this court that Genest Murray is
entitled to recover an allowance for Mr. Murray&#146;s counsel fee as
Mr. Murray is not a member of the firm. However, the respondents
contended before the Assessment Officer that the firm was not
entitled to recover anything for the work of the salaried
associates, the partner or the articling student.  The Assessment
Officer accepted that submission.  Relying on an unreported
decision, Carrier v. Turner (June 8, 1994, Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.),
the Assessment Officer held that &#147;the fees of Genest Murray&#146;s own
lawyers who worked on the appeal with Genest Murray&#146;s counsel,
Mr. Eric Murray, are not assessable&#148;.
[3]  Genest Murray appeals the decision of the Assessment Officer
to this court pursuant to Courts of Justice Act, s.6(1)(c).  The
matter came before Labrosse J.A. pursuant to s.7(2).  He
determined that, as there were conflicting decisions in the area,
the matter ought to be heard by a panel of the court pursuant to
s.7(4).</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant&#146;s position is that the evolution of statutory
and common law removed any limitation on the right of self-
represented lawyers to recover costs.  The position of the
respondents is that there is a general rule in Ontario that a
self-represented lawyer is entitled to assess only solicitor&#146;s
fees and disbursements and that fees for trial preparation and
counsel fees are not recoverable.  While they concede the
appellant&#146;s entitlement to a counsel fee for Mr. Murray, they
submit that the additional costs claimed are also in the nature
of a counsel fee to which the appellant has no right.
[5]  Most of the costs at issue relate to the work of salaried
associates and an articling student.  In my view, the appellant&#146;s
claim to an allowance for these salaried employees is justified
by the Solicitors Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15, s. 36:
          </pre>
    <pre>    36.  Costs awarded to a party in a proceeding shall not be
    disallowed or reduced on assessment merely because they relate to
    a solicitor or counsel who is a salaried employee of the party.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant was awarded these costs in the proceeding and
I can see no reason to deny it the benefit of this statutory
provision with respect to costs related to salaried employees.
Section 36 replaced a narrower provision, s. 37 of the Solicitors
Act, R.S.O., 1980, c. 478, which allowed recovery of costs by
corporations for salaried employees who were entitled to receive
the costs as part of their remuneration in addition to salary.
In my view, the general language of the current provision,
deleting any reference to corporations or to the requirement that
the employee be entitled to receive the costs, applies to law
firms which are awarded costs as parties to proceedings .
[7]  It is conceded by the appellant that s. 36 does not apply to
the costs claimed on account of the work of the partner who is
not a salaried employee, and accordingly, I refer to the common
law to resolve that issue.  On that aspect of the case, the
starting point is London Scottish Benefits Society v. Chorley,
(1884) 13 Q.B.D. 872, where the English Court of Appeal held that
a self-represented solicitor is entitled to costs.  Brett M.R.
reasoned that it would be wrong to require a solicitor who is a
party to retain another solicitor to conduct the litigation as a
condition of recovering costs.  This would, he said, amount &#147;to a
mere circuity&#148; as the loss of the self-represented solicitor&#146;s
time devoted to the legal work necessary for the case amounted to
a financial loss.  The court held, however, that the self-
represented solicitor&#146;s costs should be taxed on a different
basis to avoid recovery of costs for the time and trouble faced
by any litigant.  The solicitor would not be entitled &#147;to include
items which the union of the two characters in the same
individual renders impossible, such as instructions to,
consultations with, and attendances on a solicitor, who in such a
case is the party himself&#148;.  In effect, Chorley holds that self-
represented solicitors are entitled to claim costs on the basis
that by devoting their personal efforts to the litigation rather
than other remunerative professional work, they incur an
opportunity cost which is compensable.  Chorley has been followed
in Ontario: see, e.g. Lalancette v. Walford, [1927] 4 D.L.R. 642
(Ont. S.C.).
[8]  The Chorley case arose from a regime of a profession divided
between solicitors and barristers and did not concern the
question of counsel fees.  The respondents maintain that the
distinction between a solicitor&#146;s fees and counsel fees for the
work of a barrister continues to govern this area of the law in
Ontario. They rely on the decision of the former Divisional Court
in Johnston v. Ryckman (1903), 7 O.L.R. 511.  In that case, one
member of a firm was sued.  He retained his partner on a fee for
service basis.  The court held that the lawyer-litigant was
entitled to recover costs, including a counsel fee, but only
because he had retained another lawyer and agreed to pay him a
counsel fee for his work.  Had he not entered that arrangement
with his partner, or had he represented himself, the court stated
that no counsel fee would have been allowed.  Boyd C. observed at
521:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The reason why a barrister, sued as a defendant, and who
    acts as his own counsel, cannot recover for counsel fees is
    because he is in the same plight in this regard as the lay client
    who pleads his own cause.  He is not in Court as an officer of
    the Court, but as a litigant.  The necessary factor in the
    taxation of counsel fees is that the money must be disbursed for
    the payment of them as a condition precedent, and the barrister-
    litigant cannot pay money or be liable to himself.  There is no
    principle in the matter beyond this &#150; it is rather a rule of
    practice or procedure than anything higher.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In a similar vein, Meredith J. noted the distinction between
recovery for solicitor&#146;s costs and taxing a counsel fee and
observed at p.524:
          </pre>
    <pre>    I am unable to state any principle upon which all of these
    rulings can be supported.  It cannot be upon the principle that
    party and party costs are to be looked upon as indemnity only,
    for that would exclude solicitor&#146;s costs as well as counsel&#146;s
    fees.  Nor can it be because of the impossibility of making
    payment to one&#146;s self, for that is far from impossible&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[10] He concluded that while there seemed to be no basis for the
distinction, it was long-standing, and on that account, ought not
to be disturbed.
[11] The respondents cite several modern cases that appear to
follow the rule that a self-represented lawyer may not recover
anything by way of counsel fee: see:  Fanaken v. Bell Temple
(1985), 49 C.P.C. 212 (Assessment Officer); Tory, Tory Deslaurier
and Binnington v. Concert Productions International Inc. (1986),
14 C.P.C. (2nd) 103 (Assessment Officer); Argiris v. Canadiana
Realty Ltd. [1998] O.J. 2146.  See also Watson v. Holyoake
(1986), 15 C.P.C. (2d) 262 (Ont. H.C.) at 269.  In Carrier v.
Turner, supra, the case relied upon by the Assessment Officer,
Klowak J. stated that the rationale for recovery of costs was
indemnity.  In her view, it followed that a self-represented
solicitor had no claim and that the contrary line of reasoning
&#147;injects into a costs award the concept of damages and a source
of profit&#148;.
[12] There are a number of cases to the contrary holding that a
self-represented lawyer may recover costs, including counsel fee.
Jaffe v. Dearing (1992), 7 C.P.C. (3rd) 225 involved a self-
represented Florida lawyer.  Austin J. held (at 231) that to
follow the traditional rule &#147;would be to confuse form and
substance&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>    Had Dearing [the self-represented lawyer] retained counsel
    he would have had to pay counsel.  That payment would have been
    earned by Dearing, in theory at least, during the time that the
    case was being tried and Dearing himself was not in the witness
    box.  He could or would have been gainfully employed elsewhere.
    To quote Dearing, &#145;an attorney&#146;s time is his stock in trade&#146;; why
    in principle should he not be paid for it?</pre>
    <pre>[13] Austin J. noted that counsel fees had been allowed by
certain assessment officers: Endicott v. Halliday (1982), 28
C.P.C. 114; Wright and McTaggart v. Soapac Industries Ltd.
(1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 394. He concluded that the indemnity
principle did apply and that the &#147;time is money&#148; or opportunity
cost rationale justified an award of costs, including the
appropriate fees for preparation for an appearance at trial, to
the self-represented lawyer.
[14] While Klowak J. refused to follow Jaffe v. Dearing, in
Carrier v. Turner, supra, Austin J.&#146;s ruling has been followed in
a number of cases: see Gunning Estate v. Abrams [1997] O.J. No.
4364 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.); Jouppi v. Guy [1997] O.J. No. 2170
(Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).  Most recently, the matter received the
detailed attention of Ellen Macdonald J. in Fellowes, McNeil v.
Kansa General International Insurance Company (1997), 37 O.R.
(3d) 464.  After a thorough review of the authorities, including
cases dealing with self-represented litigants to which I will
refer below, Ellen Macdonald J. held that a self-represented
lawyer could be awarded costs, including costs for counsel fees
at trial.
[15] The appellant relies on a number of decisions, discussed
below, on the right of self-represented lay litigants to recover
costs.  The appellant submits that those cases establish that lay
litigants may be awarded costs, including counsel fee, and that
it follows that self-represented solicitors must be similarly
entitled.
[16] Dicta from the Chorley case, supra, was long thought to
preclude recovery by self-represented lay litigants of any costs
beyond disbursements.  In Chorley,  the English Court of Appeal
stated that the opportunity cost rationale did not apply to self-
represented lay litigants.  In the court&#146;s view, a self-
represented litigant who is not a solicitor should not be
entitled to recover costs as such a party does not bring
professional skill and competence to the case and a litigant&#146;s
own time and trouble is not a pecuniary loss which the law can
measure.  Bowen L.J. held that the common law rule precluded
recovery, but noted that the Court of Chancery had on occasion
allowed a reasonable allowance for the self-represented
litigant&#146;s loss of time.  He quoted a leading text on Chancery
practice, Lush&#146;s Practice (3d ed.) at 896:  &#147;A party not an
attorney, suing or defending in person, is entitled to no more
than his expenses out of pocket or at most to a reasonable
allowance beyond for his loss of time&#133;&#148;.
[17] In more recent times, the English courts recognized the
inconsistency of allowing self-represented lawyers to recover for
their time while refusing the same right to lay litigants.  In
Buckland v. Watts [1970] 1 Q.B. 27 at 31, Donaldson J. observed
that in principle the opportunity cost rationale applied equally
to self-represented lay litigants, and that their time could be
compensated with appropriate modification for lack of
professional skill and training.  However, Donaldson J. held that
he was not free to depart from past authority, and he disallowed
the lay litigant&#146;s claim.  His decision was upheld on appeal:
[1970] 1 Q.B. 27 at 35-38.  The anomaly in the United Kingdom was
removed by legislation that now allows lay litigants to recover
costs: Litigants in Person (Costs and Expenses ) Act (U.K.),
1975, c. 47.
[18] In an early Ontario case, Millar v. Macdonald (1892), 14
P.R. 449 (Div. Ct.) at 501, the Chancery rule, referred to above,
was applied.  Boyd C. held that the successful self-represented
defendant was to be awarded &#147;disbursements and some allowance,
but of a moderate description, for his time and trouble on the
argument&#148;.  Boyd C. noted, however, that the award was
exceptional, and was made because the defendant had been faced
with committal for contempt.
[19] While there appears to be little Ontario authority on the
subject, appellate courts in two provinces have held that self-
represented lay litigants may be awarded costs.  In Macbeth v.
Dalhousie College and University (1986), 10 C.P.C. (2d) 69, the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that a self-represented lay
litigant was entitled to recover costs primarily on the basis
that the common law rule precluding such recovery constituted a
denial of equality rights guaranteed by s. 15 of Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.  This reasoning was superceded by subsequent
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada precluding the direct
application of the Charter to common law rules governing
litigation between private parties (Retail, Wholesale &amp;
Department Store Union, Local 580 v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.,
[1986] 2 S.C.R. 573) and insisting on the need to establish
discrimination on an enumerated or analogous ground to support a
s.15 claim (Andrews v. Law Society of Upper Canada, [1989] 1
S.C.R. 143).  In Law Society of Prince Edward Island v. Johnston,
(1988), 54 D.L.R. (4th) 18, the Prince Edward Island Court of
Appeal, referring to Dolphin Delivery, supra, held that the
Charter did not apply to the claim of a self represented litigant
to costs.  That court also rejected the claim on the ground that
costs could only be awarded on an indemnity basis.
[20] The British Columbia Court of Appeal arrived at the same
result achieved in the Macbeth case without resort to the
Charter.  In Skidmore v. Blackmore (1995), 122 D.L.R. (4th) 330,
a five judge panel of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
overruled the court&#146;s earlier decision in Kendall v. Hunt (1979),
106 D.L.R. (3rd) 277, which held that self-represented litigants
could not recover costs in excess of disbursements.  In Skidmore,
the court found that the 19th century English rule reflected by
the Chorley and Buckland cases could no longer be justified.
Cumming J.A. pointed out that modern cost rules reflected a
variety of purposes.  While indemnity remained one important
element, costs were also ordered or withheld as a means of
controlling behaviour by discouraging frivolous suits or
meritorious defences, and as a way of sanctioning unnecessary
steps in litigation, as well as misconduct by litigants or their
counsel.  Modern costs rules also were designed to promote and
encourage settlements.  In Cumming J.A.&#146;s view, it was important
for the court to have at its disposal full costs sanctions,
whether litigants were represented or unrepresented.  Moreover,
the refusal to allow self-represented costs on indemnity grounds
was difficult to justify as the &#147;time is money&#148; rationale applies
every bit as much to the lay litigant as to the self-represented
lawyer.  Cumming J.A. noted that any difficulty in measuring the
amount to which the lay litigant is entitled could be answered in
British Columbia by strict application of the tariff.  Finally,
it was held that the court was competent to effect this change in
the common law as (at 342) &#147;the matter of costs is a question
essentially within the discretion of the court, it bears directly
on matters of practice, and it is something on which this court
is well situated to rule&#148;.
[21] It is apparent from this review of the case law that the
preponderance of modern authority supports the contention that
both self-represented lawyers and self-represented lay litigants
may be awarded costs and that such costs may include allowances
for counsel fees.  Since the Chorley decision in 1884, it seems
not to have been doubted that self-represented solicitors could
recover costs for solicitor&#146;s fees.  The respondents did not take
issue with that proposition on this appeal.  Johnson v. Ryckman,
supra stands for the proposition that a self-represented
solicitor could not recover anything for counsel fee, but as I
have already noted, it was acknowledged in that case that there
seemed to be no rationale for the rule.  I am not persuaded by
the respondent&#146;s submission that this 1903 case, which rests on
such a shaky foundation, should continue to govern us today.
Johnson v. Ryckman has been superceded by more recent cases that
have quite properly ignored the untenable distinction between
solicitor&#146;s fees and counsel fees.  I can see no reason for
maintaining the distinction between solicitor&#146;s fees and counsel
fees that was already outmoded almost one hundred years ago.  The
legislature&#146;s decision to allow parties to recover costs in
relation to the work of salaried employees provides added impetus
to reject the view that self-represented solicitors should be
precluded from recovering costs.  Two provincial appellate courts
have held that lay litigants may recover costs, including counsel
fees.  The clear trend of both the common law and the statutory
law is to allow for recovery of costs by self-represented
litigants.
[22] Quite apart from authority and as a matter of principle, it
seems to me to be difficult to justify a categorical rule denying
recovery of costs by self-represented litigants.  As noted in the
Fellowes McNeil, supra and in Skidmore, supra, modern cost rules
are designed to foster three fundamental purposes: (1) to
indemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation; (2) to
encourage settlements; and (3) to discourage and sanction
inappropriate behaviour by litigants.  It seems to me that all
three purposes are fostered by allowing the trial judge a
discretion to award costs to self-represented litigants.
[23] Since the Chorley case over one hundred years ago, it had
been accepted that self-represented lawyers are entitled to
indemnity on the &#147;time is money&#148; or opportunity cost rationale.
It is difficult to see why the opportunity cost rationale should
not be more generally applicable to self-represented litigants.
The self-represented lawyer possesses legal skills, but lacks
professional detachment when acting in his or her own cause.  If
the law is prepared to compensate lawyers for this loss of time
when devoting their efforts to their own cause, I fail to see any
basis for denying the same entitlement to self-represented lay
litigants who are able to demonstrate the same loss.
[24] A rule precluding recovery of costs, in whole or in part, by
self-represented litigants would deprive the court of a
potentially useful tool to encourage settlements and to
discourage or sanction inappropriate behaviour.  For example, an
opposite party should not be able to ignore the reasonable
settlement offer of a self-represented litigant with impunity
from the usual costs consequences.  Nor, in my view, is it
desirable to immunize such a party from costs awards designed to
sanction inappropriate behaviour simply because the other party
is a self-represented litigant.
[25] I would add that nothing in these reasons is meant to
suggest that a self-represented litigant has an automatic right
to recover costs.  The matter remains fully within the discretion
of the trial judge, and as Ellen Macdonald J. observed in
Fellows, McNeil v. Kansa, supra, there are undoubtedly cases
where it is inappropriate for a lawyer to appear in person, and
there will be cases where the self-represented litigant&#146;s conduct
of the proceedings is inappropriate.  The trial judge maintains a
discretion to make the appropriate costs award, including denial
of costs.
[26] I would also add that self-represented litigants, be they
legally trained or not, are not entitled to costs calculated on
the same basis as those of the litigant who retains counsel. As
the Chorley case, supra, recognized, all litigants suffer a loss
of time through their involvement in the legal process.  The self-
represented litigant should not recover costs for the time and
effort that any litigant would have to devote to the case.  Costs
should only be awarded to those lay litigants who can demonstrate
that they devoted time and effort to do the work ordinarily done
by a lawyer retained to conduct the litigation, and that as a
result, they incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing
remunerative activity.  As the early Chancery rule recognized, a
self-represented lay litigant should receive only a &#147;moderate&#148; or
&#147;reasonable&#148; allowance for the loss of time devoted to preparing
and presenting the case.  This excludes routine awards on a per
diem basis to litigants who would ordinarily be in attendance at
court in any event.  The trial judge is particularly well-placed
to assess the appropriate allowance, if any, for a self-
represented litigant, and accordingly, the trial judge should
either fix the costs when making such an award or provide clear
guidelines to the Assessment Officer as to the manner in which
the costs are to be assessed.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[27] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, and set aside
the Certificate. It is still necessary to determine whether the
amounts claimed for the salaried associates, partners and
articling student are reasonable.  Accordingly, I would refer the
matter back to the Assessment Officer with a direction that the
costs be assessed in accordance with these reasons.  The
appellant is also entitled to costs of the Assessment and of this
appeal.</pre>
