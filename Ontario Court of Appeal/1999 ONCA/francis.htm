</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice McNeely dated May 6,
1998;  (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 74.</pre>
      <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:
</pre>
      <pre>                                  I
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  Maria Francis (Ms. Francis) has been in Canada illegally for
11 years.  Her oldest son, Cleavon, has been in Canada illegally
for about 9 years.  Her two other children, Daniella and Shanice
were born in Canada.
[2]  Ms. Francis was born in Grenada.  She came to Canada from
Venezuela as a visitor in 1988.  Her son arrived about two years
later.  Ms. Francis initially tried to secure permanent residence
in Canada by way of a refugee claim, but eventually abandoned
that claim.  In January 1994, a deportation order was made
against her.  She applied for an exemption under s. 114(2) of the
Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (“the Act”).  That section
permits the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the
“Minister”) to exempt any person from any regulation where the
Minister is satisfied that the person should be exempted owing to
the existence of “compassionate or humanitarian consideration.”
That application was ultimately rejected.  By November 1997, Ms.
Francis had exhausted her remedies under the Immigration Act and
she and Cleavon were subject to deportation orders.
[3]  The children, through their litigation guardian, then
commenced an application in the Ontario Court (General Division)
seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Minister.
The children argued that the deportation of their mother would
interfere with their constitutional right to remain in Canada and
their constitutional rights to remain as part of a family unit.
The children purported to invoke the parens patriae jurisdiction
of the Ontario Court (General Division).  The deportation orders
were stayed pending the hearing of the application.
[4]  McNeely J. granted the application.  He quashed the
deportation order against Ms. Francis and directed that no
further order should be made, except after proceedings of which
the Canadian-born children had notice and in which their best
interests were considered.  He also enjoined the Minister from
deporting Cleavon for a period of thirty days following the
determination of the mother’s claim.  Finally, he declared that
it was in the best interests of the two Canadian-born children
that they remain in Canada with their mother.
[5]  The Minister appealed.</pre>
      <pre>     II</pre>
      <pre>[6]  On the argument of the appeal in January 1999, there was
considerable debate as to whether the interests of the Canadian
children could be properly addressed in an application brought
under s. 114(2) of the Act.  It was argued by the respondents
that to the extent that those interests could not be effectively
addressed, there was a gap in the process which justified the
exercise of the Ontario Court (General Division) parens patriae
jurisdiction.
[7]  The court was told that the question of the extent to which
children’s interests should be addressed in an application
brought under s. 114(2) of the Act was under reserve by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (The Minister of
Citizenship and Immigration).  The court decided to reserve
judgment pending the decision in Baker.  That decision was
released in July 1999.  Baker clarifies the procedures to be
followed on a s. 114(2) application and the relevance of the
interests of the children affected by a deportation order to the
exercise of the discretion created by s. 114(2).
[8]  Following the release of Baker, the court had hoped that
counsel could come to some agreement whereby Ms. Francis and her
son could renew their s. 114(2) application and have it
reconsidered in accordance with the principles set down in Baker.
Unfortunately, counsel could not agree.  Counsel for the Minister
takes the position that the appeal should be decided and has
advised the court that if the appeal is allowed and the order of
McNeely J. set aside, that the authorities will take steps to
remove Ms. Francis and Cleavon from the country.
[9]  Counsel for the Minister submitted that McNeely J. erred in
failing to stay the application brought by the children.  He
acknowledged that McNeely J. had jurisdiction to consider the
application, but contended that as it raised issues which were
essentially immigration matters, McNeely J. should have declined
to exercise that jurisdiction.  Counsel for the Minister
characterizes the application before McNeely as an attempt to re-
litigate immigration issues which were or could have been raised
in the course of the proceedings which eventually led to the
deportation orders against Ms. Francis and Cleavon.  Counsel
points to the terms of McNeely J.’s order as the clearest
indication that the proceedings involved immigration matters.  He
relies on Reza v. Canada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394, and Peiroo v.
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 69 O.R.
(2d) 253 (C.A.), to support his submission that McNeely J. should
have stayed the proceedings.
[10] The children and Ms. Francis, who is a respondent on the
application, do not take issue with the general proposition that
immigration matters should be dealt with under that Act.  They
submit, however, that this application involved a determination
of the rights of Canadian-born children and not immigration
matters.  They contend that McNeely J. properly invoked the
court’s parens patriae jurisdiction and addressed the merits of
the application.
[11] Similar applications, brought by children of a parent under
a deportation order, have been made in at least two other cases.
In John (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (The Minister of
Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 46 Imm. L.R. (2d) 112 (Ont.
Ct. (Gen. Div.)), Dambrot J. accepted the argument made by the
Minister in this case and stayed the application.1  In
Pirakalathan Ratnavel v. Canada (The Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration), March 12, 1999, Toronto, 99 CV-163413 (Ont. Ct.
(Gen. Div.)), Sachs J. declined to enter a stay and issued
injunctive relief pending proceedings in the Federal Court.
[12] In my view, the lis of the application before McNeely J. is
properly characterized as an immigration matter.  In essence, the
application was an attack on the deportation orders on the basis
that they interfered with the children’s constitutional rights
and had been made without according procedural fairness to the
children.  This court has expressed the view that, generally,
immigration matters are best dealt with under the comprehensive
scheme established under that Act.  Judicial review of decisions
made under the Act are left to the Federal Court.  That is not to
say that the provincial superior court should always yield to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Court.  There will be situations in
which the Federal Court is not an effective or appropriate forum
in which to seek the relief claimed.  In those rare cases, the
superior court can properly exercise  its jurisdiction.
[13] McNeely J.’s refusal to stay the children’s application may
have been justified on the basis that, as the law stood at the
time of the application, it was unclear whether the interests of
the children could be addressed when a parent brought an
application under s.114(2) of the Act.  If those interests could
not be assessed adequately, arguably the Federal Court was not an
appropriate forum in which to seek judicial review of a decision
on the basis that the decision did not properly consider the
interests of the children.  Given the uncertainty in the law, it
is arguable that McNeely J. was entitled to proceed to consider
the application on the merits.
[14] The decision in Baker v. Canada (The Minister of Citizenship
and Immigration) (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.) has
eliminated that uncertainty.  Ms. Baker brought an application
under s. 114(2) based in part on the negative impact her
deportation would have on her Canadian-born children.  The
Minister refused relief under s. 114(2) and judicial review was
refused in the Federal Court.
[15] It was accepted by all parties in Baker that the Minister
owed a duty of procedural fairness to applicants seeking relief
under s. 114(2) of the Act.  In determining the scope of that
duty, L’Heureux-Dubé J., for the majority, said, at p. 215:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … the circumstances require a full and fair consideration of
          the issues, and the claimant and others whose important interests
          are affected by the decision in a fundamental way must have a
          meaningful opportunity to present the various types of evidence
          relevant to their case and have it fully and fairly considered.</pre>
      <pre>[16] In concluding that the duty of fairness had been met in the
case, L’Heureux-Dubé J. also stated, at p. 216:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … The opportunity, which was accorded, for the appellant or
          her children to produce full and complete written documentation
          in relation to all aspects of her application satisfied the
          requirements of the participatory rights required by the duty of
          fairness in this case.</pre>
      <pre>[17] These passages make it clear that those potentially affected
by the exercise of the discretion under s. 114(2), including
children, must have an opportunity to have their position put
before the official considering the application.  In most cases
involving young children, I would think that this would be done
through the parent.
[18] L’Heureux-Dubé J. next considered whether the officers
involved in the s. 114(2) inquiry demonstrated a reasonable
apprehension of bias.  She found that one of the officers had
demonstrated bias and she would have quashed the decision on that
basis alone.  She went on, however, to determine whether, apart
from the bias issue, the exercise of the discretion under s.
114(2) was unreasonable in all of the circumstances.  In doing
so, she focused on the relevance of the interests of the children
to the exercise of the discretion granted in s. 114(2).  She
wrote at p. 230:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … In my opinion, a reasonable exercise of the power
          conferred by the section [114(2)] requires close attention to the
          interests and needs of children.  Children’s rights, and
          attention to their interests, are central humanitarian and
          compassionate values in Canadian society.  Indications of
          children’s interests has important considerations governing the
          manner in which H &amp; C powers [humanitarian and compassionate]
          should be exercised may be found, for example, in the purposes of
          the Act, in international instruments, and in the guidelines for
          making H &amp; C decisions published by the Minister herself.</pre>
      <pre>[19] In describing how those rights should be addressed,
L’Heureux-Dubé J. opined at p. 233:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … The principles discussed above indicate that, for the
          exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of
          reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider children’s
          best interests as an important factor, give them substantial
          weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them.  That is not
          to say that children’s best interests must always outweigh other
          considerations or that there will not be other reasons for
          denying an H &amp; C claim even when children’s interests are given
          this consideration.  However, where the interests of children are
          minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada’s humanitarian
          and compassionate tradition and the Minister’s guidelines, the
          decision will be unreasonable.</pre>
      <pre>[20] Applying that principle to the facts before her, L’Heureux-
Dubé J. concluded, at p.229, that the immigration official had
been “completely dismissive” of the interests of the children and
had failed to give “serious weight” to those interests.  She held
that the exercise of the discretion under s. 114(2) was
unreasonable, should be set aside, and the matter should be
remitted to the Minister for re-determination by a different
immigration officer.
[21] After Baker, it is clear that the interests of the children
must be considered where a parent makes an application under s.
114(2) of the Act.  Those interests will be an important
consideration in determining whether the discretion granted under
that provision should be exercised in favour of the parent.
Furthermore, the procedural duty of fairness recognized in Baker
contemplates that the parent seeking relief under s. 114(2) and
sometimes others will have a fair chance to place material
relevant to the children’s interests before the official
considering the s.114(2)  application.
[22] Following the process and using the approach outlined in
Baker, the interests of the children can be properly considered
where a parent brings an application under s.114(2) of the Act.
Those interests can and must be addressed by those exercising the
discretion granted under s. 114(2).  That discretion is subject
to judicial review in the Federal Court.  There is, therefore, no
need to resort to the parens patriae jurisdiction of the
provincial Superior Court.  With the benefit of the analysis
provided by Baker, it is evident that McNeely J. should have
stayed the children’s application in accordance with the
principles recognized in Reza v. Canada, supra, and Peiroo v.
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), supra.
[23] I would, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the order
of McNeely J. and direct that the application brought on behalf
of the children be stayed.</pre>
      <pre>     III</pre>
      <pre>[24] Subsequent to the release of Baker, the court wrote to
counsel for the Minister (with copies to all other parties)
inquiring as to whether Ms. Francis or Cleavon could bring a
further application under s. 114(2) of the Act while still in
Canada.  The court was concerned that Ms. Francis and Cleavon may
not have received the full protection of the law as set out in
Baker.  Counsel for the Minister responded:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The department will consider an application pursuant to s.
          114(2) from Ms. Francis and or her son, Cleavon upon submission
          of an application and the cost-recovery fee of $500.  The
          application will be considered in a manner consistent with the
          Baker decision.</pre>
      <pre>[25] As the Minister acknowledges that Ms. Francis and Cleavon
can bring a new s.114(2) application, I see no reason why, in the
particular circumstances of this case, they should be required to
leave the country before making that application.  I think part
of the order of this court should be stayed to allow Ms. Francis
and Cleavon to remain in the country while they pursue a new s.
114(2) application.
[26] Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order of McNeely J. quashed the
deportation orders and enjoined the Minister from making further
orders.  Those parts of the order effectively prevent the
deportation of Ms. Francis or Cleavon.  Paragraph 3 of his order
makes a declaration as to the best interests of the children.  I
see no basis upon which McNeely J. should have made any
declaration as to the best interests of the children.  That part
of his order should be set aside immediately.  I would, however,
stay the order of this court setting aside paragraphs 1 and 2 of
McNeely J.’s order.  This would allow Ms. Francis and Cleavon to
bring a further s. 114(2) application while still in Canada.
[27] If Ms. Francis and Cleavon intend to bring a new s. 114(2)
application, they must do so expeditiously.  I would think that
those seeking to make the case for allowing Ms. Francis and
Cleavon to remain in Canada with the rest of their family can
assemble the necessary material with dispatch and place it before
the appropriate authority.  The authorities are well aware of the
particulars of this case and, I assume, can decide the matter
without delay once the relevant information has been placed
before them.
[28] I would allow the appeal and set aside the entirety of the
order of McNeely J. and make an order staying the children’s
application brought in the Ontario Court (General Division).  In
so far as the order of this court would set aside paragraphs 1
and 2 of the order of McNeely J., I would stay the order of this
court for a period of 120 days from the release of these reasons
to allow Ms. Francis and Cleavon to remain in Canada while
bringing a further s. 114(2) application.  Any party to this
appeal may bring an application to abridge or extend the stay if
the circumstances so warrant.
[29] I would make no order as to costs.
