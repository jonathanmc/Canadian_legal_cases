    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice John G. J.
O'Driscoll and a jury on February 25, 1998

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  In our view the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be
supported by the evidence.  Despite the issue of consciousness of
guilt this was essentially an identification case even though the
complainant and the appellant were not unknown to each other.
The victim gave a description to the police which he adopted at
trial but which was inconsistent with the appellant's appearance
in at least four significant features.  Ultimately, the victim
retreated to the position that he could identify the appellant
from his voice.  Thus, the purported identification was left on
the wholly subjective basis of the voice and the victim had
conceded that the appellant's appearance was inconsistent with
most of the objective features mentioned in the description.
[2]  Aside from the evidence of flight there was no other
circumstantial evidence tending to prove the appellant was the
attacker.  To the contrary, the circumstantial evidence tended to
point to the appellant's companion as the assailant.
[3]  The power under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code is to
be exercised sparingly, especially in a case that turns partly on
credibility and not simply reliability.  However, the appellate
court must independently examine and assess the evidence adduced
at trial and reach its own conclusion as to the reasonableness of
the verdict.  In doing so it must decide whether the totality of
the evidence is such that the verdict is one that a properly
instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.
[4]  We have done so and, in our view, this verdict cannot stand.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set
aside, and an acquittal entered.</pre></td>
