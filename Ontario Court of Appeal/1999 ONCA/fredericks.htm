    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice K. A. Langdon,
sitting without a jury, on March 30, 1998 and the sentence
imposed on March 30, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of two counts of possession for
the purpose of trafficking by Langdon J., sitting without a jury,
and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment in addition to the
time spent in pre-trial custody. He appeals against conviction
and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.
[2]  The main thrust of the appellant&#146;s argument is that the
verdict cannot be supported by the evidence. The appellant
submits that, in arriving at the verdict, the trial judge drew
inferences from evidence that constituted inadmissible hearsay,
failed to consider or appreciate relevant evidence, made
inconsistent findings as between counts on the indictment and
drew an impermissible adverse inference from the appellant&#146;s
failure to testify.
[3]  Having regard to the totality of the evidence, we are of the
view that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which
the trial judge could properly conclude that the appellant had
both control and knowledge of the drugs found in the apartment.
The trial judge gave particular weight to the fact that the
appellant was brought to the apartment and allowed to remain
there by Rudder, the tenant of the apartment who had knowledge
and control over the large quantity of drugs and cash located in
the apartment. The trial judge drew the inference that Rudder
would not leave such a large quantity of drugs and cash unguarded
(cocaine and marihuana having an aggregate street value of over
$1,000,000 and approximately $60,000). The trial judge drew the
further inference that, given the circumstances of the
appellant&#146;s arrival at the apartment and his presence in the
apartment with this quantity of the drugs and money, the
appellant was entrusted to be the keeper of the drugs.
[4]  In our view, the inferences drawn by the trial judge were
supported by the evidence. We do not accept the appellant&#146;s
argument that the inferences were based on inadmissible hearsay.
Nor are we persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the
evidence in any material way.
[5]  In our view, given the main thrust of the trial judge&#146;s
reasoning, there is no inconsistency in the findings as between
counts. The poor quality of the evidence with respect to the
location of the firearm adequately explains the different verdict
on the weapons charge.
[6]  Finally, we do not read the trial judge&#146;s reasons as drawing
any improper inference from the fact that the appellant had not
testified. The impugned comments are simple references to the
absence of evidence that would rebut the inferences drawn from
the circumstantial evidence. The appeal against conviction is
therefore dismissed.
[7]  Although the sentence is high, it is not manifestly
excessive having regard to the appellant&#146;s record, the fact that
he was on judicial interim release for a similar offence at the
time of this offence, and the nature and quantity of the drugs.
Finally, having regard to the circumstances surrounding the
sentence imposed on Rudder, we are not satisfied that the
sentence offended the principle of parity. Leave to appeal the
sentence is granted but the appeal against sentence is dismissed.
