    <pre>HEARD:         October 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Her Honour Judge K. L. Hawke on
June 18, 1998 and from the sentence imposed on June 18, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  test  where inadvertent non-disclosure  is  discovered
after trial and the issue is raised on appeal is set out in R. v.
Dixon  (1998),  122 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  The  appellant  must
show  that the right to make full answer and defence was impaired
as a result of the failure to make disclosure.  This requires the
appellant  to  show the following, as set out  at  pp.  17-18  of
Dixon:
          </pre>
    <pre>             Even if the undisclosed information does not itself affect
       the reliability of the result at trial, the effect of the non-
       disclosure on the overall fairness of the trial process must be
       considered at the second stage of analysis.  This will be done by
       assessing, on the basis of a reasonable possibility, the lines of
       inquiry with witnesses or the opportunities to garner additional
       evidence that could have been available to the defence if the
       relevant information had been disclosed.  In short, the
       reasonable possibility that the undisclosed information impaired
       the right to make full answer and defence relates not only to the
       content of the information itself, but to the realistic
       opportunities to explore possible uses of the undisclosed
       information for purposes of investigation and gathering evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The Crown properly concedes that the identity of the person
whose  prints  were found on the bags inside the suitcase  should
have  been disclosed.  In our view, the right to make full answer
and  defence was impaired.  Had the appellant known the  identity
of  the  prints he could have pursued attempts to obtain evidence
from  this  person.  At the very least, this shows  that  someone
other than the appellant, who had a criminal record and had  been
deported  to  Jamaica, had been involved with this suitcase.   It
would  also  tend  to bolster the appellant's evidence  that  the
clothing and other items in the suitcase did not belong to him.
[3]  In light of this conclusion it is unnecessary to deal with
the other matters raised by the appellant, except that we are
satisfied that the appellant was properly given his election as
to mode of trial and that the trial before Hawke J. was not a
nullity.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set
aside, and a new trial ordered in accordance with s. 686(5)(b) of
the Criminal Code.  The appellant has served approximately two
months of the sentence imposed.  As well, he was in custody prior
to conviction for approximately two weeks.  Crown counsel fairly
conceded that had it been necessary to deal with the sentence
appeal he did not see any reason to reincarcerate this appellant
in view of his age, his poor health, and prior good character.
In all the circumstances, the Crown may wish to consider whether
the interests of justice require that they proceed with the new
trial.</pre></td>
