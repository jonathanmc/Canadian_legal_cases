    <pre>On appeal from the order of Lederman J. dated June 22, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>A.   INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants, the United States of America (&#147;USA&#148;)  and
the defendants by counterclaim, David L. Dean, Peter R. Mounsey,
and Nancy A. Mangone (collectively the &#147;individual defendants&#148;),
brought a motion to dismiss the respondent Friedland&#146;s
counterclaim on the basis of state immunity pursuant to the State
Immunity Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.S-18 (&#147;SIA&#148;).  Lederman J. dismissed
the motion.  This is an appeal from that decision.</pre>
    <pre>B.   FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The facts are set out by Lederman J. in his reasons for
judgment, which are reported: (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 747.
Accordingly, only a brief review of the facts need be undertaken
here.
[3]  The USA, through the Environmental Protection Agency
(&#147;E.P.A.&#148;), commenced an action against Friedland in Colorado.
The action alleged that Friedland was personally liable for
environmental cleanup costs, then estimated to be $152,000,000.00
(U.S.), under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;).  The USA obtained an
ex parte garnishment order (&#147;the U.S. order&#148;) against Friedland
in Colorado for that amount.  The U.S. order was based in part
upon an affidavit sworn by Nancy A. Mangone (&#147;Mangone&#148;), the lead
E.P.A. lawyer responsible for the mine site and one of the
individual defendants.
[4]  Relying on the U.S. order, the USA obtained ex parte Mareva
injunctions in B.C., from Spencer J., and in Ontario, from Borins
J.  The Ontario injunction prevented Friedland from dissipating
or disposing of  INCO share certificates in the amount of
$152,000,000 (U.S.) pending disposition of the CERCLA claim.  In
support, the USA relied upon affidavits sworn by Mangone dated
May 25, 1996 (&#147;the Mangone affidavits&#148;).  Paragraph 81 of one of
the Mangone affidavits contained a statement that:
          </pre>
    <pre>         The United States  will undertake  at the hearing
	 on the motion  herein through  counsel to pay any
	 damages assessed by this Court that Friedland may
	 suffer should an injunction turn out to have been
	 wrongly  given  or if the United  States does not
	 prevail on the merits &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The order of Borins J. granting a Mareva injunction
contained the following undertaking:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Upon the undertaking of the Plaintiff, by its counsel to:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; abide by an[y] (sic) Order this Court may
          make as to damages in case this Court should
          hereafter determine that the Defendant has
          sustained damages by reason of this Order
          which the Plaintiff ought to pay &#133; .</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The Mareva injunction was subsequently dissolved by Sharpe
J.  He found that the USA had failed to make full and fair
disclosure in the materials filed on the ex parte motion and, as
such, had failed to meet the obligations required on such a
motion.
[7]  Rather than seeking an inquiry on the undertaking, Friedland
filed a statement of defence and counterclaim seeking damages
against the USA and the individual defendants, all of whom were
lawyers in the employ of the U.S. Department of Justice or the
E.P.A., pursuant to both the undertaking and the common law.
[8]  As noted, the USA and the individual defendants moved to
dismiss the counterclaim on the basis of state immunity.  The USA
and individual defendants now appeal from the dismissal of that
motion.</pre>
    <pre>C.   ANALYSIS
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Jurisdiction to hear the appeal:  interlocutory or final
          order</pre>
    <pre>[9]  At the opening of the argument, the court raised the
question whether the order of Lederman J. was interlocutory or
final.  Counsel for all parties submitted that the order was
final and that the appeal from that order properly lay to this
court.
[10] The claim of sovereign immunity, if successful, is a
complete answer to Friedland&#146;s counterclaim.  Lederman J.&#146;s order
finally determined that issue adversely to the appellants.  An
order disposing of a substantive right raised by way of defence
that could be determinative of the entire action is final for the
purposes of appeal:  Ball v. Donais (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322
(C.A.).  Accordingly, the order of Lederman J. was a final order
and this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Section 4(2)(a) of the SIA</pre>
    <pre>[11] Section 4(2)(a) of the SIA creates an exception to the
general principle of sovereign immunity where a foreign state
waives its immunity.  That section provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4(2) In any proceedings before a court, a foreign state
          submits to the jurisdiction of the court where it
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a) explicitly submits to the
               jurisdiction of the court by written
               agreement or otherwise either before or after
               the proceedings commence;</pre>
    <pre>[12] Lederman J. found that the USA had explicitly submitted to
the court&#146;s jurisdiction within the meaning of s.4(2)(a).  He
held that the statement in para. 81 of the Mangone affidavit
constituted an explicit waiver of immunity which was &#147;not limited
to the possibly narrow scope that a court, on an inquiry, may
give to an undertaking as to damages&#148; and which did not contain
words of limitation that excluded tort claims.  As such,
Friedland could properly assert by way of counterclaim reasonable
and viable claims extending from the natural meaning of the
undertaking.
[13] The appellants submitted that Lederman J. erred in finding
that the USA had explicitly submitted to the jurisdiction of the
courts within the meaning of s.4(2)(a) of the SIA.  They argued
that the exception in s.4(2)(a) must be applied strictly; that
the mere fact that the statement did not exclude tort claims is
not sufficient to establish a waiver of immunity to tort claims
and is, at most, a waiver of immunity to the court&#146;s jurisdiction
to inquire under the undertaking; and that the Mangone affidavit
does not constitute an undertaking but is, at best, merely
confirmation that counsel for the USA had authority to provide an
undertaking at a future hearing.
[14] In our view, this ground of appeal must succeed.  On its
plain language, the statement in para. 81 is a statement of
intention to provide an undertaking in the future.  The actual
undertaking provided by the USA was that given pursuant to the
Mareva injunction granted by Borins J.  One must look to that
undertaking to determine whether there was an explicit submission
to the jurisdiction of the courts, and if so, the extent of the
submission.
[15] The language of the undertaking in the order of Borins J.
clearly constitutes an explicit submission to the jurisdiction of
the courts.  But any waiver of immunity must be clear and
unequivocal; it cannot be presumed:  P.S.A.C. v. United States
Defence Department (1988), 74 di 191 (Can. L.R.B.); aff&#146;d [1990]
1 F.C. 332 (sub. nom. Re Canada Labour Code); rev&#146;d on other
grounds [1992] 2 S.C.R. 50.  Nothing in the language of the
undertaking indicates that the scope of that submission extended
to tort claims.  By its wording, the submission is limited to the
extent undertaken &#150; viz., a submission to the jurisdiction of the
court to inquire under the undertaking &#150; and goes no further. The
undertaking does not constitute an explicit waiver for the
purposes of Friedland&#146;s counterclaim within the meaning of
s.4(2)(a) of the SIA.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   Sections 4(2) and (4) of the SIA</pre>
    <pre>[16] Section 4(4) creates an exception to the general principle
of sovereign immunity where a foreign state initiates or
intervenes in any proceedings before a court.  The relevant
portions of s.4 provide:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4(2) In any proceedings before a court, a foreign state
          submits to the jurisdiction of the court where it
               </pre>
    <pre>                    &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  initiates the proceedings in
               the court; &#133; .
          </pre>
    <pre>          (4)  A foreign state that initiates
          proceedings in a court or that intervenes or
          takes any step in proceedings before a court,
          other than an intervention or step to which
          paragraph (2)(c) does not apply, submits to
          the jurisdiction of the court in respect of
          any third party proceedings that arise, or
          counter-claim that arises, out of the subject-
          matter of the proceedings initiated by the
          state or in which the state has so intervened
          or taken a step.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Lederman J. held that the USA had waived its immunity within
the meaning of s.4(4) when it initiated ex parte proceedings
seeking a Mareva injunction.  He found that s.4(4) was not simply
a codification of the common law and that there was no
requirement that a counterclaim against a foreign state be merely
&#147;defensive&#148; in nature.  He rejected the USA&#146;s argument that there
was no claim left to which Friedland could respond, observing
that &#147;the action though barely alive, is &#145;still breathing&#146;&#148; and
could properly serve as the basis for a counterclaim.  He then
considered the degree of nexus required between the counterclaim
and the proceeding initiated by the foreign sovereign.  Noting
the lack of a clear statement of the degree of nexus required, he
applied a &#147;reasonable and contextual approach&#148; and found that the
claims asserted in Friedland&#146;s counterclaim had a sufficient
nexus to the subject-matter of the proceeding.
[18] The appellants submitted that Lederman J. erred in finding
that the USA implicitly waived its immunity within the meaning of
s.4(4).  In our view, this ground of appeal must also succeed.
The requirement in s.4(4) that a counterclaim against a foreign
sovereign arise &#147;out of the subject-matter of the proceeding
initiated by the state&#148; indicates an intention to exclude
counterclaims that are independent of the state&#146;s claim.  At
common law, the &#147;subject-matter&#148; requirement was understood as
precluding counterclaims that were not merely defensive in
nature:  South African Republic v. Compagnie Franco-Belg, [1898]
1 Ch. 190; High Commissioner for India v. Ghosh, [1960] 1 Q.B.
134 (C.A.); Mehr v. The Republic of China, [1956] O.W.N. 218
(H.C.J.), aff&#146;d [1956] O.W.N. 363 (C.A.).  Thus, a defendant
could raise any counterclaim that allowed him or her to answer
the claim brought by the state, but could not raise any
counterclaim that was outside or independent of the state&#146;s
claim.
[19] Counsel for Friedland argued that s.4(4) contains no words
of limitation apart from the &#147;subject-matter&#148; requirement.  He
contrasted s.4(4) with the equivalent provisions in the U.S. and
U.K. acts providing for sovereign immunity, which expressly limit
the amount and kind of relief which may be sought, and noted that
Parliament could have similarly limited s.4(4) if it had wished
to do so.  We find this argument unpersuasive.  The SIA was
enacted in the context of common law principles governing
sovereign immunity.  One such principle was the subject-matter
requirement for counterclaims against a foreign sovereign.
Nothing in s.4(4) indicates Parliament&#146;s intention to alter this
common law &#147;subject-matter&#148; requirement.  While the SIA contains
no limitation respecting the amount and kind of relief that may
be sought by way of counterclaim, the requirement that a
counterclaim be defensive in nature is distinct from a limitation
respecting the amount and kind of relief sought by way of
counterclaim.  As such, s.4(4) must be understood as allowing a
counterclaim against a foreign sovereign only to the extent that
it allows the defendant to answer the claim initiated by the
state.
[20] The Ontario proceeding was initiated by the USA by way of a
statement of claim seeking an injunction restraining Friedland
from dealing with $152,000,000 (U.S.) in INCO shares pending
disposition of the CERCLA proceedings brought in Colorado.  After
the injunction was lifted by Sharpe J., Friedland filed a
statement of defence and counterclaim, seeking damages for
conspiracy, abuse of process, libel, breach of disclosure duties,
loss of business opportunity and damage to reputation.  The
counterclaim does not merely answer the claim brought by the USA;
it asserts tort claims that are independent of the proceeding
initiated by the USA.  Friedland does not simply respond to the
USA&#146;s claim; rather, he seeks damages for conduct that both
preceded and followed the ex parte motion for a Mareva
injunction.  His counterclaim cannot be said to arise out of the
subject-matter of the proceeding brought by the USA within the
meaning of s.4(4) of the SIA.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   Section 6 of the SIA</pre>
    <pre>[21] Before Lederman J., Friedland also relied upon s.6 of the
SIA, which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          6.  A foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a
          court in any proceedings that relate to
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  any death or personal injury, or
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  any damage to or loss of property
          </pre>
    <pre>          that occurs in Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Having found that the USA had waived its sovereign immunity
pursuant to both ss.4(2)(a) and 4(4), Lederman J. declined to
consider the applicability of s.6.
[23] Counsel for Friedland submitted that the torts committed by
the USA and the individual defendants caused him injury, loss and
damage, including the loss of use of his shares, damage to his
business reputation, the loss of economic opportunities and
emotional upset and personal embarrassment.
[24] Addressing s.6(a), counsel for Friedland argued that
&#147;personal injury&#148; includes mental distress and emotional upset,
and relied upon this court&#146;s decision in Walker v. Bank of New
York (1994), 16 O.R. (3d) 504.  He further relied upon University
of Calgary v. Colorado School of Mines, [1996] 2 W.W.R. 596
(Alta. Q.B.) for the proposition that an action for defamation is
an action for personal injury within the meaning of s.6.
[25] In our view, s.6(a) does not assist Friedland.  The obiter
statement of McKinlay J.A. in Walker, at p. 510, that &#147;the scope
of personal injury covered by s. 6 &#133; could include mental
distress, emotional upset, and restriction of liberty&#148; does not
mean that s.6 extends to mental distress or emotional upset in
all cases.  Otherwise, a party could invoke s.6(a) merely by
claiming damages for alleged mental distress or emotional upset,
an interpretation that would expand the exception far beyond its
intended scope and render the doctrine of sovereign immunity
ineffective.  We agree with counsel for the appellants that the
&#147;personal injury&#148; exception refers primarily to physical injury
and that s.6(a) extends to mental distress and emotional upset
only insofar as such harm arises from or is linked to a physical
injury.  This interpretation is consistent with the generally
accepted international understanding of the &#147;personal injury&#148;
exception to sovereign immunity.
[26] Addressing s.6(b), counsel for Friedland argued that &#147;damage
to or loss of property&#148; encompasses any pecuniary loss, including
that resulting from damage to business reputation.  He relied
upon the French version of s.6(b), which refers to &#147;dommages
matériels&#148;, and submitted that, in Québec civil law, that term
encompasses all pecuniary damages whether flowing from loss or
damage to tangible property or pure economic loss.
[27] In our view, s.6(b) does not assist Friedland.  On its face,
&#147;damage to or loss of property&#148; refers to physical harm to or
loss or destruction of property.  The application of s.6(b)
depends upon the nature of the harm suffered rather than the
nature of the relief claimed.  The interpretation urged by
counsel for Friedland would allow a party to invoke s.6(b)
whenever the damages suffered are capable of monetary
quantification, an interpretation that is unduly broad and
unsupported by the plain language of the section.  The
conventional international understanding of the &#147;loss of
property&#148; exception is that the exception applies only to
physical harm to or destruction of property and does not extend
to pure economic loss.  We cannot accept that Parliament intended
to give the words &#147;damage to or loss of property&#148; a meaning
substantially different from the conventional international
understanding.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   The individual defendants</pre>
    <pre>[28] Having found the USA to have waived its immunity, Lederman
J. considered whether the individual defendants could rely on
personal immunity as independent functionaries of the sovereign.
He found that the immunity enjoyed by employees of the sovereign
is derivative, rather than independent, of the immunity enjoyed
by the sovereign.  He therefore concluded that the waiver of
immunity by the USA extended to the individual defendants.
[29] In light of our conclusion that the USA has not waived its
immunity with respect to the claims asserted in Friedland&#146;s
counterclaim, it is not necessary to determine whether the
immunity enjoyed by functionaries of the sovereign is independent
of or derives from that enjoyed by the sovereign itself. Even if
the immunity enjoyed by the individual defendants is merely
derivative, they are protected from the claims asserted in
Friedland&#146;s counterclaim by virtue of the immunity enjoyed by the
USA.
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   Forum non conveniens</pre>
    <pre>[30] In addition to its claim of state immunity, the USA argued
that the proceeding should be stayed on the grounds that Ontario
was forum non conveniens.  Lederman J. rejected this submission
and found that there was a real and substantial connection
between the claims asserted in the counterclaim and Ontario.  In
reaching this conclusion, he noted that the USA opened itself up
to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts by having initiated
proceedings in Ontario and characterized the USA&#146;s forum non
conveniens argument as forum shopping.</pre>
    <pre>[31] Having regard to our finding that the USA has not waived its
immunity with respect to Friedland&#146;s counterclaims, we do not
find it necessary to consider whether Ontario is forum non
conveniens.</pre>
    <pre>D.   DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[32] The appeal is allowed, the order of Lederman J. is set aside
and in its place an order will issue dismissing the respondent&#146;s
counterclaim.  The appellants are entitled to the costs of the
motion before Lederman J. and of the appeal, payable forthwith
after their assessment.
