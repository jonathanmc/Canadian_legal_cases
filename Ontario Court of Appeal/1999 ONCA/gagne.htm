</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice C. B. Noble, sitting
with a jury, on October 10, 1996 and from his sentence imposed on
December 20, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge is required to review the substantial parts
of the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so
that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence.
[2]  In this case, it was an essential part of the defence that
the complainants' memory of the abuse had been innocently tainted
by the similar fact witness and the access to the pornographic
novel.  There was a factual foundation for this submission but it
was never placed before the jury in a manner that they could
appreciate its value and effect.  Objection was taken to the
charge but the trial judge refused to recharge.  In our view,
this constituted a serious misdirection.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This error was compounded by the direction on similar fact
evidence.  The trial judge instructed the jury that this evidence
was relevant to certain matters that were not in issue in this
case.  While he did tell the jury that it was relevant to
credibility, he failed to instruct the jury as to how it could be
used.  As was said by this court in R. v. P. (G.F.) (1994), 89
C.C.C. (3d) 176 at 181, the trial judge should have told the jury
that it was open to them to conclude in view of the relationship
between the appellant and the complainants and the similar fact
witness and having regard to the facts of the three situations
that a pattern of similar behaviour existed suggesting that the
complainants' stories were true.
[4]  More seriously, the trial judge failed to direct the jury
that the similarities upon which the Crown relied could be
explained by innocent contamination from the similar fact
witness.  As Cory J. said in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d)
321 (S.C.C.) at 344, the force of similar fact evidence lies in
the objective improbability of coincidence.  Where, as here,
there is an alternative explanation, it should be pointed out to
the jury.  This was of particular significance in this case as
the jury asked a question as to how to use the similar fact
evidence.  Unfortunately, the trial judge merely repeated the
earlier erroneous and incomplete instructions.
[5]  This is not an appropriate case for application of the
proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.  The jury was
concerned about the use of the similar fact evidence and it was
essential that the jury receive proper instructions on those
matters and the theory of the defence as it related to the
similar fact evidence.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the convictions on
counts 1 and 2 set aside, and a new trial ordered on those
counts.</pre></td>
