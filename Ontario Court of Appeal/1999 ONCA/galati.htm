    <pre>               Hart Schwartz, for the respondents Her Majesty the
               Queen in Right of Ontario and Attorney General for

    <pre>HEARD:         November 15 and 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Epstein J. dated June 15, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   The Attorney General of Ontario is not a government actor
in the nomination process of the Liberal Party in selecting its
candidates.  The requirement of registration of candidates in the
election itself under the Election Finances Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
E-6 is only a requirement for eligibility for public funding of
the candidate&#146;s expenses and of his or her political party.
There is no suggestion in this record of any participation by the
government of the day in the nomination process of which the
appellant complains.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
