COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. DAVID
               GALLAUGHER (Appellant)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        OSBORNE, ABELLA and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Ilan Newman
               For the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               John North
               For the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         January 21, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge found as a fact that the police officer went</pre>
    <pre>to the appellant’s place of business (which was also his</pre>
    <pre>residence) on the pretext of buying a dock as a Christmas present</pre>
    <pre>for his wife but for the true purpose of determining if the</pre>
    <pre>appellant would agree to discuss the sale of drugs with him.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  From the appellant’s perspective, he invited the police</pre>
    <pre>officer into his business premises to discuss a potential dock</pre>
    <pre>sale. This was a business-related invitation. When the police</pre>
    <pre>officer was in the appellant’s premises he saw marijuana in plain</pre>
    <pre>view in several places in the kitchen. Later that day, the police</pre>
    <pre>officer obtained a search warrant. The search warrant was</pre>
    <pre>executed and in due course the appellant was arrested and charged</pre>
    <pre>with possession for the purpose of trafficking.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that this case is</pre>
    <pre>different from R. v. Evans (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (S.C.C.)</pre>
    <pre>since the police officer did not enter the premises to search. In</pre>
    <pre>our view, there was no s. 8 violation.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Thus, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
