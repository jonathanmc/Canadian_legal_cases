    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[1] On February 5, 1988, National Bank of Canada issued an Irrevocable
    Stand-By Letter of Credit in the amount of $2,500,000. in favour of the Simcoe &amp; Erie
    General Insurance Company. In February 1996, Simcoe and Erie changed its name to GAN
    General Insurance Company.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[2] The Letter of Credit was issued by the Bank at the request of its
    customer Lavalin Inc. as security for Lavalin's obligations to GAN under a professional
    liability policy. The issuance of the insurance policy was conditional on such a Letter of
    Credit being provided by a Canadian chartered bank. </font></p>

    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[4] On July 14, 1997, in accordance with the Letter of Credit, GAN
    presented the Bank with a signed and endorsed Sight Draft drawn on the Bank and supported
    by a written Demand certifying that $2,500,000. was owing to GAN by Lavalin. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[5] Because the original Letter of Credit could not be found when the
    demand for payment was made, GAN also gave the Bank two additional documents: (i) an
    Indemnification in favour of the Bank to protect it from any claims which might
    subsequently arise from its payment of the money; and (ii) an affidavit from GAN's
    corporate counsel confirming that the original Letter of Credit could not be found but
    that it had not been sold, transferred or otherwise assigned.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[6] The Bank refused to make payment because it was not presented with
    the original Letter of Credit. It took the position that it was entitled to strict
    compliance with every term of the Letter of Credit, and that a true copy of the Letter of
    Credit does not strictly comply with the requirement that it be presented with the
    original. The Bank does not dispute the accuracy or legitimacy of the copy; nor does it
    deny that the Letter of Credit had been automatically renewed every year since 1992 and
    was therefore valid and in force at the time GAN requested payment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[7] GAN's application for a declaration that the Bank was obligated to
    pay the $2,500,000. notwithstanding the absence of the original Letter of Credit was
    successful. Lax J. ordered the Bank to pay the full sum upon delivery by GAN of an
    indemnity and an insurance bond of indemnity. The Bank appeals from that judgment. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[8] There is no doubt that the Letter of Credit states that &quot;the
    original of this credit&quot; must accompany sight drafts presented for payment under the
    Letter of Credit. The issue, however, is whether the presentation of a true copy rather
    than the original Letter of Credit, voids the Bank's obligations under it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[9] It is my view that Lax J. reached the correct result and that the
    Bank's obligation to honour the demand for payment was not affected by GAN's failure to
    produce the original Letter of Credit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[10] There is no doubt that banks must protect themselves from the
    possibility of fraud or from liability arising from breaches in the terms and conditions
    of the credit. Article 15 of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits
    reinforces this commercial truism:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Banks must examine all documents with reasonable care to ascertain that
            they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit.
            Documents which appear on their face to be inconsistent with one another will be
            considered as not appearing on their face to be in accordance with the terms and
            conditions of the credit.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[11] But in this case we are not dealing with a document which lacks
    authenticity, or with a demand for payment which is inconsistent with the terms and
    conditions of the credit. On the contrary, there is no challenge to the authenticity of
    the copy, nor any denial that, on its face, the Bank is obliged to pay $2,500,000. to GAN
    under the Letter of Credit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[12] The Bank, in my view, is not entitled to succeed based on its
    argued test of &quot;strict compliance.&quot; Strict compliance applies to those
    documentary terms and conditions that go to the essence of the credit agreement, those
    which are &quot;sufficiently material to justify a refusal of payment&quot;: <i>Bank of
    Nova Scotia v. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd.</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 59 at 96 per Le Dain J. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[13] The essence of this particular agreement is found in its second
    paragraph:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">This Credit shall be available to you by your signed and endorsed sight
            draft drawn on NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA when supported by your signed written demand
            certifying that the amount drawn is due and payable to you by LAVALIN INC. in connection
            with their obligations to you pursuant to the professional liability policy No. L56075 and
            its renewal(s) or replacement(s) thereof (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the
            Policy&quot;).</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[14] There is no basis for the Bank insisting on strict compliance with
    the requirement for the original document. A true copy rather than the original is, <i>in
    this case</i>, more in the nature of a minor discrepancy than a material breach of a
    fundamental provision. This was a document prepared by the Bank and, as such, one with
    which the Bank was fully familiar. The Bank knew from the true copy everything it needed
    to know to be satisfied that the requirements of the credit had been met. It was clear on
    its face: <i>Angelica-Whitewear</i> at 98.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[15] The requirement of the original Letter of Credit is not a
    fundamental term or condition of the credit, and, as stated in <i>Angelica-Whitewear</i>,
    &quot;not sufficiently material to justify a refusal of payment.&quot; There is therefore
    no requirement of strict compliance with this term. The Bank is only entitled to
    substantive compliance with respect to this document. In my view, the production of an
    undisputed true copy of the Letter of Credit generously meets that threshold.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[16] While not determinative, it is worth noting that there is virtually
    no prejudice or risk to the Bank in this case. An authentic copy of the Letter of Credit
    was available. GAN offered to indemnify the Bank, and even to provide a bond of indemnity
    issued by Chubb Insurance Company of Canada. Moreover, the likelihood of the original
    being found and successfully presented was negligible given that it could only be
    presented for payment at one branch of the Bank, and only by GAN, accompanied by the
    documents required to justify payment. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[17] To find otherwise permits the Bank to avoid its liabilities based
    on a &quot;technicality&quot;, a recipe for commercial unreliability and uncertainty. On
    the other hand, sanctioning the use of an authentic copy, and insulating the Bank's
    vulnerability with an indemnity agreement, permits the fulfilment of the commercial
    agreement reached by the parties when they negotiated the Letter of Credit. The essence of
    that agreement was that when GAN presented a sight draft drawn on National Bank of Canada,
    along with a signed written demand certifying that the amount due relates to Lavalin's
    obligation under the policy, the Bank would pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[18] GAN did in fact present those documents to the Bank and was
    therefore in compliance with the Letter of Credit. It was, accordingly, entitled to
    payment in the amount requested. The Bank's refusal to honour the Letter of Credit was, in
    the circumstances, officious and entirely unwarranted.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">[19] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></p>
