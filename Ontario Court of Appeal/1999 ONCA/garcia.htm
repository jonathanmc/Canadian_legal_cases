    <pre>HEARD:         April 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Salhany J. dated May 20, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a serious offence that involved the robbery of a
convenience store at 2:00 a.m. by two men armed with a knife and
a broken beer bottle respectively. The storekeeper was threatened
and jabbed in the arm with a beer bottle by the co-perpetrator.
The trial judge was correct in holding that this was not an
appropriate case for a conditional sentence.
[2]  We can find no error in principle in the sentence imposed by
the trial judge in the circumstances as they existed at the time
he delivered it. However, we have admitted fresh evidence in this
court that is impressive. It demonstrates that during his interim
release, the appellant has addressed his alcohol abuse problem
effectively. He has demonstrated a commendable desire to
rehabilitate himself and we should lend our encouragement to that
conduct.
[3]  Accordingly, we are prepared to reduce the sentence to nine
months in custody followed by probation for one year. The terms
of probation shall be in the statutory terms and shall include:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   that the appellant abstain from the consumption of
          alcohol or other intoxicating substances;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   that the appellant abstain from the
          consumption of controlled substances except
          in accordance with a medical prescription;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   that the appellant abstain from
          owning, possessing or carrying any weapons,
          ammunitions or explosive devices;
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   that the appellant attend
          counselling for substance abuse and anger as
          directed and approved by his probation
          officer; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               5.   that the appellant report as
          required to his probation officer.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is
allowed to the extent necessary to give effect to these reasons.
