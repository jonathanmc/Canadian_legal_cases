      <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice J. Hamilton, sitting
with a jury, on October 3, 1996 and from his sentence imposed on
October 15, 1996
</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]   Following  his trial by judge and jury, the  appellant  was
convicted  of  manslaughter and sentenced to a term  of  fourteen
years'  imprisonment  with no eligibility for  parole  for  seven
years.  He  appeals  against his conviction and  seeks  leave  to
appeal the sentence.
[2]  The appellant raises two grounds of appeal against
conviction, both in relation to the trial judge’s instructions to
the jury. The first concerns the sufficiency of the Vetrovec
warning and the second, the correctness of the instructions on
the essential elements of the offence of manslaughter. The
sentence appeal raises two further issues: whether the quantum of
sentence is excessive and whether the parole ineligibility order
was required to address specific and general deterrence.
[3]  At the conclusion of the hearing, we made the following
disposition, with reasons to follow. We dismissed the appeal
against conviction, granted leave to appeal the sentence and
allowed the sentence appeal, reducing the sentence to a term of
ten years' imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for five
years. Our reasons are the following.
[4]  The offence arises out of an assault on the deceased, Andrew
Croft, on November 17, 1994, which assault required immediate
hospitalization and contributed to Mr. Croft’s eventual death
from multiple causes on March 26, 1995.
[5]  Mr. Croft was 64 years old. Although he was an alcoholic who
had a number of health problems, he was holding down a full-time
job as a superintendent of an apartment building. On November 17,
1994 he had dinner with his daughter before going to a tavern for
a few drinks. He left the bar at about 12:40 a.m. and proceeded
to walk home. About five minutes later, he was found by the
police lying unconscious on the street and was transported to
hospital by ambulance.
[6]  At the hospital, it was discovered that Mr. Croft had
suffered a serious head injury and emergency surgery was
performed. Tests also revealed that his blood alcohol level was
between 387 and 397 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood. Mr.
Croft never really recovered. He suffered a series of setbacks
during a four-month hospital stay until his ultimate death.
Although the cause of death was listed as multi system failure,
the medical experts at trial agreed that Mr. Croft’s death was
attributable to his initial head injury.
[7]  It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the appellant
encountered Mr. Croft on the street, and upon seeing him, old and
somewhat inebriated, grabbed him by the lapels, and threw or
pushed him to the ground causing him to strike his head. The
appellant then went through Mr. Croft’s pockets and stole his
wallet which included his credit card.
[8]  In support of its position, the Crown relied on the direct
evidence of Michael Demers and Barbara Baker. Although neither
saw the appellant throw Mr. Croft to the ground, Baker testified
that she saw the appellant grab Mr. Croft by the lapels and next
saw him standing over Mr. Croft going through his pockets. Demers
testified that he saw the appellant standing over the deceased.
It is common ground between the parties that both Demers and
Baker were unsavoury characters by reason of their respective
lifestyles, criminal records and possible motives to lie. In
addition to their evidence, the Crown relied on evidence that the
appellant used Mr. Croft’s credit card only minutes after Mr.
Croft was found by the police. The Crown also called one Lenny
Avery, who testified that he had overheard four men at the tavern
discussing “what an easy thing it was to beat him up and rob
him”. Avery assumed that they were referring to Mr. Croft and he
identified the appellant at trial as one of the men. Avery also
had a criminal record.
[9]  The appellant did not testify and did not call evidence. His
position at trial was that the Crown had failed to prove: a) that
the deceased was assaulted as opposed to falling on his own; b)
that the appellant was the assaulter; and c) that the head
injuries sustained in the fall were a contributing cause of the
subsequent death.</pre>
      <pre>1.   Appeal against conviction</pre>
      <pre>     a)   Adequacy of the Vetrovec warning regarding Baker,
Demers and Avery
</pre>
      <pre>[10]  The  trial judge, in his discretion and in accordance  with
the principles set out in R. v. Vetrovec (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1
(S.C.C.), cautioned the jury against accepting without  more  the
testimony  of  Baker, Demers or Avery given their  character  and
other  features of their evidence. However, the appellant  argues
that  the trial judge did not give a sufficiently clear and sharp
warning to that effect.
[11] Although counsel for the appellant is correct in stating
that the caution given to the jury against accepting the
testimony of each of these witnesses was not given in strong
terms, we are satisfied that the charge, when considered as a
whole, satisfied the exigencies of this case. The trial judge
adequately brought home to the jury all the factors that impaired
the worth of each witness’s testimony: he gave detailed general
instructions on the various factors they should consider in
assessing the credibility of the witnesses; he reviewed at length
the testimony given by each witness, underscoring as he went
along the various inconsistencies and difficulties with the
evidence (including the delay in coming forward and some of the
possible motivations to lie); he noted their unsavoury
characters; and, he instructed the jury on the use that could be
made of the criminal records.
[12] Finally, we find it noteworthy that counsel at trial did not
object to the sufficiency of the charge in this respect although
it is clear from the record that he specifically addressed his
mind to the issue.</pre>
      <pre>     b)    Instructions on the essential elements of the  offence
     of manslaughter
</pre>
      <pre>[13]  The appellant argues that the trial judge failed to  advise
the  jury  that  before  they  could  convict  the  appellant  of
“unlawful  act manslaughter”, they had to be satisfied  beyond  a
reasonable doubt, not only that the appellant caused Mr.  Croft’s
death  by an unlawful act but also, that the underlying  act  was
objectively  dangerous. See R. v. DeSousa (1992), 76 C.C.C.  (3d)
124 (S.C.C.).
[14] The trial judge made numerous references to the unlawful act
in question in his instructions to the jury. However, the
following passage is more particularly relevant to this issue:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The grabbing of the lapels would be an assault if you find
          it happened as described. But in this case the theory of the
          Crown is that the accused grabbed the deceased and threw him to
          the ground thereby hurting Croft’s head. The grabbing of the
          lapels alone is not sufficient. Yes, it may be an assault, but
          that is not the assault that the Crown relies on. It is the
          grabbing of the shoulders or lapels and pushing of Croft or
          throwing of Croft to the ground is the assault you have to find;
          that is, as a result of the grabbing of Croft, Croft went to the
          ground either by slipping or being thrown. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[15] In our view, the reference to “slipping” is unfortunate  but
we  are  nonetheless satisfied that the instructions as a  whole,
particularly  when  considered in the  context  of  the  case  as
presented  to the jury by counsel, were adequate and  that  there
was no misdirection. The trial judge made repeated references  to
“grabbing” and “pushing” and “causing the injury to the head”. In
our  view,  the jury would have understood that it was  necessary
for them to be satisfied that the appellant intentionally put Mr.
Croft  to the ground thereby causing the head injury before  they
could  convict.  It  cannot  be argued,  and  indeed  it  is  not
suggested,  that  an assault intended to put  Mr.  Croft  to  the
pavement would not be “objectively dangerous”.
[16] Hence, it was not necessary in the circumstances to make any
express reference to the requirement of “objective
dangerousness”. In our view, the manner in which this requirement
was conveyed to the jury by the trial judge, without express
reference to the legal test, was just as effective and probably
easier to understand. Again, it is significant that trial counsel
saw no reason to object o the charge in this respect.
[17] It is for these reasons that we dismissed the conviction
appeal.</pre>
      <pre>2.   Appeal against sentence
</pre>
      <pre>     a)   Quantum of sentence</pre>
      <pre>[18]  In  our view, the sentence of fourteen years' imprisonment,
in  addition  to the ten months spent in pre-trial  custody,  was
excessive having regard to the circumstances of the offence.  The
appellant’s assault on Mr. Croft consisted of a push or  a  shove
thereby  causing him to fall on the ground and injure  his  head.
Although there was a foreseeable risk of bodily harm, there is no
real basis for concluding that the risk of death was foreseeable.
The  extent  of the injury caused to Mr. Croft and  his  eventual
death  are  more readily attributable to this victim’s particular
vulnerability  than  to  the force of the  assault.  Hence,  this
offence, although resulting in a tragic consequence, did not fall
in the category of the most serious of its kind.
[19] Nonetheless, the appellant’s cowardly attack on a vulnerable
person and his callous disregard for the safety of his victim
requires a denunciatory sentence. Further, the appellant’s
background is a significant aggravating factor. Over the course
of the past twenty years, the appellant has been convicted of
approximately eighty offences, twenty-four of which were offences
of violence. In these circumstances, specific deterrence and the
protection of the public become of paramount importance in the
consideration of a fit sentence. In our view, a sentence of ten
years' imprisonment is a fit one.
</pre>
      <pre>     b)   Parole eligibility
</pre>
      <pre>[20] The trial judge made an order under s. 743.6 of the Criminal
Code  delaying the appellant’s parole eligibility until such time
as  he  has  served  one-half of his sentence. Although  he  gave
sparse  reasons  for  making the order,  his  decision  is  amply
supported on the record and we see no reason to interfere.
[21] The appellant has proven by his conduct that he will not
abide by the law. As indicated earlier, his criminal record shows
approximately eighty convictions including a number of parole
violations. It extends from 1975 to the time this offence was
committed with no significant breaks. There is every reason to
believe that, if released, he will re-offend. Hence, it is clear
from this background that the need for specific deterrence
requires the making of the order.
[22] For these reasons, leave to appeal the sentence is granted,
the appeal is allowed, and the sentence varied to ten years’
imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for a period of five
years.
