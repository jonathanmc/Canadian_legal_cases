McKINLAY J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  appeal of the judgment of The Honourable  Mr.</pre>
    <pre>Justice Somers, dated December 21, 1995, awarding the respondent,</pre>
    <pre>General  Refrigeration Inc. (&quot;General&quot;), damages  for  breach  of</pre>
    <pre>contract.  The breach related to the placement by the  appellant,</pre>
    <pre>National  Directory  Advertising Programs  Limited  (&quot;NDAP&quot;),  on</pre>
    <pre>behalf  of  the  respondent, of Yellow Pages advertising  in  the</pre>
    <pre>Halifax/Dartmouth telephone directory.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]    NDAP  is  an  advertising  agency  specializing   in   the</pre>
    <pre>development  and  placement of Yellow  Pages  advertising  across</pre>
    <pre>Canada.  It  does  not  deal directly with publishers  of  Yellow</pre>
    <pre>Pages,  but  has  a  contract  with an intermediary,  Tele-Direct</pre>
    <pre>(Publications)  Inc. (&quot;Tele-Direct&quot;).  NDAP is  required  by  the</pre>
    <pre>Canadian  National  Yellow Pages Association (&quot;CANYPS&quot;)  to  deal</pre>
    <pre>with  Tele-Direct  in  placing  the advertisements.   Tele-Direct</pre>
    <pre>itself publishes Yellow Pages directories in Ontario, Quebec  and</pre>
    <pre>New Brunswick, but deals with other publishers of directories  in</pre>
    <pre>some  jurisdictions,  such as Maritime  Telephone  and  Telegraph</pre>
    <pre>(&quot;MT&amp;T&quot;) in Nova Scotia.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  parties  agree that the procedure  for  approving  and</pre>
    <pre>placing Yellow Pages advertisements is as set out in paragraph  5</pre>
    <pre>of the appellant's factum, which states:

</pre>
    <pre>                     a)    The  representative of  NDAP
          would meet with the contact person at General
          approximately once a year.  She would explain
          the   order   processing  forms,   invoicing,
          billing  procedures and the  master  contract
          which  lists all the advertising that General
          was placing across Canada.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     b)    NDAP would suggest types  of
          advertisements     available     and     make
          recommendations  based  on  General's  needs.
          NDAP   and   General   would   discuss    the
          advertisement  to be placed.   General  would
          either   accept   or  reject   the   proposed
          advertising.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     c)    Once  the advertisement  was
          complete  and  finalized, NDAP would  send  a
          description  of the advertisement (containing
          the names, types of advertisements, addresses
          and   telephone  numbers)  to   General   for
          approval.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     d)    General  would  approve  the
          advertisement   by   initialing   the   faxed
          description and sending it back to NDAP.   It
          was  the  responsibility of General to  check
          the   accuracy   of  names,   addresses   and
          telephone    numbers,   and   the    proposed
          advertisement in general.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     e)    General would then  have  no
          further  involvement  in  the  process  until
          General  received the invoice  along  with  a
          print/tear  sheet  (a  copy  of  the  printed
          advertisement)  from the Yellow  Pages  which
          would, in the normal course, correspond  with
          the approved instructions.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[4]   In the fall of 1990, NDAP forwarded an order to Tele-Direct</pre>
    <pre>for placement of General's advertisement in the Halifax/Dartmouth</pre>
    <pre>Yellow  Pages. The order was confirmed by Tele-Direct on November</pre>
    <pre>13, 1990. After receiving a copy of the order sent to Tele-Direct</pre>
    <pre>by  NDAP,  General  requested a change in  the  advertisement  to</pre>
    <pre>include  its name, address and telephone number, and  details  of</pre>
    <pre>its   dealer  in  the  area,  Hoskins  Refrigeration  Ltd.   NDAP</pre>
    <pre>forwarded  the  new  insertion to Tele-Direct instructing  it  to</pre>
    <pre>include the additional information.   There was no error in  this</pre>
    <pre>transmission  of information by NDAP. Tele-Direct,  also  without</pre>
    <pre>error, forwarded the advertisement to MT&amp;T for publication.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]   There is a standard industry prohibition against review  of</pre>
    <pre>advertisements  once  they  are in the  hands  of  the  publisher</pre>
    <pre>because  of time constraints.  As a result, NDAP did not have  an</pre>
    <pre>opportunity  to review or approve the final advertisement  before</pre>
    <pre>it was published by MT&amp;T.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]   It  was  at this point that the error occurred which  gives</pre>
    <pre>rise  to  this  litigation.  MT&amp;T, having  received  the  correct</pre>
    <pre>material   for   publication,  for   some   unexplained   reason,</pre>
    <pre>erroneously  included in the advertisement the name, address  and</pre>
    <pre>telephone  number of a competitor of General.  Unfortunately  for</pre>
    <pre>both  parties to this litigation, MT&amp;T enjoys statutory  immunity</pre>
    <pre>from liability for such errors.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  NDAP noticed the error when it received a tear sheet showing</pre>
    <pre>the advertisement.  It notified MT&amp;T and processed an error claim</pre>
    <pre>report.   MT&amp;T acknowledged its error, and issued a  credit  memo</pre>
    <pre>for the cost of the advertisement, $817.91, which NDAP passed  on</pre>
    <pre>to General.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  trial judge found that the contract between  NDAP  and</pre>
    <pre>General was not simply for delivery of the correct information to</pre>
    <pre>MT&amp;T.  Rather, NDAP had a contractual obligation to  ensure  that</pre>
    <pre>the published advertisement complied with General's wishes. There</pre>
    <pre>is  no  issue  that General suffered damages as a result  of  the</pre>
    <pre>placement  of  the  erroneous  advertisement.   As  a  result  of</pre>
    <pre>General's advertisement, business was directed to a competitor.

</pre>
    <pre>     ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[9]  There is no doubt that the advertisement ordered by General</pre>
    <pre>was not placed in accordance with the contract between it and</pre>
    <pre>NDAP, and there is equally no doubt that damages to General</pre>
    <pre>resulted.  In addition, there was no negligence on the part of</pre>
    <pre>General in carrying out the contract. Consequently, there are</pre>
    <pre>only two issues in this appeal:  the first is whether limitation</pre>
    <pre>of liability clauses in the documentation exchanged between the</pre>
    <pre>parties frees NDAP from liability beyond the cost of the</pre>
    <pre>advertisement, and the second is quantum of damages in the event</pre>
    <pre>NDAP is liable.

</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Limitation of Liability Clauses
</pre>
    <pre>[10]  Before  pointing  out the limitation of  liability  clauses</pre>
    <pre>relied  on  by  NDAP  it should be noted that  there  is  also  a</pre>
    <pre>limitation  of  liability clause in the contract between  it  and</pre>
    <pre>Tele-Direct.   By  that clause, NDAP agrees  to  indemnify  Tele-</pre>
    <pre>Direct against any damages claimed by advertisers, and claims  by</pre>
    <pre>NDAP  against  Tele-Direct  are  limited  to  the  cost  of   the</pre>
    <pre>advertisement involved.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] The clauses on which the appellant relies are the following:

</pre>
    <pre>          a)    On  the  front page of a document entitled  &quot;NDAP</pre>
    <pre>          Corporate  Contract&quot;, which is actually a  confirmation</pre>
    <pre>          of  each order made for Yellow Pages advertising, there</pre>
    <pre>          are  approximately  two inches of  printed  contractual</pre>
    <pre>          terms.  In quite large upper case letters approximately</pre>
    <pre>          three  quarters of the way down those terms  are  found</pre>
    <pre>          the  words, &quot;MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO NDAP FOR ANY OMISSION</pre>
    <pre>          OR ERROR IN AD PLACEMENT IS COST OF THE ADVERTISING.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>          b)    There is a two-page document referred to  as  the</pre>
    <pre>          &quot;Master  Contract&quot;, which lists all orders  for  Yellow</pre>
    <pre>          Pages  advertisements by General across  Canada  placed</pre>
    <pre>          with  NDAP.  At  the bottom of the last  page  of  that</pre>
    <pre>          document,  approximately two inches below the signature</pre>
    <pre>          of  Elio Dinardo, General's National Sales Manager, are</pre>
    <pre>          the  words,  in  the same print as the balance  of  the</pre>
    <pre>          document,  &quot;Maximum liability to NDAP for any  omission</pre>
    <pre>          or error in ad placement is cost of the advertising.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>          c)   The billing copy of the NDAP order form, which was</pre>
    <pre>          sent to the respondent is a single page document.  The</pre>
    <pre>          following words appear on their own at the bottom of</pre>
    <pre>          this very simple document, in upper case letters, &quot;THE</pre>
    <pre>          MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSION OF ANY</pre>
    <pre>          TELEPHONE COMPANY, ITS AGENT, PUBLISHER OR NDAP IS</pre>
    <pre>          LIMITED TO THE CHARGES MADE FOR THAT ITEM OF</pre>
    <pre>          ADVERTISEMENT INVOLVED.&quot;



</pre>
    <pre>[12] A letter was sent by NDAP to Mr. Dinardo, General's National</pre>
    <pre>Sales Manager, on February 23, 1990, which included the following</pre>
    <pre>statement:

</pre>
    <pre>                     ...  we  are  providing  a  Master
          Contract with all directory items and  rates.
          It is essential that we receive authorization
          to place directory advertising on your behalf
          on an annual basis.  Please review the Master
          Contract, authorize, and mail back to  me  at
          your  earliest  convenience.  Please  keep  a
          copy for your files.
</pre>
    <pre>This is the document referred to in b) above.


</pre>
    <pre>[13] In dealing with the issue of the effect of the limitation of</pre>
    <pre>liability clauses referred to above, the trial judge decided that</pre>
    <pre>NDAP  could  not rely on them because they were not  sufficiently</pre>
    <pre>brought to the attention of the General.  There were no issues of</pre>
    <pre>credibility  in  this  case.  Indeed, the trial  judge  correctly</pre>
    <pre>emphasized  that  witnesses  for  both  the  appellant  and   the</pre>
    <pre>respondent  were agreed that the limitation of liability  clauses</pre>
    <pre>were  never  discussed between the parties, that  they  were  not</pre>
    <pre>specifically pointed out to the respondent by the appellant,  and</pre>
    <pre>that  Mr. Dinardo, on behalf of the respondent, had not read  the</pre>
    <pre>limiting  words  located  below  his  signature  on  the  &quot;Master</pre>
    <pre>Contract&quot;.

</pre>
    <pre>[14]  In  arriving  at  his conclusion, the  trial  judge  relied</pre>
    <pre>primarily  on  a  decision of this court, quoting two  statements</pre>
    <pre>made  by  Tarnopolsky  J.A. in Trigg v. MI. Movers  International</pre>
    <pre>Transport  Services Ltd. (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 562 at pp.  565  and</pre>
    <pre>566:

</pre>
    <pre>                     Where a party to a contract raises
          a  defence based on a limitation or exemption
          clause, the immediate issue is whether or not
          the   clause  is  legitimately  part  of  the
          contract    between   the    parties.     The
          determination  of this issue depends  on  the
          adequacy of the notice given by the party for
          whose benefit the clause is inserted.
</pre>
    <pre>                                   . . . .


</pre>
    <pre>                     Thus,  the general rule is that  a
          limitation   or  exemption  clause   is   not
          imported into a contract unless it is brought
          home  to the other party so prominently  that
          he  or she must be taken to have known it and
          agreed to it.


</pre>
    <pre>[15] Those words in Trigg must be read in the factual context  of</pre>
    <pre>the case where a limitation of liability clause is relied on.  In</pre>
    <pre>the  Trigg  case, the limitation provision was on the back  of  a</pre>
    <pre>more  complex standard form contract for carriage by sea  of  two</pre>
    <pre>luxury  automobiles provided by Trigg.  The limitation  provision</pre>
    <pre>was  not brought to the attention of Trigg.  Even more important,</pre>
    <pre>at  the time Trigg signed the contract, he was misinformed by the</pre>
    <pre>sales representative of the shipper as to the shipper's liability</pre>
    <pre>for  loss or damage.  As a result, he declined to purchase marine</pre>
    <pre>insurance.

</pre>
    <pre>[16]  In  this  case, the limiting provisions  had  been  in  the</pre>
    <pre>documentation exchanged between the parties over the whole twenty</pre>
    <pre>years  of their contractual relationship.  We don't know  whether</pre>
    <pre>any  predecessors  of  Mr. Dinardo were  aware  of  the  limiting</pre>
    <pre>provisions, but the very fact that they were included in  all  of</pre>
    <pre>the  documentation over such a long period is of relevance.   But</pre>
    <pre>of  even greater relevance, in my view, is the fact that in  each</pre>
    <pre>of the documents involved there was a very minimum of contractual</pre>
    <pre>wording.   This  was not a case like a standard form  car  rental</pre>
    <pre>contract,  which  has  a large number of confusing  and  detailed</pre>
    <pre>provisions,  few  of  which  the normal  individual  signing  the</pre>
    <pre>contract would understand even if he or she did take the time  to</pre>
    <pre>read  the  small  print.  Here there was no small print;  indeed,</pre>
    <pre>there  was very little print at all, and the limitation provision</pre>
    <pre>was always quite prominent.  I do not see how, after receiving  a</pre>
    <pre>letter  advising him to read the Master Contract carefully before</pre>
    <pre>signing it, Mr. Dinardo could possibly have missed the limitation</pre>
    <pre>provision.  The trial judge accepted his evidence that he did not</pre>
    <pre>read  it,  but  given the fact that all of the  printing  on  the</pre>
    <pre>contract was very clear, and could have been read in no more than</pre>
    <pre>one  minute, the fact that Mr. Dinardo did not read the provision</pre>
    <pre>seems  to  me to be irrelevant.   Mr. Dinardo failed  to  take  a</pre>
    <pre>minute to do what he was asked by the appellant to do -- read the</pre>
    <pre>contractual document.

</pre>
    <pre>[17] The words of Robins J.A. in  Fraser Jewellers (1982) Ltd. v.</pre>
    <pre>Dominion Electric Protection Co. et al. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 1 at</pre>
    <pre>p.  11 could have been written about the facts in this case.   He</pre>
    <pre>states:

</pre>
    <pre>                     This  is  not a case in which  the
          clause limiting liability was so obscured  as
          to  make  it  probable that it  would  escape
          attention.  This  contract  was  printed  and
          contained on essentially one sheet of  paper.
          The  limitation provision was highlighted  in
          bold  block letters.  The language  is  clear
          and unambiguous.  There was no need to resort
          to  a  magnifying  glass  to  see  it  or   a
          dictionary  to  understand it.   Nothing  was
          done  to  mislead a reader.  Had  Mr.  Gordon
          perused  the  contract, he  would  have  been
          aware  of the limitation.  The fact  that  he
          did  not is irrelevant to the question of the
          fairness or conscionability of the contract.


</pre>
    <pre>                     The  trial judge held that it  was
          the  defendant's responsibility to bring  the
          clause  to  the 'specific attention'  of  the
          plaintiff and to explain its effect.  Not  to
          have  done  so,  he  found,  constituted   an
          'unacceptable  commercial  practice'.   As  I
          view   the  matter,  there  was  no   special
          relationship  existing between these  parties
          that  imposed  any  such  obligation  on  the
          defendant.  This  is  an ordinary  commercial
          contract  between  business  people....  [I]n
          this  commercial setting, in the  absence  of
          fraud or other improper conduct inducing  the
          plaintiff  to  enter the contract,  the  onus
          must  rest  upon the plaintiff to review  the
          document and satisfy itself of its advantages
          and  disadvantages before signing it.   There
          is   no   justification  for   shifting   the
          plaintiff's   responsibility  to   act   with
          elementary prudence onto the defendant.


</pre>
    <pre>                      It  is  not  suggested  that  the
          plaintiff was rushed or pressured in any  way
          into   signing  the  contract.   Nor  is   it
          suggested that the defendant engaged  in  any
          dubious  conduct to achieve  this  end.   The
          plaintiff had all the time needed to read the
          contract   and   consider  its   terms   and,
          admittedly,   could  have  questioned   ADT's
          representative on any provision  about  which
          it  may have had doubt.  It accordingly  must
          be treated in the same manner as a subscriber
          who  signed the contract with full  knowledge
          of the exclusion provision.


</pre>
    <pre>[18]  In  my  view, the limitation of liability  provisions  were</pre>
    <pre>effective in this case to limit NDAP's liability to the  cost  of</pre>
    <pre>the erroneous advertisement.

</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Quantum of Damages


</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Having  decided that NDAP's liability  is  limited  to  the</pre>
    <pre>amount  already paid by it to General, there is no need  to  deal</pre>
    <pre>with  the  question of damages.  However, I do wish to  say  that</pre>
    <pre>this  is  the  type of case where the assessment  of  damages  is</pre>
    <pre>extremely  difficult.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  trial  judge</pre>
    <pre>carefully  balanced  the evidence before  him,  and  came  to  as</pre>
    <pre>accurate and fair a figure as possible in the circumstances.  Had</pre>
    <pre>I  been  of  the  view that NDAP was liable,  I  would  not  have</pre>
    <pre>interfered with the damage assessment.


RESULT


[20] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below,  and</pre>
    <pre>replace  it with a judgment dismissing the action with costs.   I</pre>
    <pre>would award the appellant costs of the appeal.
