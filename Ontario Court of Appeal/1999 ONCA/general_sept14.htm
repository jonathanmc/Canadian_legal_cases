</pre>
        <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Smith A.C.J.O.C.,
O&#146;Leary and Farley JJ.) dated December 10, 1997, made at Thunder
Bay, Ontario.
</pre>
        <pre>CARTHY J.A.:
</pre>
        <pre>[1]  This action concerning a fire loss is at the discovery stage
and has spawned a variety of questions regarding solicitor-client
privilege and litigation privilege, which form the subject matter
of  this appeal. I have reviewed the reasons of Doherty J.A.  and
adopt  his analysis of the principles underlying solicitor-client
privilege, or as he prefers, &#147;client-solicitor privilege&#148;.



BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
        <pre>[2]   Daniel  Chrusz and others were the owners of the University
Park Inn, a motel and bar complex, which was severely damaged  by
fire on November 15, 1994. General Accident Assurance Company was
the  lead  insurer of the property and immediately retained  John
Bourret,  an  independent  claims adjuster,  to  investigate  the
incident.  On  November  16, 1994, Bourret  reported  to  General
Accident  that the fire may have been deliberately set, and  that
arson  was  suspected. General Accident then retained  a  lawyer,
David  Eryou, for legal advice relating to the fire and any claim
under the policy.
[3]  Bourret twice reported to General Accident and then on
December 1st, 1994 was instructed to report directly to Eryou and
to take instructions from him.
[4]  On January 9, 1995, Chrusz delivered a Proof of Loss
claiming $1,570,540.61. General Accident advanced $100,000 to
Chrusz as a partial payment on the loss and, on April 25, 1995,
General Accident agreed to advance a further $505,000, being the
appraised actual cash value of the motel part of the property. It
appears that, at this stage, there was no suspicion of arson on
the part of Chrusz.
[5]  Between July 1994 and January 1995, Chrusz employed Denis
Pilotte as a motel  manager on the site. His services were
terminated in January 1995, and in May of that year he made
allegations against Chrusz to Bourret and Eryou. Judging by what
is contained in the pleadings that followed, Pilotte apparently
alleged that Chrusz was fraudulently involved in creating the
appearance of fire damage, where none existed, in order to
inflate the amount of the claim. An example, which points to the
potential relevance of the now disputed communications, is the
allegation that Chrusz was responsible for moving undamaged
furniture into fire damaged areas in order to inflate the claim
of loss.
[6]  On May 23, 1995, Pilotte gave a statement under oath to
Eryou and Bourret that was transcribed at the behest of Eryou.
Prior to making the statement Pilotte had not obtained legal
advice and willingly proceeded without a lawyer. He said he
wanted to make the statement because his conscience was bothering
him. Pilotte also brought a videotape he had recorded which was
shown and discussed. At the request of Eryou, the videotape was
left with Eryou to be returned after making a copy. In due course
it was returned.
[7]  Pilotte and his counsel were given copies of Pilotte&#146;s
statement on June 2, 1995 as promised by Eryou. It was not a
condition of making the statement that Pilotte be given a copy of
the transcript. According to General Accident, Pilotte agreed to
keep the transcript confidential at Eryou&#146;s request. It is argued
that the statement was given to Pilotte on agreement that it
would not be released to anyone without Eryou&#146;s prior approval.
[8]  On June 2, 1995, General Accident issued a statement of
claim against the insured and the insured&#146;s employees, alleging,
amongst other things, concealment, fraud and misrepresentation
during the process of the adjustment of the loss. This claim was
launched in partial reliance upon the Pilotte statement.
[9]  A statement of defence filed November 14, 1995 included a
counterclaim against the plaintiffs and the Pilottes and Bourret.
The Pilottes are sued for damages in the amount of $1.5 million
allegedly caused by their defamation and slander and injurious
falsehoods concerning the defendants to the main action. The
essence of the claim against the Pilottes is that Denis Pilotte,
motivated by the cancellation of his benefit plan arising from
his employment as the night manager at the hotel owned by Chrusz,
&#147;intentionally sought out to fabricate, create and publish
defamatory statements, untruths and a most incredible alchemy of
falsehoods with the stated and intended purpose of interfering
with Chrusz&#146;s contractual relationships with the insurers.&#148;  The
counterclaim alleges that the plaintiff insurers &#147;relied on
reckless, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated and malicious
statements made by disgruntled former employees of Chrusz, Denis
and Patty Pilotte.&#148;
[10] The motion which led to this appeal challenges the claims
for privilege to documents listed in Schedule B of the affidavits
of documents of certain of the defendants to the counterclaim.


Judgment of Kurisko J.</pre>
        <pre>[11]  In  extensive reasons now reported at (1997),  44  C.C.L.I.
(2d) 122, and (1997), 12 C.P.C. (4th) 150, Kurisko J. divided the
communications into six categories.

</pre>
        <pre>     1.   Communications between Eryou and General Accident</pre>
        <pre>[12]  Kurisko J. concluded that all communications between  these
parties were subject to solicitor-client privilege.
     </pre>
        <pre>     2.   Communications by Bourret to General Accident or  Eryou
          before May 23, 1995</pre>
        <pre>[13]  These  communications were derivative and not protected  by
litigation  privilege  in that there was no  agency  relationship
between General Accident and Bourret. (The concept of &#147;derivative
communications&#148;  was  adopted  from  R.  Manes  and  M.   Silver,
Solicitor-Client    Privilege   in   Canadian    Law    (Toronto:
Butterworths, 1993)).
     </pre>
        <pre>     3.   Communications between Bourret or General Accident and third
          parties prior to May 23, 1995</pre>
        <pre>[14]  These  were  held  to  be derivative  and  not  subject  to
litigation privilege.
</pre>
        <pre>     
     4.   Communications between Bourret and General Accident and
          Bourret and Eryou after May 23, 1995</pre>
        <pre>[15]  At  this  stage, Kurisko J. concluded that  litigation  was
imminent  and thus, these communications were subject  to  either
legal professional privilege or litigation privilege.
     </pre>
        <pre>     5.   The Pilotte Statement</pre>
        <pre>[16]  The Pilotte statement was, prima facie, privileged  in  the
hands  of  Eryou  and  General  Accident  as  being  prepared  in
anticipation of litigation, but such privilege was  lost  in  the
handing  of a copy to Pilotte. The unconditional promise to  give
the  transcript to Pilotte was an unequivocal waiver  of  control
over the confidentiality of the transcript.</pre>
        <pre>     6.   The Pilotte Videotape</pre>
        <pre>[17]  The videotape was not a document over which privilege could
be  properly  claimed as it was not prepared in contemplation  of
this  litigation (i.e., the Counterclaim) and was ordered  to  be
disclosed to the defendants.</pre>
        <pre>Judgment  of the Divisional Court (Smith A.C.J.O.C., O&#146;Leary  and
Farley JJ.)</pre>
        <pre>[18]  The Divisional Court set aside the order of Kurisko J.  and
directed that the documents he ordered to be produced need not be
produced, except for the videotape made by Pilotte. This judgment
is  now reported at (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 790. The court concluded
that  all  reports from Bourret to General Accident and/or  Eryou
made before and after May 23, 1995 were privileged.
[19] With respect to the Pilotte statement, the court found that
once recorded by Eryou, it became part of his brief for
litigation. Eryou did not waive this privilege by giving a copy
to Pilotte. The court held that none of the parties are required
to produce this document.
[20] The court did, however, agree with Kurisko J. in concluding
that the videotape, the float book and additional time sheets,
are not subject to any privilege as they were in existence before
Eryou met with Pilotte and were not subject to any privilege in
Pilotte&#146;s hands. The court noted that: &#147;[a]n original document
that is clothed with no privilege does not acquire privilege
simply because it gets into the hands of a solicitor&#148;.</pre>
        <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
        <pre>[21] These facts raise a variety of disclosure issues and, as  is
often  the  case,  it  is helpful to return  to  fundamentals  to
identify  the  appropriate principles before seeking  answers  to
individual  questions.  There are hundreds  of  case  authorities
dealing with litigation privilege but few that discuss the issues
comprehensively.  This  is because in most  cases  an  individual
question  has been raised in a particular context and receives  a
specific  answer. The range of issues in this appeal justifies  a
broader analysis.


Litigation privilege</pre>
        <pre>[22]  The origins and character of litigation privilege are  well
described by Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant in The Law of  Evidence
in Canada, (Toronto:  Butterworths, 1992) at p.653:
          </pre>
        <pre>               As the principle of solicitor-client privilege developed,
          the breadth of protection took on different dimensions. It
          expanded beyond communications passing between the client and
          solicitor and their respective agents, to encompass
          communications between the client or his solicitor and third
          parties if made for the solicitor&#146;s information for the purpose
          of pending or contemplated litigation. Although this extension
          was spawned out of the traditional solicitor-client privilege,
          the policy justification for it differed markedly from its
          progenitor. It had nothing to do with clients&#146; freedom to consult
          privately and openly with their solicitors; rather, it was
          founded upon our adversary system of litigation by which counsel
          control fact-presentation before the Court and decide for
          themselves which evidence and by what manner of proof they will
          adduce facts to establish their claim or defence, without any
          obligation to make prior disclosure of the material acquired in
          preparation of the case. Accordingly, it is somewhat of a
          misnomer to characterize this aspect of privilege under the
          rubric, (solicitor-client privilege), which has peculiar
          reference to the professional relationship between the two
          individuals. [Footnotes omitted.]</pre>
        <pre>[23] R. J. Sharpe, prior to his judicial appointment, published a
thoughtful lecture on this subject, entitled &#147;Claiming  Privilege
in  the  Discovery  Process&#148;  in  Law  in  Transition:  Evidence,
L.S.U.C.  Special  Lectures (Toronto: De Boo, 1984)  at  163.  He
stated  at pp. 164-65:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    It is crucially important to distinguish litigation
          privilege from solicitor-client privilege. There are, I suggest,
          at least three important differences between the two. First,
          solicitor-client privilege applies only to confidential
          communications between the client and his solicitor. Litigation
          privilege, on the other hand, applies to communications of a non-
          confidential nature between the solicitor and third parties and
          even includes material of a non-communicative nature. Secondly,
          solicitor-client privilege exists any time a client seeks legal
          advice from his solicitor whether or not litigation is involved.
          Litigation privilege, on the other hand, applies only in the
          context of litigation itself. Thirdly, and most important, the
          rationale for solicitor-client privilege is very different from
          that which underlies litigation privilege. This difference merits
          close attention. The interest which underlies the protection
          accorded communications between a client and a solicitor from
          disclosure is the interest of all citizens to have full and ready
          access to legal advice. If an individual cannot confide in a
          solicitor knowing that what is said will not be revealed, it will
          be difficult, if not impossible, for that individual to obtain
          proper candid legal advice.
          </pre>
        <pre>                     Litigation privilege, on the other
          hand,  is  geared directly to the process  of
          litigation.  Its  purpose  is  not  explained
          adequately by the protection afforded lawyer-
          client  communications  deemed  necessary  to
          allow  clients  to obtain legal  advice,  the
          interest    protected   by   solicitor-client
          privilege.  Its purpose is more  particularly
          related to the needs of the adversarial trial
          process.  Litigation privilege is based  upon
          the  need  for a protected area to facilitate
          investigation and preparation of a  case  for
          trial  by the adversarial advocate. In  other
          words,   litigation   privilege    aims    to
          facilitate  a process (namely, the  adversary
          process),  while  solicitor-client  privilege
          aims  to protect a relationship (namely,  the
          confidential  relationship between  a  lawyer
          and a client).
                                </pre>
        <pre>                  Rationale for Litigation Privilege
          </pre>
        <pre>                     Relating  litigation privilege  to
          the   needs  of  the  adversary  process   is
          necessary  to  arrive at an understanding  of
          its  content and effect. The effect of a rule
          of  privilege is to shut out the  truth,  but
          the  process  which litigation  privilege  is
          aimed  to  protect &#150; the adversary process  &#150;
          among  other things, attempts to get  at  the
          truth.  There are, then, competing  interests
          to  be  considered when a claim of litigation
          privilege is asserted; there is a need for  a
          zone  of  privacy  to facilitate  adversarial
          preparation;  there  is  also  the  need  for
          disclosure to foster fair trial.</pre>
        <pre>[24]  It  can  be seen from these excerpts, quoted without  their
underlying  authorities, that there is nothing  sacrosanct  about
this  form of privilege. It is not rooted, as is solicitor-client
privilege, in the necessity of confidentiality in a relationship.
It is a practicable means of assuring counsel what Sharpe calls a
&#147;zone  of  privacy&#148;  and  what is termed in  the  United  States,
protection  of  the  solicitor&#146;s work product:   See  Hickman  v.
Taylor 329 U.S. 495 (1946).
[25] The &#147;zone of privacy&#148; is an attractive description but does
not define the outer reaches of protection or the legitimate
intrusion of discovery to assure a trial on all of the relevant
facts. The modern trend is in the direction of complete discovery
and there is no apparent reason to inhibit that trend so long as
counsel is left with sufficient flexibility to adequately serve
the litigation client. In effect, litigation privilege is the
area of privacy left to a solicitor after the current demands of
discoverability have been met. There is a tension between them to
the extent that when discovery is widened, the reasonable
requirements of counsel to conduct litigation must be recognized.
[26] Our modern rules certainly have truncated what would
previously have been protected from disclosure. Under r. 31.06(1)
information cannot be refused on discovery on the ground that
what is sought is evidence. Under r. 31.06(2) the names and
addresses of witnesses must be disclosed. A judicial ruling in
Dionisopoulous v. Provias (1990) 71 O.R. (2d) 547 (H.C.)
compelled a party to reveal the substance of the evidence of a
witness, demonstrating that it is not just the Rules of Civil
Procedure that may intrude upon traditional preserves.
[27] Rule 31(06)(3) provides for discovery of the name and
address and the findings, conclusions and opinions of an expert,
unless the party undertakes not to call that expert at trial.
This is an example of the Rules Committee recognizing the right
to proceed in privacy to obtain opinions and to maintain their
confidentiality if found to be unfavourable. The tactical room
for the advocate to manoeuvre is preserved while the interests of
a fair trial and early settlement are supported. The actual
production of an expert&#146;s report is required under r. 53.03(1).
Similar treatment is given to medical reports under rules 33.04
and 33.06.
[28] In a very real sense, litigation privilege is being defined
by the rules as they are amended from time to time. Judicial
decisions should be consonant with those changes and should be
driven more by the modern realities of the conduct of litigation
and perceptions of discoverability than by historic precedents
born in a very different context.
[29] One historic precedent that in my view does have modern
application but that has been given a varied reception in Ontario
is the House of Lords&#146; decision in Waugh v. British Railways
Board, [1979] 2 All E.R. 1169. That case concerned a railway
inspector&#146;s routine accident report. It was prepared in part to
further railway safety and in part for submission to the
railway&#146;s solicitor for liability purposes. It was held that
while the document was prepared in part for the purpose of
obtaining legal advice in anticipated litigation, that was not
its dominant purpose and thus it must be produced.
[30] After considering authorities that had protected documents
from production where one purpose of preparation was anticipated
litigation, Lord Wilberforce concluded at pp.1173 and 1174:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    It is clear that the due administration of justice
          strongly requires disclosure and production of this report: it
          was contemporary; it contained statements by witnesses on the
          spot; it would be not merely relevant evidence but almost
          certainly the best evidence as to the cause of the accident. If
          one accepts that this important public interest can be overridden
          in order that the defendant may properly prepare his case, how
          close must the connection be between the preparation of the
          document and the anticipation of litigation? On principle I would
          think that the purpose of preparing for litigation ought to be
          either the sole purpose or at least the dominant purpose of it&#133;
          </pre>
        <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
        <pre>                     It  appears to me that unless  the
          purpose of submission to the legal adviser in
          view  of  litigation is at least the dominant
          purpose  for which the relevant document  was
          prepared, the reasons which require privilege
          to  be  extended to it cannot apply.  On  the
          other  hand  to  hold that  the  purpose,  as
          above, must be the sole purpose, would, apart
          from difficulties of proof, in my opinion, be
          too  strict a requirement, and would  confine
          the privilege too narrowly&#133;</pre>
        <pre>This  dominant  purpose test has contended  in  Canada  with  the
substantial  purpose test. Appellate courts in Nova  Scotia,  New
Brunswick, British Columbia and Alberta have adopted the dominant
purpose  standard:  see Davies v. Harrington (1980),  115  D.L.R.
(3d) 347 (N.S.C.A.); McCaig v. Trentowsky (1983), 148 D.L.R. (3d)
724  (N.B.C.A.);  Voth Bros. Construction (1974)  Ltd.  v.  North
Vancouver  Board  of  School  Trustees  (1981),  23  C.P.C.   276
(B.C.C.A.) and Nova, An Alberta Corp. v. Guelph Engineering  Co.,
[1984] 3 W.W.R. 314 (Alta. C.A.).</pre>
        <pre>[31]  In  Ontario,  the predominant view of  judges  and  masters
hearing  motions is that the substantial purpose test  should  be
applied.  This, of course, provides a broader protection  against
discovery  than the dominant purpose test and, in my  view,  runs
against  the  grain  of contemporary trends in  discovery.  These
authorities  find  their  root in a decision  of  this  court  in
Blackstone  v.  The Mutual Life Insurance Company  of  New  York,
[1944] O.R. 328 where Robertson C.J.O. said at p. 333:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    I agree with the proposition of the defendant&#146;s counsel
          that it is not essential to the validity of the claim of
          privilege that the document for which privilege is claimed should
          have been written, prepared or obtained solely for the purpose
          of, or in connection with, litigation then pending or
          anticipated. It is sufficient if that was the substantial, or one
          of the substantial, purposes then in view.</pre>
        <pre>[32]  The  real  issue in that case was whether  the  reports  in
question  were prepared in anticipation of litigation. Gillanders
J.A.  wrote  concurring reasons with no mention  of  &#147;substantial
purpose&#148;, and similarly there was none in the dissenting  reasons
of  Kellock J.A. Even as an obiter remark by Robertson C.J.O.  it
is   not  presented  as  a  reasoned  conclusion  based  upon   a
consideration  of the authorities and does not match  substantial
purpose  against dominant purpose. I do not consider  the  quoted
statement   binding  on  this  court  and,  based   upon   policy
considerations  of  encouraging discovery, would  join  with  the
other  appellate  authorities in adopting  the  dominant  purpose
test.
[33] An important element of the dominant purpose test is the
requirement that the document in question be created for the
purposes of litigation, actual or contemplated. Does it apply to
a document that simply appears in the course of investigative
work?  The concept of creation has been applied by some courts to
include copying of public documents and protection of the copies
in the lawyer's brief. In Hodgkinson v. Simms et al. (1988), 55
D.L.R. (4th) 577 the majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal applied the dominant purpose test but then, relying
principally on Lyell v. Kennedy (1884), 27 Ch.D. 1 (C.A.), held
that copies of public documents gathered by a solicitor&#146;s office
attained the protection of litigation privilege. In Lyell v.
Kennedy the protected copies were of tombstone inscriptions and
Cotton L.J. upheld the privilege, stating at p.26:
          </pre>
        <pre>               In my opinion it is contrary to the principle on which the
          Court acts with regard to protection on the ground of
          professional privilege that we should make an order for their
          production; they were obtained for the purpose of his defence,
          and it would be to deprive a solicitor of the means afforded for
          enabling him to fully investigate a case for the purpose of
          instructing counsel if we required documents, although perhaps
          publici juris in themselves, to be produced, because the very
          fact of the solicitor having got copies of certain burial
          certificates and other records, and having made copies of the
          inscriptions on certain tombstones, and obtained photographs of
          certain houses, might shew what his view was as to the case of
          his client as regards the claim made against him.</pre>
        <pre>[34] The majority reasons in Hodgkinson were written by McEachern
C.J.B.C. who, at p.578, identified the issue as being:
          </pre>
        <pre>               &#133; whether photocopies of documents collected by the
          plaintiff&#146;s solicitor from third parties and now included in his
          brief are privileged even though the original documents were not
          created for the purpose of litigation.</pre>
        <pre>[35]  After a thorough analysis of the authorities, the principal
one  of which is Lyle v. Kennedy, the  Chief Justice observed  at
p. 583:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    In my view the purpose of the privilege is to ensure
          that a solicitor may, for the purpose of preparing himself to
          advise or conduct proceedings, proceed with complete confidence
          that the protected information or material he gathers from his
          client and others for this purpose, and what advice he gives,
          will not be disclosed to anyone except with the consent of his
          client.</pre>
        <pre>And at p. 589:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    It is my conclusion that the law has always been, and
          in my view should continue to be, that in circumstances such as
          these, where a lawyer exercising legal knowledge, skill, judgment
          and industry has assembled a collection of relevant copy
          documents for his brief for the purpose of advising on or
          conducting anticipated or pending litigation he is entitled,
          indeed required, unless the client consents, to claim privilege
          for such collection and to refuse production.</pre>
        <pre>[36] Craig J.A., in dissenting reasons, put aside the older cases
as  not manifesting the modern approach to discovery and espoused
a  rigid  circumscribing  of  litigation  privilege.  He  bluntly
concluded at p.594:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    I fail to comprehend how original documents which are
          not privileged (because they are not prepared with the dominant
          purpose of actual or anticipated litigation) can become
          privileged simply because counsel makes photostatic copies of the
          documents and puts them in his &#147;brief&#148;. This is contrary to the
          intent of the rules and to the modern approach to this problem.
          If a document relates to a matter in question, it should be
          produced for inspection.</pre>
        <pre>[37] I agree with the tenor of Craig J.A.&#146;s reasons. The majority
reasons  reflect a traditional view of the entitlement to privacy
in a lawyer&#146;s investigative pursuits. It is an instinctive reflex
of  any  litigation counsel to collect evidence and to pounce  at
the most propitious moment. That&#146;s the fun in litigation! But the
ground   rules  are  changing  in  favour  of  early   discovery.
Litigation counsel must adjust to this new environment and I  can
see  no  reason to think that clients may suffer except by losing
the surprise effect of the hidden missile.
[38] Returning to the specific topic, if original documents enjoy
no privilege, then copying is only in a technical sense a
creation. Moreover, if the copies were in the possession of the
client prior to the prospect of litigation they would not be
protected from production. Why should copies of relevant
documents obtained after contemplation of litigation be treated
differently? Suppose counsel for one litigant finds an
incriminating filing by the opposite party in the Security
Commission&#146;s files. Could there be any justification for its
retention until cross-examination at trial?  Further, such
copies, if relevant in their content, must be revealed in oral
discovery under r. 31.06(1) which provides that questions must be
answered even though the information sought is evidence.
[39] The production of such documents in the discovery process
does little to impinge upon the lawyer&#146;s freedom to prepare in
privacy and weighs heavily in the scales supporting fairness in
the pursuit of truth.
[40] In disagreeing with the majority reasons in Hodgkinson I am
at the same time differing from the reasons and result in Ottawa-
Carleton (Regional Municipality) v. Consumers&#146; Gas Go. (1990), 74
O.R. (2d) where the Ontario Divisional Court held copies of
public documents to be privileged. Montgomery J., the motions
judge in that case indicated a preference for the reasoning of
Craig J.A. in Hodgkinson. The Divisional Court preferred to
follow the majority. In the present case the Divisional Court
appears to agree with my view, although without analysis of
authorities.
[41] This court does not easily turn aside authorities such as
Lyle v. Kennedy  that have stood as the law for many years.
However, consistent with the theme of these reasons, deference
must be given to modern perceptions of discoverability in
preference to historic landmarks that no longer fit the dynamics
of the conduct of litigation. The zone of privacy is thus
restricted in aid of the pursuit of early exchange of relevant
facts and the fair resolution of disputes.</pre>
        <pre>Common interest privilege</pre>
        <pre>[42]  In some circumstances litigation privilege may be preserved
even  though  the information is shared with a third  party.  The
circumstance giving rise to this issue on the present  appeal  is
the  provision to Pilotte by the solicitor for the insurer  of  a
copy of Pilotte&#146;s signed statement.
[43] While solicitor-client privilege stands against the world,
litigation privilege is a protection only against the adversary,
and only until termination of the litigation. It may not be
inconsistent with litigation privilege vis-à-vis the adversary to
communicate with an outsider, without creating a waiver, but a
document in the hand of an outsider will only be protected by a
privilege if there is a common interest in litigation or its
prospect.
[44] The general principle was first enunciated by Denning L.J.
in Buttes Gas and Oil Co. v. Hammer (No. 3), [1980] 3 All E.R.
475 (C.A.) at pp.483-84:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    In case this be wrong, however, I must go on to
          consider the claim for legal professional privilege. The
          arguments became complicated beyond belief. Largely because a
          distinction was drawn between Buttes (who are the party to the
          litigation) and the ruler of Sharjah (who is no party to it).
          Such as questions as to who held the originals and who held the
          copies and so forth. Countless cases were cited. Few were of any
          help.
          </pre>
        <pre>                      I  would  sweep  away  all  those
          distinctions.  Although  this  litigation  is
          between   Buttes  and  Occidental,  we   must
          remember that standing alongside them in  the
          selfsame  interest are the rulers of  Sharjah
          and  UAQ respectively. McNeill J thought that
          this gave rise to special considerations, and
          I  agree with him. There is a privilege which
          may  be called a &#145;common interest&#146; privilege.
          That  is  a  privilege in aid of  anticipated
          litigation  in which several persons  have  a
          common   interest.   It  often   happens   in
          litigation that a plaintiff or defendant  has
          other persons standing alongside him who have
          the  selfsame  interest as he  and  who  have
          consulted  lawyers on the selfsame points  as
          he  but who have not been made parties to the
          action.  Maybe for economy or for  simplicity
          or  what  you  will.  All exchange  counsels&#146;
          opinions.  All  collect information  for  the
          purpose  of litigation. All make copies.  All
          await  the  outcome  with  the  same  anxious
          anticipation because it affects each as  much
          as it does the others. Instances come readily
          to  mind. Owners of adjoining houses complain
          of   a   nuisance  which  affects  them  both
          equally.   Both  take  legal   advice.   Both
          exchange relevant documents. But only one  is
          a plaintiff. An author writes a book and gets
          it  published. It is said to contain a  libel
          or  to be an infringement of copyright.  Both
          author and publisher take legal advice.  Both
          exchange  documents. But only one is  made  a
          defendant.
          </pre>
        <pre>                     In  all  such cases  I  think  the
          courts should, for the purposes of discovery,
          treat  all the persons interested as if  they
          were partners in a single firm or departments
          in  a  single company. Each can avail himself
          of  the privilege in aid of litigation.  Each
          can collect information for the use of his or
          the  other&#146;s  legal adviser.  Each  can  hold
          originals and each make copies. And so forth.
          All  are the subject of the privilege in  aid
          of  anticipated  litigation, even  though  it
          should transpire that, when the litigation is
          afterwards  commenced, only one  of  them  is
          made  a  party to it. No matter that one  has
          the  originals and the other has the  copies.
          All are privileged.</pre>
        <pre>[45]  In language more specifically directed to the issue on this
appeal  the U.S. Court of Appeal put it this way in United States
of America v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company et al. 642
F.2d 1285 (1980) (S.C.C.A.) at pp.1299-1300:
          </pre>
        <pre>                    The attorney-client privilege exists to protect
          confidential communications, to assure the client that any
          statements he makes in seeking legal advice will be kept strictly
          confidential between him and his attorney; in effect, to protect
          the attorney-client relationship. Any voluntary disclosure by the
          holder of such a privilege is inconsistent with the confidential
          relationship and thus waives the privilege.
          </pre>
        <pre>                      By  contrast,  the  work  product
          privilege   does  not  exist  to  protect   a
          confidential  relationship,  but  rather   to
          promote  the adversary system by safeguarding
          the    fruits   of   an   attorney&#146;s    trial
          preparations from the discovery  attempts  of
          the opponent. The purpose of the work product
          doctrine  is  to protect information  against
          opposing  parties, rather  than  against  all
          others   outside  a  particular  confidential
          relationship, in order to encourage effective
          trial preparation. In the leading case on the
          work  product  privilege, the  Supreme  Court
          stated:   &#147;Proper preparation of  a  client&#146;s
          case  demands  that he assemble  information,
          sift  what  he  considers to be the  relevant
          from  the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal
          theories and plan his strategy without  undue
          and  needless interference. A disclosure made
          in the pursuit of such trial preparation, and
          not  inconsistent  with  maintaining  secrecy
          against  opponents, should be allowed without
          waiver  of the privilege. We conclude,  then,
          that  while  the mere showing of a  voluntary
          disclosure  to a third person will  generally
          suffice to show waiver of the attorney-client
          privilege,  it should not suffice  in  itself
          for waiver of  the work product privilege.
          </pre>
        <pre>                     We do not endorse a reading of the
          GAF  Corp.  standard so  broad  as  to  allow
          confidential disclosure to any person without
          waiver  of  the  work product privilege.  The
          existence   of   common   interests   between
          transferor  and  transferee  is  relevant  to
          deciding whether the disclosure is consistent
          with   the   nature  of  the   work   product
          privilege. But &#145;common interests&#146; should  not
          be  construed  as  narrowly  limited  to  co-
          parties. So long as transferor and transferee
          anticipate   litigation  against   a   common
          adversary  on the same issue or issues,  they
          have  strong common interests in sharing  the
          fruit   of  the  trial  preparation  efforts.
          Moreover,   with   common  interests   on   a
          particular  issue against a common adversary,
          the  transferee  is  not  at  all  likely  to
          disclose  the  work product material  to  the
          adversary. When the transfer to a party  with
          such  common interests is conducted  under  a
          guarantee   of  confidentiality,   the   case
          against waiver is even stronger. [Emphasis in
          original]</pre>
        <pre>[46]  Although the subject of common interest has arisen in other
contexts  in  Canadian cases, I am satisfied that the  above  two
excerpts  should  be  adopted as expressing both  the  applicable
principle and the specific application of that principle  to  the
issues on this appeal. Canadian authorities which have dealt with
common   interest   privilege  in  different  contexts   include:

Investigation  and Research), [1995] O.J. No.  4148  (Gen.  Div);

        <pre>Application of principles to the disputed categories</pre>
        <pre>[47]  I  will  depart  somewhat from Kurisko J.&#146;s  categories  of
communication in order to relate them more directly to  my  legal
analysis.
[48] There is no question that all communications between Eryou
and General Accident are protected by solicitor-client privilege,
there being no indication of waiver.
[49] The more contentious issue is whether communications between
Bourret and Eryou or Bourret and General Accident are privileged.
[50] In my view, an insurance company investigating a policy
holder&#146;s fire is not, or should not be considered to be, in a
state of anticipation of litigation. It may be that negotiations
and even litigation will follow as to the extent of the loss but
until something arises to give reality to litigation, the company
should be seen as conducting itself in good faith in the service
of the insured. The reality of anticipation of litigation arose
in this case when arson was suspected and Eryou was retained.
Chrusz was presumably a suspect if this was a case of arson and
litigation privilege attached to communications between Bourret
and Eryou or from Bourret through General Accident to Eryou so
long as such litigation was contemplated. The dominant purpose
test is satisfied.
[51] However, I would not accord communications between Bourret
and Eryou with the protection of solicitor-client privilege.
Bourret was retained to perform the functions of investigating
and reporting. He was expected to be honest in doing his job, and
no special legal protection was necessary to ensure a candid
report. I agree with the reasoning of Doherty J.A. on this
subject.
[52] Viewed from another perspective, when the end comes to
contemplated litigation what purpose is served by protecting such
information if relevant in other proceedings?  The sanctity of
the client&#146;s secrets which are shared with a lawyer is untouched.
If the circumstances surrounding the fire are relevant in other
litigation there may be no better evidence than Bourret&#146;s
reports. Thus, the interests of the determination of truth is
served by production without effect upon the fundamental
protection afforded to solicitor-client communications.
[53]  The payments by General Accident to Chrusz between  January
and  April 1995 are clear evidence that his involvement in  arson
was  no  longer  a  consideration. The  parties  had  essentially
returned  to  the  original  positions  of  insurer  and  insured
negotiating  over  the  value of the claim.  Litigation  was,  as
always, a possibility, but, so far as the evidence reveals it was
not in contemplation.
[54]  At that point, in my view, the previous existing litigation
privilege  came  to  an  end and documents  that  had  once  been
protected  on that account became compellable in any  proceedings
where they were relevant.
[55] On May 23, 1995, a metamorphosis occurred. The revelations
of Pilotte immediately brought new litigation into contemplation
&#150; the eventual claim by General Accident of fraud and
misrepresentation by Chrusz following the fire. However, it was
Pilotte&#146;s evidence that he was acting because his conscience
bothered him. The lack of any assertion that he contemplated
litigation prior to receiving the counterclaim, requires a
separate analysis of whether documents in his hands must be
produced, notwithstanding protection in the hands of Eryou by
reason of the fresh litigation privilege.
[56] Dealing first with Eryou, any communications or reports from
Bourret after May 23, 1995, whose dominant purpose was directed
to the litigation now before us are protected by litigation
privilege, subject to the rules as to discovery of evidence and
witnesses. Similarly, any contacts with third parties reported on
by Bourret would be protected.
[57] The Divisional Court refers to the &#147;float book and
additional time sheets&#148; together with the video. It is unclear on
the record before us what was delivered by Pilotte to Eryou but I
will assume it was these three items, two of which were copies or
originals of documents taken from the motel. None of these were
created or prepared for the purpose of litigation and so, on the
principles enunciated earlier in these reasons, they cannot
qualify for any form of privilege in the hands of any of Eryou,
General Accident, or Pilotte.
[58] The statement taken by Eryou from Pilotte is protected by
litigation privilege in the hands of Eryou, again subject to the
discovery rules, but the copy delivered to Pilotte must be
considered separately. It is clear that Pilotte did not at that
time contemplate litigation. In my view, however, he was closely
enough aligned with General Accident in seeing his evidence
pressed forward against Chrusz to protect  Eryou against a waiver
of his client&#146;s litigation privilege. See, in this respect,
United States v. American Telephone, supra. There was nothing
inconsistent in giving a copy of a statement to this witness and
maintaining privilege against the adversary. This was especially
so when a promise of confidentiality was requested.
[59] As closely as he was aligned in interest to General
Accident, I do not consider that Pilotte acquired a common
interest privilege. In all of the examples cited by Lord Denning
in Buttes, there is an actual contemplation of litigation shared
by individuals against a common adversary. Pilotte was merely a
witness who was under no apparent threat of litigation. If events
had proceeded in the normal course without a counterclaim and he
was called as a witness at trial he would have no more reason to
refuse production of the statement than any witness to a motor
vehicle accident who has been provided with a written statement
to refresh his or her memory before giving evidence. The cross-
examiner would be entitled to its production and claims of
litigation privilege would be hollow.
[60] The fact that Pilotte became a party to the counterclaim did
not change the status  of this statement in his hands. It was not
created for this litigation and is simply a relevant piece of
factual information that came to counsel with the original brief.</pre>
        <pre>Conclusion</pre>
        <pre>[61] I would set aside the orders below and in their place direct
production as indicated in these reasons. The parties are  better
able than I to be specific as to particular communications and if
there  are disagreements these can be  resolved on settlement  of
the order.
[62] Costs throughout should be to the appellants on the basis of
a single counsel fee against the respondent General Accident.

DOHERTY J.A. (Dissenting in part):

The Issues:</pre>
        <pre>[63]  This  already  prolonged  litigation  is  stalled  at   the
discovery  stage  while the parties argue  over  the  appellants&#146;
right  to  production  of  documents in  the  possession  of  the
respondents.   Most  of  these documents were  generated  in  the
course  of an investigation conducted on behalf of the respondent
insurers into the origins of a fire at the appellants&#146; hotel. The
respondents  resist  production  claiming  both  client-solicitor
privilege and litigation privilege.
[64] The appellants raise three issues:</pre>
        <ul>
          <li><pre>    Are  communications between an appraiser and the  insurers&#146;
  solicitor protected from disclosure to the appellants by either
  client-solicitor privilege or litigation privilege?</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><pre>    Is  a  transcript of a statement made under  oath  by  Deny
  Pilotte on May 23, 1995 to the lawyer for the insurers (the &quot;May
  23rd  statement&quot;) protected against production by the insurers&#146;
  litigation privilege?</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>     Is  a copy of the May 23rd statement that was given to  Mr.
  Pilotte&#146;s lawyer by the lawyer for the insurers protected against
  production  by  Mr. Pilotte by either the insurers'  litigation
  privilege or Mr. Pilotte&#146;s litigation privilege?</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>[65] I  have  had  the  opportunity  of  reading  the  reasons  of  my
colleagues,  Carthy  and  Rosenberg  JJ.A.  I  agree  with  their
conclusions on the first and third issue. I respectfully  dissent
from  their  conclusion  on the second. I  would  hold  that  the
insurers are obliged to produce the statement.
[66] These issues bring to the forefront two antithetical
principles, both of which are accepted as fundamental to the
civil litigation process. One principle, the right to full and
timely discovery of the opposing party&#146;s case, rests on the
premise that full access to all the facts on both sides of a
lawsuit facilitates the early and just resolution of that suit.
The other principle, the right of a party to maintain the
confidentiality of client-solicitor communications, and sometimes
communications involving third parties, rests on the equally
fundamental tenet that the confidentiality of those
communications is essential to the maintenance of a just and
effective justice system. The tension between the two principles
is described by Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. Gruenke (1991), 67 C.C.C.
(3d) 289 at 305:
          </pre>
        <pre>               The prima facie protection for solicitor-client
          communications is based on the fact that the relationship and the
          communications between solicitor-and-client are essential to the
          effective operation of the legal system. Such communications are
          inextricably linked with the very system which desires the
          disclosure of the communication&#133;.</pre>
        <pre>[67]  In attempting to reconcile these principles, I do not start
from the premise that one principle, access to all the facts,  is
a  good  thing in that it promotes the search for truth and  that
the  other principle, confidentiality, is a necessary evil to  be
tolerated  only  in the clearest of situations.  Both  principles
have  a positive value to the community and individuals, and when
viewed  from  a  broad  perspective,  both  serve  the  goal   of
ascertaining  truth  by  means  which  are  consistent  with  the
important  societal  values of fairness,  personal  autonomy  and
access to justice.

The Facts:</pre>
        <pre>[68] The appellants (&quot;Chrusz&quot;) are the owners of a hotel property
in  Thunder  Bay. The respondent insurers insured  that  property
against  fire  loss.  The respondent, General Accident  Assurance
Company  (&quot;General  Accident&quot;),  is  the  lead  insurer  and  has
carriage of this litigation. For ease of reference, I will  refer
only   to  General  Accident  when  speaking  of  the  respondent
insurers.  The respondent, Deny Pilotte, was employed  by  Chrusz
between  July 1994 and January 1995 as the manager of  the  hotel
property.  The respondent, John Bourret, is a claims adjuster  in
the  employ of the respondent, C.K. Alexander Insurance Adjusters
Ltd.
[69] On November 15, 1994, a fire caused extensive damage to the
Chrusz hotel. Mr. M. Cook, the senior claims examiner for General
Accident, immediately retained Mr. Bourret to investigate the
circumstances surrounding the fire. On November 16, 1994, Mr.
Bourret reported to Mr. Cook that &#147;the fire may have been
deliberately set and that arson was suspected.&#148;1  His suspicion
was based on the finding of traces of an accelerant in the bar
area of the hotel. That part of the hotel had been leased by
Chrusz to a tenant.
[70] On November 16, 1994, upon being informed of the possibility
of arson, Mr. Cook retained Mr. David Eryou, a barrister and
solicitor, &#147;for the purpose of determining any and all issues
relating to the loss occasioned to the insured premises.&#148;  The
retainer extended to &#147;what type of strategy could be taken with
respect to the proof of loss when it was submitted by the insured
party, and general legal advice on processing of the claim as
long as the file was open.&#148;  On the same day, Mr. Cook told Mr.
Bourret that Mr. Eryou had been retained and that Mr. Bourret
&#147;was to investigate the fire loss and report directly to Mr.
Eryou.&#148;  Mr. Bourret confirmed these instructions with Mr. Eryou
and further confirmed that he was to take instructions from Mr.
Eryou in respect of his investigation.
[71] Mr. Bourret prepared some 19 reports between November 1994
and October 1996. The first two reports, dated November 24 and
December 16, 1994, were sent to General Accident with copies to
Mr. Eryou. Beginning with the third report, dated January 12,
1995, the remaining reports were sent to Mr. Eryou. General
Accident did not receive copies of these reports.2
[72] On January 9, 1995, Chrusz delivered a proof of loss
claiming over $1.5 million. Shortly afterwards (no date is
specified in the material), General Accident advanced $100,000.00
in partial payment of the claim. In April 1995, General Accident
agreed to advance a further $505,000.00 to Chrusz and paid some
part of that amount before May 23, 1995. There is no suggestion
in the record that arson, or at least the possible involvement of
Chrusz in any arson, remained a concern when these payments were
made.
[73] On May 23, 1995, matters took a dramatic turn. Mr. Pilotte
made a lengthy statement under oath to Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou.
Although privilege is claimed with respect to the statement,
subsequent events make it clear that Mr. Pilotte made allegations
that Chrusz was attempting to dishonestly inflate his insurance
claim.3  Mr. Pilotte also turned over a videotape and certain
business records to Mr. Eryou. According to Mr. Pilotte, he made
these disclosures on his own initiative to clear his conscience
and for no other reason. Mr. Pilotte had been fired by Chrusz
about four months earlier.
[74] The statement was transcribed. Although Mr. Pilotte did not
request a copy, Mr. Eryou promised to give him one and asked that
he keep it confidential. On June 2, 1995, Mr. Eryou turned a copy
of the transcript of the statement and a copy of the videotape
that he had received from Mr. Pilotte over to Mr. Pilotte's
lawyer.
[75] On June 3, 1995, General Accident commenced an action
against Chrusz alleging fraud, concealment and misrepresentation.
According to the statement of claim, General Accident became
aware of Chrusz's fraud on May 23, 1995, the date on which Mr.
Pilotte made his statement to Mr. Eryou. General Accident sought
a declaration that Chrusz&#146;s insurance policy was void and a
declaration that it was entitled to the return of the money paid
under that policy. It also claimed damages in excess of $1
million.
[76] On November 14, 1995, Chrusz filed a statement of defence
and denied the allegations. Chrusz also counterclaimed against
General Accident, Mr. Bourret and his company. In addition to
claiming that General Accident had breached its obligations under
the insurance contract, Chrusz alleged that General Accident had
improperly relied on the &#147;reckless, uncorroborated and malicious&#148;
statements of Mr. Pilotte. The counterclaim also made a claim
against Mr. Pilotte for defamation. Although not particularized,
the claim would appear to be based in part on the statement made
by Mr. Pilotte on May 23, 1995.

The Privilege Claims Advanced by the Respondents:</pre>
        <pre>[77] The documents over which the insurers claimed privileged are
described in Schedule &#147;B&#148; to the affidavits of documents  of  Mr.
Bourret  and  Mr.  Cook.  Many of the documents  referred  to  in
Schedule &#147;B&#148; of Mr. Bourret&#146;s affidavit are obviously the product
of  his  investigation of the fire (e.g. blueprints, photographs,
drawings,  videotapes, reports). Other documents referred  to  in
that  schedule  are  not  adequately  described  to  permit   any
inference  as  to  their subject matter or purpose  (e.g.  faxes,
handwritten  notes, invoices). Mr. Cook&#146;s affidavit of  documents
refers  to  many  of the same documents as are  set  out  in  Mr.
Bourret&#146;s affidavit, including those which are the product of Mr.
Bourret&#146;s  investigation of the fire. Many of the  documents  set
out in Schedule &#147;B&#148; to Mr. Cook&#146;s affidavit are also described so
generically as to not allow any inference as to their content  or
purpose.
[78] General Accident contended that communications directly
between Mr. Cook and Mr. Eryou were protected by client-solicitor
privilege. It further contended that client-solicitor privilege
extended to communications between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou
because Mr. Bourret had been designated by General Accident as
its agent for the purposes of those communications with Mr.
Eryou. Alternatively, General Accident claimed that
communications between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou were protected
by litigation privilege in that arson was suspected and
litigation contemplated prior to any of those communications
taking place.
[79] A transcript of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s May 23rd statement was listed
in Schedule &#147;B&#148; of the affidavits of Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou.
In the affidavits they resisted production of the transcript
alleging both client-solicitor privilege and litigation
privilege. On a motion before Kurisko J. the claim was limited to
one of litigation privilege. The affidavits asserted that the
transcript had been prepared &#147;for the dominant purpose of aiding
in the conduct of this litigation at a time when litigation was
threatened, anticipated or outstanding.&#148;</pre>
        <pre>The Rulings Below:</pre>
        <pre>[80]  The reasons of Kurisko J. are reported at (1997), 34 O.R.
(3d)  354, 17 C.P.C. (4th) 284, 48 C.C.L.I. (2d) 207. The reasons
of the Divisional Court are reported at ((1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 790.
[81] Mr. Justice Kurisko held that the direct communications
between Mr. Eryou and Mr. Cook are protected by client-solicitor
privilege.
[82] The Divisional Court did not address this aspect of Kurisko
J.'s order. It is common ground on this appeal that those
communications are privileged.
[83] Kurisko J. held that the communications between Mr. Eryou
and Mr. Bourret are not protected by client-solicitor privilege.
He further held that any claim to litigation privilege over those
communications based on the possibility of arson expired when
arson ceased to be a concern. He concluded that arson was no
longer an issue by the time the insurers advanced some
$100,000.00 to the appellants shortly after January 9, 1995.
Finally, Kurisko J. concluded that litigation became imminent
upon receipt of Mr. Pilotte's statement on May 23, 1995. He held
that communications between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou after that
date are protected by litigation privilege.
[84] The Divisional Court held that, from the time Mr. Eryou was
retained on November 16, 1994, communications between Mr. Bourret
and Mr. Eryou were made for the purpose of giving and obtaining
legal advice. Overturning Kurisko J. on this issue, the court
ruled that these communications are protected by client-solicitor
privilege just as if the communications had been directly between
Mr. Eryou and General Accident. As the court was satisfied that
all of the communications are protected by client-solicitor
privilege, it did not address the litigation privilege claim.
[85] Kurisko J. next held that the transcript of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s
statement is not privileged. He held that while the transcript
was prima facie subject to litigation privilege in the hands of
General Accident, the privilege was waived when Mr. Eryou made
the unsolicited promise to Mr. Pilotte to provide him with a copy
of the statement. Kurisko J. rejected the contention that Mr.
Pilotte and General Accident had a &#147;common interest&#148; such that
providing Mr. Pilotte with a copy of the transcript of the
statement did not waive General Accident&#146;s claim to litigation
privilege. He further ruled that as Mr. Pilotte did not
anticipate litigation involving him when he made the statement,
he could not rely on litigation privilege.
[86] The Divisional Court disagreed with Kurisko J. on this issue
and held that General Accident&#146;s litigation privilege was not
waived by providing a potential witness with a copy of his own
statement. The court declared that neither the insurers nor Mr.
Pilotte were obliged to produce the transcript of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s
statement.
[87] Kurisko J. also ruled that the materials turned over to Mr.
Eryou by Mr. Pilotte on May 23, 1995 (the videotape and business
records) are not privileged. The Divisional Court agreed. This
conclusion is not challenged on appeal.
The Client-Solicitor Privilege Claim:

a)Generally</pre>
        <pre>[88]   Client-solicitor  privilege  is  the   oldest   and   best
established privilege in our law. It can be traced back some  400
years in English law:  Baker v. Campbell (1983), 153 C.L.R. 52 at
84,  per  Murphy J. (H.C.);  N. Williams &#147;Civil Litigation  Trial
Preparation  in Canada&#148; (1980), 58 Can. Bar Rev. 1 at  37-38.  In
Gruenke,  supra,  at  304-6  Lamer  C.J.C.  referred  to  client-
solicitor privilege as one of the few blanket or class privileges
known  to  our  law.  The  Chief Justice distinguished  class  or
blanket privilege from other privileges which are determined on a
case-by-case  basis.  The  former  operate  (subject  to  certain
exceptions)  whenever  the  criteria  for  their  existence   are
established.  The operation of the latter depend on the  totality
of  the  circumstances of each case. Obviously, the operation  of
class  or  blanket  privileges can result  in  the  exclusion  of
valuable  evidence. No doubt this explains why there are  so  few
class privileges recognized in our law.
[89] The criteria for the existence of client-solicitor privilege
are well-established. In Descôteaux v. Mierzwiniski (1982), 70
C.C.C. (2d) 385 at 398 (S.C.C.), and again very recently in R. v.
Shirose (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 288 (S.C.C.), the Supreme
Court of Canada adopted the following description of client-
solicitor privilege by Wigmore (8 Wigmore, Evidence, § 2292,
McNaughton Rev. 1961):
          </pre>
        <pre>               Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional
          legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications
          relating to that purpose, made in confidence by the client, are
          at his instance permanently protected from disclosure by himself
          or by the legal adviser, except the protection be waived.</pre>
        <pre>[90]  The  privilege extends to communications in whatever  form,
but  does  not extend to facts which may be referred to in  those
communications if they are otherwise discoverable  and  relevant:
Susan  Hosiery Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1969] 2 Ex. C.R. 27 at 34;  Grant
v.  Downs (1976), 135 C.L.R. 674 at 686 (H.C.);  R. Manes and  M.
Silver,  Solicitor-Client  Privilege in  Canadian  Law  (Markham:
Butterworths, 1993) at 127-33. For example, even if Mr. Bourret&#146;s
reports are privileged as a defendant by counter-claim, he may be
examined for discovery on steps he, or others on his behalf, took
to  investigate  the  fire as well as on  observations  made  and
information gathered in the course of that investigation.
[91] The rationale underlying the privilege informs the
perimeters of that privilege. It is often justified on the basis
that without client-solicitor privilege, clients and lawyers
could not engage in the frank and full disclosure that is
essential to giving and receiving  effective legal advice. Even
with the privilege in place, there is a natural reluctance to
share the &#147;bad parts&#148; of one&#146;s story with another person. Without
the privilege, that reluctance would become a compulsion in many
cases:  Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia (1876), 2 Ch. D. 644
at 649;  Smith v. Jones (1999), 22 C.R. (5th) 203 at 217, per
Cory J.;   J.W. Strong, ed., McCormick on Evidence, 4th ed. (St.
Paul, Minn.:  West Publishing Co. 1992), vol. 1 at 353.
[92] While this utilitarian purpose is central to the existence
of the privilege, its rationale goes beyond the promotion of
absolute candor in discussions between a client and her lawyer.
The privilege is an expression of our commitment to both personal
autonomy and access to justice. Personal autonomy depends in part
on an individual&#146;s ability to control the dissemination of
personal information and to maintain confidences. Access to
justice depends in part on the ability to obtain effective legal
advice. The surrender of the former should not be the cost of
obtaining the latter. By maintaining client-solicitor privilege,
we promote both personal autonomy and access to justice:  Geffen
et al. v. Goodman et al. (1991), 81 D.L.R. (4th) 211 at 231-32,
per Wilson J. (S.C.C.);  Solosky v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C.
(2d) 495 at 510 (S.C.C.);  Descôteaux v. Mierzwiniski, supra, at
413-14;  R. v. Beharriell (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 92 at 107-8,
per L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. (concurring) (S.C.C.);  R. v. Shirose,
supra, at 288;  Baker v. Campbell, supra, at 118-20, per Deane J.
[93] The privilege also serves to promote the adversarial process
as an effective and just means for resolving disputes within our
society. In that process, the client looks to the skilled lawyer
to champion her cause against that of her adversaries. The client
justifiably demands the undivided loyalty of her lawyer. Without
client-solicitor privilege, the lawyer could not serve that role
and provide that undivided loyalty. As the authors of McCormick,
supra, write at pp. 316-17:
          </pre>
        <pre>               At the present time it seems most realistic to portray the
          attorney-client privilege as supported in part by its traditional
          utilitarian justification, and in part by the integral role it is
          perceived to play in the adversary system itself. Our system of
          litigation casts the lawyer in the role of fighter for the party
          whom he represents. A strong tradition of loyalty attaches to the
          relationship of attorney and client, and this tradition would be
          outraged by routine examination of the lawyer as to the client&#146;s
          confidential disclosures regarding professional business. To the
          extent that the evidentiary privilege, then, is integrally
          related to an entire code of professional conduct, it is futile
          to envision drastic curtailment of the privilege without
          substantial modification of the underlying ethical system to
          which the privilege is merely ancillary. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
        <pre>[94]  In  summary, I see the privilege as serving  the  following
purposes:   promoting  frank communications  between  client  and
solicitor   where  legal  advice  is  being  sought   or   given,
facilitating access to justice, recognizing the inherent value of
personal  autonomy and affirming the efficacy of the  adversarial
process.  Each of these purposes should guide the application  of
the established criteria when determining the existence of client-
solicitor privilege in specific fact situations.
[95] The adjudication of claims to client-solicitor privilege
must be fact sensitive in the sense that the determination must
depend on the evidence adduced to support the claim and on the
context in which the claim is made. A claim to client-solicitor
privilege in the context of litigation is in fact a claim that an
exception should be made to the most basic rule of evidence which
dictates that all relevant evidence is admissible. It is
incumbent on the party asserting the privilege to establish an
evidentiary basis for it. Broad privilege claims which blanket
many documents, some of which are described in the vaguest way,
will often fail, not because the privilege has been strictly
construed, but because the party asserting the privilege has
failed to meet its burden:  see Shaughnessy Golf &amp; Country Club
v. Drake International Inc. et al. (1986), 26 D.L.R. (4th) 298 at
302-4 and 307-8, per Esson J.A. (B.C.C.A.).
[96] It is also necessary to consider the context of the claim,
by which I mean the circumstances in which the privilege is
claimed. For example, in this case, the insurer claims client-
solicitor privilege against its insured in part in respect of the
product of its investigation of a possible claim by the insured
under its policy. The preexisting relationship of the insured and
insurer and the mutual obligations of good faith owed by each to
the other must be considered in determining the validity of the
insurer&#146;s assertion that it intended to keep information about
the investigation confidential vis-à-vis its insured. The
confidentiality claim cannot be approached as if the parties were
strangers to each other.
[97] The confidentiality of the communications is an underlying
component of each of the purposes which justify client-solicitor
privilege. In McCormick, supra, at 333, it is said:
          </pre>
        <pre>               It is of the essence of the privilege that it is limited to
          those communications which the client either expressly made
          confidential or which he could reasonably assume under the
          circumstances would be understood by the attorney as so intended.</pre>
        <pre>[98]  The centrality of confidentiality to the existence  of  the
privilege helps make my point that the assessment of a  claim  to
client-solicitor  privilege  must be  contextual.  Sometimes  the
relationship  between the party claiming the  privilege  and  the
party  seeking disclosure will be relevant to determining whether
the  communication was confidential. For example, the  reciprocal
obligations  of an insured and an insurer to act  in  good  faith
towards each other are well-established:  Canadian Indemnity  Co.
v.  Canadian Johns-Manville Co., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 549  at  620-21;
Coronation  Insurance Co. v. Taku Air Transport  Ltd.,  [1991]  3
S.C.R.  622  at 636. I have difficulty reconciling  these  mutual
obligations  with  the  contention that an insurer  automatically
intends  to maintain confidentiality as against the insured  over
the  fruits of its investigation of an incident giving rise to  a
possible claim under a policy of insurance. I stress that I refer
only  to  the fruits of the insurer&#146;s investigation  and  not  to
other  topics  which may be the subject matter of  communications
between the insurer and its counsel.
[99] Unlike some courts, (eg. Summerville Belkin Industries Ltd.
v. Brocklesby Transport et al., [1985] 6 W.W.R. 85 at 88
(B.C.S.C.)), I do not accept that the mere possibility of a claim
under an insurance policy entitles an insurer to treat its client
as a potential adversary from whom it intends to keep
confidential information concerning its investigation of the
claim. I prefer the view which assumes that the insurer &#147;fairly
and open mindedly&#148; investigates potential claims:  see Blackstone
v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, [1944] O.R. 328 at 334, per
Robertson C.J.O. (C.A.);  Walters v. Toronto Transit Commission
(1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 635 at 637-38 (H.C.). If an insurer asserts
a privilege over the product of its investigation, it must
demonstrate that it intended to keep that information
confidential from its client. The mere possibility of a claim
will not establish that intention.
[100]     Chrusz accepts that all communications directly between
Mr. Eryou and General Accident are protected by client-solicitor
privilege. While I accept that concession for the purposes of
this appeal, I would not want to be taken as endorsing it.
[101]     General Accident relies on Mr. Bourret&#146;s suspicion of
arson as providing the necessary basis for the inference that the
communications between Mr. Eryou and General Accident prior to
May 23, 1995 were intended to be kept confidential from Chrusz. I
can accept that the suspicion described in the affidavits
provided a basis, as of November 16, 1994, for concluding that
the initial communications were intended to be kept confidential
from Chrusz. General Accident takes the position that once such
suspicion was established, it continued as long as the
investigation continued. I cannot agree. It is up to General
Accident to establish a proper evidentiary basis for a finding
that all of the communications referred to in the affidavits were
intended to be confidential as against Chrusz. The record tells
me only that General Accident had reason to suspect arson as of
November 16, 1994. It would certainly seem that any suspicion had
disappeared by the time the insurers advanced $100,000.00 on the
policy shortly after January 9, 1995. To the extent that the
inference of intended confidentiality turned on the existence of
the suspicion of arson, the onus was on General Accident to
establish that the suspicion continued over the period for which
it claims privilege. I am not prepared to assume that the
suspicion continued from the day after the fire until some
indeterminate point in the future.
[102]     Communications between Mr. Eryou and General Accident
after the May 23, 1995 statement do not raise the same concerns.
The fraud allegations against Mr. Chrusz made in that statement
provide a firm basis from which to infer an intention to keep
communications between Mr. Eryou and General Accident
confidential.
(b)Communications between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou</pre>
        <pre>[103]       Assuming  that  the  communications  between  General
Accident   and   Mr.  Eryou  are  protected  by  client-solicitor
privilege,  I  turn  to  the question of  whether  Mr.  Bourret&#146;s
communications  with  Mr.  Eryou  are  also  privileged.  General
Accident contends that the communications are protected by client-
solicitor  privilege and/or litigation privilege.  At this  stage
of  my  reasons,  I  am concerned only with the  client-solicitor
privilege claim and not the litigation privilege claim. There  is
also  no  distinction  to  be drawn between  communications  made
before May 23, 1995 and those made after that date when assessing
the client-solicitor privilege claim. That date becomes important
when the litigation privilege claim is considered.
[104]     Claims for client-solicitor privilege, unlike claims
for litigation privilege, are usually framed in terms of
communications directly between a client and a solicitor. It is,
however, well-settled that client-solicitor privilege can extend
to communications between a solicitor or a client and a third
party:4 Bunbury v. Bunbury (1839), 48 E.R. 1146;  Russell v.
Jackson (1851), 68 E.R. 558;  Hooper v. Gumm (1862), 70 E.R.
1199;  Wheeler v. Le Marchant (1881), 17 Ch. D. 675 at 682, per

Smith v. Jones, supra, at 208-210, per Major J. (dissenting);
Attorney-Client Privilege, 139 A.L.R. 1250.
[105]      The  case  law  involving claims  to  client-solicitor
privilege over third party communications is not extensive. It is
also   relatively   undeveloped   beyond   a   recognition   that
communications made to or by third parties who are classified  as
&#147;agents&#148; of the lawyer or the client will be protected by client-
solicitor  privilege:   see  Manes and  Silver,  Solicitor-Client
Privilege in Canadian Law, supra, at 73-79;  G. Watson and F. Au,
Solicitor-Client  Privilege  and Litigation  Privilege  in  Civil
Litigation (1998), 77 Can. Bar Rev. 315 at 346-349.
[106]     The authorities do, however, establish two principles:</pre>
        <ul>
          <li><pre>    not every communication by a third party with a lawyer which
  facilitates or assists in giving or receiving legal  advice  is
  protected by client-solicitor privilege;  and</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>     where  the third party serves as a channel of communication
  between the client and solicitor, communications to or from the
  third party by the client or solicitor will be protected by the
  privilege as long as those communications meet the criteria for
  the existence of the privilege.</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>[107]       These   two  principles  assist  in   resolving   the
applicability of client-solicitor privilege to the communications
between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou, but neither provide a complete
answer.  In  my view, this case requires the court  to  determine
when  a  third party&#146;s communication will be protected by client-
solicitor  privilege  even  though  the  third  party  cannot  be
described  merely  as a channel of communication  or  conduit  of
information between the solicitor and client. I will consider the
two  established  principles and then will turn to  the  approach
that  I  would  take  to  determine  whether  the  third  party&#146;s
communications  to the solicitor in this case  are  protected  by
client-solicitor  privilege even though the third  party  is  not
merely a channel of communication.
[108]     Wheeler v. Le Marchant, supra illustrates the first
principle that communications to or by a third party are not
protected by client-solicitor privilege merely because they
assist the solicitor in formulating legal advice for a client. In
that case, the client retained a solicitor for advice concerning
a certain piece of property. The solicitor in turn retained a
surveyor to give him information concerning that property. In
subsequent litigation involving a claim for specific performance,
the client contended that the information passed from the
surveyor to the lawyer was protected by client-solicitor
privilege. No litigation was contemplated at the time the
surveyor provided the information to the solicitor. The client&#146;s
claim succeeded initially, but on appeal it was unanimously held
that the communications between the surveyor and the solicitor
were not protected by client-solicitor privilege. Cotton L.J.
concluded at p. 684:
          </pre>
        <pre>               &#133; It is said that as communications between a client and his
          legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice are
          privileged, therefore any communication between the
          representatives of the client and the solicitor must also be
          privileged. That is a fallacious use of the word
          &#147;representatives.&#148;  If the representative is a person employed as
          an agent on the part of the client to obtain the legal advice of
          the solicitor, of course he stands in exactly the same position
          as the client as regards protection, and his communications with
          the solicitor stand in the same position as the communications of
          his principal with the solicitor. But these persons were not
          representatives in that sense. They were representatives in this
          sense, that they were employed on behalf of the clients, the
          Defendants, to do certain work, but that work was not the
          communicating with the solicitor to obtain legal advice.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
        <pre>[109]      Wheeler has not escaped academic criticism:  see  J.D.
Wilson, Privilege in Experts&#146; Working Papers (1997), 76 Can.  Bar
Rev.  346  at  361-365.  But  it has received  repeated  judicial
approval here and in other common law jurisdictions:  see Learoyd
v.  Halifax Joint Stock Banking Co., [1893] 1 Ch. D. 686 at  690-
91;  Calcraft v. Guest, [1898] 1 Q.B. 759 at 762-3 (C.A.);  Susan
Hosiery  Ltd.  v.  M.N.R., supra, at 31-32;   R.  v.  Littlechild
(1979),  51 C.C.C. (2d) 406 at 411-12 (Alta.C.A.);  C-C  Bottlers
Ltd. v. Lion Nathan Ltd., [1993] 2 N.Z.L.R. 445 at 447-48 (H.C.).
[110]     The second principle described above extends client-
solicitor privilege to communications by or to a third party who
serves as a line of communication between the client and
solicitor. Thus, where a third party serves as a messenger,
translator or amanuensis, communications to or from the party by
the client or solicitor will be protected. In these cases the
third party simply carries information from the client to the
lawyer or the lawyer to the client.
[111]     The privilege also extends to communications and
circumstances where the third party employs an expertise in
assembling information provided by the client and in explaining
that information to the solicitor. In doing so, the third party
makes the information relevant to the legal issues on which the
solicitor&#146;s advice is sought. For example, in Susan Hosiery Ltd.
v. M.N.R., supra, the client&#146;s financial advisers who
communicated with the lawyer were intimately familiar with the
client&#146;s business. At the client&#146;s instruction, they met with the
solicitor to convey information concerning the business affairs
of the client. They were also instructed to discuss possible
arrangements of those affairs presumably to minimize tax
consequences. In a very real sense, the accountants served as
translators, assembling the necessary information from the client
and putting the client&#146;s affairs in terms which could be
understood by the lawyer. In addition, they served as a conduit
of advice from the lawyer to the client and as a conduit of
instructions from the client to the lawyer.
[112]     A second example of the extension of the privilege to
cases involving expert third party intermediaries is found in
Smith v. Jones, supra. Jones was charged with aggravated sexual
assault. His lawyer decided that a forensic psychiatric report
could assist in Jones&#146; defence or on sentence. Counsel retained
Dr. Smith, a psychiatrist, to speak with Jones and prepare a
report. The question of whether the communications from Jones to
Smith were protected by client-solicitor privilege arose in a
proceeding subsequently initiated by Dr. Smith.
[113]     The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada (per Cory
J. at 217) assumed that the communications were protected by
client-solicitor privilege and proceeded to consider whether the
&#147;public safety&#148; exception to that privilege warranted disclosure
of the communications.
[114]     Major J., in dissent, (Lamer C.J.C. and Binnie J.
concurring) did address the applicability of client-solicitor
privilege to the communications between Jones and Smith. He said,
at p. 210:
          </pre>
        <pre>               Courts in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the
          United States have all concluded that client communications with
          third party experts retained by counsel for the purpose of
          preparing their defence are protected by solicitor-client
          privilege.</pre>
        <pre>[115]      In so holding, Major J. referred with approval to  the
following  passage  from  the  judgment  of  Traynor  J.  in  San
Francisco  (City) v. Superior Court, 281 P. 2d 26  at  31  (1951)
(California Supreme Court):
          </pre>
        <pre>            The privilege of confidence would be a vain one unless its
          exercise could be thus delegated. A communication, then by any
          form of agency employed or set in motion by the client is within
          the privilege.
                                </pre>
        <pre>                                  &#133;.
          </pre>
        <pre>                Thus, when communication by a client to
          his attorney regarding his physical or mental
          condition  requires  the  assistance   of   a
          physician to interpret the client&#146;s condition
          to  the attorney, the client may submit to an
          examination  by  the physician  without  fear
          that  the latter will be compelled to  reveal
          the   information  disclosed.  [Emphasis   in
          original].</pre>
        <pre>[116]      In my view, Traynor J. was referring to situations  in
which  the  third party&#146;s expertise is required to interpret  for
the solicitor information provided by the client to the solicitor
so  that the solicitor can understand that information and assess
its  significance  to the legal issues that  the  solicitor  must
address.  In  such a case, the psychiatrist, like the accountants
in  Susan  Hosiery,  supra, assembles and translates  information
provided  by the client so that the solicitor can understand  the
nature and legal significance of it. Viewed in this way, the role
of  the  psychiatrist or the accountants is akin  to  that  of  a
translator. Indeed, in the American authority relied on by  Major
J.,  Traynor J. analogized, at p. 31, the psychiatrist&#146;s role  to
that  of an interpreter, or messenger. In such cases, information
is  imparted  from  the  client  to  the  solicitor  through  the
assistance of a third party. As Traynor J. said at p.  31,  these
third  parties  act as &#147;agents of transmission&#148; of communications
between the client and the lawyer.
[117]     While the conclusion that Jones&#146; communications with
Smith were protected by client-solicitor privilege is sustainable
under the line of authority pertaining to third parties who serve
as conduits of information from the client to the solicitor, I
think one must be careful in assessing whether  the dissenting
reasons of Major J. have an impact on cases where the claim for
client-solicitor privilege involving third parties is raised in
circumstances where litigation is neither ongoing nor
contemplated. Jones had been charged with sexual assault when he
spoke to Dr. Smith and the communications were in aid of Dr.
Smith&#146;s preparation of a psychiatric report to be used by Jones&#146;
counsel in his defence or on sentencing. Similarly, in R. v.
Perron (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 108 (Que. C.A.), an authority
heavily relied on by Major J., the communications with the
psychiatrist were made in furtherance of counsel&#146;s preparation of
a defence to outstanding charges. In his reasons, Major J.
specifically refers on at least two occasions to communications
with third party experts by a client or a solicitor made &#147;for the
purpose of preparing their defence&#148; (at pp. 209 and 210). While
Major J. spoke in terms of client-solicitor privilege, he in fact
limited his observations to circumstances in which litigation
privilege would apply. It is unclear whether Major J. used the
phrase &#147;solicitor-client privilege&#148; in the same sense that I use
it or whether he used the term in a way that conflates client-
solicitor privilege with litigation privilege. As Watson and Au
observe in Solicitor-Client Privilege and Litigation Privilege in
Civil Litigation, supra, at 333-35, there is considerable
confusion with respect to terminology in this area of the law.
[118]     I would not describe Mr. Bourret as a channel of
communication between General Accident and Mr. Eryou. Nor would I
characterize him as translating or interpreting information
provided by General Accident. Mr. Bourret was not passing
information from General Accident on to Mr. Eryou, but rather was
gathering information from sources extraneous to General Accident
and passing that information on to General Accident and/or Mr.
Eryou. Similarly, Mr. Bourret was not a channel of communication
from General Accident to Mr. Eryou, but rather was a channel of
communication from the outside world to Mr. Eryou. His position
was very different from that of the financial
advisers/accountants referred to in Susan Hosiery Ltd. It was
much closer to the position of the surveyors in Wheeler. Like the
surveyors, he was retained to gather information from sources
extraneous to the client and pass that information on to the
solicitor so the solicitor could give legal advice to the client.
[119]     It remains to be determined whether the communications
are protected by client-solicitor privilege even though Mr.
Bourret cannot be described as a conduit of information from the
client to the solicitor. Kurisko J., taking his lead from the
case law, approached the issue by attempting to characterize the
legal nature of the relationship between Mr. Bourret and General
Accident. He held that if Mr. Bourret&#146;s relationship to General
Accident were that of an agent, the communications were
privileged. He looked to the distinctions drawn in the general
law of agency between agents, independent contractors and
employers and decided that Mr. Bourret was not an agent for the
purposes of the communications with Mr. Eryou.
[120]     I agree with the Divisional Court that the
applicability of client-solicitor privilege to communications
involving a third party should not be determined by deciding
whether Mr. Bourret is properly described as an agent under the
general law of agency. I think that the applicability of client-
solicitor privilege to third party communications in
circumstances where the third party cannot be described as a
channel of communication between the solicitor and client should
depend on the true nature of the function that the third party
was retained to perform for the client. If the third party&#146;s
retainer extends to a function which is essential to the
existence or operation of the client-solicitor relationship, then
the privilege should cover any communications which are in
furtherance of that function and which meet the criteria for
client-solicitor privilege.
[121]     Client-solicitor privilege is designed to facilitate
the seeking and giving of legal advice. If a client authorizes a
third party to direct a solicitor to act on behalf of the client,
or if the client authorizes the third party to seek legal advice
from the solicitor on behalf of the client, the third party is
performing a function which is central to the client-solicitor
relationship. In such circumstances, the third party should be
seen as standing in the shoes of the client for the purpose of
communications referable to those parts of the third party&#146;s
retainer.
[122]     If the third party is authorized only to gather
information from outside sources and pass it on to the solicitor
so that the solicitor might advise the client, or if the third
party is retained to act on legal instructions from the solicitor
(presumably given after the client has instructed the solicitor),
the third party&#146;s function is not essential to the maintenance or
operation of the client-solicitor relationship and should not be
protected.
[123]     In drawing this distinction, I return to the seminal
case of Wheeler v. La Marchant, supra. In distinguishing between
representatives of a client or a solicitor whose communications
attracted the privilege and those whose communications did not,
Cotton L.J. referred to representatives employed by a client &#147;to
obtain the legal advice of the solicitor.&#148;  A representative
empowered by the client to obtain that advice stood in the same
position as the client. A representative retained only to perform
certain work for the client relating to the obtaining of legal
advice did not assume the position of client for the purpose of
client-solicitor privilege.
[124]     I find support for my position in the definition of
client-solicitor privilege adopted in Rule 502 of the American
Revised Uniform Evidence Rules (1986 amendment). The rule
recognizes that in some situations, communications from third
parties to the solicitor of a client should be protected by
client-solicitor privilege. Rule 502(2) defines &quot;representative
of the client&quot; as:
          </pre>
        <pre>               &#133; one having authority to obtain professional legal
          services, or to act on advice rendered pursuant thereto, on
          behalf of the client.5</pre>
        <pre>[125]      The definition ties the existence of the privilege  to
the third party&#146;s authority to obtain legal services or to act on
legal  advice on behalf of the client. In either case  the  third
party  is  empowered by the client to perform a function  on  the
client&#146;s   behalf  which  is  integral  to  the  client-solicitor
function. The agent does more than assemble information  relevant
to the legal problem at hand.
[126]     This functional approach to applying client-solicitor
privilege to communications by a third party is sound from a
policy perspective. It allows the client to use third parties to
communicate with counsel for the purpose of seeking legal advice
and giving legal instructions in confidence. It promotes the
client&#146;s access to justice and does nothing to infringe the
client&#146;s autonomy by opening her personal affairs to the scrutiny
of others. Lastly, it does not impair the lawyer&#146;s ability to
give his undivided loyalty to the client as demanded by the
adversarial process. Where the client retains the authority to
seek legal advice and give legal instructions, these policy
considerations do not favour extending client-solicitor privilege
to communications with those who perform services which are
incidental to the seeking and obtaining of legal advice.
[127]     The position of the Divisional Court provides incentive
to a client who has the necessary means to direct all parties
retained by the client to deposit any information they gather
with the client's lawyer so as to shield the results of their
investigations with client-solicitor privilege. The privilege
would thus extend beyond communications made for the purpose of
giving and receiving legal advice to all information relevant to
a legal problem which is conveyed at a client&#146;s request by a
third party to the lawyer. This view of client-solicitor
privilege confuses the unquestioned obligation of a lawyer to
maintain  confidentiality of information acquired in the course
of a retainer with the client&#146;s much more limited right to
foreclose access by opposing parties to information which is
material to the litigation. Client-solicitor privilege is
intended to allow the client and lawyer to communicate in
confidence. It is not intended, as one author has suggested, to
protect &#147;&#133;all communications or other material deemed useful by
the lawyer to properly advise his client&#133;&#148;:  Wilson, Privilege In
Experts&#146; Working Papers, supra, at 371. While this generous view
of client-solicitor privilege would create what clients might
regard as an ideal environment of confidentiality, it would deny
opposing parties and the courts access to much information which
could be very important in determining where the truth lies in
any given case.
[128]     I make one further observation. If the Divisional
Court&#146;s view of client-solicitor privilege is correct, litigation
privilege would become virtually redundant because most third
party communications would be protected by client-solicitor
privilege. To so enlarge client-solicitor privilege is
inconsistent with the broad discovery rights established under
contemporary pre-trial regimes, which have clearly limited the
scope of litigation privilege. The effect of that limitation
would be all but lost if client-solicitor privilege were to be
extended to communications with any third party who the client
chose to anoint as his agent for the purpose of communicating
with the client&#146;s lawyer.
[129]     The true function assigned to Mr. Bourret by General
Accident must be determined from the entirety of the
circumstances. Mr. Bourret&#146;s or General Accident&#146;s
characterization of his function is not determinative of one of
the very issues that the motion judge was called upon to decide:
Hamalainen v. Sippola (1991), 62 B.C.L.R. (2d) 254 at 259
(B.C.C.A.). Mr. Bourret was initially retained to investigate the
fire and report to General Accident. On November 16, 1994, after
arson was suspected, his retainer changed in one respect only. He
was to conduct the same investigation, but he was to deliver his
reports to Mr. Eryou instead of General Accident.6  The
affidavits of Mr. Bourret and Mr. Cook indicate that Mr. Bourret
was to report the results of his investigations to Mr. Eryou and
take instructions from him. The affidavits do not suggest that
Mr. Bourret was given any authority to seek legal advice from Mr.
Eryou on behalf of General Accident, or any authority to give
instructions on legal matters on behalf of General Accident to
Mr. Eryou. His authority did not reach inside the client-
solicitor relationship between Mr. Eryou and General Accident.
Instead, Mr. Bourret's function was to educate Mr. Eryou as to
the circumstances surrounding the fire so that General Accident
could receive the benefit of Mr. Eryou&#146;s informed advice and
could instruct Mr. Eryou as to the legal steps to be taken on its
behalf.
[130]     As I read the slim evidence provided by General
Accident, it does not establish that Mr. Bourret&#146;s retainer
extended to any function which could be said to be integral to
the client-solicitor relationship. I would hold that the
communications between Mr. Bourret and Mr. Eryou are not
protected by client-solicitor privilege.

The Litigation Privilege Claims:</pre>
        <pre>[131]     General Accident claims that communications between Mr.
Eryou  and  Mr.  Bourret prior to May 23, 1995 are  protected  by
litigation privilege. It relies on the suspected arson to support
that   claim.  General  Accident  also  contends  that  even   if
communications prior to May 23rd are not protected by  litigation
privilege, communications from that day forward are so  protected
in  the light of the fraud allegations revealed by Mr. Pilotte in
his May 23rd statement.
[132]     The May 23rd statement and the copy provided to Mr.
Pilotte are said by General Accident to be protected by its
litigation privilege. Mr. Pilotte contends that the copy provided
to him is protected by his litigation privilege.
[133]     I agree with Carthy J.A. that the communications
between Mr. Bourret and General Accident and Mr. Eryou before May
23, 1995 are not protected by litigation privilege and that the
communications between those parties from that date forward are
protected by litigation privilege assuming they are not subject
to disclosure under the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure.
[134]     I also agree with much of my colleague&#146;s analysis of
the litigation privilege claim. In particular, I agree with:</pre>
        <ul>
          <li><pre>     his  description  of  the different  rationales  underlying
  client-solicitor privilege and litigation privilege [paras. 22-
  24];</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>     his  conclusion that litigation privilege exists to provide
&quot;a  protected area to facilitate investigation and preparation of
a case for trial by adversarial advocates&quot; [para. 23];</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>    his  assertion that the reach of litigation privilege  must
take cognizance of the broad rules of discovery which are aimed
at  full  disclosure of relevant facts by all  parties  to  the
litigation [paras. 25-28];</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>    his  adoption  of  the  dominant  purpose  test  as  being
consistent with contemporary notions of full pre-trial discovery
[paras. 29-32];</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>    his  conclusion  that  any  litigation  privilege  General
Accident may have had with respect to communications prior to May
23rd disappeared when General Accident no longer suspected Chrusz
of any involvement in arson [paras. 50-54];  and</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>    his conclusion that communications from or to Mr. Bourret by
General Accident and or Mr. Eryou after May 23rd are subject to
litigation privilege assuming they are not subject to disclosure
under the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure [para. 56].</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>[135]      In  the  course  of  his analysis  of  the  litigation
privilege  claim, Carthy J.A. holds that copies of non-privileged
documents  placed  into  a  lawyer&#146;s  brief  in  the  course   of
preparation  for  litigation are never  protected  by  litigation
privilege  [paras. 33-41]. I do not concur in that  part  of  his
analysis.  That issue does not arise directly on this  appeal  as
there  is  no  appeal  from the holding of  Kurisko  J.  and  the
Divisional  Court that the copies of the videotape  and  business
records  provided to Mr. Eryou by Mr. Pilotte are not privileged.
My  colleague  has  addressed  the question,  however,  no  doubt
because of the Divisional Court&#146;s observation at p. 796 that:
          </pre>
        <pre>            It is true that a copy of an original document incorporated by
          a solicitor into his litigation brief becomes privileged, but
          that privilege does not extend to the original.</pre>
        <pre>[136]      Carthy J.A., while acknowledging the line of authority
which  supports  the  position taken  by  the  Divisional  Court,
prefers  the  view  of Craig J.A., in dissent, in  Hodgkinson  v.
Simms et al. (1988), 55 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 594, where Craig J.A.
observed:
          </pre>
        <pre>            I fail to comprehend how original documents which are not
          privileged (because they are not prepared with the dominant
          purpose of actual or anticipated litigation) can become
          privileged simply because counsel makes photostatic copies of the
          documents and puts them in his &#147;brief.&#148;</pre>
        <pre>[137]     I do not disagree with the observation of Craig J.A.  A
non-privileged  document  should  not  become  privileged  merely
because  it is copied and placed in the lawyer&#146;s brief.  I  would
not,  however,  go so far as to say that copies of non-privileged
documents  can  never  properly  be  the  subject  of  litigation
privilege.   In  Nickmar  Pty.  Ltd.  v.  Preservatrice   Skandia
Insurance  Ltd.  (1985), 3 N.S.W.L.R. 44 at  61-62  (N.S.W.S.C.),
Wood J. opined:
          </pre>
        <pre>            In my view, it is incorrect to state, as a general proposition,
          that a copy of an unprivileged document becomes privileged so
          long as it is obtained by a party, or its solicitor, for the sole
          purpose of advice or use in litigation. I think that the result
          in any such case depends on the manner in which the copy or
          extract is made or obtained. If it involves a selective copying
          or results from research or the exercise of skill and knowledge
          on the part of a solicitor, then I consider privilege should
          apply [Lyell v. Kennedy (No. 3) (1884), 27 Ch. D. 1]. Otherwise,
          I see no reason, in principle, why disclosure should be refused
          of copies of documents which can be obtained elsewhere, and in
          respect of which no relationship of confidence, or legal
          profession privilege exists.</pre>
        <pre>[138]      The  review  of  the case law provided  in  Manes  and
Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canadian Law, supra, at 170-
73 suggests to me that Wood J.&#146;s analysis is the appropriate one:
see  also  Commissioner  Australian  Federal  Police  v.  Propend
Finance  Pty. Ltd. (1997), 141 A.L.R. 545 (H.C.). I  would  leave
the question of when, if ever, copies of non-privileged documents
can  be  protected by litigation privilege to a  case  where  the
issue is squarely raised and fully argued.
[139]     I turn now to General Accident&#146;s claim that it is not
required to produce the transcript of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s statement of
May 23rd because it is protected by litigation privilege. Unlike
Carthy J.A., I would hold that the statement is not so protected.
[140]     There is no doubt that the statement meets the
conditions precedent to the operation of litigation privilege in
that it was prepared by counsel in contemplation of litigation
and for the purpose of assisting him in that litigation. The
dominant purpose test is clearly met. From General Accident&#146;s
perspective, the statement is the equivalent of a witness
statement provided by a non-party. Such statements have been held
to be protected by litigation privilege:  Yri-York Ltd. v.
Commercial Union Assurance Co. of Can. et al. (1987), 17 C.P.C.
(2d) 181 at 186 (Ont. H.C.);  Catherwood (Guardian ad litem of)
v. Heinrichs (1995), 17 B.C.L.R. (3d) 326 (B.C.S.C.).
[141]     Nor, in my view, is litigation privilege defeated by
virtue of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s indifference as to whether the statement
was disclosed to others at the time he made it. I agree with the
analysis of Mr. Manes that in the context of litigation
privilege, one is concerned with the confidentiality interest of
the client and not third parties: R. Manes, Judging the
Privilege, a paper presented at the Superior Court Judges
Education Seminar (Ontario), Spring 1999 at 14-19;  see also
Manes and Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canada Law,
supra, at 100-103;  S. Lederman, Commentary:  Discovery-
Production of Documents-Claim of Privilege to Prevent Disclosure
(1976), 54 Can. Bar Rev. 422;  Strauss v. Goldsack (1976), 58
D.L.R. (3d) 397 at 402-403, per McGillivray C.J.A. (dissenting).
General Accident, through Mr. Eryou, expressed a clear intention
that the contents of the statement should not be disclosed to its
potential adversaries.
[142]     I do not think, however, that every document which
satisfies the condition precedent to the operation of litigation
privilege should be protected from disclosure by that privilege.
In my view, the privilege should be recognized as a qualified one
which can be overridden where the harm to other societal
interests in recognizing the privilege clearly outweighs any
benefit to the interest fostered by applying the privilege in the
particular circumstances.
[143]     It is well established in Canada that no privilege is
absolute. As Cory J. said in Smith v. Jones, supra, at 219:
          </pre>
        <pre>               Just as no right is absolute so too the privilege, even that
          between solicitor and client, is subject to clearly defined
          exceptions. The decision to exclude evidence that would be both
          relevant and of substantial probative value because it is
          protected by the solicitor-client privilege represents a policy
          decision. It is based upon the importance to our legal system in
          general of the solicitor-client privilege. In certain
          circumstances, however, other societal values must prevail.</pre>
        <pre>[144]      It  seems to me that the words of Cory J.  apply  with
even  greater  force  when the privilege in issue  is  litigation
privilege  and  not client-solicitor privilege.  The  former  has
never occupied the same favoured position as the latter.
[145]     Recent jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada is
replete with cases where confidentiality-based claims have come
into conflict with claims based on other individual or societal
interests. The defendant who seeks access to a plaintiff&#146;s
medical records, the Crown&#146;s attempt to elicit evidence of an
accused&#146;s statement to his spiritual adviser and an accused&#146;s
attempt to introduce evidence of a complainant&#146;s previous sexual
activity are all examples of situations in which one party relies
on a privacy interest to deny access or admissibility and the
other party counters with the claim that the just and accurate
resolution of the litigation requires that the party have access
to or be permitted to introduce that evidence. In resolving these
difficult cases, the court has identified the competing interests
and has determined questions of access or admissibility by
applying a type of cost-benefit analysis to the competing
interests. In the outcome of that analysis, the privacy claim may
win out entirely, may fail entirely, or may be given limited
effect:  see Slavutych v. Baker, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 254;  R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577;  R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 326;  R. v. Gruenke, supra;  Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company v. Frenette, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 647;  R. v. O&#146;Connor, [1995]
4 S.C.R. 411 (S.C.C.);  R. v. Beharriell, supra;  Smith v. Jones,
supra;  see also Cook v. Ip (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 289 (C.A.);  R.
v. R.S. (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 115 (Ont.C.A.). This approach
produces some uncertainty in close cases;  however, it is
necessary to take cognizance of voices which have gone unheard in
our courts in the past and to permit the law of privilege to
adapt to the evolving interests and priorities of the community:
see Manes and Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canadian Law,
supra, at 20-23.
[146]     The case law dealing with litigation privilege offers
some support for applying a competing interests approach to
litigation privilege claims. Cases that refuse to apply the
privilege to statements made by one party to a representative of
the opposing party even when in contemplation of litigation are
instructive. These cases recognize that withholding production of
the opposing party&#146;s statement does nothing to enhance the
legitimate privacy expectations inherent in the client-solicitor
relationship, but may impair the full, fair and timely resolution
of the litigation:  see Flack v. Pacific Press Ltd. (1970), 14
D.L.R. (3d) 334 at 341 and 350, per Robertson J.A., and at 357-
58, per Nemetz J.A.;  Strauss v. Goldsack, supra, at 415-16, per
Clement J.A., and at 420-21, per Moir J.A.
[147]     Counsel for Chrusz also referred the court to one
authority which expressly recognizes that in particular
circumstances the interests of justice can trump an otherwise
valid litigation privilege claim. In Butterfield v. Dickson
(1994), 28 C.P.C. (3d) 242 (N.W.T.S.C.), the applicant sought
production of certain adjusters&#146; reports prepared after a fatal
boating accident. Vertes J. held that the reports were producible
as they did not meet the dominant purpose test. He went on, at p.
252, to hold:
          </pre>
        <pre>               Finally, there is a further basis for ordering disclosure of
          these reports.
          </pre>
        <pre>               There is evidence that certain tests and
          adjustments were made to the boat by the
          respondents after the fatality. The
          applicant, therefore, will not be able to
          inspect the boat in exactly the same
          condition it was in at the time of the
          fatality. In the interests of justice, the
          applicant should have access to these reports
          so as to assess the effect of any adjustments
          made to the boat since them.</pre>
        <pre>[148]      I  read  Vertes  J. to hold that litigation  privilege
should give way where it would deny the opposing party access  to
important information which could not be obtained except  through
access to the reports over which the privilege is sought.
[149]     There is considerable academic support for the view
that litigation privilege should be a qualified one which must,
in some circumstances, give way to the interests served by full
disclosure:  see Manes and Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in
Canadian Law, supra, at 21-22;  Watson and Au, Solicitor-Client
Privilege and Litigation Privilege in Civil Litigation, supra, at
344-45;  R. Sharpe, Claiming Privilege in the Discovery Process,
in Law in Transition:  Evidence, Law Society of Upper Canada
Special Lectures (Toronto:  DeBoo, 1984) at 164-65. These authors
point to the American experience where the lawyer&#146;s work product
privilege against production has always been a qualified one:
Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 at 511 (1947). The statutory
manifestation of that qualification is found in Rule 26(b)(iii)
of the U.S. Rules of Federal Procedure which permits production
upon a showing by the party seeking production that there is &#147;a
substantial need&#148; for the material and that the party is &#147;unable
without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of
the material.&#148;  This statutory language reflects some of the
factors which, in my view, should be considered in determining
whether a document should be produced even though it fulfills the
conditions precedent to the operation of litigation privilege.7
[150]     In my opinion, litigation privilege claims should be
approached in the same way as other confidentiality-based claims
which seek to deny access to or evidentiary use of relevant
information. The harm done by non-disclosure to other societal
interests must be considered and factored into the decision
whether to give effect to the privilege claim.
[151]     Litigation privilege claims should be determined by
first asking whether the material meets the dominant purpose test
described by Carthy J.A. If it meets that test, then it should be
determined whether in the circumstances the harm flowing from non-
disclosure clearly outweighs the benefit accruing from the
recognition of the privacy interest of the party resisting
production. I would put the onus on the party claiming the
privilege at the first stage of this inquiry and on the party
seeking production of the document at the second stage of the
inquiry. I appreciate that the party seeking production will not
have seen the material and will be at some disadvantage in
attempting to make the case for production. The judge can, of
course, inspect the material:  Rule 30.04(6). She can also
provide the party seeking production with a judicial summary of
that material to assist in making the necessary submissions as is
done where the Crown claims privilege over the contents of an
affidavit used to obtain a wiretap authorization:  see R. v.
Garofoli (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 194 (S.C.C.).
[152]     In deciding whether to require material which meets the
dominant purpose test to be produced, the policies underlying the
competing interests should be considered. The privacy interest
reflects our commitment to the adversarial process in which
competing parties control the preparation and presentation of
their respective cases. Each side is entitled to and, indeed,
obligated to prepare its own case. There is no obligation to
assist the other side. Counsel must have a &#147;zone of privacy&#148;
where they are free to investigate and develop their case without
opposing counsel looking over their shoulder.
[153]     The policies underlying the privacy interest on which
the litigation privilege is based do not, however, include
concerns about the potential fabrication of evidence by the party
seeking disclosure. There was a time when that concern featured
prominently in the rules governing discovery and production of
documents:  see Wigram, Points in the Law of Discovery, 2nd ed.
(1840) at 265-66, referred to by McGillivray C.J.A. in Strauss v.
Goldsack, supra, at 409. Given the present discovery philosophy,
however, the desire to avoid the fabrication of evidence cannot
be viewed as one of the policies underlying the privacy interest
of the party opposing production. Such concern must now be
addressed by way of judicial control over the timing of
production and the order in which parties are discovered.8
[154]     The policies underlying the disclosure interest are
adjudicative fairness and adjudicative reliability. While we
remain committed to the adversarial process, we seek to make that
process as fair and as effective a means of getting at the truth
as possible. Both goals are in jeopardy when one party can hide
or delay disclosure of relevant information. The extent to which
these policies are undermined by non-disclosure will depend on
many factors. The nature of the material and its availability
through other means to the party seeking disclosure are two
important factors. If the material is potentially probative
evidence going to a central issue in the case, non-disclosure can
do significant harm to the search for the truth. If the material
is unavailable to the party seeking disclosure through any other
source, then applying the privilege can cause considerable
unfairness to the party seeking disclosure.
[155]     I turn now to apply the approach I favour to the May
23rd statement. I have read the statement.9  It is hardly a
typical witness statement generated in the course of an
investigation. It consists of an exhaustive examination under
oath of Mr. Pilotte by Mr. Eryou and Mr. Bourret over a two-day
period. The questions asked of Mr. Pilotte are detailed and make
extensive reference to documents, some of which appear to have
been taken from Chrusz by Mr. Pilotte during his employment. The
statement, which covers almost 200 pages, is best described as an
ex parte examination for discovery of a friendly party by General
Accident.
[156]     I am satisfied that all or parts of the statement are
potentially admissible as substantive evidence. To the extent
that it contains admissions against interest, it is clearly
admissible against Mr. Pilotte. I am also satisfied, given the
circumstances in which the statement was made, that all or parts
of it may be admissible under the principled approach to hearsay
evidence:  R. v. B.(K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740. It would
certainly seem arguable that Mr. Pilotte&#146;s detailed recollection
of events provided under oath a few months after the relevant
events is likely to be much more reliable than any recollection
he may have on discovery or at trial some 4 or 5 years after the
relevant events.
[157]     In deciding whether the statement should be ordered
produced, it is also significant that the statement is the root
of General Accident&#146;s claim. In assessing the credibility of the
allegations made in that statement, it may be important to
examine how the information was first elicited from Mr. Pilotte.
The format of the questions and the role played by Mr. Eryou or
Mr. Bourret in eliciting answers to those questions could be
significant in assessing the merits of the allegations giving
rise to this claim.
[158]     It cannot be said that Chrusz has access to the same
information from any other source. Obviously, Mr. Pilotte will
not voluntarily provide the statement to Chrusz. While Chrusz can
discover Mr. Pilotte and ask him about his knowledge of the
relevant events, he cannot know without a copy of the statement
what Mr. Pilotte said when first questioned about those events.
To the extent that Mr. Pilotte&#146;s statement could be substantive
evidence, Chrusz cannot obtain that evidence without an order
directing production of the statement.
[159]     These considerations lead me to conclude that the goals
of adjudicative fairness and adjudicative reliability could
suffer significant harm if the statement is not ordered produced
at the discovery stage of the proceedings.
[160]     It remains to be considered the potential harm to
General Accident&#146;s legitimate privacy interest which would be
caused by an order directing production of the statement.
Chrusz&#146;s discovery rights must be borne in mind in making this
determination. General Accident&#146;s privacy interest rests in the
document and not in the information contained in the document.
Chrusz is entitled on discovery of General Accident and Mr.
Pilotte to all of the information in their possession which is
material to the various allegations in the pleadings. Even if the
statement were not ordered produced, General Accident and Mr.
Pilotte must disclose the substance of its contents. Non-
production would, in effect, deny access to the primary source,
thereby denying Chrusz a means of determining whether the
information provided on discovery was full and accurate.
[161]     My review of the statement does not indicate that any
of General Accident&#146;s legal strategy or the thoughts or opinions
of its counsel will be revealed if the statement is ordered
produced. The statement does not contain anything which comes
within the ambit of what is usually referred to as &#147;lawyers&#146; work
product.&#148;  It is not like an expert&#146;s report, which may well
reflect the theory of the case developed by counsel or reveal the
weaknesses and strengths of the case as seen by counsel. This
statement is purely informational and purports to be Mr.
Pilotte&#146;s account of the relevant events. There can be no
suggestion that it somehow reflects counsel&#146;s view of the case.
Indeed, there was no case until this statement was made.
[162]     If the May 23rd statement is produced, the basis upon
which General Accident chose to deny coverage and sue Chrusz for
fraud will be revealed. This can hardly be described as an
invasion of counsel&#146;s &#147;privacy zone.&#148;  I do not think that the
policies underlying General Accident&#146;s privacy interests in non-
disclosure are in any way adversely affected by disclosure of
this statement. As I see it, the real risk attendant upon
disclosure of the statement in so far as General Accident is
concerned is that Chrusz will manufacture or tailor evidence in
an effort to respond to the very specific allegations of fraud
found in the statement. As indicated above, I do not regard this
concern as relevant to the determination of whether litigation
privilege should be applied to protect the statement from
disclosure.
[163]     In summary, production of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s May 23rd
statement will yield significant benefits to the fair and
accurate determination of this litigation. It will not compromise
counsel&#146;s ability to effectively prepare and present a case for
General Accident. When the competing interests are identified and
weighed in the context of the facts of this case, the scales tip
clearly in favour of requiring production of the statement by
General Accident.
[164]      I see no basis upon which Mr. Pilotte&#146;s privilege
claim with respect to the copy of the statement could be
maintained in the face of an order directing production of the
statement by General Accident. In my view, the copy of the
statement in the possession of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s lawyer should also
be produced.

Conclusion:</pre>
        <pre>[165]      I would answer the three questions posed at the outset
of these reasons as follows:</pre>
        <ul>
          <li><pre>     Communications between Mr. Bourret and the insurers  and/or
  Mr. Eryou made prior to May 23, 1995 are not protected by either
  client-solicitor    privilege    or    litigation    privilege.
  Communications between Mr. Bourret and General Accident  and/or
  Mr. Eryou on or after May 23, 1995 are protected from disclosure
  by litigation privilege unless they are required to be produced
  under the Rules of Civil Procedure;</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>     The  transcript of Mr. Pilotte&#146;s May 23rd statement in  the
  possession of the insurers is not protected against production by
  litigation privilege;  and</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>     The  copy  of  the  transcript of Mr.  Pilotte&#146;s  May  23rd
  statement  in  the  possession of his lawyer is  not  protected
  against  production  by  Mr. Pilotte by  virtue  of  litigation
  privilege.</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>[166]     I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the
Divisional  Court  and  restore  the  order  of  Kurisko  J.  The
appellants are entitled to their costs throughout.
</pre>
        <pre>                                             &#147;Doherty J.A.&#148;
ROSENBERG J.A. (concurring):</pre>
        <pre>[167]      I  agree  with Carthy J.A., subject to  the  following
comments. Like him, I accept Doherty J.A.&#146;s analysis of solicitor-
client privilege. I agree with Carthy J.A.&#146;s application of those
principles  to the facts of this case, subject to Doherty  J.A.&#146;s
reservation,   which  I  share,  concerning  pre-May   23,   1995
communications between Mr. Eryou and General Accident.
[168]     I agree with Carthy J.A.&#146;s analysis of litigation
privilege. The litigation privilege is well established, even if
some of the nuances are not. In my view, the competing interests
or balancing approach proposed by Doherty J.A. is more
appropriate for dealing with emerging claims of privilege such as
those claims dealt with in Slavutych v. Baker, [1976] 1 S.C.R.
254 and R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 263. I am concerned that a
balancing test would lead to unnecessary uncertainty and a
proliferation of pre-trial motions in civil litigation.
[169]     That is not to say that litigation privilege is
absolute. The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that all
of the established privileges are subject to some exceptions. As
Cory J. said in Smith v. Jones (1998), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 225
(S.C.C.) at 239:
          </pre>
        <pre>               Both parties made their submissions on the basis that the
          psychiatrist's report was protected by solicitor-client
          privilege, and it should be considered on that basis. It is the
          highest privilege recognized by the courts. By necessary
          implication, if a public safety exception applies to solicitor-
          client privilege, it applies to all classifications of privileges
          and duties of confidentiality. It follows that, in these reasons,
          it is not necessary to consider any distinctions that may exist
          between a solicitor-client privilege and a litigation privilege.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
        <pre>[170]     In my view, with established privileges like solicitor-
client  privilege and litigation privilege it is preferable  that
the  general  rule  be stated with as much clarity  as  possible.
Deviations from the rule should be dealt with as clearly  defined
exceptions  rather than as a new balancing exercise each  time  a
privilege claim is made. See Smith v. Jones at p. 242. Where,  as
in  Smith v. Jones, a party seeks to set aside the privilege, the
onus  properly  rests upon the party seeking  to  set  aside  the
privilege. See Smith v. Jones at p. 240.
[171]     It follows that I agree with Carthy J.A.&#146;s statement of
the litigation privilege and its application to the facts of this
case subject only to one reservation. As to copies of non-
privileged documents, like Doherty J.A. I find the reasons of
Wood J. in Nickmar Pty. Ltd. v. Preservatrice Skandia Insurance
Ltd. (1985), 3 N.S.W.L.R. 44 (N.S.W.S.C.) persuasive. However,
since that issue does not arise in this case, I would prefer to
leave the question open.
[172]     In all other respects, I agree with the reasons of
Carthy J.A. and with his disposition of the appeal.

_______________________________
1 In his affidavit in support of the privilege claim, Mr. Cook
states that Mr. Bourret said that &#147;the fire had been deliberately
set.&#148;  Given subsequent events, it would appear that Mr.
Bourret&#146;s recollection is more accurate.
2 In their affidavits, both Mr. Cook and Mr. Bourret suggest that
reports after December 1, 1994 were sent directly to Mr. Eryou.
The documents referred to in their affidavits, however, indicate
that the third report dated January 12, 1995 was the first report
sent directly to Mr. Eryou.
3 The transcript of Mr. Pilotte's statement was ordered sealed by
Kurisko J.  A sealed copy of the transcript was filed with this
court. It fills some 198 pages and is in a question and answer
format.  The questioning extended over two days.
4 These reasons do not address communications involving employees
of the client and/or the lawyer.
5 See McCormick, supra at 317-18, footnote 18. This definition
has been adopted in several states:  eg.  Arkansas, North Dakota,
South Dakota and Hawaii.
6 The insignificance to Mr. Bourret&#146;s function resulting from the
insertion of Mr. Eryou into the relationship is evident by the
fact that Mr. Bourret&#146;s reports did not start to go to Mr. Eryou
directly until some two months later.
7 The Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended a similar
qualification of the litigation privilege in its Report on
Evidence, 1977 at p. 31.  The authors described the proposed
privilege in these terms:
&#147;A person has a privilege against disclosure of information
obtained or work produced in contemplation of litigation by him
or his lawyer or a person employed to assist the lawyer, unless,
in the case of information, it is not reasonably available from
another source, and its probative value substantially outweighs
the disadvantages that would be caused by its disclosure.&#148;
8 Kurisko J.  provided such control in this case in reasons
released on November 14, 1997.  His order was affirmed by the
Divisional Court on July 20, 1998.
9 Although the statement was ordered sealed by Kurisko J., his
order provided for examination of the statement by the Divisional
Court or this court.</pre></td>
