    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Mr. Justice Gans dated
December 21, 1998</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, the motions judge was correct in striking the
Third Party Claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
Although it was not open to the motions judge under a Rule
21.01(1)(b) motion to consider any evidence, we are of the view
that his conclusion is entirely supportable on the basis of the
appellant's pleadings alone.
[2]  The third party claim is for contribution and indemnity
under the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. N-1.  Counsel for the
appellant conceded in his argument that the sole basis for the
claim is subrogated in nature. However, on the facts as pleaded
by the defendant there can be no subrogated claim at law against
the third party. Reference need only be made to paragraphs 6, 7
and 10 of the Statement of Defence that are incorporated in the
Third Party Claim under paragraph 5. Those alleged facts must be
taken as true on this motion. Hence, it is clear that the third
party tenant was responsible for paying the insurance premiums
for the landlord&#146;s policy of insurance which covered  the
incident which forms the basis for the alleged negligence. In
these circumstances there can be no subrogated claim by either
the landlord or the plaintiff insurer: Tony and Jim&#146;s Holding
Ltd. v. Silva, [1999] O.J. No. 705 (C.A.). The appellant is in no
better position.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
