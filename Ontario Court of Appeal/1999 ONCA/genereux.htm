    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of C. Scullion J., dated December 22,
1997.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Maurice Genereux, a Toronto physician, was convicted on his
plea  of  guilty to each of two counts of aiding and  abetting  a
patient to commit suicide. He was sentenced to two years less one
day  and  three  years  probation on each  count,  to  be  served
concurrently.  Dr.  Genereux appeals from the sentence  and  asks
that a conditional sentence order be made. The Crown also appeals
from  the  sentence and asks that the period of  imprisonment  be
increased.
[2]  After eleven days of evidence at a preliminary inquiry
before Scullion J., Dr. Genereux re-elected, pleaded guilty, and
was convicted on these two counts. There followed two days of
evidence on the sentence issue. Judgement having been reserved,
Scullion J. pronounced the sentence on May 13, 1998.
[3]  Essentially the case for the Crown was that Dr. Genereux
supplied two of his patients who were HIV positive but not
suffering from AIDS, at their request, with a drug to assist them
to commit suicide. At the time he supplied the drug, each of the
patients was seriously depressed and was fearful of death from
AIDS. Neither patient was terminally ill at the time Dr. Genereux
gave him the drug nor at the time it was ingested. To the
knowledge of Dr. Genereux, treatment could have helped both.
[4]  Dr. Genereux&#146;s patients were Arron McGinn, who committed
suicide on April 11, 1996, and Mark Jewitt who attempted suicide
on July 12, 1995 but survived. In each case, Dr. Genereux had
given a prescription enabling the patient to acquire a lethal
dose of a drug (seconal) knowing that it was going to be used to
commit suicide.
[5]   Mark Jewitt had been a patient of Dr. Genereux from 1988
until the date of his attempt to end his life in 1996.  On
November 1, 1988, he tested positive for HIV. At that time he
lived with a partner who was also a patient of Dr. Genereux.  In
early 1993, Mr. Jewitt found a bottle of seconal, which had been
prescribed for Mr. Jewitt&#146;s partner by Dr. Genereux. When he
asked Dr. Genereux not to help his partner commit suicide, Dr.
Genereux indicated that this was a matter of patient
confidentiality. In June of that year Mr. Jewitt&#146;s partner died
of AIDS.  Mr. Jewitt became obsessed with the possibility of the
same fate and determined to commit suicide if he developed AIDS.
[6]  It was the gist of Mr. Jewitt&#146;s evidence that Dr. Genereux
prescribed drugs on which he was dependent for depression, lack
of sleep and for HIV. He told Dr. Genereux he had learned of
seconal as a means of suicide. After he had tested positive for
HIV his condition deteriorated and he mistakenly thought he had
AIDS. In addition, he was struggling financially and very
depressed.
[7]  On July 12, 1995 Mr. Jewitt asked Dr. Genereux for seconal
to help him sleep. Knowing that his patient was actually
contemplating suicide, Dr. Genereux gave him the prescription.
The appointment with Dr. Genereux had been but a few minutes.
There had been no medical examination or enquiry.
[8]  Later that day, a friend found Mr. Jewitt unconscious. He
had taken all of the seconal. A call to 911 saved his life. In
cross-examination Mr. Jewitt said he did not blame Dr. Genereux,
rather he blamed himself.
[9]  Arron McGinn tested positive for HIV in 1989.  From early in
1990, he and his best friend were both patients of Dr. Genereux.
[10] Mr. McGinn was, throughout his illness, a violent abusive
man with a history of depression. He used and abused drugs both
prescription and illegal. He monitored his own health and was
concerned about living with AIDS.
[11] On August 11, 1995 Dr. Genereux prescribed for Mr. McGinn a
quantity of seconal that would be lethal. He repeated this
prescription a week later as Mr. McGinn said the first batch had
been lost. At a meeting that September with Dr. Genereux,
Mr. McGinn said he had the seconal to kill himself and warned his
friend who was present not to interfere.
[12] That fall Mr. McGinn became emotionally unstable. His friend
called and advised Dr. Genereux. Later that day the friend took
Mr. McGinn to a psychiatric institution as he thought him
suicidal. There is no suggestion that Dr. Genereux saw Mr. McGinn
then or at any time preceding his death in April 1996.
[13] Nine months after Dr. Genereux had given the prescription to
him, on April 10, 1996, Mr. McGinn took all of the seconal. He
said he did not want to suffer through AIDS and told his friend
not to intervene. Later, when Mr. McGinn had lost consciousness,
his friend called Dr. Genereux and asked if he should call 911.
Dr. Genereux answered to the effect that death was what his
friend wanted, and he should let him do it.  Later Dr. Genereux
attended, examined Mr. McGinn, completed a death certificate
showing the cause of death as &#147;AIDS pneumonia&#148; and took the empty
seconal bottle.
[14] The trial judge found that a call to 911 might well have
saved Mr. McGinn&#146;s life.
[15] Four experts were called with respect to sentence. Two were
called by the Crown, and two by the defence. All were highly
qualified.  For the Crown, Dr. Hébert, an expert in ethics,
concluded that Dr. Genereux had failed to abide by the deepest
and most rudimentary professional responsibilities of a physician
caring for the incapable and the sick. He and his colleague
asserted, and it is conceded, that neither patient was terminally
ill nor beyond help yet Dr. Genereux did nothing to treat them.
For the defence, Dr. Glancy, a psychiatrist who knew Dr. Genereux
having treated him for some years, said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It would be my opinion the offences before the Court can
          best be understood in the context of a man who has difficulty
          refusing the demands of patients. This is in the context of
          over-identification with the patients. Doctor Genereux himself
          has trouble dealing with a number of his own interpersonal and
          experiential problems &#133; Since his needs in other areas of his
          life have largely been unfilled, it is paramount that these needs
          are filled by patients. In particular, it would be my opinion
          that he over-identifies with patients who are HIV positive and
          are homosexual, because of his own intrapsychic difficulties.</pre>
    <pre>[16] There was a good deal of evidence about Dr. Genereux and his
career.   Since  1984,  Dr.  Genereux had  devoted  much  of  his
practice to the gay and lesbian community in this city.  Much  of
his  work was in treating persons who suffered from HIV and  AIDS
virus.  He  was  familiar  with their experience,  suffering  and
sometimes  death.  While the evidence of experts  called  by  the
Crown was understandably strong in criticism of Dr. Genereux  for
his  departure  from  acceptable medical  standards,  there  were
before  the  trial judge a number of letters from patients  which
were testimonial to Dr. Genereux&#146;s friendly care and concern  for
those who depended on him. There was also a good deal of evidence
that reflected his character and a tragic career in medicine.
[17] Dr. Genereux came from a small town in Alberta. He graduated
in medicine from a university there. During his student years,
upon the death of a young woman with whom he had established a
relationship, he attempted to take his own life with an overdose
of seconal. In 1971, he graduated. He entered the residency
program in gynaecology and obstetrics but did not pass the
fellowship examinations. For a while he lived in Africa but
became an alcoholic. Following an illness there he returned to
Alberta where he worked as a general practitioner. This came to
an end when it was discovered that he was involved in a
homosexual relationship. He was in disgrace and as a result his
hospital privileges were withdrawn and members of his family
shunned him.
[18] Dr. Genereux was unable to obtain a license in British
Columbia.  He next worked in an outpost hospital in the Arctic
for two years. That position ended when it was discovered he was
addicted to drugs. There followed a period of successful
treatment in the United States and at an institution in Toronto.
From 1984 through 1987 he was a substance abuse counselor at the
Toronto institution. He has abstained from alcohol since 1983.
[19] He began his practice in Toronto in 1987 and built a large
clientele of mainly gay males.  HIV was his chief area of
interest.  In March 1994, Dr. Genereux pleaded guilty before the
Discipline Committee of his profession to charges of professional
misconduct arising from complaints of six male patients, five of
whom were gay and HIV positive. The complaints were all of sexual
improprieties and took place between 1987 and 1991. The
profession suspended Dr. Genereux&#146;s license for two years
provided the suspension might be suspended after fifteen months
if Dr. Genereux met certain conditions.
[20] In February 1995, Dr. Genereux&#146;s license was reinstated.
Five months later he prescribed seconal for Mr. Jewitt and a
month later for Mr. McGinn.
[21] In March 1998, Dr. Genereux&#146;s licence was revoked on his
plea to charges of professional misconduct arising out of the
matters giving rise to these offences.
[22]   In their submissions, counsel criticized the reasons of
the learned trial judge as &#147;insufficient&#148; for his decision. We do
not agree. There is no formula that must be followed. The trial
judge found the facts generally as stated above, he considered
the evidence of the experts called by the Crown and the defence
and we think it clear from the reasons that he weighed the
evidence and relied on parts of it. He addressed the principles
he thought applicable and those relied on by the parties.
[23] Was the sentence a fit one?  We think the trial judge was
alive to the seriousness of the appellant&#146;s crimes and to the
values sought to be protected by s.241(b) of the Criminal Code,
the preservation of life and the protection of vulnerable people
(Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney-General) (1993), 85
C.C.C. (3d) 15 (S.C.C.)).  Vulnerable people are the concern of
the intervenor, and they rely heavily on the judgement of the
Supreme Court in that case.
[24] The Crown submits that a sentence of two years less one day
was wrong and that a substantial term in the penitentiary was
required to mark society&#146;s abhorrence of Dr. Genereux&#146;s conduct
and to deter other like-minded people.  Mr. Jewitt and Mr. McGinn
were the kind of people s.241(b) should protect.  Each was sick,
confused, frightened and intent on suicide. But each could have
been treated, as neither was terminally ill.  Before the trial
judge, the Crown said such a sentence was needed to send a
message to doctors that they cannot partake in this type of
activity.  In this court essentially the same submissions were
made adding, &#147;More particularly, in the context of doctor-
assisted suicide, the criminal sanction imposed will resonate
throughout the medical profession, whose members are precisely
the type of people who will influenced by the threat of severe
criminal penalties&#148;.
[25] We appreciate the Crown&#146;s submission but, in our view, the
conduct of Dr. Genereux was a complete departure from acceptable
medical standards and ethics, and it should be treated as such.
The case stands on its own facts.  We are sure that for such
conduct the certainty of the loss of professional status,
prosecution and incarceration where appropriate is understood.
We doubt the wisdom of imposing a sentence designed to, or that
might, intimidate physicians in the appropriate treatment of
their patients.  The trial judge correctly addressed the
principle of deterrence.
[26] Moreover, in our view, the sentence imposed by the trial
judge gave adequate recognition to the requirement for
denunciation.  The offences were not committed for financial gain
or personal benefit nor were they committed for the purpose of
making a public or political statement about euthanasia or
assisted suicide.  Rather, these offences resulted from Dr.
Genereux&#146;s very serious personal inadequacies and his misguided
acceptance of doing what his patients wanted him to do.  Dr.
Genereux was obviously ill-suited to the responsibilities and the
stresses that are involved in the practice of medicine.
[27] It is not suggested that the trial judge was wrong in
considering Dr. Genereux as a first offender notwithstanding the
disposition of charges of sexual misconduct towards other
patients by the Discipline Committee of his profession. However,
that evidence together with the evidence of his career and
personal life was important in order that the Court understand
the person to be sentenced and better appreciate the expert
evidence.
[28] We are not persuaded that the trial judge made any error in
principle.  In our opinion the sentence of two years less one day
to be followed by a period of three years probation on each count
to be served concurrently was a fit one.
[29] The trial judge refused to order a conditional sentence
providing that Dr. Genereux serve his sentence in the community.
The judge concluded that on the facts of the case, a period of
incarceration was required.  Mr. McDowell has carefully reviewed
with us the evidence of witnesses called by the defence on this
issue.  In particular, he has highlighted the evidence as to Dr.
Genereux&#146;s health and activities to date and the stigma arising
from the decision of his profession to take away his license to
practice medicine.  We agree with the trial judge.  We think
imprisonment was required to mark society&#146;s condemnation of Dr.
Genereux&#146;s conduct.  It is here that the principle of
denunciation was very important.  The trial judge recognized this
and correctly exercised his discretion.
[30] In the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted but both
appeals are dismissed.
