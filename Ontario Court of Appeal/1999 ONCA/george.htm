    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. ANTHONY GEORGE (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ABELLA, LASKIN and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Owen Wigderson,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Philip Downes,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 8, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice E. Then dated December
31, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Crown does not now rely on the allegation that the
statement was false as circumstantial evidence of guilt.  This
leaves the fact that on a hot July night the appellant was
perspiring and that he and his car were in the area thirty
minutes after the robbery.  That would not amount to a basis upon
which a preliminary inquiry judge could form an opinion that the
evidence was sufficient.  It amounts to mere suspicion.
[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order to stand
trial is quashed.</pre></td>
