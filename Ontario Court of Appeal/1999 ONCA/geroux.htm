</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice George S. P.
Ferguson, sitting with a jury, on March 6, 1998 and the sentence
imposed on March 13, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged with the offence of robbery and
was convicted of the lesser and included offence of theft. He
appeals against conviction. The main thrust of the appellant&#146;s
argument is that the trial judge, having initially charged the
jury that the only possible verdicts were guilty or not guilty of
the offence of robbery, erred in recharging the jury on the
lesser and included offence of theft.
[2]  The jury instructions are certainly not a model of clarity.
However, in fairness to the trial judge, it would appear that the
initial confusion would have been caused by the joint position of
counsel for the Crown and the defence that there was no issue
with respect to the &#147;assault&#148; component of the offence of robbery
notwithstanding the fact that the evidence did give rise to
certain issues on that element of the offence.
[3]  We are of the view that the trial judge was correct in
amending his initial charge so as to leave it open for the jury
to return a verdict on the lesser and included offence of theft.
No objection to this recharge was made by defence counsel. This
is perhaps not surprising since, in our view, the recharge
clearly enured to the benefit of the appellant. In the result,
even if there was error, there was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
