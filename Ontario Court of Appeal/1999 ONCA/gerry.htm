</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                          ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Gerry's Distributors Limited (&quot;Gerry's&quot;) brought this</pre>
    <pre>action, by its receiver and manager, Richter &amp; Partners Inc., for</pre>
    <pre>the recovery of rebates owed to it by Itwal Limited (&quot;Itwal&quot;). At</pre>
    <pre>trial, Itwal conceded that it owed Gerry's the sum of $413,878 in</pre>
    <pre>rebates. However, Itwal claimed a right of set-off in the amount</pre>
    <pre>of $455,201 in respect of payments it made to Gerry's suppliers</pre>
    <pre>after Gerry's went into receivership and into bankruptcy. Brennan</pre>
    <pre>J. held that Itwal was entitled to rely on the defence of</pre>
    <pre>equitable set-off and dismissed the action. Gerry's appeals</pre>
    <pre>against the dismissal of the action.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Itwal is a buying group established by its members to allow</pre>
    <pre>them to benefit from the discounts and rebates offered to volume</pre>
    <pre>purchasers of goods. Gerry's was one of the members of the group.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  It is common ground between the parties that there were</pre>
    <pre>three types of transactions that gave rise to a volume rebate</pre>
    <pre>entitlement:</pre>
    <pre>1.   &quot;warehouse shipments&quot; whereby Gerry's would order suppliers'</pre>
    <pre>     goods directly from Itwal and receive an invoice from Itwal;</pre>
    <pre>2.   &quot; drop shipments&quot; whereby Gerry's ordered the goods directly</pre>
    <pre>     from the supplier, the supplier invoiced Itwal and Itwal in</pre>
    <pre>     turn invoiced Gerry's; and</pre>
    <pre>3.   &quot;direct shipments&quot; whereby Gerry's ordered goods directly</pre>
    <pre>     from the supplier and paid the supplier directly; the</pre>
    <pre>     suppliers would periodically report to Itwal on the direct</pre>
    <pre>     shipments so that the appropriate rebates could be</pre>
    <pre>     calculated.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Gerry's agrees that Itwal has a right of set-off in respect</pre>
    <pre>to unpaid invoices from Itwal to Gerry's for both warehouse and</pre>
    <pre>drop shipments. However, it disputes that the right extends to</pre>
    <pre>suppliers paid by Itwal for direct shipments to Gerry's. Two</pre>
    <pre>arguments are advanced in support of its position.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  First, it is submitted that Itwal has no claim against</pre>
    <pre>Gerry's. Gerry's claims that Itwal was under no legal obligation</pre>
    <pre>to pay Gerry's unpaid suppliers. It is argued that Itwal should</pre>
    <pre>not be credited for voluntary payments it made for the good of</pre>
    <pre>continuing members but to the detriment of Gerry's creditors.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Second, in the event that the court takes the view that</pre>
    <pre>Itwal has a valid cross-claim, it is submitted that the rebates</pre>
    <pre>owed to Gerry's did not flow from Itwal's payment of Gerry's</pre>
    <pre>debts to suppliers and that the connection between the cross-</pre>
    <pre>claims is insufficient to give rise to equitable set-off.</pre>
    <pre>Alternatively, it is submitted that only the payments of those</pre>
    <pre>invoices that relate directly to the rebates owing should be</pre>
    <pre>credited, an amount of approximately $24,000.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Three general requirements must be met before equitable set-</pre>
    <pre>off can successfully be raised to reduce, or extinguish, a</pre>
    <pre>defendant's liability:</pre>
    <pre>1.   Each party must have a claim against the other. The claims</pre>
    <pre>     can be liquidated or unliquidated. The issue raised in this</pre>
    <pre>     case is whether Itwal has a valid claim against Gerry's.</pre>
    <pre>2.   There must be mutuality. Mutuality has been defined in</pre>
    <pre>     various ways. For the purpose of this appeal, it is</pre>
    <pre>     sufficient to refer to Telford v. Holt (1987), 41 D.L.R.</pre>
    <pre>     (4th) 385 (S.C.C.) where the Supreme Court (at 393) adopted</pre>
    <pre>     the following words on the meaning of mutuality A[t]hat the</pre>
    <pre>     plaintiff, at the commencement of the suit was and still is</pre>
    <pre>     indebted to the defendant in an amount equal to the</pre>
    <pre>     plaintiff's claim...&quot; The Court noted that under this</pre>
    <pre>     definition any assignment would destroy mutuality and hence</pre>
    <pre>     destroy the possiblity of set-off at law. It is well</pre>
    <pre>     established however that the requirement of mutuality is</pre>
    <pre>     relaxed in the case of equitable set-off. Gerry's raised an</pre>
    <pre>     issue on the question of mutuality in its factum but did not</pre>
    <pre>     pursue the matter at the hearing. In our view, the facts of</pre>
    <pre>     this case do not raise any concerns with respect to this</pre>
    <pre>     requirement.</pre>
    <pre>3.   The cross-claims must be sufficiently connected. The second</pre>
    <pre>     issue raised on the appeal relates to this requirement.

</pre>
    <pre>Does Itwal have a valid claim against Gerry's for reimbursement</pre>
    <pre>of monies paid to Gerry's suppliers?

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Although the trial judge did not expressly address this</pre>
    <pre>question in his reasons, it is manifest from his judgment that he</pre>
    <pre>took the view that Gerry's was liable to reimburse Itwal for the</pre>
    <pre>payments made to Gerry's suppliers.  In our view, this finding is</pre>
    <pre>supported both in law and on the evidence.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  It is clear from the evidence that rebates were earned by</pre>
    <pre>the members on shipments obtained directly from the suppliers as</pre>
    <pre>well as on shipments that went through Itwal in one form or</pre>
    <pre>another. The evidence is uncontroverted that the direct shipments</pre>
    <pre>formed part of the overall scheme to obtain the volume rebates.</pre>
    <pre>Itwal's representative testified that suppliers looked to Itwal</pre>
    <pre>for payment on direct payments when a member experienced</pre>
    <pre>financial difficulties. This arrangement formed part of the</pre>
    <pre>overall scheme. In some cases, the arrangement was reduced to</pre>
    <pre>writing. In other cases, including the case at hand, it was not.</pre>
    <pre>No evidence was called to dispute this testimony.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] Based on this evidence, we see no reason to interfere with</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge's finding that Itwal had a valid claim against</pre>
    <pre>Gerry's for payments made on its behalf.

</pre>
    <pre>Is there a sufficient connection between the cross claims to give</pre>
    <pre>rise to equitable set-off?

</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge held that Gerry's entitlement to the rebates</pre>
    <pre>was &quot;dependent upon completion of the transactions including</pre>
    <pre>paying for the goods. Not having paid, Gerry's is not entitled.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>Gerry's submits that this finding is wrong because Itwal</pre>
    <pre>acknowledged that it owed the rebates to Gerry's. Further, it is</pre>
    <pre>submitted that the evidence did not show that the rebates were</pre>
    <pre>payable only on payment of the goods.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] We do not read the trial judge's reasons in the strict sense</pre>
    <pre>urged upon us by Gerry's. We interpret the reasons as meaning</pre>
    <pre>that both the benefit to the members in the form of rebates and</pre>
    <pre>the corresponding obligation to pay for the goods formed part of</pre>
    <pre>the scheme. The rebates cannot be considered independently from</pre>
    <pre>the payment of the goods. The only conclusion supported by common</pre>
    <pre>sense is that, in the overall scheme, rebates would not be</pre>
    <pre>available to members in the absence of payment for the goods.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] In our view, the trial judge's finding that the claims were</pre>
    <pre>sufficiently connected with each other to give rise to a right of</pre>
    <pre>equitable set-off is supported by the evidence. Further, the</pre>
    <pre>equities favour Itwal. Gerry's, and consequently its creditors,</pre>
    <pre>received the benefit of the goods purchased from the suppliers.</pre>
    <pre>It also received the benefit of the non-spayment of the invoices.</pre>
    <pre>As the trial judge concluded, it would be unconscionable if</pre>
    <pre>Gerry's were entitled to collect the rebates in addition to the</pre>
    <pre>benefit already received. We agree with his conclusion.

</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appeal is dismissed with costs.
