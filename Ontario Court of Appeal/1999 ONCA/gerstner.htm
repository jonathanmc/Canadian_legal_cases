    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]    Mr. Borg appeals from orders made in March, 1998 by
Walters J., the case management judge in the matrimonial
proceedings between himself and Ms. Gerstner. Walters J. found
him in contempt of an order of Zelinski J. and committed him to
jail for 90 days for failure to purge his contempt by paying
$100,000. into his solicitor's trust account as contemplated by
the original order of Zelinski J. of August 14, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[2]    The basis of the appeal is that the order of Justice
Zelinski was unclear in its meaning and therefore cannot form the
basis for a contempt order. The original order reads as follows:
            [3]    THIS MOTION, was heard this day at 7755
            Hurontario Street, Brampton, Ontario, in
            the presence of counsel.</pre>
    <pre>            ON READING Petitioner for Divorce issued
            April 18, 1997, Affidavits of the
            Petitioner sworn April 18, 1997 June 10,
            1997, July 24, 1997 and Financial
            Statement sworn April 18, 1997, and the
            affidavit of the Respondent dated August
            15th, 1997 [sic] and the affidavit of
            Adele Begley sworn August 7, 1997 filed
            herein, and submissions by counsel on
            behalf of the Petitioner and the
            Respondent, and the terms of Adjournment
            filed;</pre>
    <pre>            1.  THIS COURT ORDERS adjournment to
            Friday August 15, 1997, PEREMPTORY UPON
            the Respondent unless:</pre>
    <pre>            (a)  He complies with the outstanding
                 Orders of the Court by paying the
                 amounts due and owing hereunder,
                 including all costs due and owing
                 hereunder.</pre>
    <pre>            (b)  He arranges to have deposited into
                 the trust of account of his
                 counsel, pending further order of
                 the Court, at least $100,000.00 of
                 the $175,000.00 said to have been
                 withdrawn from the &quot;business bank
                 accounts&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>Unfortunately, the filed terms of adjournment which are referred
to were not made part of the record before us.</pre>
    <pre>[4]    In our view the meaning of the endorsement is clear. The
motion was adjourned for one day at the request of the
respondent, Mr. Borg. The motion would proceed the next day
without further adjournment unless previous orders were complied
with and $100,000 of the impugned $175,000 was paid to his
solicitor in trust for safekeeping pending the motion.</pre>
    <pre>[5]    However, the parties and/or their counsel who were present
in court on August 14 seemed to have the understanding that the
payment conditions were orders of the court made in conjunction
with the one-day adjournment, because Ms. Gerstner brought the
contempt motion by the end of August 14, when the money had not
been paid in, and Mr. Borg responded to that motion with an
affidavit sworn August 15 which read in part as follows:</pre>
    <pre>            1.  I am advised by my solicitor and do
            verily believe that on or about August
            14th, 1997, the Honourable Justice
            Zelinski made an Order that I comply
            with the several Court Orders in this
            proceeding for costs and support by this
            mornings date….</pre>
    <pre>            2.  With respect to the sum of
            $171,000.00 withdrawn from the business
            account, I wish to advise this
            Honourable Court that I can account for
            none of these proceeds as they have gone
            to pay various debts owing by the firm
            and myself.  I can easily prove these
            debts outstanding if only I could have
            access to the business records in the
            home.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]    It appears that as a result of this evidence that Mr. Borg
did not have the $100,000 to deposit with his solicitor, the
original motion was adjourned on terms on consent to a date in
September.</pre>
    <pre>[7]    However, it subsequently became known that paragraph 2 of
the affidavit was false, as Mr. Borg's mother swore that she had
been holding the money for him and at his request, had returned
it to him on August 14. Mr. Borg had therefore sworn and placed
before the court a false affidavit in order to avoid complying
with the required condition of the adjournment, whether on August
14 or August 15.</pre>
    <pre>[8]    The conduct of Mr. Borg in this matter may be the subject
of more than one possible legal remedy and consequence both
within and outside these proceedings. However, in our view it
cannot form the basis for a finding of contempt because Justice
Zelinski did not order Mr. Borg to pay the money to his
solicitor, but rather made it a condition of an adjournment. Mr.
Borg  purported to avoid compliance by misleading the court and
the applicant as to his ability to comply. However he cannot be
considered to be in breach of a direct order of the court. The
remedy contemplated by the order of Zelinski J. if he did not
comply was that the adjournment would be peremptory against Mr.
Borg on August 15 and if he was not ready to proceed, the motion
could proceed to be argued by the applicant and granted against
him.</pre>
    <pre>[9]    Because the court applied the wrong remedy,  the appeal
must be allowed. In the circumstances, there will be no costs.</pre></td>
