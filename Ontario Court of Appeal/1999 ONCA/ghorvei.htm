</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Madam Justice S. Chapnik,
sitting with a jury, on October 26, 1994
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was
convicted of trafficking in heroin, possession of heroin and
breach of recognizance and was sentenced to a total term of
imprisonment of four and a half years. He appeals his conviction
and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.
[2]  The offence of trafficking relates to the appellant&#146;s
participation in a street sale of a quantity of heroin on May 5,
1994.  An exchange of drugs and money between Nemat Abdi, a
friend of the appellant's, and Charles Parker was observed by
Constable Torben Nielsen, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto
Police Force. Constable Nielsen also saw the appellant drive Mr.
Abdi to the scene and wait for him in the car while Mr. Abdi
walked a short distance away to meet with Mr. Parker and effect
the transaction.
[3]  The offence of possession of heroin relates to drugs found
in the appellant&#146;s possession when he was arrested by Constable
Nielsen at Mr. Abdi&#146;s apartment on May 11, 1994. At the time of
his arrest, the appellant was also found in possession of a pager
in contravention of one of the terms of a recognizance that the
appellant had entered into in relation to another charge.
[4]  The appellant raises three grounds in support of his
conviction appeal.
[5]  First, the appellant submits that Constable Nielsen did not
have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him without a
warrant on May 11, 1994. Consequently, he argues that the drugs
and the pager were found as a result of an illegal search in
contravention of his s.8 Charter rights and that this evidence
should be excluded pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter.
[6]  Second, the appellant submits that Crown counsel's cross-
examination of him was improper and resulted in an unfair trial.
[7]  Third, the appellant seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence
relating to Constable Nielsen&#146;s credibility. He submits that, if
this evidence had been available at trial, it would have been
admissible for the purpose of cross-examining Constable Nielsen.
He argues further that, because the verdicts in this case are
dependent upon Constable Nielsen&#146;s credibility, this evidence
would likely have affected the result of the trial.
[8]  I would dismiss the appeal for the following reasons.</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The arrest without a warrant
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant submits that Constable Nielsen did not have
sufficient reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him without
a warrant at Mr. Abdi&#146;s apartment on May 11, 1994. The relevant
authority to arrest without a warrant is found in s.495(1)(a) of
the Criminal Code:
          </pre>
    <pre>               s. 495    (1)  A peace officer may arrest without warrant
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  a person who has committed an
          indictable offence or who, on reasonable
          grounds, he believes has committed &#133; an
          indictable offence;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] Constable Nielsen relies on the events of May 5, 1994 in
support of his belief that the appellant committed an indictable
offence. The appellant submits that these events amounted to no
more than suspicion and were insufficient to empower the police
officer to make the subsequent arrest on May 11, 1994.
[11] At trial, the appellant brought an application to exclude
the evidence seized as a result of the search incidental to his
arrest on May 11, 1994 on the basis that the arrest was illegal.
The trial judge dismissed the application. She accepted Constable
Nielsen&#146;s testimony that he relied on the following circumstances
to arrest the appellant:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a) he recognized the appellant as the driver of the grey
Honda on May 5, 1994;
(b) he had information from a confidential source that led
him to suspect that the occupants of the vehicle might have been
engaged in drug trafficking;
(c) he had come into contact with the appellant previously,
as recently as two months prior to this event;
(d) he observed the passenger of the appellant&#146;s vehicle
engage in a drug transaction;
(e) the purchaser of the heroin told him that he had dealt
with the driver, known as &#147;Mike&#148; once before;
(f) he saw the grey Honda parked behind Mr. Abdi&#146;s
residence at 1252 Davenport where Mr. Abdi resided; and
(g) between May 5 and 11, he had passed by 1252 Davenport
and had seen the appellant get out of a red Jimmy which was
registered to Mr. Abdi.
</pre>
    <pre>[12] In my view, it was open to the trial judge to accept
Constable Nielsen&#146;s testimony and to conclude on the basis of
that evidence that the requirements of s.495(1)(a) were met.  The
trial judge further concluded that Constable Nielsen had
reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant was on the
premises at the time of the arrest, that Constable Nielsen made a
proper announcement of his intention to enter the apartment, and
that the entry into Mr. Abdi&#146;s apartment was not a forcible one.
These findings were also supported by the evidence.
[13] In these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with
the trial judge&#146;s finding that the arrest of the appellant
without a warrant in Mr. Abdi&#146;s residence was legal and that the
incidental search did not contravene s.8 of the Charter.
Consequently, the evidence obtained as a result of the search was
properly admitted at trial. Hence, I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  Cross-examination of the appellant</pre>
    <pre>[14] It is submitted that Crown counsel at trial engaged in a
cross-examination of the appellant that was improper and
prejudicial in three respects:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)       Crown counsel questioned the appellant as to any
possible motive on the  part of Constable Nielsen to make a false
accusation against him;
(b)       Crown counsel questioned the appellant about the fact
that he had accused the officer of &#147;stealing&#148; money from him and
suggested that the appellant had withheld that information from
the jury; and,
(c)       Crown counsel questioned the appellant about Mr. Abdi&#146;s
receipt of welfare benefits and about the origins of Mr. Abdi&#146;s
income.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The respondent concedes that Crown counsel&#146;s questions in
cross-examination regarding Constable Nielsen&#146;s motive to lie
were improper. The respondent also concedes that the questions
put to the appellant about his accusation that the officer had
stolen his money should not have been asked because they were not
relevant. The respondent submits, however, that in the context of
the entire cross-examination in this case, the impugned questions
constituted minor transgressions and would not have affected the
verdict.
[16] Finally, the respondent submits that the questions put to
the appellant with respect to Mr. Abdi&#146;s receipt of welfare
benefits and the origins of Mr. Abdi&#146;s income were relevant and
proper.
[17] I agree with the respondent&#146;s position on this ground of
appeal.
[18] The respondent correctly concedes that the cross-examination
of the appellant on the officer&#146;s possible motive to lie was
improper. This kind of cross-examination can potentially leave
the jury with the impression that an onus lies on the accused to
disprove the allegations. Whether or not the impugned questions
and answers may have had such an effect is a question, however,
that must be considered in the context of the full cross-
examination and the whole proceedings. In the context of this
case, I am satisfied that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred. Crown counsel did not press the issue
beyond asking a few questions, the jury would already have
understood from the evidence that it was the defence&#146;s position
at trial that Constable Nielsen was lying and the trial judge
properly instructed the jury on the burden of proof.
[19] The questions with respect to the appellant&#146;s complaint
against the officer over some missing money were also improper.
This evidence was irrelevant to any issues in the case. However,
it is my view that the brief reference to this complaint was,
when considered in context, inconsequential.
[20] Finally, the questions with respect to the appellant&#146;s
knowledge of Mr. Abdi&#146;s source of income were relevant to his
knowledge of Mr. Abdi&#146;s involvement in trafficking activities.
The appellant was charged with trafficking in heroin on May 5,
1994 as a party to Mr. Abdi&#146;s sale to Charles Parker. In order to
prove this charge, the Crown was required to prove that the
appellant knew that Mr. Abdi trafficked in heroin on that date.
[21] I would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  Application to introduce fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[22] In his application to introduce fresh evidence, the
appellant sought to introduce the transcripts of three unrelated
trials involving other accused persons in which Constable Nielsen
had testified and which resulted in acquittals. Two of these
trials, R. v. Downey and R. v. Willis, were held prior to the
appellant's trial and the third, R. v. Pappageorge, was held some
eight months after. The application is based on the contention
that the fresh evidence, if received, could have a significant
impact on Constable Nielsen&#146;s credibility since the evidence
would show, first, that Constable Nielsen gave contradictory
evidence in the Downey and Willis trials, and second, that his
credibility was called into question by the presiding judge in R.
v. Pappageorge.
[23] Crown counsel on appeal disputed the contention that
Constable Nielsen had given contradictory evidence in the Downey
and Willis cases and took the position that neither transcript of
those proceedings could have any impeachment potential. Counsel
for the appellant conceded at the hearing of this appeal that the
Crown&#146;s position with respect to the transcript in Downey and
Willis was correct and, therefore, confined his argument to the
transcript in Pappageorge.
[24] In Pappageorge, Constable Nielsen testified for the Crown on
the accused&#146;s application to exclude evidence under s.24(2) of
the Charter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge
granted the accused&#146;s application and excluded the evidence. In
his reasons, the trial judge indicated that he was not impressed
with Constable Nielsen. He rejected his testimony as being
&#147;false&#148; and concluded: &#147;I find that this officer is a compulsive
liar. I do not believe his evidence at all.&quot;
[25] Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge in
Pappageorge made a clear finding that Constable Nielsen had lied
under oath and that, if that finding had been available at the
appellant&#146;s trial for the purpose of cross-examining Constable
Nielsen, it could reasonably be expected to have affected the
result.  Consequently, the appellant seeks to admit this fresh
evidence on his appeal and seeks an order directing a new trial
on the basis of that evidence.
[26] The authority to admit fresh evidence on appeal is found in
s.683(1) of the Criminal Code. This court can admit fresh
evidence &#147;where it considers it in the interests of justice&#148; to
do so. The criteria for the admission of fresh evidence are set
out in the often cited case of Palmer  v. The Queen, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 759 at 775:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (i)  the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
          diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this
          general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal
          case as in civil cases: see McMartin v. The Queen, [1965] 1
          C.C.C. 142, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 372, [1964] S.C.R. 484;
(ii) the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears
upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial;
(iii)     the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief; and
(iv) it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
have affected the result.
</pre>
    <pre>[27] No question of due diligence arises in this case since the
evidence was not available until several months after the
appellant&#146;s trial was completed. The evidence is also relevant
within the meaning of the second Palmer criterion. The evidence
is about the credibility of a key Crown witness. Constable
Nielsen is the only witness who gave evidence implicating the
appellant. The evidence is also credible. There is no doubt that
the trial judge in Pappageorge made the findings sought to be
relied upon.
[28] The determining issue, therefore, is whether the evidence
could reasonably be expected to have affected the result at
trial. Of course, it could only have had any effect on the result
if it could have been used at trial to impeach Constable
Nielsen&#146;s credibility. The question then becomes whether a
witness can be cross-examined on a prior judicial finding that he
has lied under oath.
</pre>
    <pre>[29] If the prior judicial finding that Constable Nielsen lied
under oath had formed the basis of a conviction of perjury or of
giving contradictory evidence, it is clear that he could have
been subjected to cross-examination on that conviction and on its
underlying facts. See s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. C.-5; R. v. Miller (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (Ont.
C.A.). Constable Nielsen, as an ordinary witness and unlike an
accused person, would also be subject to cross-examination on
relevant discreditable conduct even if the conduct has not
resulted in a charge being laid or in a conviction. See R. v.
Gonzague (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 505 (Ont. C.A.).
[30] In this case, the judicial finding in Pappageorge that
Constable Nielsen&#146;s testimony was &#147;false&#148; and that he was &#147;a
compulsive liar&#148; was not made in the context of proceedings
concerning the truth or falsity of the testimony in question. Had
the finding been made in the context of a prosecution for perjury
or for the giving of contradictory testimony, Constable Nielsen
would have been given an opportunity to respond to the accusation
that he had lied under oath and the trial judge&#146;s finding would
have been subject to the criminal standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt. As the matter stands, the judicial finding in
question is nothing more than a rejection of Constable Nielsen&#146;s
testimony, albeit in very strong terms.
[31] In my view, it is not proper to cross-examine a witness on
the fact that his or her testimony has been rejected or
disbelieved in a prior case. That fact, in and of itself, does
not constitute discreditable conduct. I do not think it would be
useful to allow cross-examination of a witness on what is, in
essence, no more than an opinion on the credibility of unrelated
testimony given by this witness in the context of another case.
The triers of fact who would witness this cross-examination would
not be able to assess the value of that opinion and the effect,
if any, on the witness&#146;s credibility without also being provided
with the factual foundation for the opinion. This case, in fact,
provides a good example of the difficulties that would arise if
such cross-examination were permitted because, in my view, once
the finding is examined in the context of the whole record in
Pappageorge, it becomes apparent that it is essentially unfounded
and hence can provide no assistance in determining Constable
Nielsen&#146;s credibility.
[32] Upon considering the full transcript in Pappageorge, I am
unable to find support for the trial judge&#146;s finding that
Constable Nielsen is &#147;a compulsive liar&#148;. I can only surmise that
this statement is either the unfortunate result of judicial
intemperance or that the trial judge&#146;s conclusion is based on
extraneous considerations not properly before the court. I make
the first supposition on the basis that the transcript reveals
that the trial judge made a number of premature expressions of
incredulity with respect to Constable Nielsen&#146;s testimony while
he was testifying and before hearing the whole evidence. I make
the latter supposition based on the fact that the trial judge
stated in his reasons that he has &#147;known [the officer] for
years&#148;. It may well be that the trial judge was not impressed
with this witness but his finding must nonetheless be based on
evidence properly before him.
[33] Further, the trial judge&#146;s finding that the officer&#146;s
testimony was &#147;false&#148; does not appear to be reasonable on the
basis of the record before him. I note in this regard that the
trial judge also disbelieved most of Mr. Pappageorge&#146;s testimony,
yet, in the end analysis, it is on the basis of that testimony
that he finds Constable Nielsen&#146;s evidence to be &#147;false.&#148;  While
it was certainly open to the trial judge on the evidence to
reject the officer&#146;s evidence, I find little support for any
clear and express finding that the officer&#146;s testimony was
&#147;false&#148;, or, in other words, that he has lied under oath.
[34] Counsel for the appellant relies on this court&#146;s decision in
R. v. Malabre, [1997] O.J. No. 1109 in support of his contention
that the finding in Pappageorge would have had impeachment
potential at his trial had it been known. In Malabre, the
appellant argued that the trial judge had erred in refusing to
allow the cross-examination of a police officer on adverse
findings of credibility in a prior case. This court did not give
effect to this ground of appeal. However, the appellant relies on
the following statement by the court:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant also contended that the trial judge in the
          earlier case had made findings of credibility with respect to
          Pearson that were tantamount to a determination that he had lied
          under oath. We would find merit in the appellant&#146;s argument if
          there had been a clear and express finding to that effect.
          However, the findings of the trial judge in the earlier
          proceeding on Pearson&#146;s credibility are subject to
          interpretation. In the circumstances, we are not persuaded that
          the trial judge in this case erred by refusing to allow cross-
          examination on those findings. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[35] It is clear that it was not necessary to decide the issue in
Malabre, and, in my view, the obiter comments of the court should
not be taken to mean any more than the court would have
considered counsel&#146;s argument to be tenable had the facts
supported the contention that there had been a finding that the
witness had lied under oath.  However, given the record in
Malabre, the court did not see any merit in the argument.
[36] I would therefore conclude that the proposed fresh evidence
could not have been used at trial to impeach Constable Nielsen's
credibility.  It therefore fails to meet the fourth Palmer
criterion.
[37] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application to
introduce fresh evidence and would dismiss the appeal against
conviction.
[38] I would grant leave to appeal the sentence but dismiss the
appeal against sentence. In my view, there is no basis upon which
this court could interfere with the sentence imposed upon the
appellant. The trial judge made no error in principle and the
sentence imposed is not excessive.
