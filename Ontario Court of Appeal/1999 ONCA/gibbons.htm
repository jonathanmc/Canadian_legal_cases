    <pre>On appeal from the summary judgment of Madam Justice Ellen M.
Macdonald dated December 23, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal the dismissal of their action as
against the respondents Dr. M. Green, Dr. Jeffrey Knackstedt and
Dr. Michelle Long. The action was dismissed on a motion for
summary judgment on the grounds that: a) the claim for relief
under the Family Law Act R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (&#147;the FLA&quot;) could
not be supported because a foetus not born alive is not a person
within the meaning s.61(1) of the FLA; and b) the appellants&#146;
personal claim for damages was prescribed by reason of the one-
year limitation period under the Regulated Health Professions Act
1991, S.O. 1991, c. 18. The appellants concede that their claim
under the FLA cannot be supported. However, they appeal against
the dismissal of the balance of their action on the ground that
it is prescribed.
[2]  A statement of claim was issued on April 21, 1997. It was
subsequently amended on March 4, 1998 under Rule 26.02(a) of the
Rules of Civil Procedure. It is common ground between the parties
that the statement of claim was issued within the limitation
period. The respondents took the position, however, that the
appellants&#146; personal claim for damages was first brought as a new
cause of action in the amended pleading on March 4, 1998, at
which time the limitation period had expired. The motions judge
agreed with the respondents&#146; position. In our view, this was an
error.
[3]  A &#147;cause of action&#148; is defined as &#147;the fact or facts which
give a person a right to judicial redress or relief against
another&#148;:Black&#146;s Law Dictionary (6 ed.).All the material facts
supporting the appellants&#146; personal cause of action were pleaded
in the original statement of claim. Although the appellants were
incorrect in pleading that their right to redress or relief arose
under the FLA, it is our view that the original pleading
contained the facts upon which their personal cause of action
arises at common law and it asserted that a duty of care was owed
personally to them. Hence the subsequent amendment to the
pleading asserted no new cause of action.
[4]  It follows from these reasons that we are of the view that
the action was commenced within the limitation period and that
the motion for summary judgment should have been dismissed.
[5]  The appeal is allowed, the order of Ellen Macdonald J. is
set aside, and an order substituted dismissing the respondents'
motion for summary judgment.  The costs of the motion before
Ellen Macdonald J. and of the appeal will be costs in the cause.
