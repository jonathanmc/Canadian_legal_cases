    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Marianne Gignac, was seriously injured when
an uninsured motor vehicle collided with the motor vehicle in
which she was a passenger. This appeal raises questions
concerning the extent to which the respondents, Canadian General
Insurance Company (&quot;Canadian General&quot;) and State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (&quot;State Farm&quot;), are liable to
compensate Ms. Gignac for her injuries. The questions for
determination hinge on the interpretation of the applicable
legislation with respect to State Farm' s policy and the
interpretation of the S.E.F. 44 endorsement under Canadian
General's policy. The appeal is from a determination of questions
of law made by Zuber J. under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended.</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The motor vehicle accident occurred on November 15, 1991.
Hence the governing legislation is the Insurance Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. I.8 (&quot;the Act&quot;). This legislation introduced the no-
fault principle of liability which governs in cases of accidents
occurring after June 21, 1990 and prior to January 1, 1994. This
regime of compensation is commonly referred to as &quot;Bill 68&quot; in
reference to its original enactment.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  State Farm is the insurer of the motor vehicle in which Ms.
Gignac was a passenger and, as such, its policy provides
uninsured motorist coverage for Ms. Gignac. The limit of
uninsured motorist coverage under State Farm's policy is
$200,000. Ms. Gignac maintained her own automobile insurance
coverage with Canadian General, including S.E.F. 44 underinsured
motorist coverage. The limit of underinsured coverage under
Canadian General's policy is $500,000. Canadian General also
provides coverage for the no-fault benefits to which Ms. Gignac
is entitled under the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Under s. 266(1) of the Act, Ms. Gignac is precluded from
suing in tort unless she has sustained permanent and serious
physical injuries as a result of the accident. It is assumed for
the purpose of this proceeding that Ms. Gignac can meet this test
and that, consequently, she can look to State Farm and Canadian
General for the recovery of both her pecuniary and non-pecuniary
damages. It is further assumed that Ms. Gignac's damages will
exceed the limits under either policy. In fact, Ms. Gignac
estimates that her damages will be approximately $1,200,000.</pre>
    <pre>Position of the Parties on State Farm's Liability</pre>
    <pre>[5]  State Farm takes the position that it is entitled to reduce
its $200,000 limit by the amount of no-fault benefits received by
Ms. Gignac from Canadian General and by the amount of disability
benefits paid to her under the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-8 (&quot;CPP&quot; ). Hence, if Ms. Gignac were to receive more than
$200,000 in benefits, State Farm's liability would be zero. State
Farm relies on the applicable statutory provisions in support of
its position.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The motions judge agreed with State Farm's position with
respect to the deductibility of both the no-fault benefits and
the CPP disability benefits. Ms. Gignac appeals against these
findings. First, she takes the position that State Farm is not
entitled to deduct the no-fault benefits from its $200,000 limit.
She argues, rather, that the no-fault benefits are to be deducted
from the total award of damages to the extent that these benefits
correspond to a particular head of damage. If this method is
adopted, the resulting award would still far exceed the limits
under State Farm's policy and, hence, it would remain liable to
the extent of $200,000. Second, Ms. Gignac takes the position
that CPP disability benefits are not deductible at all by State
Farm. Ms. Gignac also relies on the applicable statutory
provisions in support of her position.</pre>
    <pre>Position of the Parties on Canadian General's liability</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Canadian General takes the position that it is entitled to
reduce its $500,000 limit by the amount of State Farm's $200,000
limit regardless of the actual payments made by State Farm. It
therefore argues that its maximum liability is $300,000 whether
State Farm is liable to pay $200,000 to Ms. Gignac or zero.
Canadian General relies on the wording of the S.E.F. 44
endorsement in support of its position.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The motions judge agreed with Canadian General's position.
Ms. Gignac appeals against this finding. She takes the position
that Canadian General is only entitled to reduce its limit by any
amount actually paid by State Farm. Hence, Ms. Gignac argues
that, if State Farm is entitled to deduct the no-fault and CPP
benefits from its $200,000 as it contends &#150; thereby  reducing its
liability to zero, Canadian General would remain liable to the
full extent of its $500,000 limit.  If, on the other hand, State
Farm is not entitled to deduct the benefits and is liable to the
extent of its $200,000 limit, Ms. Gignac agrees that Canadian
General's limit would be reduced to $300,000.</pre>
    <pre>The Issues</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Three questions are therefore raised on this appeal:
     1.   Is State Farm entitled to deduct the amount of
          statutory no-fault benefits paid to Ms. Gignac from its
          uninsured motorist coverage limit of $200,000?
     2.   Is State Farm entitled to deduct the amount of CPP
          disability benefits paid to Ms. Gignac from its
          uninsured motorist coverage limit of $200,000?
     3.   Is Canadian General entitled to deduct the amount of
          State Farm's $200,000 uninsured motorist coverage from
          its underinsured motorist coverage limit regardless of
          the actual payments made by State Farm?</pre>
    <pre>[10] In my view, the answer to question one is no and the answer
to questions two and three is yes.</pre>
    <pre>Deductibility of No-Fault Benefits</pre>
    <pre>[11] The answer to the first question hinges on the
interpretation of s. 265(1) of the Act and regulations
thereunder. Subsection 265(1) provides that every contract of
automobile insurance must provide coverage to the insured for
damages recoverable from the owner or driver of an uninsured or
unidentified automobile for bodily injuries, damage to the
automobile and contents and dependants'  claims. It is in
accordance with this provision that State Farm provides uninsured
motorist coverage. Ms. Gignac claims damages for bodily injuries
under this coverage pursuant to s. 265(1)(a) of the Act. It reads
as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          265(1) Uninsured automobile coverage - Every
          contract evidenced by a motor vehicle
          liability policy shall provide for payment of
          all sums that,</pre>
    <pre>               (a) a person insured under the contract
               is legally entitled to recover from the
               owner or driver of an uninsured
               automobile or unidentified automobile as
               damages for bodily injuries resulting
               from an accident involving an
               automobile;</pre>
    <pre>               ...</pre>
    <pre>          subject to the terms, conditions, provisions,
          exclusions and limits as are prescribed by
          the regulations. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[12] According to this coverage, Ms. Gignac is entitled to
recover from State Farm all sums that she is legally entitled to
recover against the uninsured driver as damages for bodily
injuries.  State Farm correctly notes that its liability under
s. 265(1)(a) is &quot;subject to... the regulations.&quot;  The operative
regulation is Reg. 676, R.R.O. 1990. Both ss. 2(1)(a) and (b) of
Reg. 676 apply to this case. Subsection 2(1)(a) sets out the
monetary limit for the uninsured automobile coverage:</pre>
    <pre>          s.2(1) The insurer shall not be liable to
          make any payment,</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  for any amount in excess of the minimum
               limits for automobile liability
               insurance in the jurisdiction in which
               the accident occurs regardless of the
               number of persons injured or killed or
               the damage to the automobile and
               contents, and in no event shall the
               insurer be liable for any amount in
               excess of the minimum limits set out in
               section 251 of the Act;</pre>
    <pre>[13] Section 251 of the Act sets the limit at $200,000. It is not
disputed that State Farm's liability under the uninsured
automobile coverage cannot exceed $200,000. However, as stated
earlier, State Farm takes the position that this amount is first
reduced by the amount of no-fault benefits paid by Canadian
General pursuant to s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676. It provides as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          2(1) The insurer shall not be liable to make
          any payment,</pre>
    <pre>               (b) where a person insured under the
               contract is entitled to recover money
               under any valid policy of insurance
               other than money payable on death,
               except for the difference between such
               entitlement and the relevant minimum
               limits determined under clause (a).</pre>
    <pre>[14] State Farm takes the position that, given their plain
meaning, the words &quot;money under any valid policy of insurance&quot;
include the statutory no-fault benefits paid to Ms. Gignac by
Canadian General. It therefore argues that, on the plain wording
of the regulation, it is &quot;not liable to make any payment ...
except for the difference between [the amount of no-fault
benefits received by Ms. Gignac] and the relevant minimum limits
[of  $200,000]&quot;.  Hence, it is argued that, if Ms. Gignac
receives $200,000 in no-fault benefits, State Farm's liability
would be reduced to zero.</pre>
    <pre>[15] State Farm relies on Heney v. Ontario Superintendent of
Insurance (1983), 1 C.C.L.I. 68 (Ont. H.C.J.), aff' d [1984] O.J.
No. 63 (C.A.) in support of its position. In Heney, the same
issue arose as to what deductions were to be made from the amount
payable under the uninsured automobile coverage. O'Brien J.
considered language identical to the provisions under
consideration in this case and concluded as follows at p. 80:</pre>
    <pre>          In my view, these words are clear and
          unambiguous and the defendant insurer is
          entitled to deduct from the policy limits
          amounts it paid the plaintiff under the
          accident benefit section of its policy&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>While this court, on appeal from O' Brien J.' s judgment, did not
address this issue in its reasons, it confirmed the decision with
minor variations.  In the present case, the motions judge was of
the view that he was bound to follow Heney and therefore
concluded that State Farm could deduct the statutory no-fault
benefits paid to Ms. Gignac from the limits of its uninsured
motorist coverage.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The same issue was raised before this court in the
subsequent decision of Quiroz v. Wallace (1998), 40 O.R. (3d)
737.  In Quiroz, the question raised by the insurer was whether
it was entitled to deduct the amount of statutory accident
benefits paid to an insured from the uninsured motorist coverage
limit of $200,000. This court considered the identical statutory
language (s. 265(1) of the Act and s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676) and
concluded that the benefits were not deductible. Heney was
distinguished on the basis that the motor vehicle accident in
Quiroz occurred at a time when a different statutory compensation
regime was in place. Hence, this court held that the identical
wording of the legislation acquired a different meaning when
interpreted in the context of the later regime in Quiroz.</pre>
    <pre>[17] This case deals with yet another legislative regime of
compensation. The question then arises whether the statutory
provisions in question should be interpreted as they were in
Heney or as they were in Quiroz. In my view, they should be
interpreted as in Quiroz, in part for some of the reasons set out
in that case, and for other reasons particular to this regime.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Before giving my reasons for arriving at that conclusion, it
may be useful to set out a brief summary of the various regimes
of automobile insurance in effect in Ontario at different times
during the past decade. This summary also appears in Quiroz at
743-44. For ease of reference, I will identify each regime in
this summary by the case names referable to it whenever it is
applicable.
*    Full tort: the Heney regime
     Prior to June 1990, motor vehicle accident victims had full
     access to the courts to sue for damages against parties who
     were at fault. A schedule of modest no-fault accident
     benefits for all injured persons accompanied this
     unrestricted access to tort recovery.  The no-fault benefits
     were deductible from the judgment.</pre>
    <pre>*    Bill 68: the Gignac regime (also the Ly and Tuplin regime)1
     *    In June 1990, the Ontario Motorist Protection Plan (OMPP, or
     Bill 68) was implemented introducing a &quot;threshold no-fault&quot;
     plan. This regime governs in cases of accidents occurring after
     June 21, 1990 and prior to January 1, 1994. The OMPP provided
     compensation for injured persons through a fixed schedule of
     accident benefits to be paid regardless of fault: s. 268(1). The
     role of the tort system in auto accident compensation was reduced
     substantially reserving the right to sue only to the victims of
     the most serious and permanent physical injuries, or death:
     s. 266(1). Those victims entitled to resort to the tort system
     under the OMPP could sue for pecuniary as well as non-pecuniary
     losses.  Section 274 of the Act under this regime provided that
     payments made or available to a person under the No-Fault
     Benefits Schedule constituted a release of any claim under both
     s. 268(1) [no-fault benefits] and s. 265(1), the uninsured
     automobile coverage.
*    Bill 164: the Quiroz regime
     Accidents that occurred on or after January 1, 1994 and
     prior to November 1, 1996 are governed by the Bill 164
     regime. Under Bill 164, a comprehensive system of enriched
     accident benefits was made available to all accident victims
     to protect against pecuniary losses, regardless of fault.
     This comprehensive system of structured benefit compensation
     was intended to eliminate the need to sue for pecuniary
     losses in all cases. Therefore, the Act specifically limited
     the right to sue for non-pecuniary loss only. At the same
     time, it allowed for greater access to the tort system for
     recovery of non-pecuniary losses for the seriously injured
     by redefining the threshold which had to be met. The release
     provision, s. 274, was replaced with a new section 274 which
     deleted any reference to s. 265(1) [uninsured automobile
     coverage] for accidents occurring after the coming into
     force of Bill 164.</pre>
    <pre>*    The post-1996 regime
     *    For accidents after November 1, 1996, (Bill 59) the injured
     person is entitled to statutory accident benefits as compensation
     for pecuniary losses. If the injuries meet a certain threshold,
     or are catastrophic, the victim can sue in tort for non-pecuniary
     losses and for some pecuniary losses. Statutory accident benefits
     are to be deducted from the judgment, but under a procedure that
     differs from OMPP (Bill 68).</pre>
    <pre>[19] This court held in Quiroz that the intent of s. 2(1)(b) of
Reg. 676 is to prevent double recovery. The court then
distinguished Heney on the following basis (at 744):</pre>
    <pre>          ... the motions judge was correct in
          concluding that the statutory accident
          benefits are not deductible under s. 2(1)(b)
          of Regulation 676 from the amount payable
          under the uninsured automobile coverage. The
          legislative context is not the same as it was
          in Heney. In Heney,  an insured could recover
          damages for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary
          losses under the uninsured automobile
          coverage. As set out earlier, it is clear
          that under Bill 164, the insurer's liability
          under its uninsured automobile coverage is
          restricted to payment of damages for non-
          pecuniary loss. Hence, if the purpose of
          s. 2(1)(b) of Regulation 676 is to prevent
          double recovery, it only makes sense to
          interpret the words &#147;money under any valid
          policy of insurance&quot;  to mean money recovered
          in compensation for non-pecuniary loss
          because in other situations there is no
          double recovery.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Of course, this distinction does not apply when the Heney
regime is compared to Bill 68, the regime in question in this
case. Under Bill 68, a victim of a motor vehicle accident who is
severely injured and meets the threshold test, such as Ms.
Gignac, can recover both pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses from
the tortfeasor. Hence, if any pecuniary damages are recovered
from State Farm, there could potentially be some double recovery
if any of the no-fault benefits compensating the same pecuniary
losses are not deducted. This double recovery could not happen
under the Quiroz regime because an injured party simply could not
sue for pecuniary losses. However,  as was the case in Quiroz,
there are other reasons that favour the insured's position.</pre>
    <pre>[21] As stated earlier, Ms. Gignac does not take the position
that she should recover twice for any loss. Rather, she submits
that the no-fault benefits paid to her by Canadian General are to
be deducted from the total damages claimed against State Farm.
This deduction is provided for in s. 267(1) of the Act:</pre>
    <pre>          s.267(1) Collateral Source Rule Not to Apply.
          The damages awarded to a person in a
          proceeding for loss or damage arising
          directly or indirectly from the use or
          operation of an automobile shall be reduced
          by,</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  all payments that the person has
                    received or that were or are
                    available for no-fault benefits and
                    by the present value of any no-
                    fault benefits to which the person
                    is entitled. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[22] Hence, for example, assuming that her damages total
$1,200,000 as estimated, and that she receives $200,000 in no-
fault benefits from Canadian General, Ms. Gignac states that she
could only claim the sum of $1,000,000 against State Farm under
its s. 265(1) uninsured motorist coverage. Thus, there would be
no double recovery.  Of course, State Farm would be liable only
to the extent of its $200,000 limit.</pre>
    <pre>[23] It assists further to understand Ms. Gignac's position if a
comparison is made between her case and the case of a less
injured plaintiff. Under Ms. Gignac's suggested approach, where a
plaintiff' s damages total $250,000 and $75,000 are received in
no-fault benefits, the uninsured motorist coverage would be
reduced to $175,000, as compared to Ms. Gignac's $200,000
recovery. If, on the other hand, State Farm's position is
adopted, the less injured plaintiff in this example would still
recover $125,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage while Ms.
Gignac would recover nothing. It is argued that it is only
sensible to infer that the legislator intended that the more
severely injured party receive greater compensation.</pre>
    <pre>[24] I find the appellant's argument compelling. Subsection
2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 must be interpreted in the context of the
other provisions of the Act. The court must respect the intent of
the legislature as much as possible. When all the provisions of
Bill 68 that are applicable to this case are considered together,
it seems clear to me that the legislature intended the following:
a)   that all persons injured in motor vehicle accidents receive
     no-fault benefits to compensate for their losses
     (s. 268(1));</pre>
    <pre>b)   that only the most severely injured be entitled to receive
     compensation from the tortfeasor (s.266(1));</pre>
    <pre>c)   that there be no double recovery from any such tortfeasor
     for items listed under s.267(1), which include no-fault
     benefits;</pre>
    <pre>d)   that all insurers provide uninsured motorist coverage for
     damages calculated under s. 267(1) so as to ensure a &quot;safety
     net&quot;  for victims injured by the actions of uninsured
     motorists (s. 265(1));</pre>
    <pre>e)   that this safety net be limited to a certain amount
     (s. 2(1)(a) of Reg.676); and</pre>
    <pre>f)   that there be no double recovery from the funds available
     under this safety net (s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676).</pre>
    <pre>[25] If State Farm's position were adopted, the no-fault benefits
would be deducted first under s. 267(1) and then again under
s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676, resulting in a double deduction. It would
also lead to the result that, in circumstances like those in this
appeal, mandatory uninsured coverage is illusory and worthless.
It is not clear to me that the legislature intended this result.
I think, rather, that the interpretation urged by State Farm
leads to an absurd result and should be avoided if possible.</pre>
    <pre>[26] When read in context, I am of the view that it is reasonable
to interpret s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 as requiring that a deduction
be made from the uninsured motorist coverage only for those no-
fault benefits that have not already been deducted under
s. 267(1). This is the only interpretation that achieves the dual
purpose of preventing double recovery and providing compensation
to the most severely injured from the tortfeasor (or,
alternatively, from the insurance provider who steps in the shoes
of the tortfeasor under the uninsured motorist coverage).
[1]
[27] I am not unmindful that this interpretation does not accord
with a narrow reading of the words in s. 2(1)(b). I am
nonetheless of the view that this interpretation is reasonably
open when the provision is read in context and with its purpose
in mind. As noted in Quiroz, this approach is consistent with the
reasoning in other decisions of this court. The following excerpt
from Quiroz is equally applicable to this case (at 745-46):</pre>
    <pre>          This court followed a similar reasoning in
          the recent decision of Bannon v. McNeely
          (1998), 159 D.L.R. (4th) 223 with respect to
          another provision of the Act as it read under
          the OMPP regime. The provision under
          consideration provided as follows:</pre>
    <pre>               s.267(1) Collateral Source Rule Not to
               Apply. The damages awarded to a person
               in a proceeding for loss or damage
               arising directly or indirectly from the
               use or operation of an automobile shall
               be reduced by,</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  all payments that the person has
                    received or that were or are
                    available for no-fault benefits and
                    by the present value of any no-
                    fault benefits to which the person
                    is entitled. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>          Despite the very wide language, Finlayson
          J.A., writing for the court, concluded that
          in light of the fact that the purpose of the
          section was to prevent double recovery, at
          pp. 243-44:</pre>
    <pre>               ... any no-fault benefit deducted from a
               tort award under s. 267(1)(a) must be
               deducted from a head of damage or type
               of loss akin to that for which the no-
               fault benefits were intended to
               compensate... It follows further from
               this conclusion that if the no-fault
               deduction exceeds the amount awarded
               under the specific head of damages to
               which the no-fault benefits can be
               attributed, then there cannot be resort
               to another portion of the tort judgment
               for the balance.</pre>
    <pre>          In adopting this interpretation, Finlayson
          J.A. referred to the principle of statutory
          interpretation &quot;that courts are to respect
          the intent of the legislature as much as
          possible, and therefore a section of a
          statute should be read to comply with the
          legislative text, promote the legislative
          purpose, and produce a reasonable and just
          meaning&quot;  (at p. 244).</pre>
    <pre>          It is my view that the interpretation
          advocated by Lloyd's [the same as State
          Farm's position in this case], while
          compliant with the legislative text, does not
          promote the legislative purpose. Nor does it
          produce a reasonable and just result. This
          latter conclusion is reached when a
          comparison is made to the compensation
          provided under the Motor Vehicle Accident
          Claims Act for victims of motor vehicle
          accidents who do not have access to any
          insurance coverage. This comparison is a
          valid one since the uninsured motorist
          coverage under the Insurance Act was intended
          to, and does indeed, take the place of the
          Fund in all but some peculiar situations such
          as where the uninsured motorist strikes a
          pedestrian who has no access to automobile
          insurance or in circumstances where all the
          parties to the accident are uninsured.</pre>
    <pre>          This court, in Bazzi v. Superintendent of
          Insurance (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 77, held that,
          under the terms of the relevant statutory
          provision, no fault benefits are not
          deductible from the Fund limit of $200,000.
          It would be anomalous that a private
          insurance carrier could do so. It would
          result in accident victims being better off
          without insurance coverage since they could
          receive their statutory accident benefits and
          would also be entitled to recover their tort
          claim from the Fund limits for non-pecuniary
          loss.</pre>
    <pre>[28] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal on the question
of deductibility of no-fault benefits. Accordingly, State Farm is
not entitled to deduct the no-fault benefits paid by Canadian
General from its $200,000 limit. Rather, the no-fault benefits
are to be deducted from the total award of damages in accordance
with Bannon v. McNeely.</pre>
    <pre>Deductibility of CPP disability benefits</pre>
    <pre>[29] State Farm takes the position that the CPP disability
benefits received by Ms. Gignac constitute &quot;money under any valid
policy of insurance&quot;  within the meaning of s. 2(1)(b) of
Reg. 676 and are deductible from its $200,000 limit. For
convenience, I reproduce the text of the regulation:
          2(1) The insurer shall not be liable to make
          any payment,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) where a person insured under the
               contract is entitled to recover money
               under any valid policy of insurance
               other than money payable on death,
               except for the difference between such
               entitlement and the relevant minimum
               limits determined under clause (a).
               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[30] State Farm relies on Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Gill (1973),
37 D.L.R. (3d) 229 (S.C.C.) for its position. In Gill a widow and
her children claimed damages for the wrongful death of Gill. A
question arose whether CPP benefits payable to the plaintiffs as
a result of Gill's death should be taken into account in the
calculation of damages. The question turned on the interpretation
of s. 4(4) of the Families&#146; Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1960,
c. 138 which provided as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          In assessing damages there shall not be taken
          into account any sum paid or payable on the
          death of the deceased under any contract of
          assurance or insurance. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[31] The Supreme Court considered the nature of the CPP and
concluded that pensions payable under it &quot;are so much of the same
nature as contracts of insurance that they also should be
excluded from consideration when assessing damages under the
provisions of that statute&quot;.  Spence J., in writing for the
court, made the following comparison between the CPP and a
contract of insurance (at 239-40):</pre>
    <pre>          ... persons in the class of pensionable
          persons are required by statute to make a
          contribution to the pension plan; the
          employer makes contribution, and then a
          pension is payable on retirement or upon
          becoming disabled, or a pension is payable to
          the widow and dependent children upon the
          death of the contributor. The plan,
          therefore, is an exact substitute for a
          privately arranged insurance policy made
          between the deceased person and an insurance
          company with the benefits payable upon the
          death or disablement of the insured. There is
          an element of risk to both the contributor
          under the Canada Pension Plan and to the
          Government which pays the benefits under the
          Plan. It may well be that a person who is a
          contributor may make but a few payments and
          then become disabled and be paid pension
          amounts over a long period, on the other
          hand, the contributor may contribute for a
          very long number of years and then upon
          retirement die within a few months so that
          very little pension benefit is obtained.</pre>
    <pre>          There are, of course, many forms of insurance
          and surely one of them may be considered to
          be the social insurance now exemplified by
          the Canada Pension Plan. In so far as the
          word &quot;contract&quot;  is concerned, there is, in
          result, a contract between the contributor to
          the Canada Pension Plan and the Government
          which, by virtue of the statute, exacts from
          such contributor weekly deductions from his
          wages. One must keep in mind the evident
          remedial character of s. 4(4) of the
          Families&#146; Compensation Act. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] The motions judge held that Gill was determinative of the
issue. Consequently, he held that the CPP disability benefits
received by Ms. Gignac were monies paid under &quot;a valid policy of
insurance&quot; within the meaning of s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 and,
consequently deductible from State Farm's $200,000 limit.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The appellant seeks to distinguish Gill on the basis that it
dealt with the deductibility of CPP death benefits, not CPP
disability benefits. In my view, there is nothing in the
reasoning of the Supreme Court in Gill that would support this
court drawing this distinction. It is clear, even from the short
excerpt noted above, that the Supreme Court considered both death
and disability CPP benefits to be akin to monies payable under a
contract of insurance.</pre>
    <pre>[34] The appellant argues further that, even if the CPP is to be
equated to a contract of insurance, the disability benefits
payable thereunder fall into a completely different class than
the uninsured motorist benefits. She argues that CPP disability
payments are non-indemnity payments and that, as such, they
should not be deducted from the indemnity payments payable under
the uninsured motorist coverage. I do not find this argument of
assistance in interpreting s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The categorization of payments as either indemnity or non-
indemnity is more relevant where the statutory provision
providing the reduction of damages imports a notion of
indemnification.  For instance, in Cugliari v. White (1998),38
O.R. (3d) 641 this court held that CPP disability benefits were
not deductible as payments for loss of income under s. 267(1)(c)
of the Act. The distinction between indemnity and non-indemnity
payments was more relevant in that case because the words under
s. 267(1)(c) themselves imported a notion of indemnification.
Section 267(1)(c) provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          s. 267(1) The damages awarded to a person in
          a proceeding for loss or damage arising
          directly or indirectly from the use or
          operation of an automobile shall be reduced
          by,</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  all payments that the person has
               received or that were or are available
               for loss of income under the laws of any
               jurisdiction or under an income
               continuation plan and by the present
               value of any such payments to which the
               person is entitled;</pre>
    <pre>[36] This court concluded that the CPP disability benefits did
not constitute &quot;payments... for loss of income&quot; within the
meaning of s. 267(1)(c) largely on the basis that the eligibility
conditions for CPP disability benefits do not require that the
recipient be employed at the time of the disability or that the
recipient demonstrate a pecuniary loss. The same considerations
regarding the imported notion of indemnification do not apply
when one considers the wording of s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676.</pre>
    <pre>[37] The result in Cugliari is nonetheless relevant to the
question for consideration in this appeal. It is clear from
Cugliari that CPP disability benefits are not deductible from the
calculation of damages under s. 267(1)(c) and, consequently, a
deduction under s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 would not result in any
double deductibility.</pre>
    <pre>[38] Finally, the appellant argues that the legislature could not
have intended that the very seriously injured who receive CPP
benefits in excess of $200,000 receive no compensation from the
uninsured coverage.  In  my view, this possible result does not
detract from the clear intent to prevent double recovery. The
deduction of CPP disability benefits under s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676
does prevent double recovery where, as in this case, disability
benefits are payable as a consequence of the accident.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Of course this court is bound by Gill and I see no
principled reason to distinguish it. Consequently, I agree with
the motions judge that Gill is determinative of the issue of
deductibility of CPP disability benefits in this case. These
benefits constitute payments under &quot;any valid policy of
insurance&quot; within the meaning of s. 2(1)(b) and are deductible
from State Farm's policy limits.
[1]
[40] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on this issue.</pre>
    <pre>Canadian General's limits under the S.E.F. No. 44 endorsement</pre>
    <pre>[41] At issue is the extent of Canadian General's liability for
underinsured coverage under the S.E.F. No. 44 Family Protection
Endorsement of its policy. As stated earlier, the limit under the
policy is $500,000. Canadian General, however, takes the position
that its limit is reduced by the limit of $200,000 under State
Farm's policy by reason of the following paragraphs of the S.E.F.
No. 44 endorsement.</pre>
    <pre>[42] Paragraph 3(a) of the endorsement reads as follows:
          3. Limit of Coverage Under This Endorsement
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a) The insurer's maximum liability under
          this endorsement, regardless of the number of
          eligible claimants, or number of insured
          persons injured or killed, or number of
          automobiles insured under the policy shall be
          the amount by which the Limit of Family
          Protection Coverage exceeds the total of all
          limits of motor vehicle liability insurance,
          or bonds, or cash deposits, or other
          financial guarantees as required by law in
          lieu of such insurance, of the inadequately
          insured motorist and of any person jointly
          liable therewith. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[43] It is common ground between the parties that the uninsured
coverage under State Farm's policy constitutes &quot;motor vehicle
liability insurance&quot; within the meaning of paragraph 3(a).
Paragraph 1(e)(ii) of the endorsement expressly provides as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          ... for the purpose of determining the limit
          of coverage under paragraph 3 of this
          endorsement, uninsured motorist coverage
          available to the eligible claimant shall be
          taken into account as if it were motor
          vehicle liability insurance with the limits
          stated to be those of the uninsured motorist
          coverage. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[44] Ms. Gignac argues that, reasonably construed, these
paragraphs mean that the actual  insurance benefits must be
available to her before the underinsurer can diminish its
obligation. In other words, she argues that Canadian General can
only deduct from its $500,000 limit the amount of money actually
paid to her by State Farm.</pre>
    <pre>[45] In my view, the position advanced by the appellant simply
ignores the use of the word &quot;limit&quot; in the above-noted
paragraphs. By its terms, the extent of underinsured coverage
under the S.E.F. No. 44 is clearly defined in reference to the
limits of other policies and not to the payments or the benefits
that may be payable thereunder.</pre>
    <pre>[46] I agree with the motions judge that Canadian General's
position is supported by the plain meaning of the endorsement.
The appellant has not persuaded me that there is any reason to
depart from this plain meaning. Consequently, I would dismiss the
appeal on this issue. It is my view that, by the terms of the
policy, Canadian General's liability is limited to $300,000
regardless of the actual payments made by State Farm.</pre>
    <pre>Costs</pre>
    <pre>[47] Given the divided success, I would award the appellant one-
half of its costs against State Farm. I would also award Canadian
General its costs of the appeal.
