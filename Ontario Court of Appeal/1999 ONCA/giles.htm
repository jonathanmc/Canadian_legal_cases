    <pre>HEARD:         October 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mossip J. dated October 29, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, on the factual record before us, it would not
be appropriate to address the important issue of  principle
raised by the appellant.  The trial judge noted that the evidence
with regard to the payment of the child&#146;s expenses ought to have
been more carefully prepared and presented and he proceeded on
the basis that the mother was paying $230 per month towards those
expenses.
[2]  The issue raised before us does not appear to have been put
squarely to the trial judge or to Justice Mossip on appeal.  It
remains open to the appellant to raise the issue relating to
contributions from third parties, including the grandparents, on
a variation application.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed, in the circumstances, without
costs.</pre>
