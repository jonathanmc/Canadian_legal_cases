    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of the Divisional Court (Southey,
Forestell and Corbett JJ.) dated December 9, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A. (dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The respondent Gillies Lumber Inc. supplied lumber to  four
residential housing projects.  It registered a general lien under
s.20(1)  of  the  Construction Lien  Act1  against  each  of  the
projects  for  the price of the lumber supplied  to  all  of  the
projects.  Gillies now concedes that it had no right to  register
a general lien.  The question on this appeal is whether the court
should   preserve  Gillies&#146;  liens  by  applying   the   curative
provisions of s.6 of the Act.
[2]  On a motion by the receiver and manager of two of the
projects, Mossop J. vacated Gillies&#146; general lien.  His order was
reversed by the Divisional Court (Southey, Forestell and Corbett
JJ.), which permitted Gillies to convert its general lien into
four valid specific liens.  Bradford Enterprises (Cambridge) Inc.
and Kubassek Homes (K-W) Ltd., the registered owners of two of
the projects, and PW Capital Inc. appeal to this court.  For the
reasons that follow, I would hold that, because of s. 6, Gillies&#146;
general lien is not invalid.  I would therefore dismiss the
motion brought by the receiver and manager to vacate Gillies&#146;
claims for lien.</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  four  projects to which Gillies supplied  lumber  were
known  as the Shadow West Project, the Village Project,  the  Ayr
Project and the Plattsville Project.  Each project was located in
a  different  city  and  each project had a  separate  registered
owner, although all four projects came under the umbrella of  the
Kubassek group of companies.
[4]  Gillies admitted that it did not have one written contract
for the four projects.  Individual contracts were formed by
Gillies issuing quotations and, in response, the project owner
issuing purchase orders for the supply of lumber to that project.
Gillies also admitted that it was instructed to and agreed to
invoice separately the company responsible for building each
project.  The details of each project, including its registered
owner, the amount Gillies invoiced and the amount of the lien
Gillies registered are set out in the following chart:

    <pre>[5]   The  dealings  between the parties  on  each  project  were
generally  the  same.   Each project owner requested  Gillies  to
supply  lumber to that project.  Gillies assigned each project  a
separate customer I.D. number.  Gillies then issued quotations to
each  project owner.  In turn, the project owner issued  purchase
orders  to  Gillies for the supply of lumber.  Separate contracts
were formed when the quotation was accepted by the issuance of  a
purchase  order.  As  instructed, Gillies invoiced  each  project
owner  separately, and delivered monthly statements showing  only
the amount owing for lumber supplied to that project.
[6]  As the chart shows, the total amount owing to Gillies for
the four projects was $307,396.02.  On January 18 and 19, 1996,
Gillies registered a general lien against each of the four
projects for this total amount.  To perfect its lien, it then
registered certificates of action in accordance with the Act.
Gillies registered a general lien instead of specific liens for
the amount owing on each project, apparently because it believed
that it was only dealing with Kubassek Holdings Ltd.  Gillies,
however, never told the appellants that it would treat the four
projects as one for lien purposes.  Indeed, Gillies registered a
general lien even though it knew that each project had a separate
registered owner, knew how much lumber it had supplied to each
project and knew how much was owing on each project.
[7]  Section 20(1) of the Act provides for the registration of a
general lien:
          </pre>
    <pre>                20.  (1) Where an owner enters into a single contract
      for improvements on more than one premises of the owner, any
      person supplying services or materials under that contract, or
      under a subcontract under that contract, may choose to have the
      person&#146;s lien follow the form of the contract and be a general
      lien against each of those premises for the price of all services
      and materials the person supplied to all the premises.</pre>
    <pre>The  owners  of  the four projects did not enter  into  a  single
contract  with  Gillies  for  the  supply  of  lumber.   Gillies,
therefore, concedes that it did not have any right to register  a
general  lien  against the four projects.  After the registration
of  its  general lien, the four projects ground to a  halt.   The
secured lender of the Village and Shadow West projects obtained a
court  order approving BDO Dunwoody as receiver and manager  over
the  assets  of  the owners of those two projects,  Bradford  and
Kubassek (K-W).</pre>
    <pre>[8]   On  September 4, 1996, on a motion brought by BDO Dunwoody,
Mossop  J.  vacated  the  liens and the  certificates  of  action
because  there  were separate contracts between Gillies  and  the
owner of each project.  He held:
          </pre>
    <pre>              I think the only factual conclusion that one can make is
         that there were four independent contractual relationships
         between Kubassek Homes (K-W) Ltd. and Gillies, and Bradford
         Enterprises (Cambridge) Inc. and Gillies and Kubassek Holdings
         Ltd. and Gillies and Kubassek Homes (Plattsville) Ltd. and
         Gillies.</pre>
    <pre>and
          </pre>
    <pre>               I think there is no doubt in the case at bar that
          there were separate contracts between the property
          owners or general contractor and the supplier of
          materials.  Gillies accepted the instructions to
          invoice separate corporate owners of the properties in
          question and it did so.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   Gillies appealed Mossop J.&#146;s order to the Divisional Court,
which,  by order dated December 9, 1996, allowed the appeal.   In
reasons  which  followed  some two months  later,  Forestell  J.,
writing  for the court, agreed that Gillies could not register  a
general  lien  because  &#147;there were four  separate  projects  and
technically  four separate owners at the time of registration  of
the  general lien under s.20 &#133;&#148;2  He held, however: &#147;It  is  well
settled  law  that  where a general lien has been  filed  and  is
disallowed, the lien claimant may still have a specific  lien  on
each of the respective properties described in the general lien.&#148;3
He  found  that &#147;the appellant Gillies had an honest belief  that
there  was  only  one  contractor and one  common  owner.&#148;4   The
Divisional Court permitted Gillies to convert the general lien of
$307,396.02 into four specific liens for the amount invoiced  for
each project as follows:

     Kubassek Homes (K-W) Limited .............. $89,253.11
     Bradford Enterprises (Cambridge)Inc. ..... $113,624.11
     Kubassek Holdings Ltd. .................... $44,378.45
     Kubassek Homes (Plattsville) Ltd. ......... $60,140.35</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>[10] A construction lien is a statutory charge against an owner&#146;s
interest  in land.  A lien gives suppliers of labour or materials
used in improving the land a statutory right to look to that land
for  payment.  A lien therefore prevents an owner from  obtaining
the benefit of improvements to its land without paying for them5.
[11] The lien is created by s.14(1) of the Act, which provides
that
          </pre>
    <pre>                A person who supplies services or  materials to an
      improvement for an owner, contractor or subcontractor, has a lien
      upon the interest of the owner in the premises improved for the
      price of those services or materials.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Ordinarily, a supplier will claim a lien against land  only
for the price of the services or materials provided to that land.
Cases  arise,  however,  where  a  supplier  provides  labour  or
materials  to two or more parcels of land belonging to  the  same
owner  and  the supplier is unable to allocate the price  of  its
labour  or  materials  to each individual  parcel.   These  cases
typically  arise  in  housing subdivisions where  the  supplier&#146;s
contract or subcontract may call for the supplier to provide  all
the labour or materials to be used in constructing every house in
the  subdivision.   To  avoid the difficulty  of  allocating  the
amount  owing  for  each individual house, the  Act,  in  s.  20,
created  the  concept  of a general lien, which  permits  a  lien
claimant to preserve a lien against each parcel of land  for  the
total  price of labour and materials supplied to all the  parcels
of land.
[13] Gillies sought to take advantage of s. 20 by registering a
general lien against all four projects.  However, as I have
already indicated, because Gillies did not have a single contract
for the supply of lumber to all four projects, it was not
entitled to a general lien.   I do not think that Gillies can
derive any comfort from its belief that all four projects were
owned by Kubassek Holdings Ltd. or by the Kubassek group of
companies.  Mr. Kubassek was entitled to plan his business
affairs as he did, by using separate corporations for each
project.  Moreover, Gillies agreed to supply lumber to all four
projects knowing that each project had a separate registered
owner, and having being told to invoice each project separately.
[14] Under the Act, Gillies should have preserved a lien claim
against each project only for the amount owing on that project.
It should not have preserved a lien claim against each project
for the total amount owing on all four projects.  In other words,
Gillies over- liened or improperly registered an inflated lien
against each project.  The issue on this appeal is whether
Gillies&#146; liens can be preserved despite its failure to comply
with the Act.
[15] In my view that issue turns on whether the court should
apply s. 6 of the Act, a section that was not referred to by
Mossop J. or the Divisional Court.  Section 6 provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>                 6.  No certificate, declaration or claim for lien is
       invalidated by reason only of a failure to comply strictly with
       subsection 32(2) or (5), subsection 33(1) or subsection 34(5),
       unless in the opinion of the court a person has been prejudiced
       thereby, and then only to the extent of the prejudice suffered.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Section  6 is a limited curative provision, which  protects
lien claimants from losing their lien rights because they fail to
comply strictly with specified &#147;form and content&#148; requirements of
the  Act.  In other words s. 6 allows the court to excuse  strict
compliance with specified sections  of the Act to the extent that
it  finds no prejudice. Should, however, any person be prejudiced
because   of   the  claimant&#146;s  failure  to  comply  with   these
requirements, then the lien claim is invalidated to the extent of
the prejudice suffered.
[17] The legislative history of the enactment of s. 6 in the 1983
Act is discussed both by Kirsh and McGuinness in their texts on
construction liens6.  Section 19 of the previous statute, the
Mechanics&#146; Lien Act, contained a broad curative provision
requiring only &#147;substantial compliance&#148; with the Act, a phrase,
which in turn had been generously interpreted by the courts.
Section 6 of the current Act was intended to scale back the
jurisprudence, to narrow the curative power of the court.  Even
so, in my view, nothing in the language or purpose of s. 6
suggests that its application should be limited to technical,
trivial or minor errors.  Construction lien legislation is
intended to protect the interests of workers by providing
security for the payment of their labour and materials, which
enhance the value of an owner&#146;s land.  Section 6 furthers this
purpose by permitting the court to excuse workers&#146; failure to
comply strictly with various statutory requirements for
registering a lien.  At the same time, s. 6 safeguards the
interests of owners by allowing them to resist the application of
s. 6 if they can show prejudice.
[18] Section 6, however, only applies to excuse non-compliance
with certain sections of the Act.  One statutory provision to
which s. 6 may be applied is subsection 34(5), which prescribes
the form and content of a claim for lien, including a claim for a
general lien.  Because all liens must comply with s. 34(5) and
because a failure to comply with s. 34(5) may be excused by s. 6,
Gillies may rely on s. 6 to prevent its improperly registered
general lien from being invalidated. Section 34(5) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (5)  Every claim for lien shall set out,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the name and address for service of
               the person claiming the lien and the name and
               address of the owner of the premises and the
               person for whom the services or materials
               were supplied and the time within which those
               services or materials were supplied;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  a short description of the services
               or materials that were supplied;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)   the  contract price or subcontract
               price;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)   the  amount claimed in respect  of
               services  or  materials that  have  been
               supplied; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)  a description of the premises,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (i)  where the lien attaches to the
          premises, sufficient     for     registration
                    under  the Land Titles Act  or  the
                    Registry Act, as the case may be, or
          </pre>
    <pre>                         (ii) where the lien does not
                    attach to the premises, being the
                    address or other identification of
                    the location of the premises.</pre>
    <pre>[19] This is not a case where the lien claimant registered a lien
against  the  wrong land.  Gillies registered  its  general  lien
against the lands to which it supplied materials.  Moreover,  its
general lien listed the correct registered owner of each project,
described  the materials supplied and gave a description  of  the
premises.  The  general lien did not comply with  s.  34(5)  only
because  it named &#147;Kubassek Holdings Ltd. and/or Kubassek  Group&#148;
as the person for whom materials were supplied and because it did
not  state  the  correct  contract price for  each  project  and,
instead  claimed  an amount for each project  that  exceeded  the
amount  owed  on that project. The first error, failing  to  name
correctly  under s. 34(5)(a) the person for whom  materials  were
supplied,  does not invalidate the lien.  This was a  very  minor
error.   No prejudice arises from this error because the  general
lien lists the proper owner of each project.
[20] The second and main error, and the crux of the appellants&#146;
complaint, is that Gillies over-liened each project.  Even if
this was not a minor error, at worst Gillies claimed too much
money.  But over-liening or liening for too much money does not
automatically invalidate a lien.  Section 6 itself prescribes
that a claim for a lien is not invalidated by reason only of a
failure to comply with s. 34(5), including presumably a failure
to set out the correct amount of the lien under s. 34(5)(c) and
(d).  Moreover, s. 35 makes a lien claimant liable in damages for
over-liening7.  Implicitly, therefore, s. 35 recognizes that over-
liening does not by itself invalidate a claim for lien.  Over-
liening will invalidate a claim for lien only if, in the words of
s. 6, &#147;a person has been prejudiced thereby, and then only to the
extent of the prejudice suffered&#148;.  The party claiming to have
been prejudiced bears the onus of proving prejudice.
[21] The appellants submit that they were prejudiced by the
general lien claimed by Gillies.  In my view, the evidence
supporting this submission is weak.  It consists of a bald
assertion by Mr. Kubassek that because Gillies registered a
general lien, the appellants could not obtain additional
financing, none of the projects could be completed and two of the
projects went into bankruptcy.  I recognize that Mr. Kubassek was
not cross-examined on his affidavit.  Still, the court is
entitled to take a hard look at what he said.  He provides no
particulars of his allegations of prejudice.  The four projects
were obviously in financial difficulty, apart from the general
lien registered by Gillies. Mr. Kubassek does not suggest that
the projects could have been saved if Gillies had registered &#150; as
it was entitled to do &#150; liens only for the amounts owing on each
project.  He does not suggest that potential lenders were
discouraged by the amount of the liens claimed.  On the material
filed on appeal, I am not persuaded that the registration of a
general lien caused the dire consequences claimed by the
appellants. Therefore, I am not satisfied that the appellants
have established prejudice under s. 6 of the Act.  I would
therefore hold that Gillies&#146; lien claim is not invalidated
because it improperly registered a general lien and failed to
comply with s.34(5) of the Act.  To hold otherwise, in the
absence of proven prejudice, would be too harsh a result, a
result that would give the appellants an unjustified windfall.
[22] The Divisional Court recognized that although Gillies was
not entitled to a general lien, it should, nonetheless, be
allowed to maintain its lien claims. To give effect to this view
the Divisional Court ordered that Gillies be permitted to convert
its general lien into four specific liens.  The Divisional Court
thus allowed Gillies to rewrite or amend its lien claims.  In my
opinion, the Divisional Court did not have the power to make this
order.  The Act does not provide for amending or rectifying a
claim for lien that does not comply with s. 34(5).  Under s. 6
the court has the power to hold that a claim for lien is not
invalidated for failing to comply strictly with s. 34(5), but a
court does not have the power to order that the non-compliance be
rectified.8  Therefore the proper order in this case  is simply
to dismiss the original motion brought by BDO Dunwoody to vacate
Gillies&#146; claims for lien.
[23] I make two further points.  First, this case differs from
the decision of this court in Leo P. Abrams &amp; Sons Ltd. v.
MacDonald Homes Inc. (Trustee of)9. In Abrams the lien claimant
registered a general lien, even though it had a written contract
providing that its liens were to be registered on a lot-by-lot
basis.  Despite its contract the claimant sought to preserve its
general lien and made no attempt to rely on s. 6. The majority of
the court held that the general lien was invalid because of s.
20(2), which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply and no general lien
       arises under or in respect of a contract that provides in writing
       that liens shall arise and expire on a lot-by-lot basis.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  majority concluded that to accept the lien  claimant&#146;s
position  &#147;would  be  to  ignore the scheme  of  s.20  and  would
encourage the improper registration of liens.&#148;
[25] In the present case, Gillies did not have a contract
requiring it to lien on a lot-by-lot basis.  Moreover, permitting
Gillies to rely on s. 6 should not encourage claimants to
improperly register general liens because owners can invalidate
these liens by showing prejudice.  I am, therefore, of the
opinion that Gillies is entitled to rely on the protection of s.
6 of the Act.
[26] Second, I do not intend by my order, to preclude the
appellants from asserting a claim against Gillies under s. 35 of
the Act.  Although I have concluded that the evidence on appeal
does not establish prejudice under s. 6, my proposed order would
allow the appellants to prove damages against Gillies under s. 35
of the Act.
[27] I would vary the order of the Divisional Court to provide
that the appeal from Mossop J. is allowed and the motion brought
by BDO Dunwoody is dismissed. Otherwise I would dismiss this
appeal with costs.</pre>
    <pre>                                        &#147;John I. Laskin J.A.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[28]  I  have had the opportunity to read the reasons  of  Laskin
J.A.   With respect, I do not agree with his disposition  of  the
appeal.   For the reasons which follow, I would allow the appeal,
set aside the order of the Divisional Court and restore the order
of Mossop J. vacating the general liens registered by Gillies and
vacating  the  certificates  of  action  registered  by   Gillies
consequent to each general lien.
[29] Although I am in general agreement with Laskin J.A.&#146;s
analysis, I do not agree that s.6 of the Construction Lien Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.C.30 has any application to the circumstances of
this appeal.  As well, I do not agree that the proposition stated
by the majority of this court in Leo P. Abrams &amp; Sons Ltd. v.
MacDonald Homes Inc. (Trustee of) (1996), 38 C.B.R. (3d) 250,
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused November
28, 1996, does not apply to this appeal.
[30] I do not intend to refer to the facts and the relevant
legislation as they are found in the reasons of Laskin J.A.,
except to the extent that it is necessary to do so for the
purpose of my analysis.
[31] The motion before Mossop J. was brought under s.47(1) of the
Act which empowers the court to vacate the registration of a
claim for lien, or a certificate of action, or both, &#147;upon any
proper ground&#148;.  Mossop J. vacated the claims for lien and the
certificates of action on the ground that Gillies was not
entitled to register a general lien under s.20(1) because &#147;there
were separate contracts between the property owners or general
contractor and the supplier of materials&#148;.  The Divisional Court
agreed with Mossop J., and found &#147;that Gillies would not come
under s.20 of the Act due to the fact that there were separate
contracts&#148;.  Before this court, counsel for Gillies conceded that
it had no right to register a general lien, but took the position
that s.6 should be applied, in effect, to validate the general
liens.  It appears that neither Mossop J., nor the Divisional
Court, had been asked to consider the application of s.6.
[32] Although the Divisional Court, whose reasons are reported in
(1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 475, held that Gillies was not entitled to
register the general liens under s.20(1), it purported to rewrite
the liens and &#147;converted&#148; them into four specific liens.  In
doing so, it stated at 478-79:
          </pre>
    <pre>            It is well-settled law that where a general lien has been
       filed and is disallowed, the lien claimant may still have a
       specific lien on each of the respective properties described in
       the general lien:  see Ontario Lime Assn. v. Grimwood (1910), 22
       O.L.R. 17 (Master) and Rockwell Electric Ltd. et al v. Welsford
       Development Corp. (1989), 33 C.L.R. 1, 89 N.S.R. (2d) 159 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[33]  In  my  view,  this proposition is  incorrect  and  is  not
supported  by the authorities relied on by the Divisional  Court.
The  Ontario  Lime  case was decided in 1910  when  the  relevant
legislation   made  no  provision  for  a  general   lien.    The
predecessor  to s.20 was not enacted until 1923 and was  intended
to  codify the result reached by the court in Ontario Lime.   The
Rockwell  Electric case, a decision of the Nova Scotia  Court  of
Appeal,  as  I read it, does not provide even remote support  for
the proposition.
[34] I agree with Laskin J.A. that the Divisional Court did not
have the power to make the order appealed from because the Act
does not provide for amending or rectifying a claim for lien that
does not comply with s.34(5), and, specifically, that such a
power does not lie in s.6.  I would, however, add that in my view
the Act does not enable the court to amend or rectify a claim for
a general lien that is not available to a lien claimant under
s.20(1).
[35] I turn now to my point of departure from the analysis of my
colleague.  In my view, s.6 does not apply to the circumstances
of this appeal.  For convenience, I will reproduce s.6:
          </pre>
    <pre>            6.  No certificate, declaration or claim for lien is
       invalidated by reason only of a failure to comply strictly with
       subsection 32(2) or (5), subsection 33(1) or subsection 34(5),
       unless in the opinion of the court a person has been prejudiced
       thereby, and then only to the extent of the prejudice suffered.
       [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[36]  The  predecessor to s.6 was s.19(1) of the Mechanics&#146;  Lien
Act,  R.S.O. 1980, c.261.  That Act was replaced in 1983  by  the
Construction   Lien   Act,  which  was  enacted   following   the
recommendations of the Report of the Attorney General&#146;s  Advisory
Committee on the Draft Construction Lien Act of April, 1982.
[37] By way of contrast to s.6, s.19(1) of the Mechanics&#146; Lien
Act stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>             19(1)     Substantial compliance with sections 17, 18, 23
        and 33 is sufficient and no claim for lien is invalidated by
        reason of failure to comply with any of the requirements of such
        sections unless, in the opinion of the judge or officer trying
        the action, the owner, contractor or subcontractor, mortgagee or
        other person is prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent
        to which he is thereby prejudiced. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>Subsections  17(1)(c)  and  (d) of  the  former  Act  correspond,
respectively,  with subsections 34(5)(d) and (e) of  the  present
Act.</pre>
    <pre>[38] In considering the purpose of s.6, it is instructive to take
into  account  the  views  of  the  Attorney  General&#146;s  Advisory
Committee  in  rejecting the language of s.6  in  the  Discussion
Draft  of  the  Construction  Lien Act  which  it  was  asked  to
consider, and in recommending what became s.6 of that Act.   This
is what the Committee said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Section 6 of the Discussion Draft purported to relieve against
        any failure by anyone to comply strictly with a requirement under
        the Act, unless a person was prejudiced as a result of the
        deviation from proper procedure.  It was thus far wider in scope
        than section 19 of the Mechanics&#146; Lien Act, which merely protects
        lien claimants from a failure to comply strictly with some of the
        procedural requirements of the Act.  The Committee appreciates
        the concerns that form should not be allowed to triumph over
        substance, and that a party should not be unduly penalized
        because of some trifling error in procedure.  However, after
        giving careful consideration to the question of whether
        substantial compliance with the Act should be sufficient, the
        Committee has decided that such compliance should not, in
        general, be sufficient.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Acts such as the Mechanics&#146; Lien Act and
          the  Construction Lien Act create complicated
          systems  of  substantive  rights  which   are
          inextricably  intertwined with  adherence  to
          proper procedure and form.  The owner&#146;s right
          to   deal   with   his  property,   and   the
          contractor&#146;s  and subcontractors&#146;  rights  to
          receive  payment of the monies that are  owed
          to  them  are, to a large extent, subject  to
          the  procedural provisions of the Act.   Lien
          claimants  have a right to expect  the  owner
          and  other payers to comply with the  payment
          procedures laid down by the Act, just as  the
          owner and payers have a right to expect  that
          all  claims  will  be made  on  time  and  in
          accordance with the procedure set down in the
          Act.  It is not unduly onerous to insist upon
          adherence to the procedures set down  in  the
          Act.   Indeed,  if  it is  not  necessary  to
          comply  with  a  prescribed  procedure,   one
          questions  the  need  for  prescribing   that
          procedure in the first place.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 We  believe  that  section  6  of  the
          Discussion   Draft   imperiled   the   smooth
          operation  of  the Act.  Indeed,  we  believe
          that  section 19 of the existing Act,  as  it
          has  been interpreted by the courts  has  too
          wide  an  application.   In  our  view,   the
          concept of substantial compliance jeopardizes
          the operational success of a statute such  as
          the  Construction Lien Act.   We  see  it  as
          opening the door to endless litigation.  Over
          and  above this concern, it is possible  that
          many  payers  may  feel  insecure  in  making
          payments, if the curative provisions  of  the
          Act are given too extensive an application.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  the  opinion of the Committee,  the
          general curative provision of the Act  should
          relieve   only   against  minor   errors   or
          omissions in the preparation of the documents
          and forms under the Act.  The Committee Draft
          version  of section 6 reflects this position.
          In  addition, we have added special  curative
          provisions into some of the sections  of  the
          Act,  where it would not be contrary  to  the
          smooth  operation  of the Act  to  empower  a
          court   to   relieve  against  a   particular
          procedural requirement of the Act.  [Emphasis
          added]</pre>
    <pre>[39]  In  my view, what emerges from this commentary is that  the
focus  of s.6 is procedural.  Section 6 is directed to compliance
with  s.32(2)  &#150; the contents of a certificate or declaration  of
substantial  performance; s.32(5) &#150; the manner of publication  of
such  certificates or declarations; s.33(1) &#150; the certificate  of
the completion of a subcontract; and s.34(5) &#150; the contents of  a
claim  for  lien.   Thus, as the commentary states,  and  as  the
provisions  of  the  Act  to which s.6 applies  demonstrate,  the
purpose of s.6 is to relieve against minor errors or omissions in
the  preparation of certain stipulated documents and forms  under
the Act.
[40] It is significant that s.20(1) is not among the provisions
of the Act to which s.6 applies.  I do not find this to be
surprising.  Section 20(1) is not procedural.  Whereas s.14
creates a lien in favour of people who supply services or
materials to an improvement made to &#147;premises&#148; as defined in
s.1(1), s.20(1) creates a right to a special type of a lien &#150; a
general lien &#150; to which a lien claimant is entitled only when the
conditions described in the subsection have been met.  On the
other hand, s.34(5), which is the concern in this appeal, is
procedural in prescribing the contents of a claim for lien, which
is a necessary step in the enforcement of the lien.  Thus, s.6
does not apply to the entitlement of a lien claimant to register
a general lien. By incorporating s.34(5), it applies to the
procedure to be followed by the lien claimant in enforcing its
lien, whether it be a specific lien pursuant to s.14(1), or a
general lien pursuant to s.20(1).
[41] It has been said that s.6 is a &#147;curative&#148; provision.
Although s.19 may be said to have been a curative provision, the
same cannot be said about s.6.  Properly read, s.6 creates a
limitation on the court&#146;s general powers, found in s.47(1), to
invalidate the registration of a claim for lien or a certificate
of action, for failure to comply strictly with those provisions
of the Act incorporated in s.6.  As such, s.6 is remedial, and
relieves against certain irregularities, but it does not relieve
against the registration of a general lien where the lien
claimant has not established the right to one under s.20(1),
which was the ground advanced by the respondent in its s.47(1)
motion before Mossop J.  See McGuinness, Construction Lien
Remedies in Ontario, (1997, 2nd ed., Carswell) 384-85; Guillevin
v. Enertech (1995), 19 C.L.R. (2nd) 15 at 19 (Ont. Master).
[42] In commenting on s.6, Macklem and Bristow observe that the
protection given by it is limited, inter alia, to the contents of
the claim for lien:  Macklem and Bristow, Construction Builders&#146;
and Mechanics&#146; Liens in Canada, 6th ed., (1990) at Vol. 1, 6-1.
The authors continue at 6-1 to 6-2:
          </pre>
    <pre>            The section makes no reference to &#147;substantial compliance&#148;,
       as section 19 of the former Ontario Mechanics&#146; Lien Act did.  It
       is understood that these words were expressly omitted from the
       new Act with the intention of making it clear that the section is
       designed to relieve only against minor errors or omissions in the
       preparation of documents and forms, substantial compliance no
       longer being sufficient.</pre>
    <pre>By  way  of  illustration, the authors refer to Bravo  Cement  v.
University of Toronto (1991), 46 C.L.R. 207 (Ont. Div.  Ct.),  in
which it was held that the naming of the wrong lands in the claim
for  lien  was  not  something which the court was  empowered  to
correct, or validate, under s.6.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  In considering this appeal it is well to keep in mind  that
the Act must be strictly construed in respect to persons entitled
to  the  benefit  of  a lien under it.  This principle  has  been
stated  in many cases.  I refer only to what was said by  Ritchie
J.  on behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada in Clarkson Co. Ltd.
et  al v. Ace Lumber Ltd. and Danford Lumber Co. Ltd. (1963),  36
D.L.R. (2d) 554 at 557-58:
          </pre>
    <pre>         With the greatest respect, I am, however, of opinion that the
       proper approach to the interpretation of this statute is
       expressed in the dissenting opinion of Kelly J.A. [pp. 710-11],
       where he says that,
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  lien  commonly known  as  the
               mechanics&#146; lien was unknown to the common law
               and owes its existence in Ontario to a series
               of statutes, the latest of which is R.S.O.
               1960, c.233.  It constitutes an abrogation of
               the common law to the extent that it creates,
               in the specified circumstances, a charge upon
               the owner&#146;s lands which would not exist but
               for the Act, and grants to one class  of
               creditors  a security or preference  not
               enjoyed by all creditors of the same debtor;
               accordingly, while the statute may merit a
               liberal interpretation with respect to the
               rights it confers upon those to whom  it
               applies,  it  must  be  given  a  strict
               interpretation in determining whether any
               lien-claimant is a person to whom a lien is
               given by it.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The  same  view  was  adopted  in  the
          unanimous   opinion  of  the  Supreme   Court
          of   Oregon  in  Timber  Structures  Inc.  v.
          C.W.S.  Grinding  &amp;  Machines  Works  (1951),
          229  Pac.  (2d) 623 at p.629,  where  it  was
          said:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     We  agree with defendant that  the
               right to a lien is purely statutory, and a
               claimant to such a lien must in the first
               instance bring himself clearly within the
               terms  of  the statute.  The statute  is
               strictly construed as to persons entitled to
               its  benefits  and as to  the  procedure
               necessary to perfect the lien; but when the
               claimant&#146;s   right  has   been   clearly
               established,  the law will be  liberally
               interpreted toward accomplishing the purposes
               of its enactment.</pre>
    <pre>[44] In Rudco Insulation Ltd. v. Toronto Sanitary Inc. (1998), 42
O.R. (3d) 292, which was concerned with the trust fund created by
the  Act,  this court affirmed that there are commercial  reasons
for  applying a strict construction to the Act, applying the  Ace
Lumber  case.   On behalf of the court, O&#146;Connor J.A.  stated  at
298:
          </pre>
    <pre>         The first principle that I draw from the cases is the
       following:  because the legislation creates a preference and a
       security for certain creditors that did not exist at common law,
       it ought to be given a strict interpretation in determining
       whether a particular creditor is a person to whom the benefit is
       given.</pre>
    <pre>See,  also,  George  Wimpey Canada Ltd.  v.  Peelton  Mills  Ltd.
(1982), 35 O.R. (2d) 787 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[45]  In  the Abrams case this court agreed with the decision  of
Roy  J.  that the lien claimant was precluded from registering  a
general  lien  by the application of s.20(2).  Speaking  for  the
majority, Laskin J.A. stated at p. 252:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The appellant could have liened the lots it provided services
       to on a lot by lot basis.  It did not do so because of its own
       negligence.  To accede to the appellant&#146;s position would permit
       it to take advantage of its own negligence to the detriment of
       the other creditors of MacDonald Homes.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The majority is of the view that in the
          circumstances  of  this case  we  should  not
          treat the general lien that was registered as
          a  lien  on the lot in question for the  work
          done  on that lot.  The statute sets out  the
          two  bases for claiming a lien.  There is  no
          curative  provision in the  Act.   To  accept
          Parkway&#146;s submission on this issue  would  be
          to  ignore  the  scheme  of  s.20  and  would
          encourage the improper registration of liens.
          The appellant remains a trust beneficiary for
          the amount of  work on the lot in question.</pre>
    <pre>[46] Although Abrams was concerned with s.20(2), and not s.20(1),
in  my view, there is no principled reason why the opinion of the
majority in that case does not apply to s.20(1).  As I read  what
the  majority  said, it reflects the proposition  stated  in  Ace
Lumber  that  the Act must be strictly construed  in  respect  to
persons  entitled to the benefit of a lien.  I note  that  Abrams
has  been applied by the Divisional Court in 595997 Ontario  Inc.
v. MacDonald Homes Inc. (Trustee of) (1997), 36 C.L.R. (2d) 61.
[47] Gillies has claimed a general lien, a creature of statute,
and it is incumbent on Gillies to show that it has complied with
the statute to be entitled to a general lien.  Mossop J. and the
Divisional Court have found that it did not do so.  Gillies
counsel has conceded that it did not do so and that the general
liens which it registered are invalid.  As Gillies was not
entitled to a general lien, it cannot be given one through the
application of s.6.  I do not consider the defect in the general
liens as a failure to comply with s.34(5).  The defect in the
general liens was a failure to meet the statutory conditions for
the entitlement to a general lien imposed by s.20(1), rendering
them invalid.
[48] The registering of the general liens did not represent an
error or omission on the part of Gillies in the preparation of
the general liens.  The error was a failure to comply with
s.20(1), which was an error that went to Gillies substantive
entitlement to a general lien.  Gillies registered its general
liens knowing it had entered into separate contracts with
separate owners in respect to separate properties.  In short, it
registered the wrong type of lien.  Under the Act, it was
entitled only to a specific lien upon the property of each owner
for the value of the materials which it supplied for the
improvement of each property.
[49] The circumstances of this appeal do not engage the
application of s.6.  As I have explained, on its face s.6 does
not apply to s.20(1).  Although the requirements of s.34(5) apply
to a general lien, they apply to a general lien to which the lien
claimant is legally entitled under s.20(1).  As Gillies was not
entitled to register a general lien, there was not a valid
general lien to which s.6 could apply to excuse a claim that
exceeded the value of the improvement to each property.
[50] With respect, I find the result proposed by Laskin J.A.
troubling.  The result is that the general liens remain in force,
notwithstanding their invalidity for non-compliance with s.20(1),
through the application of s.6.  This means that a lien claimant
can register a general lien on several properties for the total
value of improvements to all properties where separate contracts
exists for each property, even though precluded from doing so by
s.20(1), and resist a s.47(1) motion to vacate the lien through
the application of s.6 on the ground that he or she has merely
over-liened the property.  As stated in Abrams, to accept this
result &#147;would be to ignore the scheme of s.20 and would encourage
the improper registration of liens&#148;.
[51] I appreciate, of course, that s.6 can be applied to resist a
motion to invalidate a claim for lien only where the court finds
that a person has not been prejudiced by the failure of a lien
claimant to comply with subsection 34(5), and then only to the
extent of the prejudice suffered.  As I have indicated, neither
Mossop J., nor the Divisional Court, considered the application
of s.6.
[52] If I were of the view that s.6 applied to the circumstances
of this appeal, it would be my opinion that the property owners
had been prejudiced by the general liens registered against their
properties.  The evidence of the prejudice they sustained is
contained in paragraphs 23 to 27 of Mr. Kubassek&#146;s affidavit.  He
was not cross-examined and his evidence is uncontradicted.  As a
result of Gillies registering a general lien in the amount of
$307,396.02 against all four properties, no further financing for
any of the projects could be obtained and they &#147;ground to a
halt&#148;.  In addition, the secured lender of two of the projects
obtained an order appointing a receiver/manager and a lien
trustee of the assets of their owners.
[53] For all of the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the order of the Divisional Court and restore the order of
Mossop J.  The appellant is to have its costs of the motion to
stay, Gillies&#146; abandoned motion to introduce fresh evidence, the
appeal to the Divisional Court in addition to the costs of this
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>                                             &#147;S. Borins J.A.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[54]  While  I  concur in the result arrived at by  my  colleague
Borins J.A., I take a different route in arriving at it.  I agree
with  Borins J.A. that the court is unable to apply section 6  of
the  Construction  Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.C.30  (the  &quot;Act&quot;)  in
order  to avoid invalidating the lien at issue in this  case.   I
have  come to this conclusion based upon my interpretation of  s.
6.   For  convenience sake, I have set out the  wording  of  this
provision:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Minor irregularities
          </pre>
    <pre>               6.   No certificate, declaration or
          claim for lien is invalidated by reason only
          of a failure to comply strictly with
          subsection 32(2) or (5), subsection 33(1) or
          subsection 34(5), unless in the opinion of
          the court a person has been prejudiced
          thereby, and then only to the extent of the
          prejudice suffered.</pre>
    <pre>[55]  In my opinion, a court may only apply section 6 of the  Act
to cure defects that are merely minor or technical in nature.   I
come  to this conclusion based on the plain meaning of the  words
of  the section, the history of the provision, and the purpose of
the Act.
[56] I agree with Borins J.A. that the focus of s. 6 is on
procedure, and the application of section 6 is therefore limited
to cases involving a failure to comply with certain procedural
requirements of the Act.  This finding is consistent with the
section's use of the word &quot;comply&quot;, and with the section's
express limitation that the provision applies only to failures
under certain provisions of the Act, all of which are procedural
in nature.
[57] It should be emphasized that the section only provides
relief from a &quot;failure to comply strictly&quot; with those
requirements.  It is a well-established principle of statutory
interpretation that every word used in legislation must, to the
extent that it is possible, be given meaning:  see Ruth Sullivan,
Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed. (Toronto:
Butterworths, 1994) at 159 - 63.  The word &quot;strictly&quot; therefore
has a specific narrowing effect on the type of defects to which
section 6 may be applied.  The Oxford English Dictionary includes
the following among its definition of the word &quot;strict&quot;:
          </pre>
    <pre>            6.  Rigorously established or implemented; spec. (a) (of a
       law, ordinance, etc.) stringently framed or executed, allowing no
       refusal or evasion; (b) (of an inquiry investigation, etc.)
       carried out with unremitting attention to detail, relentless
       &#133;[Emphasis added.]
     
</pre>
    <pre>[58]   McGuinness,   Construction  Lien  Remedies   in   Ontario,
(Scarborough:  Carswell,  1997)  offers  the  following   opinion
regarding  the presence of the word &quot;strictly&quot; in the provision's
phrase &quot;failure to comply strictly&quot; (at p. 386):
          </pre>
    <pre>             Therefore, the certificate, declaration or claim for lien
        must at the very least amount to some reasonable attempt to
        comply with the provisions of the legislation.  The document must
        contain the essential information that is required or &#133; it must
        be readily possible for other parties to identify the correct
        information from other sources.  The focus of section 6 is on
        irregularities, informalities and matters of detail. [Emphasis
        added.]
     
</pre>
    <pre>[59]  Section 6 provides that a lien will not be invalidated  &quot;by
reason  only  of  a  failure  to comply  strictly&quot;  with  certain
requirements  of  the Act.  The presence of the  word  &quot;only&quot;  is
further  indication that, in my view, section 6  may  be  applied
only in cases where a lien's defect is limited to its failure  to
comply  &quot;rigorously&quot;  or &quot;relentlessly&quot; with  certain  procedural
requirements of the Act.  The phrase &quot;by reason only of a failure
to  comply strictly&quot; thus serves a threshold function for section
6.   Any defects that are not merely technical or minor in nature
are  beyond the scope of section 6 and can therefore not be saved
by its application.
[60] I believe that my conclusion that section 6 only applies to
defects that are minor or technical in nature is supported by a
consideration of the history of section 6.  As Borins J.A has
noted, section 6 was enacted as a result of a comprehensive
review of construction lien legislation in Ontario.  The wording
of section 6 contrasts significantly with the wording of its
predecessor, section 19(1) of the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.O.
1980, c.261, which provided that &quot;substantial compliance &#133; [with
certain procedural requirements of that act] is sufficient&quot; for a
lien to be saved.  There is a general consensus that the wording
of this provision was changed from &quot;substantial compliance&quot; to
&quot;failure to comply strictly&quot; in order to narrow the scope of the
courts to apply the provision.  See Bravo Cement v. University of
Toronto (1991), 46 C.L.R. 207 (Ont. Div. Crt.) at p. 210; Twin
Windows v. Holiday Construction Ltd. (1985), 15 C.L.R.
311.(Ont.H.C.); Triple &quot;R&quot; Demolition Inc. v .1186468 Ontario
Ltd, [1998] O.J. 835 (Gen. Div.) and McGuinness, supra, at 382.
[61] The report of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee,
which provided the framework for the new lien legislation,
summarized the problems that had arisen under the older, broader
provision as follows, at p. 32:
          </pre>
    <pre>             In our view, the concept of substantial compliance
        jeopardizes the operational success of a statute such as the
        Construction Lien Act.  We see it as opening the door to endless
        litigation.  Over and above this concern, it is possible that
        many payers may feel insecure in making payments, if the curative
        provisions of the Act are given too extensive an application.</pre>
    <pre>The   Committee  recommended  a  much  narrower  version  of  the
provision:
          </pre>
    <pre>             In the opinion of the Committee, the general curative
        provision of the Act should relieve only against minor errors or
        omissions in the preparation of the documents and forms under the
        Act.  The Committee Draft version of section 6 reflects this
        position.</pre>
    <pre>The  provision  recommended  by the  Committee  was  adopted  and
enacted as part of the Construction Lien Act, 1983.</pre>
    <pre>[62] I also believe that limiting the application of section 6 to
cases involving minor or technical errors is consistent with  the
overall purpose of the Construction Lien Act.  As Borins J.A. has
noted, the construction lien did not exist at common law,  and  a
lien  claimant's  right  to a lien arises  as  a  result  of  the
claimant  falling  within the four corners  of  the  Act.   These
procedural  requirements of the Act are essential  in  that  they
provide  notice to other (potential) lien claimants and creditors
that the property of the owner or debtor is subject to a priority
claim.  The accuracy of this information is therefore essential.
[63] Having found that section 6 of the Act may be applied only
in cases involving minor or technical defects, I must now
consider whether the defects in the lien registered by the
respondent, Gillies Lumber, fall within the scope of such
defects.  I have concluded that the defects in the liens at issue
in this case are too significant to be considered minor or
technical.  Gillies Lumber registered general liens, in the
amount of $307,396.02, against four properties.  It has conceded
that the general liens are not valid, as the supplies provided to
these four properties arose under four distinct contracts, and
thus does not fall within the scope of section 20(1) of the Act.
[64] The general lien registered against each of the four
properties was in the amount of $307,396.02, while the correct
amounts range from $44,378.45 to $113,624.11.  Obviously, the
amount of a lien claim is important.  In this case the overclaims
in relation to each property could well discourage potential
lenders to the prejudice of the owner.  The registration of these
liens amounts to a material misstatement that cannot be
characterized as minor technical in nature so as to be corrected
by section 6 of the Act.
[65] It is not necessary for me to consider whether any party was
prejudiced by the errors in the liens registered by Gillies
Lumber, as I have found that the errors in these liens failed to
fall within the scope of section 6.  However, I also agree with
Borins J.A. that the property owners were prejudiced by the
registration of the liens of such an excessive amount.  The
amount of the excess claimed in itself could be construed as
prima facie evidence of prejudice.  That, taken together with Mr.
Kubassek's uncontradicted evidence of prejudice, leads to the
conclusion that there was, in fact, prejudice.
[66] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal from the order
of the Divisional Court, and restore the order of Mossop J.
invalidating the liens registered by Gillies Lumber.</pre>
