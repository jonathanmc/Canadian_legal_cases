</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]       This appeal requires this court to again address the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reach of the holding in  Weber v. Ontario Hydro (1995), 125</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">D.L.R. (4th) 583 (S.C.C.), namely that a dispute which arises</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under a collective agreement must be arbitrated and cannot be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigated in the courts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]       This requires the court to define the essential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">character of the dispute and if it arises from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interpretation, application, administration or violation of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collective agreement then the Weber principle precludes the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from taking jurisdiction.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       In this case, the appellants commenced an action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleging defamation of the appellant Ana Giorno arising from a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">memorandum of October 5, 1990 authored by the respondent Pappas.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Madam Justice Bellamy determined that the principle in Weber,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applies to this dispute and, as a consequence, the court has no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. She therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">allowed the respondents' motion and dismissed the action. For the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons that follow, I agree with her conclusion.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FACTS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       The appellant Ana Giorno was an employee of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Crown in right of Ontario, working in the Ministry of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Housing. She was a member of the bargaining unit set out in a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collective agreement between the Crown in right of Ontario and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Ontario Public Service Employees Union. That agreement was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made pursuant to the Crown Employees Collective Bargaining Act,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">R.S.O. 1990, c. C.50. Like most labour legislation, this Act</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provides in s. 19(1) for final and binding arbitration of any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">differences between the parties arising from the interpretation,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">application, administration or alleged contravention of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       The respondent Ontario Rent Review Hearings Board is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">established by provincial statute and is charged with regulating</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rents in Ontario. Its members are appointed by provincial order-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in-council to serve at pleasure, but are not included within the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">definition of employee for the purposes of the Crown Employees</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Collective Bargaining Act.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       The respondent Pappas was a full-time member of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]       The appellant was seconded to the Board as an appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">analyst. Her responsibilities included the preparation of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">documentation for use by members of the respondent Board.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Analysts and Board members operated together in teams in order to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expeditiously process the work of the Board. However, while</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Giorno and Mr. Pappas were on the same team, Mr. Pappas had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no direct authority over her. Her line of responsibility was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">through senior managers in the Ministry of Housing.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]       In the fall of 1990 Ms. Giorno felt that she was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">receiving instructions from a Board member that went beyond her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">responsibilities as an appeal analyst. She sought the advice of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">her regional manager and was advised not to complete the work as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requested.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       The respondent Pappas took issue with this and wrote a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">memorandum dated October 5, 1990 to the Chair of the Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">criticizing Ms. Giorno and indicating that he was taking steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remove her from his team. He also circulated the memorandum to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nine others who were either senior managers at the Board or in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Ministry of Housing or representatives of the Union.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] On October 11, 1990 Ms. Giorno filed a grievance under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collective agreement asserting that the employer was not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">providing her with a safe and healthy workplace.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Article 18.1 of the collective agreement sets out a broadly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">worded obligation on the employer to continue to make reasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions for the safety and health of its employees during</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">working hours.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The relief she requested was that the employer ensure that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">all harassment cease, that the October 5 memorandum be removed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from her file, that Mr. Pappas issue a letter of apology and a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">retraction to be circulated to all concerned, and that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer ensure that the reporting relationship be clarified.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] On November 14, 1990, at the second stage of the grievance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">procedure, the parties were successful in settling the matter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">For her part, Ms. Giorno withdrew her grievance. For their part,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the Chair and acting Vice-chair of the Board wrote to all members</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and staff clarifying the working and reporting relationship of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal analysts and Board members; the acting Vice-chair</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">confirmed in writing to Ms. Giorno that Mr. Pappas' memorandum</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">had not and would not be placed in her personnel file and further</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">advised its recipients to discard the memorandum. The settlement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made it unnecessary to proceed to arbitration.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The appellants issued the statement of claim in this action</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on January 28, 1991. In essence, the action alleges that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">October 5, 1990 memorandum defamed Ms. Giorno. It claims damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on her behalf and pursuant to the Family Law Reform Act on behalf</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the other appellants.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Pursuant to Rule 21.01(3)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the defendants moved successfully before Bellamy J. for an order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">dismissing the action on the basis that because of the Weber</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the action.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ANALYSIS

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The issue on this appeal is whether on these facts the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">principle enunciated in Weber, supra precludes the appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from seeking redress from the respondents in the courts. In Piko</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">v. Hudson's Bay Company, a judgment of the Ontario Court of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Appeal released November 19, 1998, this court recently had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">occasion to consider Weber. Speaking for the court, Laskin J.A.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">said this at para. 9:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Weber holds that any dispute arising under a
          collective agreement, regardless of how the
          dispute is characterized, must be arbitrated,
          not litigated in the courts. Whether a
          dispute should be arbitrated or litigated
          turns on the nature of the dispute and the
          terms of the collective agreement. No matter
          how the claim is framed, if &quot;the dispute, in
          its essential character, arises from the
          interpretation, application, administration
          or violation of the collective agreement&quot; it
          must be arbitrated. Parties cannot avoid
          arbitration simply by pleading a common law
          tort.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] This approach reflects the importance of the regime of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">exclusive arbitration which is central to Canadian labour</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">legislation and which is exemplified by s. 19(1) of the Crown</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Employees Collective Bargaining Act. Such a regime is designed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">resolve workplace disputes expeditiously and economically through</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the specialized expertise of labour arbitrators. In setting out</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this approach in Weber McLachlin J. said this at p. 604:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It satisfies the concern that the dispute
          resolution process which the various labour
          statutes of this country have established
          should not be duplicated and undermined by
          concurrent actions. It conforms to a pattern
          of growing judicial deference for the
          arbitration and grievance process and
          correlative restrictions on the rights of
          parties to proceed with parallel or
          overlapping litigation in the courts.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] As Laskin J.A. said, whether a dispute can be litigated or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be arbitrated turns on the nature of the dispute and the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms of the collective agreement, not on the legal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">characterization of the wrong alleged. The court must examine the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts of the dispute to determine if the essential character of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the alleged conduct is covered by the terms of the collective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] It is of no moment that arbitrators may not always have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">approached the awarding of damages in the same way that courts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have awarded damages in tort. In Weber, at p. 603, McLachlin J.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made clear that arbitrators are to apply the same law as the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">courts. Laskin J.A. put it this way in Piko at para. 22:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               I do not rest my decision on any
          differences between the power of courts and
          the power of arbitrators to award damages for
          a tort, such as the tort of malicious
          prosecution. I recognize that arbitrators may
          apply common law principles in awarding
          damages, and, more importantly, the breadth
          of an arbitrator's power to award damages
          does not necessarily determine whether Weber
          applies.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] What is important is that the arbitrator is empowered to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">remedy the wrong. If that is so, then where the essential</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">character of the dispute is covered by the collective agreement,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to require that it be arbitrated, not litigated in the courts,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">causes no &quot;real deprivation of ultimate remedy&quot;1. The individual</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is able to pursue an appropriate remedy through the specialized</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">vehicle of arbitration. He or she is not left without a way to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">seek relief.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] Turning to the facts of this dispute, they are all workplace</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">related. The October 5 memorandum was written and circulated in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the workplace. It addressed a workplace problem, namely how</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Giorno did her work. Its author worked on the same team as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Giorno. The recipients of the memorandum were all people who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could have been expected to be informed of a problem in her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">working relationship with the respondent Pappas. Ms. Giorno's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assertion in this dispute is that this memorandum caused her</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">significant harm.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The collective agreement places a broad obligation on the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employer to provide a safe and healthy workplace. This obligation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was seen by Ms. Giorno to be broad enough to support the relief</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">requested in her grievance. It was seen by the parties as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">sufficient to sustain the relief agreed on in the settlement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, I see no reason why it could not have sustained a claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for damages at arbitration, the very relief claimed in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">litigation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] In short, I conclude that the essential character of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conduct complained of by the appellants is covered by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collective agreement. The dispute is therefore one that arises</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">under the collective agreement and had to be resolved in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arbitration process. It cannot be resolved in the courts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Is this conclusion affected by the identity of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents?  The appellants argue that relief is sought in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">civil litigation against the respondent Pappas and the respondent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board, neither of whom are the employer under the collective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement, the party from whom a remedy is normally sought at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arbitration.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] I cannot agree that this makes a difference in this case. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the respondent Board, Ms. Giorno correctly treated it as part</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the employer for the purposes of the grievance process.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed, the settlement that was reached required certain steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be taken by Board officers. The civil action against the Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be seen as an action against an entity which is, for this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purpose, part of the employer and subject to the collective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement. Hence, the Weber principle is applicable to the civil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">action against this respondent.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] As to the respondent Pappas, while he is an employee of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent Crown, he had no managerial responsibility over</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ms. Giorno. Nor was he an employee covered by the collective</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">agreement. Despite this, given that this dispute arises under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">collective agreement the principle in Weber applies. As</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Laskin J.A. said in Piko, supra at para. 13:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Where an employee has sued another
          employee for a workplace wrong, this court
          has held that bringing an action against a
          person who is not a party to the collective
          agreement will not give a court jurisdiction
          if the dispute, &quot;in its essential character&quot;,
          still arises under the collective agreement.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Laskin J.A. was referring to the endorsement of this court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Ruscetta v. Graham, [1998] O.J. No. 1198 (C.A.), leave to</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] These decisions simply reflect the principle in Weber.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Where, as here, the essential character of the dispute is covered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by the collective agreement, the arbitration process allows the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee to seek an appropriate remedy. While the remedy at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arbitration may be against the employer rather than the fellow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee, the remedy is nonetheless real.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] To preclude the employee from suing another employee for the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">workplace wrong in such circumstances does not deprive that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">employee of an ultimate remedy for that wrong. Rather, it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">prevents the undercutting of the dispute resolution process that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is given exclusive statutory jurisdiction over disputes that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arise under the collective agreement.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] I therefore conclude that Ms. Giorno's action against all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents was properly dismissed as one over which the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">has no jurisdiction. No separate argument was advanced to support</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the claims under the Family Law Reform Act and, in any event,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since these claims are derivative in nature, they too were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">properly dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.
