    <pre>[1]  The trial judge committed several errors in his charge to
the jury.

[2]  On the issue of liability, the charge was not fair and
balanced but weighted heavily in favour of the defence. The most
glaring example of this occurred when the trial judge let it be
known that in his view, the independent defence witness was
telling the truth and,   if that be so, the plaintiff and his
mother were not.

[3]  As a general rule, instructions of this nature are to be
discouraged, especially in cases such as this where the outcome
hinged largely upon the jury’s assessment of the credibility and
reliability of the opposing witnesses. In the particular
circumstances of this case, when one considers the omission of
material facts, testified to at trial, in the out-of-court
statement made by the independent witness shortly after the
event, the trial judge’s observations were unjustified. Indeed,
in view of those omissions, far from endorsing the independent
witness’s trial testimony, the trial judge might well have
instructed the jury to proceed with caution before acting upon
it.

[4]  The trial judge compounded this error in his review of the
evidence pertaining to the issue of liability. In this regard, he
underscored the frailties in the evidence of the plaintiff and
that of his mother but failed to mention any of the frailties in
the evidence of the defendant and the independent witness.

[5]  The lack of balance in the charge was prejudicial to the
plaintiff and, in our view, it rendered the trial unfair. The
onus upon the defendant to disprove negligence was effectively
screened from view by the bias expressed in favour of the
defendant.

[6]  Apart from the issue of trial fairness, the charge on
liability was deficient in that it effectively removed the issue
of contributory negligence from the jury’s consideration. That
issue was a live one, particularly if the jury were to find that
the plaintiff was not in the crosswalk at the time of the
accident. The trial judge did not adequately address this
possibility in his charge. Rather, he essentially left the issue
of negligence to the jury on an “all or nothing” basis, with the
outcome hinging on the jury’s assessment of whether the plaintiff
was or was not in the crosswalk at the time of the accident.

[7]  With respect to damages, we are of the view that the
imbalance in the trial judge’s instructions on the issue of
liability may well have prejudiced the plaintiff, leaving the
jury with the impression that little weight should be given to
his testimony and that of his mother regarding the nature and
extent of his injuries and their effect upon him.

[8]  We are also of the view that the trial judge failed to
adequately charge the jury on the conflicting evidence given by
Drs. Smith and Travis concerning the cognitive defects arising
from the brain damage suffered by the plaintiff. In this respect,
the trial judge led the jury to believe that the only real
difference between the opinions in question was the effect that
counselling would have had on the plaintiff’s ability to achieve
his academic and vocational goals. With respect, this was a gross
mischaracterization of the evidence and it failed to reflect the
fundamental differences in their respective diagnoses.

[9]  We are also of the view that the trial judge failed to
adequately review the evidence of the lay and expert witnesses
which bore directly on the jury’s assessment of the weight to be
given to the conflicting opinions of Drs. Smith and Travis.

[10] The cumulative effect of these errors leads us to conclude
that the verdict of the jury cannot stand, either in respect of
liability or damages. In the result, the appeal is allowed with
costs and a new trial is ordered. The costs of the first trial
are left to the discretion of the presiding judge at the new
trial.</pre></td>
