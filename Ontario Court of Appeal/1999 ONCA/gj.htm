</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge, in admitting the confession made to Doyle,
did not consider the evidence that the accused viewed Doyle as
someone who could put him away for the rest of his life. In our
view, this evidence was most germane to the issue facing the
trial judge, namely whether the accused had a subjective belief
that Doyle was a person in authority. His finding on this issue
without considering and addressing this evidence cannot stand:
see R. v. Hodgson (1998), 163 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Given the prejudice to the accused from the admission of
this confession, this is not a case for the proviso.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appeal must be allowed and a new trial directed.</pre></td>
