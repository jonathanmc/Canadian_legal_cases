    <pre>On  appeal from the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Rosenberg
dated October 28, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  There are two appeals before this court.  Both arise out of
an ongoing and multi-faceted dispute between the appellant, Exall
Resources Ltd. (Exall) and the respondent, Glimmer Resources Inc.
(Glimmer) over their respective rights and obligations under a
joint venture agreement (the agreement).  The agreement relates
to the exploration and development of a gold mine property in
northern Ontario (the property).  The first and primary appeal
arises from the order of Rosenberg J. dated October 28, 1997.
The second appeal is from an order of Rosenberg J. dated February
2, 1998 in which he clarified certain terms of the reference he
directed in his October order.</pre>
    <pre>I.   The Appeal from the October 1997 Order:</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The agreement was originally entered into between Glimmer
and Norex in 1989.  Broadly stated, the agreement had two parts.
Under the first part, Glimmer, who had an exclusive right to
acquire the property, granted Norex an exclusive right to acquire
60% of Glimmer's interest.  The second part of the agreement was
to take effect should Norex acquire the 60% interest.  It
established a joint venture between Glimmer and Norex to further
explore and develop the property.  Under the terms of the joint
venture, Norex was to hold the majority position and act as
operator.  It was to remain the operator as long as its interest
in the joint venture was over 50%.  If Norex's interest fell
below 50%, Glimmer was entitled to take on the role as operator.
Under paragraph 19 of the agreement, each party was required to
contribute towards monthly expenditures set out in work plans in
proportion to its interest in the joint venture.  Paragraph 22 of
the agreement provided that if a party failed to make a required
contribution, its interest in the joint venture would be reduced
to reflect that failure.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Norex transferred its interest to Hemlo and in April 1996,
Exall acquired Hemlo's interest.  Exall acquired a 60% interest
in the joint venture and assumed the role of operator.  Its
active participation as the operator of the joint venture began
in early July 1996.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Problems developed between Glimmer and Exall not long after
Exall became the operator.  By early 1997, those problems had
resulted in litigation.  The issues raised on this appeal stem
from an application brought by Glimmer for a declaration as to
the respective interests of Glimmer and Exall in the joint
venture.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Five issues were raised on the application:
*    the proper interpretation of paragraphs 19 and 22 of the
     joint venture agreement;</pre>
    <pre>*    the propriety of certain liabilities charged against the
     joint venture by Exall;</pre>
    <pre>*    the proper amount of the management fee owed to Exall by the
     joint venture under the terms of the agreement;</pre>
    <pre>*    whether Exall's conduct towards Glimmer was oppressive so as
     to entitle Glimmer to an appropriate remedy under the Ontario
     Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.B.6;  and</pre>
    <pre>*    the nature of the operator's obligations under the agreement
     in so far as fixing budgets and compliance with those budgets
     were concerned.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In the course of the application, Rosenberg J. raised the
further question whether Exall should be entitled to relief from
forfeiture if he found Exall was in breach of the terms of the
agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The ultimate determination of the application, that is the
respective interests in the joint venture of Glimmer and Exall,
could only be determined after the other monetary issues had been
resolved.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Rosenberg J. decided two of the issues.  He held that
Glimmer's interpretation of the agreement was correct, and that
Exall was in breach of its obligation to pay its share of the
monthly expenses under paragraph 19 of the agreement.  He also
held that in the circumstances Exall was not entitled to relief
from forfeiture.  Rosenberg J. directed a reference to determine
the controversies surrounding the management fee and the
contested liabilities attributed to the joint venture by Exall.
He further directed that the reference determine the respective
interests of Exall and Glimmer in the joint venture under the
terms of paragraph 22 of the agreement in light of the
determination on the reference of the issues relating to the
management fee and contested liabilities.  Finally, he ordered
that the other issues raised on the application be brought back
before him after the reference.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant challenges Rosenberg J.'s interpretation of
the relevant provisions of the contract and his refusal to grant
relief from forfeiture.</pre>
    <pre>A:   The Interpretation of the Agreement</pre>
    <pre>[10] The relevant parts of the agreement are set out below:</pre>
    <pre>          19.  Monthly expenditure projections
               will be provided by the Operator on
               a quarterly basis in advance and
               each party shall remit the required
               funds to the Operator on or before
               the first day of the month in which
               they will be expended or such
               party's Participating Interest will
               be subject to dilution pursuant to
               clause 22.</pre>
    <pre>          20.  The expenditure projections
               referred to in clause 19 above
               shall include a description of the
               work being proposed as well as the
               estimated expenditures required to
               complete such work.  If actual
               expenditures for a month exceed the
               expenditure projection for that
               month then the Operator shall
               provide to the non-operator an
               account of the overrun.  Upon
               receipt of such account the non-
               operator shall remit to the
               Operator its share of funds
               required to fund the overrun
               provided however, that any
               expenditures made by the Operator
               in excess of 15% of the original
               expenditure projection for the work
               plan and budget shall be for the
               sole account of the Operator unless
               otherwise approved by the
               Management Committee.</pre>
    <pre>                              ....</pre>
    <pre>          22.  If either party fails to make its
               required contribution to
               expenditures under a work plan then
               the party failing to make the
               contribution shall have its
               Participating Interest reduced.  At
               any time after the formation of the
               Joint Venture, a party's
               Participating Interest can be
               calculated by dividing that party's
               expenditures and deemed
               expenditures by the total
               expenditures and deemed
               expenditures of both parties and
               expressing the result as a
               percentage.  For the purpose of
               calculating the initial and
               subsequent Participating Interest
               of each party, Norex and Glimmer
               shall be deemed to have expended
               the following amounts:</pre>
    <pre>               Norex:    $250,000
               Glimmer:  $167,000  [Emphasis
               added.]</pre>
    <pre>[11] Exall argued that the &quot;expenditures&quot; contemplated in
paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 included not only projected cash needs
of the joint venture in any given month, but also all projected
liabilities to be incurred in that month regardless of whether
actual payments were due in that month.  For example, Exall
claimed that if under the terms of a work plan the joint venture
was to incur a liability in August 1996, the amount of that
liability was properly chargeable as a monthly expenditure even
though no money was payable on that liability until several
months later.  On Exall's interpretation of the agreement,
Glimmer was obliged to pay 40% of that liability on or before the
first day of August even though Exall, in its capacity as
operator, would not have to actually make any payment against the
liability until several months later.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Exall contended that the language of paragraphs 19 and 22
was ambiguous and that extrinsic evidence was admissible to
assist in arriving at the proper interpretation of those
paragraphs.  Exall submitted that evidence of the operation of
the agreement prior to Exall's involvement, the conduct of Exall
and Glimmer after Exall became the majority stakeholder, and
expert evidence as to the meaning of certain terms in the
agreement, assisted in interpreting paragraphs 19 and 22.
According to Exall, this extrinsic evidence offered strong
support for its interpretation of the agreement.  Finally, Exall
argued that its interpretation of the agreement worked no
unfairness on Glimmer in that it was Exall's ability to obtain
favourable credit arrangements which permitted the deferment of
liabilities incurred in any given month to some later date.
Exall pointed to paragraph 15 of the agreement which gave the
operator a wide discretion in the management of the affairs of
the joint venture.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Glimmer countered that there was no ambiguity in the
relevant provisions of the agreement.  Glimmer placed heavy
reliance on the language of the requirement in paragraph 19 of
the agreement that &quot;each party shall remit the required funds ...
on or before the first day of the month in which they will be
expended&quot; to support its position that monthly expenditures
referred to projected cash needs of the joint venture and not to
other forms of liability. Glimmer accepted that this provision
had to be addressed in the context of the entire agreement and
the commercial relationship established by the agreement.  It
submitted, however, that a contextual reading confirmed the
meaning evident from the language used in the agreement.  By way
of an alternative position, Glimmer tendered expert evidence in
support of its interpretation of the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Rosenberg J. accepted Glimmer's contention that the
agreement was not ambiguous and refused to consider the extrinsic
evidence offered by Exall or Glimmer in support of their
respective interpretations.  He said:</pre>
    <pre>          ... the plain meaning of the various terms of
          the contract mean that the projection should
          be of the actual payments required in a given
          month.  Each party should contribute to a
          project bank account on the first of the
          month their proportionate share of that cash
          requirement for the month.  The words &quot;each
          party shall remit the required funds to the
          operator&quot; can have no other logical meaning.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Having concluded that the words admitted of no ambiguity,
Rosenberg J. further held that Exall's interpretation of the
agreement was neither fair nor consistent with what he considered
to be the reasonable expectations of the parties.  In so
concluding, he emphasized that Exall's interpretation permitted
it to extract the bulk, if not the entirety, of the joint
venture's monthly cash flow needs from the wallet of the minority
stakeholder.</pre>
    <pre>[16] When interpreting the provisions of a written contract, the
court must look first at the language used in that contract.  If
the language reveals no ambiguity, there is no need to go outside
of the agreement for assistance in the interpretive exercise.  As
Iacobucci J. recently said in Eli Lilly and Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.
(1998), 161 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 27:</pre>
    <pre>          ... The contractual intent of the parties is
          to be determined by reference to the words
          they used in drafting the document, possibly
          read in light of the surrounding
          circumstances which were prevalent at the
          time.  Evidence of one party's subjective
          intention has no independent place in this
          determination.</pre>
    <pre>          Indeed, it is unnecessary to consider any
          extrinsic evidence at all when the document
          is clear and unambiguous on its face ...</pre>
    <pre>          When there is no ambiguity of the wording of
          the document the notion in Consolidated-
          Bathurst [[1980] 1 S.C.R. 888] that the
          interpretation which produces a &quot;fair result&quot;
          or a &quot;sensible commercial result&quot; should be
          adopted is not determinative.  Admittedly, it
          would be absurd to adopt an interpretation
          which is clearly inconsistent with the
          commercial interests of the parties if the
          goal is to ascertain their true contractual
          intent.  However, to interpret a plainly
          worded document in accordance with the true
          contractual intent of the parties is not
          difficult, if it is presumed that the parties
          intended the legal consequences of their
          words. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] That is not to say that each word in an agreement must be
placed under the interpretative microscope in isolation and given
a meaning without regard to the entire document and the nature of
the relationship created by the agreement.  Context can elucidate
and assist in revealing the plain meaning of words used in a
contract.  One part of an agreement may enlighten as to the
meaning to be given to words used in another part of the
agreement.  Similarly, the relationship created by the agreement
and its overall purpose as indicated in the agreement may assist
in giving meaning to particular words or phrases within the
agreement.  Context in this sense does not, however, refer to
extrinsic evidence of the conduct of the parties or expert
evidence as to the meaning of words used in the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Like Rosenberg J., I find no ambiguity in the language of
paragraph 19.  That paragraph plainly requires that &quot;each party
shall remit the required funds.&quot;  The &quot;required funds&quot; are those
that will be &quot;expended&quot; in that month.  The words &quot;required
funds&quot; and &quot;expended&quot; can only refer to cash needs, not to other
forms of liability.  This plain meaning is confirmed by the
content of paragraph 20 which deals with cost overruns.  It
speaks of &quot;actual expenditures&quot; and requires that &quot;funds&quot; be
remitted to the operator to &quot;fund the overrun.&quot;  All of this
language is consistent with payments towards actual expenses
incurred and inconsistent with liabilities for which no payment
is due.</pre>
    <pre>[19] In  oral argument, counsel for Exall suggested that
paragraph 19 was ambiguous when considered in combination with
paragraph 22.  Paragraph 22 refers to a party's &quot;required
contribution to expenditures under a work plan.&quot;  Counsel
submitted that as the work plan extended over a twelve-month
period, it could only be determined whether a party had failed to
make its &quot;required contribution&quot;, at the end of the work plan and
not at the end of any given month covered by the work plan.  As
paragraphs 19 and 22 are clearly linked in the agreement, counsel
argued that paragraph 19 could not be interpreted as only
referring to actual expenses in any given month.</pre>
    <pre>[20] I think this is a strained reading of paragraph 22.  Section
19 imposes the obligation to contribute to monthly expenses in
accordance with the monthly projections provided by the operator
and directs the reader to paragraph 22 for the effect of a
failure to make the contributions required by paragraph 19.
Paragraph 22 provides that the failure to make the necessary
contributions results in a reduction of the participating
interest of the party who failed to make the payments required
under paragraph 19.  The reference to the work plan in the
opening words of paragraph 22 merely informs the reader as to the
source of the expenditures.  They flow from the operations set
out in the work plan.</pre>
    <pre>[21] The language of the relevant paragraphs considered in the
context of the entire agreement and the relationship created by
it reveal a clear and unambiguous meaning.  Each party was
required to fund the ongoing cash needs of the joint venture on a
monthly basis in proportion to its interest in the joint venture.
There was no need to look to extrinsic evidence or expert opinion
in order to properly interpret the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>B:   Relief From Forfeiture</pre>
    <pre>[22] Exall submitted that it should have been granted relief from
forfeiture or alternatively, that the determination of that issue
should have been postponed until all of the issues raised on the
application had been decided.  It argued that Rosenberg J. failed
to consider significant evidence that was relevant to the
question of whether Exall's conduct was reasonable in all of the
circumstances.  Exall further contended that Rosenberg J. could
not accurately assess the disparity between the value of the
property forfeited and the damage caused by Exall's breach of the
agreement until all of the outstanding monetary issues had been
resolved.</pre>
    <pre>[23] Glimmer countered with the submission that relief from
forfeiture was not available in these circumstances and
alternatively, that if it was, Rosenberg J. properly exercised
his discretion in refusing to grant relief from forfeiture.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Glimmer's contention that relief from forfeiture is not
available was raised for the first time in a supplementary factum
filed on appeal.  In support of this position, it characterized
Exall's failure to pay its share of the monthly expenses, not as
a breach of paragraph 19 of the agreement, but as an election
under paragraph 18 not to participate in the work plan.  Glimmer
submitted that in exercising its option to not participate, Exall
was not in breach of the agreement and therefore the doctrine of
relief from forfeiture had no application.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The relevant part of paragraph 18 of the agreement reads:</pre>
    <pre>          Each party must within 30 days of receipt of
          an approved work plan and budget, elect
          whether to participate in the work plan and
          fund its share of the required expenditures.
          Failure to elect within this time shall be
          deemed to be an election not to participate.
          ...</pre>
    <pre>[26] Glimmer argued that Exall elected not to participate thereby
triggering paragraph 22 of the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[27] I cannot agree with this characterization of Exall's
conduct.  Exall prepared the work plan and on its understanding
of paragraph 19 of the agreement, purported to participate in
that work plan by assuming 60% of the liabilities contemplated
under that plan.  There is no suggestion in the record that Exall
invoked paragraph 18 or failed to make any election referred to
in that paragraph.  Nor is there any suggestion that Glimmer took
Exall's conduct to be an election under paragraph 18.  To the
contrary, Exall clearly chose to participate in the work plan.
The dispute arose because Glimmer claimed that Exall's mode of
participation, the assumption of 60% of the liabilities as
opposed to 60% of the monthly cash requirements, did not comply
with paragraph 19 of the agreement.  It runs contrary to the
entire record, the conduct of the parties, and the manner in
which the case was placed before Rosenberg J. to now recast
Exall's conduct as an election not to participate under paragraph
18.</pre>
    <pre>[28] As I would reject Glimmer's contention that Exall elected
under paragraph 18 not to participate in the work plan, it
follows that the cases relied on by Glimmer in support of its
contention that relief from forfeiture was unavailable have no
application to this case.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Having concluded that relief from forfeiture was available,
I turn to Exall's argument that the remedy should have been
granted.  Relief from forfeiture is a discretionary remedy.  The
decision at first instance to grant or refuse the remedy will be
sustained on appeal unless the appellant can show either an error
in principle in the exercise of that discretion or that the
manner in which the discretion was exercised was unreasonable in
all of the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The parties accept that Rosenberg J. identified the three
factors to be considered in deciding whether to grant relief from
forfeiture.  The two factors in issue in this case are the
reasonableness of Exall's conduct; and the disparity, if any,
between the value of the property forfeited by Exall and the
damage caused to Glimmer by the breach.</pre>
    <pre>[31] In holding that Exall's conduct was not reasonable,
Rosenberg J. focussed exclusively on the effect of Exall's
interpretation of the agreement as of September 1996.  He
observed that Exall's interpretation reduced Glimmer's interest
in the joint venture by 5.5% and increased its own interest by
the same amount, although neither party made any cash
contribution for that month.  While this factor was relevant to
an assessment of the reasonableness of Exall's conduct, the
reasonableness inquiry should have gone beyond this single factor
and addressed other relevant circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[32] There was evidence that Exall's interpretation of the
agreement was consistent with the approach taken by Norex and
Hemlo in the several years prior to Exall's involvement.  That
evidence could support Exall's contention that it reasonably
believed it was carrying on the funding of expenses in the same
manner as its predecessors Norex and Hemlo.  While Rosenberg J.
properly held that this evidence was inadmissible as an aid in
interpreting the language of the agreement, he should have
considered that evidence in determining whether Exall's conduct
was reasonable for the purposes of determining whether relief
from forfeiture should be granted.  Exall was entitled to rely on
that evidence  to support its contention that it did nothing more
than carry on the operation in the way it reasonably believed its
predecessors had carried on the operation for several years
without objection by Glimmer.  If, and this is a matter of
controversy, that evidence were accepted, Exall's reasonable
belief that it was simply carrying on business as usual would
become an important factor in determining whether its conduct was
reasonable.  The failure to consider that evidence constitutes an
error in principle.</pre>
    <pre>[33] There are two other features of the evidence which should
have been considered in determining whether Exall acted
reasonably.  First, the effect of Exall's interpretation of the
agreement on the financial obligations of Exall and Glimmer over
the entire span of the work plan should have been considered.
The relationship between the parties was an ongoing one and Exall
deserved to have the reasonableness of its interpretation of the
agreement assessed in the light of the entire relationship.
Exall contended that by the end of the work plan its cash
contributions equalled its 60% interest.  If true, Exall would
still be in breach of paragraph 19 of the agreement by failing to
make the monthly payments, but payment of its share of the
expenses within the time frame of the work plan would be relevant
in assessing the reasonableness of Exall's conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[34] Second, the evidence of Exall's full and timely disclosure
of its mode of operation to Glimmer, its invitation to Glimmer to
raise any problems Glimmer had with that operation, and Glimmer's
purported acquiescence should have been considered in deciding
whether Exall acted reasonably.  If, and again these matters are
in dispute, Exall made full and timely disclosure to Glimmer,
invited Glimmer to raise any problems, and Glimmer acquiesced in
Exall's mode of operation, these factors would be relevant to the
reasonableness of Exall's conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The finding that Exall acted unreasonably cannot stand as it
was made on the basis of only one of the many relevant
evidentiary factors.  This court is not in a position to decide
whether Exall acted reasonably as many of the relevant facts are
in dispute.  Since the case must go back before a judge of the
Ontario Court (General Division) after the reference is
completed, the best course is to direct that the issue as to
whether the appropriateness of granting relief from forfeiture be
decided at that time when all of the relevant circumstances can
be considered.  This direction has the further salutary effect of
allowing the court to determine whether relief from forfeiture
should be granted after all of the monetary matters affecting the
respective rights and obligations of the parties under the
agreement have been decided.  At that time, the court can make an
informed determination whether there is a substantial disparity
between the value of the property forfeited by Exall and the
damage caused to Glimmer by the breach.</pre>
    <pre>[36] I would allow the appeal from the order of October 28, 1997
to the extent only of varying that order by deleting paragraph 2.
Exall is free to raise the issue of relief from forfeiture after
the reference is complete in subsequent proceedings before the
Ontario Court (General Division).</pre>
    <pre>II.  The Appeal from the Order of February 2, 1998</pre>
    <pre>[37] In January 1998, after hearing further submissions from
counsel, Rosenberg J. elaborated on the terms of the reference he
had directed in October 1997.  By an order dated February 2,
1998, he gave further direction as to the calculation of the
management fee and the contested liabilities charged against the
venture by Exall.  He also gave more precise instructions as to
how those calculations should be used for the purpose of
determining the respective interests of Exall and Glimmer under
paragraph 22 of the agreement.  There was also a provision in the
order dealing with future projected monthly expenditures and
increases in those projections.</pre>
    <pre>[38] Exall filed a notice of appeal from the February order in
which it raised several grounds of appeal.  None of those grounds
has been developed either in written or oral argument.  Exall did
not even refer to any of the grounds of appeal in its factum.
Glimmer addressed some of those grounds in its respondent's
factum.  Exall then responded to Glimmer's submissions in a reply
factum.</pre>
    <pre>[39] In oral argument, counsel for Exall did not refer to any of
the issues specifically addressed in the order of February 2nd.
He did make brief submissions with respect to one part of the
endorsement which led to the order of February.  In that part of
the endorsement, Rosenberg J. indicated that under the agreement
Exall was not entitled to &quot;catch up&quot; on delinquent monthly
payments during the period of the work plan and thereby avoid a
reduction of its interest in the joint venture under paragraph 22
of the agreement.  Exall's contention that this interpretation of
the agreement was erroneous is not really an appeal from the
order of February 2, 1998, but is rather a restatement of the
argument that the order of October 1997 reflects an erroneous
interpretation of the agreement.  The conclusion that Exall was
not entitled under the terms of the agreement to &quot;catch up&quot; on
delinquent payments at the end of a work plan is consistent with
and flows from the interpretation of the agreement provided in
the October 1997 order.  For the reasons set out above, I agree
with that interpretation.</pre>
    <pre>[40] I do not propose to deal with any of the other grounds of
appeal set out in the notice of appeal from the February 1998
order.  Suffice it to say that Exall has failed to demonstrate
that any of those grounds have merit.  I would dismiss Exall's
appeal from that order.</pre>
    <pre>III. Costs</pre>
    <pre>[41] As success on the appeal from the October order is divided,
I would make no order as to costs in that appeal.  Glimmer is
entitled to its costs on the appeal from the February order.
