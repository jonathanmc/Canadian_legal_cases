    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  After hearing the appellant’s oral submissions, the court
indicated that it was not necessary to hear from the respondents
and dismissed the appeal. In view of the result we have reached,
we need not decide whether the appellant contracted with the
individual respondents or the corporate respondent or both. For
ease of reference, we will refer to the respondents in this
endorsement in the plural.

[2]  The appellant brought a motion to introduce fresh evidence.
In our view, he  has failed to satisfy the due diligence test set
out in Palmer v. Palmer. The three documents that the appellant
now alleges were improperly altered by the respondents were
produced by the respondents prior to the examinations for
discovery and were introduced by the appellant at trial. The
appellant had ample opportunity to raise any concerns about the
accuracy of these documents at trial and did not do so. Although
he now seeks to blame his trial lawyer for this failure, he did
not notify his trial lawyer that he would be taking this position
and did not provide that lawyer with an opportunity to respond.
The motion to introduce fresh evidence is dismissed.

[3]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
dismissing his claim that the respondent Donald Hunter had
deceitfully and falsely represented himself as a contractor,
personally experienced and competent to design and erect a Lindal
home. In rejecting this claim the trial judge found that Donald
Hunter had an honest belief that he was capable and competent to
erect a Lindal home and that in any event, the appellant’s
decision to hire the respondents was not based on what he alleged
at trial to be a misrepresentation but rather on the
circumstances in which the appellant found himself and his
favourable impression of Donald Hunter’s engineering background.
These findings were supported by the evidence. We see no merit in
this ground of appeal.

[4]  Next the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
denying his claim that the respondents had agreed to perform the
work for a fixed price of $185,000 plus certain extras including
the fireplace and the eavestroughing. The trial judge found that
the letter of December 17, 1990, signed by the parties,
incorporating the memorandum of September 21, 1990, set out the
terms of the contract. Those documents clearly show that many of
the prices that had been listed in the memorandum of September 21
were subject to change. The respondents sent weekly billings
detailing the work being done.  The appellant paid the invoices
in a timely fashion. By April 14, 1991, the appellant had paid
$253,474.06 which was well in excess of the amount that the
appellant later claimed was the agreed upon fixed price. In our
view, the trial judge correctly found that the agreement was not
for a fixed price. This ground of appeal therefore fails.

[5]  The appellant spent a considerable amount of time on appeal
arguing that the respondents had overcharged him by falsifying
hours and rates, charging for tools and equipment that should
properly have been paid for by a general contractor,  ignoring
the appellant’s instructions and importing and using unnecessary
landfill. The respondents called evidence denying these
allegations of overcharging.

[6]  In the course of this litigation the respondents produced
their documents relating to the project including records with
invoices from subcontractors and material suppliers as well as
timesheets in order to justify their accounts. In addressing the
appellant’s argument that he had been overcharged, the trial
judge said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               <font size="3">As the Plaintiff was approaching this matter on the basis
          that he had a “fixed price contract” in the entirety, and that
          position was not accepted by the court, the court is left with
          the Defendant’s evidence and his invoices and timesheets and
          copies of his subcontractor’s invoices and invoices for
          materials. The Plaintiff has not satisfied the court that the
          Defendant did not perform the work billed other than the items
          referred to below.</font>
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  The dispute with respect to overcharging by the respondents
raised questions of fact. The trial judge considered these issues
and indeed made some allowances in the appellant’s favour. This
court will only interfere with findings of fact when the findings
of the trial judge cannot be reasonably supported by the
evidence. We see no basis to conclude that the trial judge erred
in this regard.

[8]  Finally, the appellant argues that the respondents were
negligent in performing some of the services for which the
appellant was charged. In the pleadings, the appellant did not
make a claim for damages based on negligence. At trial, he led
evidence of faulty workmanship arguing that this was another
reason why the court should reduce the amount of money claimed by
the respondents. The respondents called evidence disputing the
appellant’s allegations. This issue also involved findings of
fact by the trial judge. The trial judge made no allowance for
faulty workmanship. On the evidence that decision was open to
him. We see no basis to interfere with his finding in this
regard.

[9]  For all of the above reasons the appeal is dismissed with
costs.</pre></td>
