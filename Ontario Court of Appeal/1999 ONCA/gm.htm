    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Mr. Justice B. MacDougall and
sentence imposed on June 23, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from his conviction on two counts of
indecent assault and from the sentence of thirty months'
imprisonment.  The complainant on both counts was the appellant&#146;s
daughter.  She testified that over a period of approximately
eight years, when she was between the ages of six and thirteen,
she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by the appellant, her
father.  These acts occurred in the years 1970 to 1979 and ended
when the complainant and her mother left the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Counsel for the appellant raises three grounds of appeal
from conviction:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The verdict is unreasonable having regard to the
          inconsistencies in the complainant&#146;s evidence and the
          contradictory evidence called by the defence;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The trial judge reversed the onus
          of proof by requiring the appellant to
          disprove the allegations; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The trial judge employed a standard
          of proof on a balance of probabilities.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We would not give effect to any of these grounds and the
appeal from conviction must be dismissed.  Each of the grounds
can be dealt with briefly.
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[4]  There were some inconsistencies in the complainant&#146;s
evidence.  However, the trial judge dealt with them in his review
of the evidence and was satisfied with the explanations provided
by the complainant.  Those explanations were not inherently
improbable.  For example, following the first finding of guilt,
the complainant instructed counsel to commence a law suit against
the appellant, notwithstanding her evidence during the trial that
she was not interested in pursuing the case against the appellant
for money.  When the case was reopened, the complainant provided
an explanation for launching this suit.  The trial judge also
accepted the complainant&#146;s explanation for inconsistencies
between the allegations in the statement of claim and in her
testimony.  These were therefore matters for the trial judge.  On
this record, the reasons provided by the complainant were capable
of belief.  These inconsistencies did not render the verdict
unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  As counsel for the Crown pointed out in her argument, some
of the alleged inconsistencies may be explained simply by the
complainant&#146;s lack of sophistication and her unusual use of
language.  These matters were preeminently for the trial judge to
consider and resolve.  Other alleged inconsistencies such as the
sleeping arrangements were, in the context of this case,
relatively minor.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Some of the complainant&#146;s evidence was contradicted by the
defence evidence, especially the testimony of the appellant&#146;s
other daughter.  However, the trial judge had the opportunity to
observe this witness and consider her testimony within the
context of the other evidence, especially the testimony from the
complainant&#146;s mother.  The trial judge did not accept the
sister&#146;s evidence and he gave his reasons for that conclusion.
For example, he found her to be a partisan witness and that there
were unresolved inconsistencies in her testimony.  These reasons
are supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Finally, we do not accept the submission that this was a
case of so-called &#147;recovered memory&#148;.  There was evidence from
three different sources that over the period of the assaults the
complainant made contemporaneous complaints about the appellant&#146;s
conduct towards her.  She also made some disclosure to a
boyfriend a few years after the assaults.  While none of these
complaints contained the detail of the trial evidence, they
support the complainant&#146;s testimony that she always remembered
the abuse.  There was some problem occasioned by the 1993 car
accident and the effects of a head injury suffered by the
complainant.  However, the trial judge was satisfied that the
complainant&#146;s long-term memory of the abuse was unaffected.  The
verdict was not unreasonable.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   Reversing the burden of proof</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In our view, the reasons of the trial judge do not support
the submission that the trial judge reversed the burden of proof
and put the onus on the appellant to disprove the allegations.
The trial judge exhaustively dealt with the various arguments put
against the reliability and credibility of the complainant&#146;s
allegations.  He did not fall into any error in resolving those
issues.  This is not a case like R. v. S. (W.) (1994), 90 C.C.C.
(3d) 243 (Ont. C.A.).  In that case, at pp. 253-54 Finlayson J.A.
criticized the approach of the trial judge in the following
terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The trial judge in the present case gave full reasons and he
          recited the evidence accurately. He also referred to the
          appropriate authorities. I cannot say that he misdirected himself
          in a material way. His overall approach to this particular case,
          however, was wrong. Instead of questioning the veracity and
          accuracy of the witnesses who, because of the nature of the
          charge, were called to support a negative, he should have been
          more critical of the complainant who put forward the affirmative
          that the offences took place: see R. v. Norman, supra, at pp. 172-
          3. This is another example of the way the trial judge shifted the
          onus to the appellant in spite of the Crown's burden to prove all
          elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The approach of the trial judge in this case was quite
different.  He did critically examine the evidence of the
complainant.  He also carefully examined the defence evidence.
His reasons demonstrate that he was conscious that the burden was
on the Crown.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The standard of proof</pre>
    <pre>[10] At the conclusion of his reasons, the trial judge said the
following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court finds on balance, that the evidence of the
          complainant to be credible and reliable.  On the whole, the Court
          therefore is not left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the
          alleged offenses did take place, and accordingly, I find the
          accused guilty as charged. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[11] Counsel for the appellant argues that the phrase &#147;on
balance&#148; suggests that the trial judge employed the civil
standard of proof on a balance of probabilities rather than the
criminal burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  We agree
with Crown counsel that in the context the phrase &#147;on balance&#148;
means nothing more than &#147;for the most part&#148; and indicates that
the trial judge had accepted the essential allegations of the
complainant although not all of what he referred to as the
&#147;peripheral details&#148;.  Throughout his reasons, the trial judge
made it abundantly clear that he accepted the complainant&#146;s
evidence and found her explanations &#147;reasonable and credible&#148;.
He then concluded that on the whole of the evidence, including
the other testimony, such as the evidence of the mother, the
childhood friend of the complainant, and the documentary
evidence, the case was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Sentence Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[12] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing
to impose a conditional sentence, especially bearing in mind the
appellant&#146;s age, his state of health, his attempts at
reconciliation with the complainant and the date of the offences.
The trial judge gave very careful reasons and considered the then
leading cases from this court on conditional sentencing.  He
concluded that the offences required imposition of a penitentiary
sentence and accordingly a conditional sentence was not
available.  The appellant has not demonstrated that the sentence
was unfit or that the trial judge made any error in principle.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[13] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave
to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal from sentence is
also dismissed.
