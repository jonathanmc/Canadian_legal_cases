GOUDGE J.A.:
</font></b></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]       This is an appeal by the defendants from the judgment
of Kennedy J. dated August 15, 1997 in which he awarded judgment
to the plaintiff Goderich Elevators Limited (&quot;Goderich&quot;) on an
insurance policy issued by the defendant insurers.  Goderich was
awarded recovery for its loss under an all-risks policy.  The
insurers were unsuccessful at trial in bringing the loss within
the exclusions provided in the policy.  For the reasons that
follow I agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge and
would dismiss the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]       The facts can be simply stated.  Goderich is an owner
and operator of grain elevators in which it warehouses grain for
others.  On November 4 and 5, 1991, Goderich loaded a shipment of
grain onto a lake freighter from its grain elevators in Prescott,
Ontario.  As a result of inspection, done after the freighter
departed, some 5,400 tonnes of the shipment was downgraded from
#1 grain and #2 grain to lower grades.  A portion of the 5,400
tonnes was downgraded to #3 grain.  The remainder was downgraded
even more, to F-feeder wheat.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       The downgrading was due to the discovery in the
shipment of &quot;heated&quot; grain in greater concentrations than is
permitted for #1 and #2 grains.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       &quot;Heated&quot; grain is defined in the literature of the
Canadian Grain Commission as follows:
          Heated kernels have the colour, taste or
          odour typical of grain that has heated in
          storage….
          Heated grain always gives off musty odours.
          These odours will carry through to the
          finished product.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       The evidence at trial made clear that heated grain
arises from an increase in the temperature of the grain for which
there may be a number of different possible causes.  Those causes
may be external, for example artificial drying of the grain at
too high a temperature.  Alternatively it can be due to
spontaneous internal causes such as slightly excessive moisture
content in the grain leading to microbial heating of the kernels.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       On the evidence before him, the trial judge found that
external causes were eliminated.  However, the evidence did not
provide a precise explanation for what caused the excessive
presence of heated grain in the spoiled portion of the shipment.
The trial judge ultimately concluded that the cause of the damage
to the grain was unknown but that the &quot;heated&quot; grain resulted
from this unknown cause while it was in storage at Prescott under
the care and control of Goderich.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]       The consequential loss to Goderich of the downgrading
of a part of this shipment was $455,761.56.  It is this loss that
Goderich claimed under its all-risks insurance policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]       That policy, in effect at the time of the loss, was
prepared by Reed Stenhouse, Goderich's insurance broker.  It was
placed with the appellant insurers.  The evidence at trial was
that the policy was not drawn for Goderich or for the grain
industry but was used to insure a variety of industries.  The
trial judge found that the central exclusion, namely &quot;heating&quot;,
was not intended to have any significance particular to
agriculture.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       The all-risk coverage in the policy was broadly drawn.
It insured Goderich against &quot;all risks of direct physical loss or
damage occurring during the term of this policy except as
hereinafter excluded&quot;.  By specific endorsement the policy
expressly covered loss in respect of grain.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The exclusion to this coverage that is at issue here reads
as follows:
          10.  PERILS EXCLUDED:
               This Policy does not insure against:
               . . .
               (d)  loss or damage caused directly or
                    indirectly by dampness of
                    atmosphere, dryness of atmosphere,
                    changes of temperature, heating,
                    . . . but this exclusion shall not
                    apply where the cause of loss or
                    damage is a peril not excluded
                    elsewhere in this Policy…;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In this context the appellant insurers raise two arguments.
Although not their primary argument, they first argue that the
insured Goderich established no causal event to trigger coverage
at all.  Alternatively and more importantly they say that the
exclusions, particularly that of &quot;heating&quot;, apply to negate
coverage.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Before addressing these arguments it is useful to repeat one
of the general principles of interpretation of insurance policies
set out by McLachlin J. in Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Ltd. v.
Simcoe &amp; Erie General Insurance Co. (1993), 13 C.C.L.I. (2d) 161
(S.C.C.) at 176, namely that coverage provisions should be
construed broadly and exclusion provisions narrowly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The appellants' first argument, namely that on these facts
there is no coverage because there is no causal event, cannot
succeed in my view.  This is a very broadly worded all-risks
policy.  It covers all risks of physical loss or damage in
respect of grain.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In British and Foreign Marine Ins. Co. v. Gaunt (1921), 2
A.C. 41 at 47, Lord Birkenhead described the coverage under an
all-risks policy as follows:
          Damage in other words, if it is to be covered
          by policies such as these, must be due to
          some fortuitous circumstance or casualty.
          . . .
          [W]here all risks are covered by the policy
          and not merely risks of a specified class or
          classes, the plaintiff discharges his special
          onus when he has proved that the loss was
          caused by some event covered by the general
          expression and he is not bound to go further
          and prove the exact nature of the accident or
          casualty which, in fact, occasioned his loss.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] In my opinion, although the cause remains unknown, the fact
that grain became &quot;heated&quot; grain while in the care and control of
Goderich is exactly the kind of &quot;fortuitous event&quot; that triggers
the coverage of this all-risks policy.  Something happened which
resulted in the damage to the grain.  The answer to the
appellants' assertion that this conclusion would extend coverage
to the normal day-to-day business risks of warehousing grain is
that the Goderich plant manager, with over forty years of
experience in the business, had never before had a cargo of grain
downgraded as occurred here.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The appellants' second argument, namely that these facts
come within the exclusions clause, must also fail.  The
appellants acknowledge that they bear the onus of demonstrating
that the loss comes within the applicable exclusion.  I have
concluded that since the insurers were not able to demonstrate
the cause of the &quot;heated&quot; grain, they failed to bring the loss
within the &quot;heating&quot; exclusion upon which they primarily relied.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] In my view, particularly given the requirement to read
exclusion provisions narrowly, it cannot be said that all
&quot;heated&quot; grain must necessarily be caused by &quot;heating&quot;.  Rather,
for damage to property to be caused by &quot;heating&quot; the ordinary
meaning of that term suggests that the property has been heated
by contact with an external heat source, such as a flame or
electrical element.  The heating comes from the external heat
source, the very thing the trial judge found to be excluded by
the evidence here.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] While it is true that grain can &quot;heat&quot; spontaneously due to
internal causes, in ordinary usage, objects are heated.  They do
not heat.  Other specified exclusions such as &quot;dampness of
atmosphere&quot; and &quot;dryness of atmosphere&quot; are consistent with the
conclusion that &quot;heating&quot; is restricted to external sources of
heat.  Moreover, as I have said, there is no suggestion that this
exclusion was written to capture a meaning for &quot;heating&quot; that
specialized usage in grain handling might suggest, and which
might encompass spontaneous internal causes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Hence, I conclude that the appellants cannot succeed on
these facts in bringing this loss within the &quot;heating&quot; exclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The appellants also rely on the &quot;change in temperature&quot;
exclusion.  However, Mr. Hobson candidly conceded – correctly I
think – that this exclusion and the &quot;heating&quot; exclusion are like
hand and glove.  The former does not go beyond the latter in
assisting the insurers.  Indeed, consistent with the external
cause approach set out above, Gale J. in Ford Motor Company of
Canada Ltd. v. The Prudential Assurance Company Ltd. et al.,
[1957] O.R. 409 interpreted the &quot;change in temperature&quot; exclusion
in a specific risk policy to be confined to changes in
atmospheric temperature which occur in the course of nature.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] I would therefore conclude that the insurers cannot
demonstrate that this loss comes within the &quot;change in
temperature&quot; exclusion any more than they can bring it within the
&quot;heating&quot; exclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] While the respondent relies as well on the contra
proferentum principle, I find it unnecessary to resort to that
principle in this case.  However, given the facts here, I think
the words of Finch J. in British Columbia Ferry Corporation v.
Commonwealth Insurance Co. et al. (1985), 14 C.C.L.I. 216 at 222
are apposite:
          Although the defendants did not draw the
          wording of the policy, it approved the
          wording and agreed to insure the plaintiff on
          the terms set out in the policy.  The terms
          are that all risks are insured against,
          unless expressly excluded.  It is for the
          defendant to show that the language of the
          exclusion applies to the loss in question,
          and removes it from the all embracing
          coverage of an all risks policy.  I need not
          decide, and do not purport to decide, whether
          such an onus exists in the case of a
          specified peril policy, which was drafted by
          an insured. But, an all-risks coverage would
          be most un-satisfactory from a commercial
          point of view if an ambiguous exclusion were
          to be construed in favour of the insurer
          against the insured.  There would be an
          incentive for the insurer to agree to unclear
          wording in exclusions and the insured would
          always be left in doubt as to the ambit of
          the coverage he had secured.  An insurer who
          seeks to limit his exposure under an all-
          risks policy by excluding losses due to
          certain specified perils, has the onus of
          specifying the peril clearly, and then of
          showing that the loss in fact suffered is
          within the excluding language. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] These insurers have not done that.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] In conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
