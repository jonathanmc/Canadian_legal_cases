    <pre>[1]  Although the appellant raised several grounds of appeal, we
only found it necessary to call upon the respondent on one
ground, namely, whether the trial judge erred in failing to give
a Vetrovec warning to the jury with respect to the evidence of
the young complainant.

[2]  Because the appellant did not raise this issue at trial,
either before or after the charge to the jury, to give effect to
it we must be satisfied that the trial judge effectively had no
choice but to give such a warning. While it might have been
preferable had such a warning been given, we are not satisfied
that the trial judge erred in failing to do so.

[3]  The trial judge fully and fairly reviewed for the jury the
relevant contradictions, frailties and inconsistencies in the
complainant&#146;s evidence. In doing so, he clearly brought home to
the jury the crucial issue of the complainant&#146;s credibility and
reliability and he instructed the jury to consider the degree to
which the complainant&#146;s evidence was supported by, or consistent
with, other material aspects of the evidence which they did
accept. In this respect, we note that the complainant&#146;s evidence
was bolstered to a significant degree by the medical evidence
which confirmed that she had been sexually abused.

[4]  In sum, when the charge is read as a whole, we are satisfied
that the jury would have appreciated the need to scrutinize the
complainant&#146;s evidence with care. Accordingly, this ground of
appeal fails.

[5]  In our view, the other grounds of appeal against conviction
are without merit and the appeal from conviction is, accordingly,
dismissed.

[6]  With respect to sentence, it was open to the trial judge to
find that the appellant continuously abused the complainant over
a period of several years while he was in a position of trust.
That being so, we see no basis for interfering with the sentence
imposed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal
against sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
