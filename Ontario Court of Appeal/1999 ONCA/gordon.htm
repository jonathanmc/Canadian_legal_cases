COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            GARTH DAVID GORDON (Applicant (Respondent in
               Appeal)) v. MICHELLE GAIL GORDON (Respondent
               (Appellant))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CARTHY, MOLDAVER AND BORINS JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Michelle Gail Gordon, appellant, in person</pre>
    <pre>               D. Gerald Rayner
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   It  is acknowledged by counsel for the respondent that  the
trial  judge&#146;s  remarks  as  to the  employment  history  of  the
respondent  and,  in  particular, that  he  was  being  laid  off
contrary to the law, were based upon counsel&#146;s statement, not the
evidence.

[2]  In our view, his finding in this respect is critical to the
decision which is founded upon the husband&#146;s changed
circumstances. On the actual evidence, it is easier to conclude
that he was running from the enforcement officer and quitting his
employment to avoid his obligations. To view it otherwise, we
must assume each employer acted illegally and no grievance
ensued.

[3]  Absent a proper evidentiary foundation, there was no
justification for any variation order. Accordingly, Wright J.&#146;s
order of May 21, 1998 is set aside leaving the order of June 3,
1993 in effect. Should the respondent wish to vary this on a
proper evidentiary basis, he may move to do so.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The support deduction order in the usual terms should issue.
The appellant has represented herself throughout and therefore
she shall recover costs, limited to taxable disbursements, of the
hearing and appeal from the respondent.</pre></td>
