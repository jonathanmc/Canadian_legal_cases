    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We have concluded that we must interfere with the decision
below. As a result of certain comments made by the trial judge we
are concerned that the outcome of the case may have been affected
by inappropriate considerations.
[2]  There was evidence at trial that it was the practice of the
police in Hamilton, apparently directed by senior officers and
the police association, to refrain from requiring a police
officer involved in a motor vehicle accident to make a statement
or provide information regarding the accident. Following this
practice, the officer investigating the accident in which the
appellant was involved did not ask the appellant, a police
constable, to give any information about the accident. As a
result, the first written record of the appellant&#146;s description
of the accident was made when she was interviewed by the Special
Investigations Unit ten or eleven days later.
[3]  It was obvious that the trial judge strongly disapproved of
this practice. On several occasions during the trial and in his
reasons for judgment he expressed his disapproval in strong
language. In doing so he created the regrettable impression that
he may have been using this trial, involving issues of liability
between two individuals, as a means of sending a message that
this practice of the police is not acceptable.
[4]  This problem was exacerbated by comments that the trial
judge made regarding the appellant&#146;s credibility. During the
course of the appellant&#146;s evidence, the trial judge stated that
in failing to provide a statement to the investigating officer,
the appellant had broken the law. He was apparently referring to
s. 199 of the Highway Traffic Act. This statement was in error.
The respondent concedes that there is no duty on a person
involved in a motor vehicle accident to make a statement on her
own initiative. Section 199 requires only that the person furnish
the investigating officer with information as may be required by
the officer. The appellant was not asked for any information
about the accident by the investigating officer. She was under no
duty &#147;to volunteer&#148; such information.
[5]  In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge began his
analysis of the evidence by stating that the appellant&#146;s
credibility was clearly in issue. In addressing the appellant&#146;s
credibility, he placed considerable emphasis on his erroneous
view that she had &#147;knowingly disobeyed the law&#148; and concluded
that her inability to remember certain details at trial &#147;does not
have a ring of truth.&#148;
[6]  Having dealt with the appellant&#146;s credibility in this
manner, the trial judge went on to find that the appellant was
negligent because she had failed to keep a proper look out for
pedestrians or other traffic and to also find that the respondent
had not been contributorily negligent. The question to be
determined is whether the trial judge&#146;s views about what he
perceived to be the unacceptable practice of the police
department and about the appellant&#146;s conduct in not providing a
statement may have affected these findings.
[7]  Having reviewed the evidence, we are satisfied that the
finding that the appellant was negligent was warranted. All of
the independent witnesses saw the respondent before the accident
and the other drivers were able to stop before reaching the point
where the appellant was crossing the street. Although the vehicle
to the appellant&#146;s left may have obscured her view at some point,
we do not think that it can totally account for the appellant&#146;s
failure to see the respondent throughout the time prior to the
accident. Whatever view one takes of the appellant&#146;s credibility,
the totality of the evidence leads to a conclusion that she
failed to keep a proper lookout.
[8]  On the other hand, the trial judge&#146;s finding that there was
no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent was most
unsatisfactory. In order to determine this issue, it would have
been helpful to determine how long before the accident the
respondent had left the sidewalk to cross Main Street. The trial
judge made no finding of fact in this regard nor did he address
the issue whether the respondent should have returned to the
north curb once she saw the traffic approaching. Moreover, as we
point out below, there was considerable evidence to suggest that
the respondent was negligent. The trial judge&#146;s reasons in
support of the finding were nothing more than his conclusion that
the appellant had been negligent. The inadequacy of these
reasons, together with our concern that the trial judge may have
been influenced by inappropriate matters, lead us to conclude
that the finding that there was no contributory negligence must
be set aside.
[9]  Normally, in circumstances such as this, we would send the
matter back for a new trial. However, the accident happened five
years ago and the respondent is now over 90 years of age. In
these circumstances, we think it preferable that we assess the
evidence and make the necessary findings to dispose of the case.
[10] In our view, there was substantial evidence that the
respondent was negligent and that this negligence contributed to
the accident. The respondent was crossing the street between
intersections and not at a crosswalk. This is a busy one-way
street. She was in the roadway in breach of s. 144(22) of the
Highway Traffic Act. Her actions contributed to the peril in
which she found herself. When she saw the traffic moving in an
easterly direction towards her she chose to continue crossing
rather than returning to the safety of the north sidewalk. We
would apportion the liability on the basis of 75% to the
appellant and 25% to the respondent.
[11] Subject to counsel making submissions in writing within 10
days that the costs at trial and on appeal should be affected by
an offer to settle, we make the following order:  Costs at trial
to the respondent and no order as to costs of the appeal.</pre></td>
