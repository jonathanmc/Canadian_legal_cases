    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue on this appeal is a narrow one. The Crown concedes
that the conviction of the appellant in adult court on two counts
of indecent assault should be quashed because the acts in
question were found to have taken place when the appellant was
fourteen years of age or younger. Therefore, the appellant should
have been tried as a Young Offender with respect to those acts.
(There was no transfer application and no application could have
been brought with respect to the time period alleged when the
appellant was under the age of fourteen.) The appellant submits
that, in addition to quashing his conviction, he is entitled to
an acquittal because the information also covered a time period
when he was an adult and the adult court therefore had
jurisdiction to try him. He submits that he was in jeopardy with
respect to that time period. The Crown submits that a lack of
jurisdiction is not a defence and that the convictions should be
quashed.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We agree with the position taken by the Crown. We would hope
that the Crown would elect not to proceed. In the event that the
Crown elected to proceed, it is apparent that the appellant was
placed in the position of having to put forward a defence and
following his conviction the appellant has served a substantial
portion of his sentence. In that event the appellant would be
entitled to raise the issue of abuse of process. In the result
the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed.</pre></td>
