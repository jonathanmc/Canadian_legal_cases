      <pre>COUNSEL:       Ritchie J. Linton
               for the appellants</pre>
      <pre>               James A. Ironside
               for the respondent, Galligan</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         October 18, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Langdon
dated January 22, 1998.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellants acknowledge that their case against Galligan
stands or falls on whether Galligan made a material
misrepresentation to them in August 1992 concerning the bona
fides of the mortgage held by the numbered company.  They contend
that Galligan misrepresented the fact that the mortgage was held
by the numbered company when he knew that the mortgage was mere
“paper” designed to allow Van Dyke to remain in possession and
defeat the appellants’ claim based on their judgment.  They argue
that they relied on the misrepresentation and it caused them to
forego attempts to realize on their judgment for some seventeen
months.
[2]  The trial judge found no misrepresentation.  The appellants
argue that the trial judge failed to consider Galligan’s actions
some 17 months later when Galligan purported to use money from
the sale of the mortgage as a “set-off” on a debt owed to
Galligan by Van Dyke.  The appellants submit that it was clear
from this evidence that Galligan knew as of August 1992 that the
mortgage taken by the numbered company was in fact a sham and
that Van Dyke was, in effect, the true beneficiary when the
numbered company purported to acquire the mortgage.
[3]  In our view, the inference does not follow.  By January
1994, Galligan and Van Dyke were at odds.  Galligan was taking
the position that Van Dyke had cheated him out of a great deal of
money on another investment and was trying to recover whatever he
could from wherever he could.  In our view, it cannot be inferred
from Galligan’s conduct in January 1994 that he knew that the
mortgage was a sham in August 1992.  In his evidence, he did not
testify that the mortgage taken by the numbered company was a
sham.  He testified that it was the first of a series of
investments made through the numbered company by himself, Van
Dyke and a third party.
[4]  We see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s
conclusions.  The appeal must fail.
[5]  Given the findings of fact with respect to the alleged
misrepresentation by Galligan, there is no basis for any finding
of liability against the numbered company.
[6]  We also see no reason to interfere with the costs order made
by the trial judge, given the allegation of fraud made but not
proved by the appellants.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $3,000.00.</pre></td>
