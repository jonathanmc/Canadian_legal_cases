    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. RICHARD GRANGELLO (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ABELLA, LASKIN and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Daniel J. Brodsky,
               for the appellant</pre>

    <pre>HEARD:         June 11, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by His Honour Judge August, sitting
alone, on April 18, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We have not been persuaded that these convictions are
unreasonable.  There was some slight circumstantial evidence and
the identification evidence from Ms. Lang.  However, as the Crown
concedes, the trial judge erred in holding that Ms. Lang's
identification was not in-dock identification.  There had been no
prior line-up or other form of prior identification procedure.
We cannot say that the verdict would necessarily have been the
same had the trial judge properly instructed himself as to the
frailties of in-dock identification.
[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are
quashed and a new trial is ordered.
[3]  The Crown concedes that this is not a strong case.  As the
appellant has already served his sentence, the Crown may wish to
consider whether a new trial would be in the interests of
justice.</pre></td>
