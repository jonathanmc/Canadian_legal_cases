    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Overview:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal arises out of an application in which Lillian
Granot, the residuary beneficiary of the estate of her late
father, Henry Hersen, sought the court's assistance in the
interpretation of certain provisions of Henry Hersen's will.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Haley J., in reasons reported at (1998), 21 E.T.R. (2d) 153,
held that the Swiss law of forced heirship applied to a
condominium property in Switzerland owned by Henry Hersen.  Under
the applicable Swiss law, the respondent, Roland Hersen, acquired
a 1/4 interest in that condominium upon the death of his father.
She further held that the doctrine of election applied and
required Roland Hersen to choose either his entitlement under
bequests in the will or his entitlement under the Swiss law of
forced heirship.  The trial judge also ordered that the costs of
all parties be paid out of the estate on a solicitor and client
basis.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Roland Hersen appeals submitting that the doctrine of
election has no application and that he is entitled to both the
specific gifts made to him in the will and the 1/4 interest in
the Swiss condominium.  Lillian Granot seeks leave to cross-
appeal from the costs order and seeks an order that the costs be
paid either by Roland Hersen personally, or from the proceeds of
the sale of the Swiss condominium.</pre>
    <pre>Facts:</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Henry Hersen died in Toronto in February 1996 at the age of
94.  He was survived by his daughter Lillian and his son Roland.
A second son, Norbert, predeceased his father.1  Mr. Hersen was
born in Poland and moved to Switzerland as a youth where he
acquired Swiss citizenship.  He moved to Belgium in 1930 and
immigrated to Canada in 1939.  Mr. Hersen lived in Canada until
his death and acquired Canadian citizenship sometime in the
1960s.  At the time of his death, he was a citizen of both Canada
and Switzerland.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Henry Hersen made his will about three weeks prior to his
death.  He appointed Lillian Granot as the sole executor and
trustee.  He made specific gifts to Lillian Granot and Roland
Hersen only and he directed that Lillian receive the residue of
his estate.  At the time of his death, his estate was worth about
$4.5 million.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The pertinent parts of the will are set out below:</pre>
    <pre>          III. I GIVE all my property wheresoever
          situate, including any property over which I
          may have a general power of appointment, to
          my trustees upon the following trusts,
          namely:</pre>
    <pre>                              ...</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  I HEREBY authorize and direct my trustee
          to pay out specific bequests, as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  To my son, ROLAND HERSEN the sum of SIX
          HUNDRED THOUSAND ($600,000.00) DOLLARS, for
          his own use absolutely, however, if my son,
          ROLAND HERSEN should predecease me, or die
          within thirty (30) days of my death to
          deliver the sum of SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
          ($600,000.00) DOLLARS to my daughter, LILLIAN
          GRANOT, for her own use absolutely.</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) I hereby direct my trustee to transfer
          the land registered in my name in the Town of
          Powassan, more particularly described as Part
          1, Plan 42R-3315 being Part Lot 22,
          Concession 12, Powassan, to my son, ROLAND
          HERSEN, for his own use absolutely; however,
          if my son, ROLAND HERSEN should predecease me
          or die within thirty (30) days of my death to
          transfer the land in Powassan to my daughter,
          LILLIAN GRANOT, for her own use absolutely.</pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     I hereby direct my trustee to
          deliver all household objects, furniture,
          pictures and carpets to my daughter LILLIAN
          GRANOT, for her own use absolutely.</pre>
    <pre>          IV.  I DIRECT my Trustee to transfer and
          deliver the residue of my estate to my
          daughter, LILLIAN GRANOT, for her own use
          absolutely, however, if my daughter, LILLIAN
          GRANOT should predecease me or die within
          thirty (30) days of my death, to transfer and
          deliver the residue of my estate to her issue
          in equal shares per stirpes. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[7]  There is no reference in the will to the Swiss condominium
owned by Henry Hersen at the time of his death.  There is a
dispute as to the value of that condominium, but it appears to be
worth between $600,000 and $800,000.  Haley J. held that under
the terms of s. 36(1) of the Succession Law Reform Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. S.26 the rights in the Swiss condominium upon the death
of Henry Hersen were to be determined by the &quot;internal law&quot; of
Switzerland.  Under that law, forced heirship rights applied so
as to give Roland a 1/4 interest, Lillian a 1/2 interest (1/4 as
the daughter and 1/4 as the residuary beneficiary under the
will), and a 1/8 interest to each of Norbert's two children.
None of these conclusions are in dispute on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Doctrine of Election:</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The doctrine of election as it applies to wills is described
in these terms in Feeney, The Canadian Law of Wills, 3rd ed., v.2
(1987), at p. 214:</pre>
    <pre>          ... as the ancient rule of equity provides
          that any person who accepts a benefit under a
          will is taken to have accepted the whole
          tenor of the will and must renounce any right
          that is inconsistent with any provision of
          the will.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Roland Hersen received two specific gifts in paragraph III
of the will ($600,000 and the Powassan property).  He is also
entitled to a 1/4 interest in the Swiss condominium.  That
entitlement arose outside of the will, by the operation of Swiss
domestic law.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The applicability of the doctrine of election depends upon
whether Roland Hersen's 1/4 interest in the Swiss condominium is
&quot;inconsistent with any provision of the will.&quot;  If there is a
inconsistency, Roland Hersen cannot take both under the will and
under the Swiss law.  If he elects to take the gifts provided in
the will, he must forego his rights in the condominium.  If he
chooses to take his interest in the Swiss condominium, his gifts
under the will must be reduced by an amount equal to the value of
his interest in the condominium ($150,000 - $200,000): Snell's
Equity, 29th ed. (1990), p. 504; Cheshire and North's Private
International Law, 12th ed. (1992), at p. 856.  If Roland
Hersen's interest in the Swiss condominium does not create any
inconsistency with the provisions in the will, then he is
entitled to take both the gifts under the will and his interest
in the Swiss condominium.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The 1/4 interest in the condominium given to Roland Hersen
under Swiss law will be inconsistent with the terms of the will
if Henry Hersen intended to give that interest in the condominium
to someone other than Roland Hersen.  That intention must be
found in the language of the will either expressly or by
necessary implication from the text of the will considered as a
whole: Graham v. Clark, [1949] 2 W.W.R. 1042 at 1049 (Alta. S.C.
App. Div.).</pre>
    <pre>[12] As the condominium is not referred to in the will, there can
be no suggestion of an express intent to give Roland Hersen's 1/4
interest in that condominium to someone else.  Haley J. found,
however, that by necessary implication Henry Hersen intended to
give the entire Swiss condominium to Lillian Granot as the
residuary beneficiary in his will.  In so holding, she relied on
the opening words of paragraph III of the will, &quot;I give all my
property wheresoever situate&quot;, the gifts of specific property to
Roland Hersen in paragraph III of the will, and the gift of the
entire residue of the estate to Lillian Granot in paragraph IV of
the will.  Haley J. said, at p. 165:</pre>
    <pre>          Did the testator intend that the Swiss
          condominium pass under his will to his
          residuary beneficiary?  Reading these two
          clauses together I am satisfied that they
          disclose the testator's intention to dispose
          of everything he owned by his will and that
          the words &quot;wheresoever situate&quot; cannot be
          dismissed as simply pro forma having regard
          to the actual existence of foreign property.
          The testator must be taken to know the extent
          of his assets but it is irrelevant as to
          whether or not he knew that his power to
          dispose of the foreign land was restricted by
          the Swiss law of forced heirship.  I am
          satisfied that by &quot;necessary implication&quot; the
          testator was referring to the foreign land in
          the dispositions in his will.  That being so
          we have the classic case of the testator
          disposing to Lillian an interest belonging to
          Roland and compensating Roland for the loss
          of his interest in the land by way of a cash
          legacy of $600,000 and a devise of other
          land.  Therefore Roland is put to his
          election between his Swiss interest and his
          benefits under the will.</pre>
    <pre>[13] On first impression, the conclusion of Haley J. is an
attractive one.  Counsel for the appellant has, however,
assembled an impressive array of English and Canadian
jurisprudence2 which strongly supports his contention that the
terms of this will cannot be construed as evincing an intention
to give the entirety of the condominium to Lillian Granot, the
residuary beneficiary.  If those authorities control, the
doctrine of election does not arise and Roland Hersen is entitled
to both the interest in the condominium and the gifts given to
him in the will.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Counsel's review of the English authorities begins in the
early years of the 19th century.  Those cases reveal a strong
resistance to the application of the election doctrine absent a
clear expression of the testator's intention to dispose of
property which the testator was not entitled to dispose of under
the will: e.g. see Greatorex v. Cary (1802), 31 E.R. 1223; Dummer
v. Pitcher (1833), 39 E.R. 944; Usticke v. Peters (1858), 70 E.R.
183; Gibson v. Gibson (1852), 61 E.R. 367; Maxwell v. Maxwell
(1852), 51 E.R. 717, aff'd, 42 E.R. 1048 (H.L.).</pre>
    <pre>[15] In Dummer v. Pitcher, the testator owned certain stock
jointly with his wife.  Under the applicable survivorship law,
that stock passed to his wife upon the testator's death.  In his
will, the testator purported to give his wife a life interest in
all of his funded property or estate of whatever kind and
wherever located.  He also made certain specific bequests to
other individuals to take effect upon the termination of his
wife's life interest.  The question arose as to whether the
testator had intended to give some part of his wife's ownership
in a stock to others under his will.  If that was his intention,
the wife was required to elect between her survivor rights in the
stock and the bequest made to her under the will.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Lord Brougham L.C., observed, at p. 949:</pre>
    <pre>          There is nothing more undoubted in the law
          than that to make a case of election the
          intention must appear certainly and clearly,
          both as to the property assumed to be
          disposed of, and as to the implied condition
          to be fulfilled.  A person is not, without
          strong indications of such an intent, to be
          understood as dealing with what does not
          belong to him.  As for his supposing himself
          to have rights which he had not, unless that
          appears plainly upon the face of the will, it
          would be most dangerous to be guided by any
          conjecture that may be raised to this effect,
          or to let in extrinsic evidence in proof of
          it. ... [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] The Lord Chancellor went on to hold that the general terms
of the bequest were not sufficiently specific to demonstrate an
intention to deal with the stock owned by the wife.  He
concluded:</pre>
    <pre>          There is nothing here to make it clear that
          the testator was dealing with the stock
          already purchased or which should thereafter
          be purchased.  On the contrary, the legacy is
          plainly, by all the rules on the subject, a
          general one.  But it is contended that in
          deciding upon the character of the ulterior
          legacies, the Court must refer to the
          preceding general gift to the trustees, and
          to the life interest given to the widow,
          after whose decease those legacies are to
          take effect.  This only brings it back to a
          clause of a nature as general - &quot;all my
          funded and other property.&quot;  There is nothing
          to justify the Court in holding that the
          testator thereby intended to give what was
          not his own: namely, the stock in which his
          wife had the interest by survivorship, not to
          be defeated by his will.  Very possibly, the
          court may surmise, as Lord Eldon did in Judd
          v. Pratt (13 Ves., 168), that, had he been
          asked the question, he would have said that
          the stock was his, and that he intended to
          deal with it as such.  But he has not made
          that intention clear where it ought to be
          shewn - in his will. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[18] In Gibson v. Gibson, supra, the testator made certain
specific bequests to his wife and directed that all the rest of
his estate &quot;whatsoever and wheresoever&quot; go to his trustees.  It
was argued that under the terms of the will, the testator
intended to give his wife's dower rights in his freehold property
to his trustees and that the wife was required to elect between
her dower rights and the bequests made to her under the will.
Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, at p. 371, set out four propositions
applicable to the doctrine of election.   The third and fourth
are pertinent to this case:</pre>
    <pre>          The third proposition is, that in no case is
          a person to be put to his election unless it
          is clear that the provisions of the
          instrument, under which he is entitled to a
          benefit, would be in some degree defeated by
          the assertion of his other right.  And,
          therefore, in the particular case of dower,
          unless it be clear and beyond reasonable
          doubt that the testator intended to make such
          a disposition of the real estate, that the
          assertion by the widow of her right to dower
          would prevent the giving full effect to his
          intention, the widow shall not be put to her
          election.  It is not enough to say that upon
          the whole will it is fairly to be inferred
          that the testator did not intend that his
          widow should have her dower; in order to
          justify the Court in putting her to her
          election, it must be satisfied that there is
          a positive intention to exclude her from
          dower, either expressed or clearly implied.</pre>
    <pre>          The fourth proposition is that the intention
          to exclude the wife from her dower must be
          apparent on the face of the will itself.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[19] After setting out the terms of the will, the Vice-Chancellor
rejected the argument that the general devise to the trustees
demonstrated an intention to devise the wife's dower interests in
the testator's freehold property.  He said:</pre>
    <pre>          ... Firstly, it is contended that as the
          testator, in devising his freehold and
          leasehold estates, has used these words &quot;all
          my freehold,&quot; &amp; c., it is apparent from this
          language that he meant to devise the whole of
          his freehold estates as he held and enjoyed
          them himself, as they were in his possession:
          that he intended, by the use of those
          expressions, that his widow should be
          excluded from her dower; in other words, that
          the disposition of his property intended was
          such that the claim of the widow to dower
          would be inconsistent with it.  When this
          argument was addressed to Lord Thurlow in
          Foster v. Cook (3 Br. C.C. 347), he gave this
          answer: &quot;Because the testator gives all his
          property to the trustees, am I to gather from
          his having given all he &quot;has, that he has
          given that which he had not?&quot;  That answer of
          Lord Thurlow appears to me wholly to demolish
          the argument derived from the circumstance of
          the testator having described his lands as
          &quot;all my lands.&quot; ...</pre>
    <pre>[20] In Maxwell v. Maxwell, supra, the testator owned certain
property in Scotland and England.  Under the terms of his will,
he devised to his trustees &quot;all his real and personal estate
whatsoever or wheresoever upon trust for his wife for life with
the remainder for all of his children and their heirs.&quot;  Under
Scottish law applicable to the Scottish property, the will was
ineffective and the Scottish property passed to the eldest son.
As the eldest son was also a beneficiary under the will, it was
contended that he was required to elect as between his rights
under the Scottish law and his entitlement under the will.  The
Master of the Rolls rejected this contention holding that the
general language of the devise to the trustees was not sufficient
to reveal an intention by the testator to dispose of property
which under the applicable foreign law belonged to his son.</pre>
    <pre>[21] The House of Lords affirmed the finding that the eldest son
was not required to elect stating, at p. 1051:</pre>
    <pre>          It is said on the part of the other children,
          and denied on his part, that he must either
          give up the Scotch property for the purposes
          of the will, or take nothing under the will:
          the claim of the younger children being
          founded on the generality, the universality,
          of the language of gift contained in it.  Nor
          can he gainsay that the Scotch property was
          part of the testator's estate, or that the
          will purports to give all his real and
          personal estate whatsoever and wheresoever.
          I apprehend, however, that, according to the
          principles or rules of construction which the
          English law applies, if not to all
          instruments, at least to testamentary
          instruments liable to interpretation, as the
          will in question is, according to its
          principles and rules, the generality, the
          mere universality, of a gift of property, is
          not sufficient to demonstrate or create a
          ground of inference that the giver meant it
          to extend to property incapable, though his
          own, of being given by the particular act.
          If he has specifically mentioned property not
          capable of being so given, the case is not
          the same: as here, if the testator had
          mentioned Scotland in terms, or had not had
          any other real estate than real estate in
          Scotland, there might have been ground for
          putting the heir to his election.</pre>
    <pre>          The matter, however, standing as it does, we
          are, as it seems to me, bound to hold that
          the will before us does not exhibit an
          intention to give or to affect any property
          that the will was not adapted to pass.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[22] Maxwell is an important case.  Not only is it confirmation
of a line of authority by the highest appellate court in England,
it is factually similar to our case.  In both Maxwell and this
case, the alleged inconsistency between the will and the
beneficiary's rights outside of the will arose by the operation
of foreign law on part of the testator's property.  Furthermore,
in both cases, the party arguing for the application of the
doctrine of election could only point to general language in the
will to demonstrate the testator's intention to devise property
which, by the application of foreign law, belonged to another who
was also a beneficiary under the will.</pre>
    <pre>[23] Maxwell is important for another reason.  Lord Justice
Knight Bruce, speaking for the Law Lords, candidly acknowledged
that the decision that the eldest son need not elect might well
be contrary to the testator's intention.  He held, however, that
absent a clear expression of that intention in the will, the
court was restricted to interpreting the will in accordance with
established general rules of construction to ensure consistency
lest the interpretation of each will turn on the discretion of
individual judges.  I take his Lordship to mean that where the
terms of the will are such that a determination of the testator's
intention is a matter of speculation, it is better to decide
those cases by established rules than by the surmises of
individual judges.</pre>
    <pre>[24] In his argument, Mr. Schnurr, for Lillian Granot,
acknowledged that Maxwell was very much against him.  He argued
that it is inconsistent with more recent authorities.  I will
deal with that argument in due course.</pre>
    <pre>[25] My review of the old English authorities should not leave
the impression that the courts have always found against the
applicability of the doctrine of election.  However, even in
cases where the doctrine of election was applied, the courts have
adhered to the principles set out in the above authorities.  For
example, in Usticke v. Peters, supra, the court found that a
specific devise of certain lands in the will gave rise to the
doctrine since those lands were the property of another who was
also a beneficiary under the will.  The court said, at p. 190:</pre>
    <pre>          ... That general rule of law is that, in
          sitting down to construe a will, you are to
          assume, prima facie that the testator did not
          intend to dispose of anything that was not
          his own to dispose of, and the circumstances
          of his having disclaimed such an intention
          will not make any difference, so far as the
          rule of construction is concerned.  Then,
          looking to the whole of the will, I find the
          testator expressly disposing of duchy lands.
          I find, independently of the will, that he
          had no duchy lands except those in question;
          and that he had no interest in the lands in
          question, except the reversion devised by Sir
          Michael to his own right heirs.  That
          reversion, according to Wintour v. Clifton, I
          cannot hold that Robert intended to pass; and
          therefore I am driven to the conclusion that
          the presumption is rebutted, and that Robert
          did intend to pass by his will an interest in
          the duchy lands in question, of which he had
          no power so to dispose.</pre>
    <pre>[26] These old English authorities continue to reflect the state
of the law in present day England.  In Re Mengel's Will Trusts,
[1962] 1 Ch. 791, the testator purported to give all of his
personal and household goods to his wife absolutely and further
to give all the remainder of his &quot;property of whatsoever nature
and wheresoever situated&quot; to the trustees upon trust for his wife
during her lifetime.  It was accepted that the Danish law of
community property applied so as to give the wife a 2 interest in
all of the property acquired during the marriage.  The other
beneficiaries under the will argued that the wife was required to
elect as between her community property rights and her
entitlement under the will.  Like Maxwell and this case, in
Mengel it was contended that the operation of foreign law on the
property of the testator gave rise to the doctrine of election.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Echoing the language of the cases from the previous century,
Lord Buckley observed, at p. 797:</pre>
    <pre>          To bring the doctrine of election into play
          in any case the intention of the testator to
          dispose of the property of another must
          appear clearly and distinctly. ...
          Therefore, the court should be slow to adopt
          a construction which gives rise to a case of
          election.</pre>
    <pre>[28] His Lordship went on, at pp. 797-98 to quote with approval a
previous decision in which it was said:</pre>
    <pre>          The difficulty of sustaining a case of
          election is always much greater where the
          testator has a partial interest in the
          property dealt with, than where he purports
          to devise an estate in which he had no
          interest at law.  Where the testator has some
          interest, the court will lean as far as
          possible to a construction which would make
          him deal only with that to which he was
          entitled.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[29] These words are apposite to the present case in that Henry
Hersen was entitled to dispose of a 1/4 interest in the Swiss
condominium under the provisions of the Swiss law.</pre>
    <pre>[30] Lord Buckley went on to emphasize the distinction between a
case where the property is described in general terms and a case
where the property is described in specific terms.  He observed
that a case of election will seldom be made out where the
property is described only in general terms.</pre>
    <pre>[31] Applying those principles to the facts before him, Buckley
J. held that the provision in the will which referred to &quot;all
personal and household goods and effects&quot; did demonstrate an
intention to dispose of the whole of that property.  As the wife
owned half of that property according to the Danish law of
community property, the doctrine of election applied to those
articles.  However, in so far as the devise of the residue was
concerned, His Lordship said:</pre>
    <pre>          ... But when one comes to deal with the
          trusts of the residue I see no reason in this
          case for departing from the principles
          illustrated by the observations in Howell's
          v. Jenkins, Miller v. Thurgood and In re
          Harris [citations omitted] to which I have
          referred; and it seems to me that the right
          way to construe clause 2(b) is to treat the
          reference to &quot;all the remainder of the
          testator's property&quot; in its literal sense and
          not to extend it to apply to anything which
          was in fact not his property.  Consequently I
          do not think that the doctrine of election
          arises in respect of the residue. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] The weight of the English authority clearly favours the
appellant's position.  On those authorities the language of this
will does not demonstrate that Henry Hersen intended to dispose
of Roland Hersen's interest in the Swiss condominium to Lillian
Granot.
[1]
[33] The principles found in the English authorities have been
adopted by Canadian courts.  They have shown the same reluctance
to invoke the election doctrine absent a clear intention on the
face of the will to dispose of property in a manner inconsistent
with the rights of another (who is also a beneficiary under the
will) in that property.  That intention has been found either in
the express language of the will read as a whole or where the
clear intention of the testator could not be carried out if the
property interest of the other person were given effect.  Like
English courts, Canadian courts have held that general language
in the residuary clause standing alone will not demonstrate an
intention to dispose of the property of another.  Absent that
intention, the doctrine of election does not arise: e.g. see Re
Hurst (1905), 11 O.L.R. (Div. Ct.); Re Hill, [1951] O.R. 619
(H.C.); Re Sullivan Estate, [1951] 3 W.W.R. (N.S.) 363 (Alta.
S.C.); Graham v. Clarke, [1949] 1 W.W.R. 751 (Alta. S.C.), aff'd,
[1949] 2 W.W.R. 1042 at 1049 (Alta. S.C. App. Div.);  Abbot v.
Grant, [1965] S.C.R. 268; Re Baker (1981), 10 E.T.R. 146 at 151
(Ont. H.C.J.).</pre>
    <pre>[34] Mr. Schnurr submitted that whatever the law in England may
be, in Canada there is no hard and fast rule that the testator's
intention to dispose of the property of another can never be
inferred from general language in a residuary clause.  He placed
heavy reliance on Re Mawson, [1939] O.W.N. 294 (H.C.).  In
Mawson, the testator and his wife were joint tenants of a
property (the King Street property).  When the testator died, his
wife became the owner of the King Street property.  In his will,
the testator made extensive reference to the King Street
property.  He purported to give his wife a life interest in the
King Street property (paragraph 1), he directed his trustee to
pay the taxes and maintenance on the King Street property out of
his estate (paragraph 10), and he directed that if his wife so
requested, his King Street property could be sold and the
proceeds used to produce additional revenue payable to his wife
(paragraph 8).  The wife was also given other specific gifts
under the will.  Paragraph 13, which included the residuary
clause said:</pre>
    <pre>          Upon the decease of my wife, Caroline Mawson,
          I direct my said executor and trustee to pay
          to my eldest sister, Grace Mawson, if she is
          then living, the sum of $1,000 out of the
          corpus of my estate, and I direct that the
          balance and residue of my estate then
          remaining is to be divided equally among such
          of my nephews and nieces as shall be living
          at the time of the decease of my wife, share
          and share alike.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The wife argued that only the residuary clause disposed of
property to persons other than herself and that the general
language of that clause was not sufficient to demonstrate an
intention by the testator to devise the wife's interest in the
King Street property.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Kelly J., at p. 297, referred approvingly to the principle
of construction that &quot;general words will not, by themselves, be
construed to include particular property not in fact belonging to
the testator, ... .&quot;  He went on to hold, however, that those
general words had to be examined in the context of the entirety
of the will.  The specific references to the King Street property
in several paragraphs of the will made it clear that the testator
intended his estate to include the King Street property.  It was,
therefore, property included in the phrase &quot;the balance and
residue of my estate&quot; found in the residuary clause.</pre>
    <pre>[37] I do not agree that Mawson breaks from the established line
of authority.  It appears to me, as I think it did to Kelly J.,
to be entirely consistent with previous authority.  The
testator's purported devise of a life interest in the King Street
property to his wife, his direction that the taxes and
maintenance on the King Street property be paid out of his estate
and his indication that the proceeds from a sale of the property
be invested to produce additional income for his wife, are
consistent only with an intention to include that specific
property in his estate.</pre>
    <pre>[38] The testator's intention to include the wife's interests in
his devise is made all the more clear when it is recalled that
the testator had absolutely no interest in the King Street
property upon his death.  The property belonged exclusively to
his wife.  Consequently, it could not be suggested that his
extensive references to the King Street property in his will
referred only to his interest in that property.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Not only do I find Mawson to be consistent with prior
authority, I can find nothing in that case which assists Lillian
Granot's claim that the doctrine of election should apply in this
case.  In this will, there is no reference to the Swiss
condominium.  The contention that Henry Hersen intended to devise
Roland Hersen's 1/4 interest in the Swiss condominium rests
entirely on the general language of the opening paragraph of the
will (&quot;all my property wheresoever situate&quot;), and the general
language of the residuary clause.  It is from that language and
that language alone that the court is asked to infer that Henry
Hersen intended to devise not only his interest in the Swiss
condominium, but also the interest of Roland Hersen.</pre>
    <pre>[40] Nor is the argument in favour of the applicability of the
doctrine advanced by the fact that the will contains gifts of
specific property to Roland.  One can certainly infer from those
gifts that it was the testator's intention that Roland Hersen
should receive under the will that property specified in
paragraph III of the will.  That inference is, however, of no
assistance in determining whether the testator intended to devise
Roland Hersen's interest in the Swiss condominium as if it were
his own.</pre>
    <pre>[41] Mr. Schnurr also placed reliance on Schillabeer v. Diebel
(1979), 100 D.L.R. (3d) 279 (Alta. S.C.).  In Schillabeer, the
eldest son had occupied a house owned by his father for many
years prior to his father's death.  Long before his death, the
father had written to the eldest son indicating that if the
eldest son continued to pay the taxes and rent for a specified
period that the eldest son would &quot;get the title if anything
should happen to your mother and I.&quot;  The same letter went on to
state: &quot;But remember that is all you will get when we pass on.&quot;
When the father died, he left his estate to his six children,
including his eldest son.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The eldest son sued the estate for specific performance
claiming that his father had agreed to transfer the house to him.
The trial judge first rejected the argument that apart from the
letter referred to above, there was an agreement by the father to
transfer the house to his eldest son.  He then held that the
letter amounted to an agreement that the house would be given to
the eldest son following the death of both parents.  The trial
judge then said, at p. 283:</pre>
    <pre>          ... the letter, creates the plaintiff's
          [eldest son] entitlement but the gift is
          qualified by the very writing creating it.
          The plaintiff is faced with and is required
          in my view to elect between his residual
          inheritance and his utilization of the letter
          to acquire his title. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[43] In Schillabeer, it was not the terms of the will which gave
rise to the election, but rather the qualified terms upon which
the father had agreed during his life to transfer the house to
his eldest son upon his death.  The father had made it clear that
such transfer should occur only if the eldest son would forego
any entitlement he may have under the father's will.  I do not
think Schillabeer assists in interpreting Henry Hersen's will.</pre>
    <pre>[44] In summary, my review of the English and Canadian cases
indicates that the following principles are applicable to the
interpretation of this will:
*    the doctrine of election applies only where the
     testator clearly intended to dispose of another's interest in
     property while at the same time making a gift to that person
     under his will;
*    that intention must be made express or appear by necessary
     implication from the terms of the will;
*    one starts from the premise that the testator only intended
     to dispose of his or her own property in the will; and
*    general words in a will like &quot;all my estate&quot; or a residuary
     gift in general terms will not, standing alone, evince an
     intention to dispose of property or an interest in property which
     the testator was not entitled to dispose of in his will.</pre>
    <pre>[45] Applying those principles, I am driven to the conclusion
that Lillian Granot has failed to show that Henry Hersen intended
to dispose of Roland Hersen's 1/4 interest in the Swiss
condominium in his will.  The doctrine of election has no
application and Roland Hersen is entitled to both the 1/4
interest in the Swiss condominium and the gifts under the will.</pre>
    <pre>[46] In coming to that conclusion, I do not pretend to have
divined Mr. Henry Hersen's true intention when he penned his
will.  I have no idea what he actually intended.  Absent any
solid indication of the testator's true intention in the words of
the will, I, like previous courts, favour an interpretation which
brings certainty and consistency.  Those goals are best achieved
by staying the course and applying the well-settled principles
established over the last 200 years.</pre>
    <pre>The Cross-Appeal:</pre>
    <pre>[47] Given my conclusion that Roland Hersen should have been
successful before Haley J., Lillian Granot's cross-appeal from
the costs order made by Haley J. becomes moot.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition:</pre>
    <pre>[48] I would allow the main appeal and vary the judgment below by
answering question (d) in these terms:</pre>
    <pre>          Roland is entitled to take both his interest
          in the condominium provided by the Swiss law
          of forced heirship and his entitlement under
          the will.</pre>
    <pre>[49] I would direct that the costs of the appellant and
respondent should be paid out of the capital of the estate on a
solicitor and client basis.</pre>
    <pre>[50] I cannot leave this case without expressing my appreciation
for the careful and clear reasons of Haley J.  There were
difficult issues raised on the application.  The fact that only
one reached the appellate level is a testament to the force of
her reasons.  I also am indebted to both counsel for their
excellent arguments.  It was a pleasure to hear this appeal.
