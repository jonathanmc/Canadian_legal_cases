    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following his trial by judge alone before Corbett J.,
the appellant was convicted of three offences arising out of
a home invasion style robbery that occurred on March 7, 1995
and was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He appeals
against his convictions solely on the ground that the trial
judge erred in admitting evidence of his private
communications, intercepted pursuant to a judicial
authorization. The appellant contends that insufficient
grounds were provided to support the authorization and that,
consequently, his communications were unlawfully intercepted
in violation of his rights under s.8 of the Charter and
should be excluded under s.24(2).</pre>
    <pre>[2]  I have concluded that the appellant's private
communications were lawfully intercepted and were properly
admitted at trial. Hence, there was no violation of the
appellant's s.8 rights and there exists no basis to
interfere with the conviction.</pre>
    <pre>The evidence at trial</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant was convicted of robbery, possession of a
weapon for the purpose of committing an indictable offence
and unlawful confinement.  All three offences arose out of a
&quot;home invasion robbery&quot;.  The appellant and another
assailant forced their way into an apartment on Chalkfarm
Drive in Northern Toronto.  The two assailants bound, beat
and robbed the complainant, someone they wrongly suspected
to be a drug dealer.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The complainant identified the appellant as one of the
assailants from a photographic line-up. The trial judge
carefully scrutinized this evidence and concluded that, in
and of itself, the complainant's identification evidence
would not support a conviction. However, she concluded that
other evidence supported the identification of the appellant
as one of the assailants and that, on the totality of the
evidence, the offences were proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The confirmatory evidence consisted of firstly, an item
of property belonging to the complainant and found on the
appellant at the time of his arrest, and secondly,
intercepted communications between the appellant and one
David Thompson. The trial judge held that the latter
evidence was the &quot;most telling evidence incriminating the
accused&quot;. It therefore follows that, if the intercepted
communications were improperly admitted at trial, the
convictions cannot stand.</pre>
    <pre>The wiretap proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The wiretap authorization that permitted the
interception of the critical communications is dated
February 7, 1995 and was issued by Humphrey J. This
authorization was the sixth in a sequence of seven obtained
over the course of some five and a half months. Each
authorization will be referred to by the number referring to
its chronological order. The information obtained pursuant
to each authorization formed part of the material presented
in support of the next application for authorization. Hence
the information relating to the appellant, presented in
support of authorization #6, was derived from intercepts
obtained under the two previous authorizations. It follows
that, even though the interceptions that formed part of the
evidence were all obtained pursuant to authorization #6,
authorizations #4 and #5 are also relevant to this appeal.
The following is a brief history of the investigation
leading up to the identification of the appellant in the
wiretap proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Each of the seven authorizations was based on affidavit
material deposed to by the lead investigator, Detective
Michael McDonald. The first authorization in the series was
obtained on October 20, 1994 in reference to an
investigation into a bank robbery that had occurred some two
months prior. The appellant is not named in this first
authorization nor is there any evidence of his involvement
in this bank robbery. As the investigation progressed and
calls were intercepted, the police gathered evidence of
other robberies being committed and further robberies being
planned by various individuals. The number and identity of
targeted persons and places changed over time. Whenever new
targets were uncovered, Detective McDonald sought and
obtained a fresh authorization naming the known persons and
places. Each authorization and supporting affidavit in the
series formed part of the material presented to the issuing
justice in support of any subsequent authorization. Since
authorization #6 is most directly relevant to the
admissibility of the intercepted calls, I will first review
its contents as they relate to the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>     Authorization #6
[8]  The appellant was named in authorization #6 on the
basis of the following information provided by the affiant,
Detective McDonald.
        I, Michael McDonald, ... make oath and say as
          follows:
        10.  That the facts relied upon to justify my
               belief that an Authorization to
               intercept the private
               communication of the persons
               described in paragraph three
               (3) [which includes the name
               of the appellant] of this my
               Affidavit should be granted,
               together with the
               particulars of the offence
               are as follows:</pre>
    <pre>               I am a member of the
               Metropolitan Toronto Police
               Force holding the rank of
               Detective. I am presently
               assigned to the Hold Up
               Squad. I am the lead
               investigator in the
               investigation that forms the
               subject matter of this
               application. I have read
               police occurrence reports,
               criminal records, statements
               and other documentary
               evidence during this
               investigation and verily
               believe that the information
               contained in this affidavit
               to be true;
               </pre>
    <pre>Detective McDonald next identified each of the five
prior authorizations obtained in relation to the
investigation (paragraphs 10.A to E) and annexed the
authorizations and supporting affidavits as
exhibits. He then continued as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          F) That during the time period that the
          January 11th, 1995, Authorization
          [#5] was in effect I have
          determined the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          i)   That David Lawton Thompson,
[and others]
               and Oneil Anthony Grant are
               still planing (sic) the
               robbery of a drug dealer in
               the Chalkfarm Drive area of
               Toronto as well as the
               robberies of other drug
               dealers known to them. As a
               result of lawful intercepts
               I believe that the robberies
               will be in the form of the
               &quot;home invasion&quot; type.
               </pre>
    <pre>Paragraph F) contains 24 additional subparagraphs
setting out further matters determined by the affiant
during the relevant time period. The subparagraphs
vary in form and include references to specific
calls, &quot;intercepts&quot; in general, facts ascertained,
criminal records and a police report. The appellant
is not named in any of these further references or in
the rest of the affidavit.</pre>
    <pre>     Authorization #5</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The reference in subparagraph 10(F)(i) of
affidavit #6 to the fact that the appellant and
others were &quot;still planning the robbery of a drug
dealer in the Chalkfarm Drive area&quot; relates back to
the affidavit in support of authorization #5, dated
January 11th, 1995. Detective McDonald's affidavit #5
followed much the same format as above. He set out
the details of the previous authorizations and
included the material in support. In reference to the
appellant, he deposed as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          E) That during the time period that the
          December 14th, 1994 Authorization
          [#4] was in effect I have
          determined the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          i)   That David Lawton Thompson,
[and others]
               and Oneil Anthony Grant are
               planning a robbery of a drug
               dealer in the Chalkfarm
               Drive area of Toronto.
               </pre>
    <pre>Twenty-three additional subparagraphs set out
various matters ascertained during the relevant time
period. These include a reference to the appellant's
criminal record for robbery and wearing a disguise.
No other reference is made to the appellant in the
affidavit.</pre>
    <pre>     Authorization #4
[10] It is common ground between the parties that
the relevant intercepts obtained under authorization
#4 consist of conversations between the appellant
and David Thompson. It therefore becomes relevant to
consider the grounds in support of the authorization
to intercept the calls of David Thompson.  The
affidavit in support of this authorization was
formatted similarly to the affidavits for
authorizations #5 and 6.  It outlined the details
determined from previous authorizations. Detective
McDonald's affidavit #4 included the following
references to David Thompson in the list of matters
&quot;determined&quot; during the time the December 5, 1994
authorization [#3] was in effect:
          D)   That during the time period that the
               December 5, 1994
               Authorization was in effect
               I have determined that the
               following:
               </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
               vi)  As well on December 9,
                    1994 HAMILTON was
                    intercepted at his
                    residence on two
                    different occasions
                    talking to a male party
                    who I now know to be
                    David Lawton THOMPSON.
               vii) During these
                    conversations I believe
                    THOMPSON told HAMILTON
                    that he, THOMPSON, has
                    a robbery planned and
                    is waiting for the
                    right time to do it.
                    THOMPSON further tells
                    HAMILTON that he,
                    HAMILTON, will be
                    included in this
                    robbery along with a
                    male called &quot;SMILEY&quot;.
               viii)     THOMPSON was
                    identified by voice
                    identification by
                    Detective Brian ANGLE
                    of the Metropolitan
                    Toronto Police Force,
                    Hold Up Squad.
               ix)  Detective ANGLE was the
                    lead investigator in a
                    matter that had lead to
                    a Judicial
                    Authorization dated
                    February 17, 1993
                    signed by Judge GARTON.
                    SEE EXHIBIT &quot;7&quot;.
               x)   Detective ANGLE is
familiar with
                    the voice of THOMPSON.</pre>
    <pre>               xi)  THOMPSON was arrested
                    on March 4, 1993 as a
                    result of Detective
                    ANGLE's investigation
                    and charged with
                    robbery, wear disguise,
                    forcible confinement,
                    point firearm and use
                    firearm offences.
                    </pre>
    <pre>               xii) THOMPSON plead guilty
                    to robbery and use
                    firearm offences and
                    received a sentence of
                    3 years and 9 months.
                    </pre>
    <pre>                              . . .
          E)   THOMPSON is presently on day
parole and
               residing at the W. P.
               ARCHIBALD CENTRE at 8151
               Dufferin Street North in
               Thornhill.  He is permitted
               to spend the weekends at his
               mother's residence [name and
               address of mother].  This is
               the address that HAMILTON
               contacted THOMPSON at on
               December 9, 1994.  THOMPSON
               has a FPS #.... SEE EXHIBIT
               &quot;8&quot;.
               </pre>
    <pre>               
Position of the parties</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant argues that the above-noted
excerpts from the affidavits, relied upon by the
Crown, consist of nothing other than conclusory
statements that are incapable of supporting an
authorization to intercept communications. He submits
that it is not sufficient for the officer to simply
list the matters he has &quot;determined&quot; during a
particular time period.  It is submitted that the
officer must specify the exact source for the
information and provide sufficient details to satisfy
the issuing justice that there are reasonable grounds
for believing the conclusion deposed to.
[1]
[12] The Crown concedes that the above-noted
references to the appellant in affidavits #5 and #6
are sparse. The Crown takes the position, however,
that these references must be viewed in the context
of the entire material before the issuing justice.
It is submitted that, when viewed in context, each
affidavit provides sufficient grounds to target the
appellant. It is argued that, in essence, affidavits
#5 and #6 each provide a summary of the lawfully
intercepted calls that gave rise to Detective
McDonald's belief that the appellant and others were
planning robberies.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant's argument on the sufficiency of
the affidavit, amongst others, was advanced at trial
in the course of a voir dire held to determine the
appellant's s.8 Charter application. Detective
McDonald testified on the voir dire and gave detailed
evidence of the intercepted communications on which
he had relied to come to the conclusion deposed to in
his affidavit.  At the conclusion of the voir dire,
the trial judge reviewed the contents of the
affidavits and the testimony of Detective McDonald.
She concluded that there was &quot;ample evidence to
uphold the authorization as having sufficient grounds
to authorize the interceptions and their admission in
evidence.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
in considering the extraneous evidence offered on the
voir dire in support of her finding that the
authorization was valid. He submits that the validity
of the authorization can only be determined on the
basis of the material before the issuing justice
(Humphrey J.) and that no reliance can be put on what
is commonly referred to as &quot;the amplified record&quot; to
bolster insufficient grounds. Therefore, it is the
appellant's position that the trial judge erred in
failing to rule that his communications were
unlawfully intercepted.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The Crown submits that the trial judge only
relied upon Detective McDonald's testimony in her
reasons so as to respond to the defence's argument on
the insufficiency of the officer's grounds set out in
the affidavit. The Crown states that the trial judge,
as reviewing justice, was entitled to rely on the
amplified record for this purpose. The Crown notes
that Detective McDonald was unshaken in cross-
examination and that,
consequently, the amplified record provided no basis
to reject the grounds provided in his affidavit. The
Crown therefore submits that Corbett J. was correct
in admitting the evidence.
Applicable legal principles
[16] The determination of this appeal hinges on the
sufficiency of the material in support of
authorization #6 before Humphrey J. The applicable
legal principles are uncontroverted and, for the
purpose of this appeal, can be set out succinctly as
follows:
     *    The interception of private communications
constitutes
          a search or seizure within the meaning of
          s.8 of the Charter: R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1
          S.C.R. 30.
     *    Section 8 of the Charter provides that
A[e]veryone has
          the right to be secure against
          unreasonable search or seizure.&quot; A
          reasonable search or seizure does not
          infringe the appellant's rights.
     *    A search will be reasonable if it is, a)
authorized by
          law, b) if the law itself is reasonable
          and c) if the manner in which the search
          was carried out is reasonable: R. v.
          Collins (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).
          The following principles apply with
          respect to these three requirements:
          </pre>
    <pre>          a)   The interception of private
               communications is authorized
               by the provisions of the
               Criminal Code: see, in
               particular, s.185 and s.186.
               </pre>
    <pre>          b)   The enabling statutory
provisions have
               been found to be identical
               to, and hence in conformity
               with the minimal
               constitutional requirement
               of reasonableness: R. v.
               Garofoli, (1990), 60 C.C.C.
               (3d) 161 (S.C.C.) at 182.
               The conditions set out in
               the Criminal Code must
               therefore be met. Only one
               of these conditions is
               relevant to this appeal: the
               issuing judge must be
               satisfied that there are
               reasonable and probable
               grounds to believe that an
               offence has been, or is
               being, committed and that
               the authorization sought
               will afford evidence of that
               offence.
               </pre>
    <pre>          c)   There is no issue in this
case as to the
               manner in which the
               interception was carried
               out.
               </pre>
    <pre>     *    An unlawful interception constitutes an
unreasonable
          search or seizure in violation of s.8 of
          the Charter and the evidence obtained in
          this manner shall be excluded pursuant to
          s.24(2) of the Charter &quot;if it is
          established that, having regard to all the
          circumstances, the admission of it in the
          proceedings would bring the administration
          of justice into disrepute.&quot;1
          </pre>
    <pre>[17] The role of Corbett J. as the reviewing justice
is also well established. Sopinka J., in writing for
the majority in R. v. Garofoli, supra at 188 set out
the test in these often-quoted words:</pre>
    <pre>     The reviewing judge does not substitute his
          or her view for that of the authorizing
          judge. If, based on the record
which was
          before the authorizing judge as
          amplified on the review, the
          reviewing judge concludes that
          the authorizing judge could have
          granted the authorization, then
          he or she should not interfere.
          In this process, the existence of
          fraud, non-disclosure, misleading
          evidence and new evidence are all
          relevant, but, rather than being
          a prerequisite to review, their
          sole impact is to determine
          whether there continues to be any
          basis for the decision of the
          authorizing judge.
[18] This court is also a reviewing court and the
test in Garofoli is applicable on this appeal. In
addition, the usual deference is owed to the findings
of the trial judge in her assessment of the record
&quot;as amplified on the review&quot; and her disposition of
the s.8 application. In the absence of an error of
law, a misapprehension of the evidence or a failure
to consider relevant evidence, this court should not
interfere with the trial judge's conclusion.
[19] Finally, it should be noted that there is some
controversy in the law as to the use that can be made
of the &quot;amplified record&quot; on the review. An excellent
review of the jurisprudence on this point is made in
the recent case of R. v. Morris, [1997] 163 N.S.R.
(2d) 231 (C.A.).  As the reasons that follow will
demonstrate, it is my view that the issue of
amplification does not arise in this case.
Sufficiency of the grounds in support of
authorization #6
[20] As indicated earlier, the appellant argues that
Detective McDonald's affidavit, filed in support of
authorization #6, contained nothing more than
conclusory statements as to his belief that the
appellant and others were planning to commit
robberies and that these statements are insufficient
to support the authorization. In support of his
position, he relies on R. v. Debot (1986), 30 C.C.C.
(3d) 207 (Ont. C.A.) at 218-19; aff'd (1989), 52
C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).
[21] In Debot, the question that arose was whether a
police officer had sufficient reasonable and probable
grounds to
conduct a warrantless search, authorized by statute,
on the basis of a tip obtained from an informer. The
court held that information provided by a police
informer can provide the necessary grounds for
conducting a warrantless search provided that the
informer's tip is more than &quot;a mere conclusory
statement.&quot; The court went on to discuss certain
factors that would be highly relevant in assessing
whether the tip could be relied upon by the officer
as reasonable and probable grounds. In discussing
this issue, the court drew an analogy to the grounds
necessary to obtain a search warrant and stated as
follows (at 218):</pre>
    <pre>          Unquestionably, information supplied by a
          reliable informer, even though it
          is hearsay, may in some
          circumstances provide the
          necessary &quot;reasonable ground to
          believe&quot;, to justify the granting
          of a search warrant... On an
          application for a search warrant,
          the informant must set out in the
          information the grounds for his
          or her belief in order that the
          justice may satisfy himself or
          herself that there are reasonable
          grounds for believing what is
          alleged... Consequently, a mere
          statement by the informant that
          he or
          she was told by a reliable
          informer that a certain person is
          carrying on a criminal activity
          or that drugs would be found at a
          certain place would be an
          insufficient basis for the
          granting of the warrant. The
          underlying circumstances
          disclosed by the informer for his
          or her conclusion must be set
          out, thus enabling the justice to
          satisfy himself or herself that
          there are reasonable grounds for
          believing what is alleged.
          </pre>
    <pre>[22] The appellant also relies on Re Restaurant Le
Clemenceau Inc. and Drouin (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d)
381 (S.C.C.) where the Supreme Court quashed a
search warrant on the basis of the insufficiency of
the information. A warrant had been issued pursuant
to the Act respecting the Ministere du Revenu,
R.S.Q. 1977, c. M-31 on the basis of an information
sworn by an official. The information stated that
the affiant believed the appellant had made false
or misleading returns. &quot;He further asserted that
this belief was reasonable and rested on an
investigation he had undertaken, though he did not
disclose its nature, and during which he had
discovered certain facts.&quot; The Supreme Court
concluded as follows (at 384):</pre>
    <pre>          In order to perform his duty of
supervision,
          the judge had to determine whether the
          facts on which the informant's belief was
          based were such that his belief was indeed
          reasonable. None of these facts are
          disclosed by the information. The judge
          then had a duty to ask for further
          information, which he elected not to do. In
          the case at bar, in view of what was before
          the judge, he could not and in fact did not
          verify the reasonableness of the
          informant's belief and his approval of the
          warrant accordingly at once gives rise to a
          writ of evocation.
          </pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant submits that, in this case, it was
likewise incumbent upon Detective McDonald, in his
affidavit #6, to set out the basis upon which he had
&quot;determined&quot; that the appellant and others were
&quot;still planing (sic) the robbery of a drug dealer in
the Chalkfarm Drive area of Toronto as well as the
robberies of other drug dealers known to them.&quot; It is
submitted that the officer should have specifically
stated that he was founding his belief on intercepted
calls and that he should have given sufficient
details about the relevant calls to enable Humphrey
J. to assess the reasonableness of his belief. He
further submits that, in the absence of this
information, it was not open to Corbett J., as the
reviewing justice, to rely on Detective McDonald's
testimony on the voir dire to satisfy herself that
sufficient grounds existed to support the
authorization.</pre>
    <pre>[24] I would agree with the appellant's submission if
subparagraph 10(F)(i) of the affidavit in support of
authorization #6 were to be read in isolation. If
Detective McDonald's words are considered without
their context and interpreted strictly, they simply
indicate that, during a specified period of time, the
officer &quot;determined&quot; that the appellant and others
were still planning robberies and that lawful
intercepts revealed that these robberies would be in
the &quot;home invasion&quot; style. The words leave open the
possibility that Detective McDonald determined that
the appellant was involved in a conspiracy to commit
a robbery or robberies from a source other than the
intercepted calls. The source, indeed, could have
been from a police informer. The intercepted calls
referred to at the
conclusion of subparagraph 10(F)(i) may have simply
been the source for the belief that the robberies in
question would be &quot;home invasion style&quot; without
mention of the appellant's involvement.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The words, however, must be viewed in the
context of the entire material before Humphrey J.
which, as stated above, included the five prior
authorizations and their supporting affidavits.
Having reviewed this material, I am of the opinion
the issuing justice could draw the reasonable
inference that Detective McDonald's belief was
founded on the intercepted calls of persons named in
the prior authorization. This becomes apparent when
one considers the affidavit as a whole and the
particular format consistently used by the affiant in
each successive affidavit.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The question remains whether it was nonetheless
incumbent upon Detective McDonald to provide a
sufficient summary of the calls in question to enable
Humphrey J. to assess the reasonableness of his
conclusion. While it would have undoubtedly been
preferable if Detective McDonald had expounded
further on the contents of the calls, it was not
incumbent upon him on an application for a fresh
authorization to provide full particulars.2 It was
sufficient that he give an accurate description of
the information obtained from the intercepted calls
and from other steps in his investigation. Although
the references relating directly to the appellant are
very concise, I am of the view that the Garofoli test
has nonetheless been met. Based on the record before
him, Humphrey J. could conclude that Detective
McDonald had the reasonable and probable grounds to
believe the conclusion he deposed to. From affidavit
#6 and the preceding ones in the series, it was
reasonable for Humphrey J. to infer that Detective
McDonald's belief in the appellant's participation
was founded on intercepted calls of persons involved
in the conspiracy. That foundation, unlike the mere
conclusory statement of a police informer referred to
in Debot, is capable of supporting the reasonable and
probable grounds of the affiant.</pre>
    <pre>[27] For the same reasons, I am also of the opinion
that affidavit #5 provided sufficient grounds to
support authorization #5. Further, I have no
difficulty in arriving at the same conclusion with
respect to authorization #4. It is my view that the
grounds in support of the authorization to intercept
the calls of David Thompson in authorization #4 were
clearly sufficient. Hence, since both authorizations
#4 and #5 are also valid, it cannot be argued that
the information in support of authorization #6 was in
any way based on unlawful intercepts.</pre>
    <pre>[28] I therefore conclude that the material in
support of authorization #6 presented to the issuing
justice provided sufficient grounds to support the
authorization to intercept the appellant's calls. The
appellant does not contend that the record on the
review in any way destroyed or even diluted these
grounds. It follows that there is no basis to quash
the authorization. The appellant's calls were
therefore lawfully intercepted.</pre>
    <pre>The amplified record</pre>
    <pre>[29] In light of my conclusion on the sufficiency of
the grounds, it is not necessary to deal with the
issue of amplification. I wish to note, however, that
I have not been persuaded that Corbett J. made
anything other than an appropriate use of the
amplified record. Given the accused's attack on the
sufficiency of Detective McDonald's grounds as set
out in his affidavit, it was incumbent upon the
reviewing justice to consider the evidence
on the voir dire to determine whether these grounds
in fact existed. Corbett J. did so and concluded that
there was ample evidence to support the officer's
grounds.
[30] In my view, the approach adopted by Corbett J.
is consistent with what Sopinka J. in Garofoli
referred to as the record &quot;as amplified on the
review.&quot; If for example, Detective McDonald's
testimony on the review had revealed that the
foundation for his opinion in subparagraph 10(F)(i)
of affidavit #6 was, not the calls intercepted under
the prior authorization, but an unproven informer,
the grounds would be destroyed. It would no longer be
open for the reviewing justice to find, as I did
earlier, that Humphrey J. could draw a reasonable
inference that the affiant's foundation lay in the
intercepted calls. In this case, the evidence on the
review confirmed the accuracy of the information
before the issuing justice.
Disposition
[31] For these reasons, I conclude that the
appellant's private communications were lawfully
intercepted. The appellant has failed to establish
any violation of his s.8 rights under the Charter.
The evidence of the intercepted calls was properly
admitted at trial and there is no basis to interfere
with the conviction. I would dismiss the appeal.

    <pre>RELEASED: February 10, 1999
_______________________________
     1  S.189(1) of the Criminal Code has now been
repealed (Repealed 1993, c. 40, s. 10). It provided that
an intercepted private communication was inadmissible unless
the interception was lawfully made. Therefore, a finding
of unlawfulness no longer results in the automatic
exclusion of the evidence without resort to s. 24(2)
of the Charter.
     2The requirements are otherwise where the
renewal of an existing authorization is sought: see
s.186(6) of the Criminal Code. In this case, it was
open to Detective McDonald to seek fresh
authorizations since, for each application in the
series, he sought to either extend the scope of the
surveillance or alter its terms: R. v. Thompson
(1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.) at 277.</pre></td>
