    <pre>
On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Farley, Coo
and Chapnik JJ.) dated June 4, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A. (Dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns whether the business of Great Lakes
Power Limited (GLP) is that of a manufacturer within the meaning
of s.7(1)(d) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.A. 31 for the
purpose of paying business tax pursuant to Part XXII of the
Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45.  If the business is that of a
manufacturer, the business tax to be levied pursuant to s.362 of
the Municipal Act is to be based on 60% of the assessed value of
GLP&#146;s land, as assessed under s. 3 of the Assessment Act.  If the
business is not that of a manufacturer, the tax base is 30% of
the assessed value of GLP&#146;s land as provided by s.7(1)(k) of the
Assessment Act which applies to any businesses &#147;not specially
mentioned&#148; in s.7(1)(a)-(j).
[2]  The Divisional Court upheld a decision of the Ontario
Municipal Board to the effect that GLP carries on the business of
a manufacturer within the meaning of s.7(1)(d).  It appears to be
common ground that GLP generates, transmits and distributes
electricity for sale to the general public to whom it charges
rates for electrical services that are regulated by Ontario
Hydro.  It is the largest private power producer in Ontario.  Its
origins date back to 1888.
[3]  It appears that this is the first occasion which this court
has had to consider the nature of the business carried on by a
producer of electricity such as GLP since Re Township of Coleman
&amp; Northern Ontario Light and Power Co. Ltd. (1927), 60 O.L.R. 405
(C.A.).
[4]  The Assessment Act is complementary to the Municipal Act for
the purposes of municipal taxation.  Section 3 of the Assessment
Act provides that all real property in Ontario is subject to
assessment and taxation, subject to a long list of exemptions
from taxation contained in the section.  The exemptions found in
paras. 17 and 18 of s.3, in my view, are relevant to this appeal.
[5]  Section 7(1) of the Assessment Act establishes the tax base
for business tax levied under the Municipal Act as a percentage
of the s.3 assessed value of a person&#146;s land which is used or
occupied by that person for the purpose of, or in connection
with, the various businesses described in s.7(1)(a)-(j).  The tax
base varies from 25% to 75% of the assessed value, depending on
the business carried on by the taxpayer.  Although s.7(1)(a)-(j)
appears to be very comprehensive, s.7(1)(k) is intended to
capture any business &#147;not specially mentioned&#148; in the previous
subsections and sets the tax base for such businesses at 30% of
the assessed value.
[6]  The following are the relevant portions of s.7(1) of the
Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               7.(1)  Irrespective of any assessment of land under this
          Act, every person occupying or using land for the purpose of, or
          in connection with, any business mentioned or described in this
          section, shall be assessed for a sum to be called &#147;business
          assessment&#148; to be computed by reference to the assessed value of
          the land so occupied or used by that person as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          E.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)   The  business of  a  manufacturer,
               including the business of a flour miller,
               maltster, a concentrator or smelter of ore or
               metals,  and  the business of  obtaining
               minerals from the ground, for a sum equal to
               60 per cent of the assessed value of the land
               so  occupied  or used, provided  that  a
               manufacturer is not liable  to  business
               assessment as a wholesale merchant by reason
               of  selling by wholesale the goods  that
               manufacturer manufactures on the land.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (g)  The business of,
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (iii)     the transmission of water
                    or of steam, heat or electricity for the
                    purposes of light, heat or power,
          </pre>
    <pre>                         for a sum equal to 30 per cent
               of   the  assessed  value  of  the  land
               so   occupied   or   used,   except    a
               highway,    lane   or    other    public
               communication   or   public   place   or
               water   or   private   right   of   way,
               occupied   or   used  by  such   person,
               exclusive   of   the   value   of    any
               machinery,     plant    or    appliances
               erected   or  placed  upon,  in,   over,
               under or affixed to the land.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (k)     Any   business   not   specially
               mentioned before in this section, for a sum
               equal to 30 per cent of the assessed value of
               the land so occupied or used.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In dismissing the appeal from the Ontario Municipal Board,
the Divisional Court concluded that the decision of the majority
of the Court of Appeal in Coleman does not stand for the
proposition that the business of a company similar to that of GLP
was not a manufacturing business within the meaning of s.10(1)(d)
of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c.195, which is similar to
s.7(1)(d) of the present Act.  As &#147;manufacturer&#148; is not defined
in the Act, the Divisional Court applied the definition of
manufacturer found in Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion
Shuttle Co. (Ltd.) (1933), 72 Que. S.C. 15, per Archambault J. at
18, noting that the definition had been accepted by the Supreme
Court of Canada in Canada v. York Marble, Tile &amp; Terrazzo Ltd.,
[1968] S.C.R. 140 and Royal Bank of Canada v. Canada (Deputy
Minister of National Revenue, Customs &amp; Excise), [1981] 2 S.C.R.
139.
[8]  I approach this appeal from the perspective of the
principles that are to be applied in the interpretation of taxing
statutes.  As such, on the basis of my interpretation of the
Assessment Act, I find it unnecessary to consider the correctness
of the Divisional Court&#146;s application of the Dominion Shuttle
definition of manufacturer.
[9]  In Québec (Communauté Urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-
Secours, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 3 the Supreme Court of Canada outlined
five rules to guide the courts in interpreting tax legislation.
For the purpose of these reasons, I find it helpful to quote the
following passage from the reasons of Gonthier J., at p.17, in
which he discussed the first rule:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In light of this passage there is no longer any doubt that
          the interpretation of tax legislation should be subject to the
          ordinary rules of construction.  At page 87 of his text
          Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), Driedger fittingly
          summarizes the basic principles:  &#147;&#133;the words of an Act are to be
          read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
          ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
          object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament&#148;.  The first
          consideration should therefore be to determine the purpose of the
          legislation, whether as a whole or as expressed in a particular
          provision.</pre>
    <pre>[10] On a consideration of the Assessment Act as a whole, it is
my view that the legislature did not consider the business of an
electrical utility such as GLP to be the business of a
manufacturer within the meaning of s.7(1)(d).  I reach this
conclusion because in both s.3 and s.7 the legislature has
recognized a distinction between the business of a manufacturer
and businesses, which on the evidence before the Ontario
Municipal Board, constitute elements of the business carried on
by GLP.
[11] Under s.3 real property is liable to taxation and is to be
assessed subject to a number of exemptions.  Para. 17 provides an
exemption for all machinery and equipment used, inter alia, for
manufacturing.  However, para. 18 provides an exemption for all
&#147;machinery and equipment&#133;to the extent and in the proportion used
for producing electric power for sale to the public&#133;&#148;.  This is
an element of the business carried on by GLP.  In my view, this
indicates the intention of the legislature to regard producers of
electric power as different and distinct from manufacturers.  If
this were not so, it would be unnecessary to include the
exemption provided by para. 18.
[12] I have reached the same conclusion on an analysis of s.7(1).
As I have indicated, s.7(1)(d) provides the tax base for the
business tax assessment of manufacturers.  In s.7(1)(g)(iii), the
tax base for the business tax assessment of the business of &#147;the
transmission of water or of steam, heat or electricity for the
purposes of light, heat or power&#148; is fixed at 30% of the assessed
value under s.3.  This is also an element of the business carried
on by GLP.  Once again, in my view, the legislature has
recognized a distinction between the business of manufacturers
and the business of public electrical utilities, such as GLP.  In
my opinion, s.3, para. 18 is complementary to s.7(1)(g)(iii).
[13] It may be, as counsel suggested, that the Coleman case is
not easy to interpret.  However, as I read Coleman it supports
the conclusion which I have reached.  The 1914 Act contained
provisions in s.10(1)(d) and (k) which correspond to the
provisions in s.7(1)(d) and (g)(iii) of the present Act.  At
p.407 of Coleman, on behalf of four of the five members of the
Court of Appeal, Middleton J.A. stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The company transmits electricity and supplies compressed
          air by a system of pipes from a compressor plant outside the
          township, assisted by an auxiliary plant within the township.  We
          agree that this is not in any sense a manufacturing business
          within [s.10(1)(d)].</pre>
    <pre>[14] Because the electrical utility in Coleman, it would seem,
carried on different aspects of its overall business in different
municipalities or regions, it was necessary for the court to have
recourse to s.10(3) of the 1914 Act, which is virtually identical
to s.7(8) of the present Act.  Both s.10(3) of the 1914 Act and
s.7(8) of the present Act preclude multiple assessments where a
taxpayer carries on more than one of the businesses contained in
s.10(1) and s.7(1), respectively, the assessment being governed
by the taxpayer&#146;s &#147;chief or preponderating business&#148;.  In doing
so, Middleton J.A. stated at p.408:
          </pre>
    <pre>               We also agree that the electrical business is the
          &#147;preponderating business&#148; carried on upon the premises, under
          subsec.3, and so the case comes within [s.10(1)(k) and not
          s.10(1)(j)].
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The  appeal  therefore  fails  and  is
          dismissed with costs.</pre>
    <pre>Section 10(1)(k) and (j) of the 1914 Act corresponds to
s.7(1)(g)(iii) and (k) of the present Act.  The passages which I
have quoted constitute in their entirety the reasons of Middleton
J.A. for the majority.</pre>
    <pre>[15] It is helpful to reproduce s.10(1)(k) of the 1914 Act to
illustrate the similarity between the italicized words and
s.7(1)(g)(iii) of the present Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               10(1)(k)  Every person carrying on the business of a
          telegraph or telephone company, or of an electric railway,
          tramway, street railway or incline railway, or of the
          transmission of oil or water, or of steam, heat, gas, or
          electricity for the purposes of light, heat or power, for a sum
          equal to 25 per cent of the assessed value of the land (not being
          a highway, lane, or other public communication or public place or
          water or private right of way), occupied or used by such person,
          exclusive of the value of any machinery, plant or appliances
          erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to such land.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16] In Coleman, the company produced electrical power in another
municipality and transmitted electricity by high tension power
lines to a transformer station in the Township of Coleman.  The
court was presented with two issues.  The first issue was whether
the company carried on its &#147;chief or preponderating business&#148; in
the Township of Coleman within the meaning of s.10(3) of the 1914
Act.  The court found that it did.  The second issue was whether
the company&#146;s business was a manufacturer within s.10(1)(d) of
the 1914 Act (s.7(1)(d) of the present Act), the transmission of
electricity within s.10(1)(k) of the 1914 Act (s.7(1)(g)(iii) of
the present Act), or whether the company&#146;s business fell within
the &#147;basket clause&#148; found in s.10(1)(j) of the 1914 Act
(s.7(1)(k) of the present Act).  The court found that the
company&#146;s business was &#147;not in any sense a manufacturing
business&#148; within s.10(1)(d), but was &#147;the electrical business&#148;
within s.10(1)(k).  This is the interpretation of the decision in
Coleman found in H.E. Manning, Assessment &amp; Rating:  Municipal
Taxation in Canada, 4th ed., (1962), 109, 185-86, 221.
[17] Further support for my conclusion that the legislature does
not consider the business of an electrical utility to be that of
a manufacturer within the meaning of s.7(1)(d) can be found in Re
Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario &amp; City of Hamilton
(1920), 47 O.L.R. 155 (C.A.), which also concerned the 1914 Act.
The Commission was assessed under s.10(1)(k).  The issue was
whether the Commission was exempt from paying business taxes
under other provisions in the Act.  A  County Court judge found
that the exemptions did not apply and that the Commission was
liable to assessment for business tax under s.10(1)(k).  In doing
so, he was required to answer a number of questions, the first of
which was:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  Was the appellant a person carrying on the business of
          the transmission of electricity for the purposes of light, heat,
          and power, within the meaning of sec. 10 of the Assessment Act,
          so as to be liable to a business assessment thereunder?</pre>
    <pre>[18] Meredith C.J.O., on behalf of the court, concluded that the
County Court judge correctly answered the question in the
affirmative, stating at p.162:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I do not understand that it is essential, in order that the
          Commission shall be liable to the business assessment, that it
          should carry on its business in Hamilton.  If it carries on one
          of the businesses mentioned in sec. 10, and the Commission does
          carry on one of the businesses mentioned in para. (k) of sub-sec.
          1, and occupies or uses land for the purpose of its business, it
          is, as I understand the provisions of the section, to be assessed
          &#147;for a sum to be called &#145;Business Assessment&#146; to be computed by
          reference to the assessed value of the land so occupied or used&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Thus, in both Coleman and Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario this court was satisfied that the business of an
electrical utility similar to that of GLP came within s.10(1)(k)
of the 1914 act, which corresponds with s.7(1)(g)(iii) of the
present Act.  From this it follows that since at least 1914 the
legislature has not intended that the business of an electrical
utility be taxed as the business of a manufacturer within the
meaning of s.10(1)(d) of the 1914 Act and s.7(1)(d) of the
present Act.  Thus, specific provision for the business of an
electrical utility is contained in s.7(1)(g)(iii) with the result
that GLP&#146;s tax base for the calculation of its business tax is
30% of the assessed value of the land which it occupies or uses.
[20] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
judgment of the Divisional Court with costs before that court in
addition to the costs of the appeal.  An order is to issue in
accordance with these reasons.
</pre>
    <pre>                                     Signed: &#147;S. Borins J.A.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[21] I agree with the judgment of the Divisional Court in appeal
and, accordingly, am unable to concur with the reasons of Borins
J.A.  However, accepting his outline of the facts and the issues,
I am able to briefly express my own views.
[22] The appellant argued that the Divisional Court erred in its
interpretation of settled law of some 70 years in Ontario.  In
the submission of appellant&#146;s counsel, this court, in Re Township
of Coleman and Northern Ontario Light and Power Co. Ltd. (1927),
60 O.L.R. 405 (C.A.), held that an electrical business, which
included the generation of electricity from water power and the
transmission of that electricity, is not a &#147;manufacture&#148; for
purposes of business assessment under s.10(1)(d) of the
Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c.195.  Section 10(1)(d) of the 1914
Assessment Act is the equivalent of the present s.7(1)(d) in the
Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.A.31.
[23]  The reasons in Coleman are extremely brief.  In determining
that the company was not a manufacturer, Middleton J.A. said only
the following for the majority at p. 407:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The company transmits electricity and supplies compressed
          air by a system of pipes from a compressor plant outside the
          township, assisted by an auxiliary plant within the township.  We
          agree that this is not in any sense a manufacturing business
          within clause (d).</pre>
    <pre>[24] It is clear from the dissenting reasons of Masten J.A. that
the company generated the electricity in another township and
then transmitted the electricity to an auxiliary plant in Coleman
Township where the character of the electricity was altered and
the electricity was then distributed.  In my view, the majority
simply noted that in Coleman Township the company was primarily
engaged in the transmission of electricity and determined that
electricity transmission is not manufacturing.  Transmission of
electricity was covered by the then equivalent of s.7(1)(g)(iii).
In my opinion, this case is not particularly relevant to the
generation of electricity and, from the combined research of the
respondent&#146;s counsel and my own, it appears that there are no
citations to Coleman in subsequent cases on any subject.  It is
an isolated case that is restricted to its particular facts.
[25] On the other hand, Minister of National Revenue of the
Dominion of Canada v. Dominion Shuttle Co. (Ltd.) (1933), 72 C.S.
15 (Que. S.C.), relied upon by the Divisional Court, has been
referred to by this court and lower Ontario courts in the context
of the Assessment Act and has been adopted by the Supreme Court
of Canada with respect to the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.E-
15.
[26] In Dominion Shuttle, Archambault J. of the Québec Superior
Court defined manufacturer at p.18:
          </pre>
    <pre>               First, what is a manufacturer?  There is no definition of
          the word &#147;manufacturer&#148; in the Act and it is practically
          impossible to find a definition which will be absolutely
          accurate, but from all the definitions contained in leading
          dictionaries, Corpus Juris, Encyclopedias, etc., the Court
          gathers that to manufacture is to fabricate; it is the act or
          process of making articles for use; it is the operation of making
          goods or wares of any kind; it is the production of articles for
          use from raw or prepared material by giving to these materials
          new forms, qualities and properties or combinations whether by
          hand or machinery.</pre>
    <pre>[27] This definition has been quoted with approval on numerous
occasions, some specifically in reference to the production of
electricity by the operation of generators.  Although Archambault
J. was interpreting the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927,
c.179, and the adoption of this definition by the Supreme Court
of Canada was outside the context of the Assessment Act, this
court and other provincial courts have not hesitated to use it
with reference to the Assessment Act.
[28] In The Village of Delhi v. Imperial Leaf Tobacco Company of
Canada Limited, [1949] O.R. 636, Roach J.A. considered the
meaning of the term &#147;manufacturer&#148; in the context of the
Assessment Act.  At p. 655, he referred to the definition from
Dominion Shuttle in the course of determining that the company in
question was not a manufacturer.
[29] The definition from Dominion Shuttle was also considered by
this court in Re Alliston Curling Club Inc. and Town of Alliston,
[1964] 2 O.R. 251 (C.A.).  McGillivray J.A. found that the
equipment was not used for &#147;manufacturing &#133; purposes&#148; in the
context of the Assessment Act.  The portion of Re Alliston that
quotes the Dominion Shuttle definition was subsequently quoted
with approval by this court in R. v. Daniel (1982), 40 O.R. (2d)
620 (C.A.) in the context of the Narcotic Control Act.
[30] Similarly, the Dominion Shuttle definition was considered
with respect to the meaning of &#147;manufacture&#148; in the Assessment
Act in Re Walsh [1961] O.W.N. 105 (Co. Ct.) at p. 107 and in
Warren Bituminous Paving Co. Ltd. v. Corporation of Township of
Otonabee, [1963] 1 O.R. 29 (H.C.J.) at p. 34.
[31] The Supreme Court of Canada has also quoted the definition
from Dominion Shuttle, but only in the context of the Excise Tax
Act.  Spence J. wrote for the Court in R. v. York Marble, Tile
and Terrazzo Limited, [1968] S.C.R. 140.  In considering the
meaning of the word &#147;manufactured&#148; in the Excise Tax Act, he
adopted the following portion of the Dominion Shuttle definition
at p.145:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#147;manufacture is the production of articles for use from raw
          or prepared material by giving to these materials new forms,
          qualities and properties or combinations whether by hand or
          machinery.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[32] In Royal Bank of Canada v. Deputy Minister of National
Revenue for Customs and Excise (1981), 128 D.L.R. (3d) 385
(S.C.C.), McIntyre J. adopted the Dominion Shuttle definition as
quoted in York Marble, supra, and said of thermal generation of
electricity at p.388: &#147;&#133; I conclude that the appellant becomes a
manufacturer by producing electric current by the operation of
the generators.&#148;   I know of no technical reason why for
assessment purposes we should differentiate among thermal, hydro
or nuclear generation of electricity.
[33] The goal of statutory interpretation is to determine the
intent of the legislature in enacting the provisions in question.
The plain meaning of the words is the starting point, but the
provision must be interpreted in the context of the rest of the
legislation.  With respect to the case in appeal, I do not think
that an analysis of the provisions of the Assessment Act relating
to the assessment and taxation of real property is of any
assistance in the light of the introductory language of s. 7
dealing with business assessment.  The section states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               7. &#150; (1)  Irrespective of any assessment of land under the
          Act, every person occupying or using land for the purpose of, or
          in connection with, any business mentioned or described in this
          section, shall be assessed for a sum called &#147;business assessment&#148;
          to be computed by reference to the assessed value of the land so
          occupied or used by that person as follows:</pre>
    <pre>[34] The definition of &#147;manufacture&#148; adopted by the courts has
been consistent since Dominion Shuttle in 1933 and has been
applied in this province.  It has been the definition of choice
under the Assessment Act and has been expressly applied to the
generation of electrical power.  Hydro generated electricity has
been such a significant source of power in this Province for so
many years that one can only assume that it if the legislature
intended to treat it in some special manner under the Assessment
Act, it would have done so long before this date.
[35] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
