    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Sachs J. dated February 26, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the summary judgment of the
Honourable Madam Justice Sachs dated February 26, 1999, wherein
she awarded the Bank of Montreal (&#147;Bank&#148;) $212,152.05 and upheld
the assignment to the Bank by the Corporation of the Town of Ajax
(&#147;Town&#148;) of a portion of its municipal lien created under a
subdivision agreement for a plan of subdivision in the Town.
[2]  The appellants were the original owners of the properties in
issue in this action. They sold the property to a developer and
took back a mortgage as part of the purchase price.  The
appellants, the developer, the Town and the Bank executed the
subdivision agreement.  The Bank had provided the developer with
credit facilities amounting to $15,000,000.  The credit included
commercial letters of credit totalling $3,500,000 issued by the
Bank to the Town to provide guarantees for the performance by the
developer of his obligations under the land servicing
arrangements.  The security arrangements of all the parties
consisted of the following:
     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>i)   the Bank held a $15,000,000 first charge pursuant to a
debenture on the residential portion of the subdivision referred
to as the housing  lots;

ii)  the appellants had a collateral second mortgage on the
housing lots for $700,000;

iii) the appellants had a first mortgage over the portions of the
property known as the school block, the apartment block and the
commercial block;

iv)  the Town was given a first lien over all of the property as
security for any obligation of the developer under the
subdivision agreement.  Both the Bank and the appellants agreed
to postpone and subordinate their respective security interests
to the lien of the Town.

v)   the Bank received a conditional assignment by the developer
of all contracts and agreements including a profit sharing
agreement the developer had with two builders.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[3]  The developer became insolvent and defaulted on its
obligations to the Bank and on its mortgage to the appellants.  A
receiver was appointed.  The appellants exercised their power of
sale under their mortgage that covered the school block and
agreed to sell the property to the School Board.  One of the
problems that emerged was that the developer had stock piled
topsoil on the school block and this had to be removed. The
question arose as to who was to assume the burden and the cost of
removing the topsoil.
[4]  The Town made a demand on the developer to remove the top
soil and to grade and seed the school block and stated that if
this was not done, it would call on the letters of credit
provided by the Bank to complete the necessary work.  The Bank
then agreed to complete the grading of the school block and in
exchange the Town agreed to assign to the Bank its first charge
over the school block.
[5]  The effect of this assignment was that the Bank had acquired
the first security interest of the Town in the school block and
on the closing of the sale to the School Board, it insisted upon
being reimbursed for the cost it had incurred in carrying out the
obligations of the developer with respect to the school block.
In order to close the sale, the parties agreed that the amount in
dispute would be paid into a trust account pending the
determination of the right of the parties.
[6]  The appellants initiated this action for a declaration that
the transfer of the Town&#146;s municipal lien to the Bank was of no
force or effect.  The respondents moved for summary judgment to
dismiss the appellants&#146; action with costs and for the release of
the monies paid into trust sufficient to pay out what was now the
Bank&#146;s lien on the school block.
[7]  The appellants&#146; position was that the Bank&#146;s actions in
obtaining a transfer of the Town&#146;s lien was merely an attempt to
shift the Bank&#146;s financial obligations to the appellants, for the
Bank had provided the Town with irrevocable and unconditional
letters of credit and agreed to pay the Town for the same
obligations which the Bank sought to enforce against the
appellants.
[8]  The motions judge found that the Town had the authority to
enter into the subdivision agreement and to assign its lien
created thereby to the Bank.  No serious complaint was made in
this court as to these findings.  To the extent that the issues
were raised in the factum of the appellant, I would accept the
reasoning of the motions judge that the authority existed in both
cases.  The real complaint, here and below, was that somehow the
Town had improperly preferred the Bank over the appellants by
declining to call on the Bank to honour its letters of credit to
pay for the cost of removing the topsoil from the school block.
In my view, this approach was totally misconceived.  Absent any
express agreement restricting the manner in which the security
holders could realise on their respective securities, they were
all entitled to act in their own best interests.  If the Town
thought that its interests were best served by having the Bank
take over the grading responsibilities of the developer rather
than engaging contractors to do the work for the Town and
claiming against the Bank under its letters of credit, it was
entitled to do so.  If the Bank was prepared to take on this
responsibility in return for upgrading the quality of its
security, there is no reason why it should not have done so.
[9]  The appellants argued that, on their reading of the
subdivision agreement, the Town was obliged to have recourse to
the letters of credit provided by the Bank in enforcing its
rights against the insolvent developer and that it could only
rely upon its first lien rights on exhausting those letters of
credit.  The agreement certainly does not say that this is the
case and it is now conceded that there were no representations by
the Bank or any one else to that effect.   This brings the
appellants to their primary argument that the court as a matter
of equity should bring about the same result by invoking the
equitable doctrine of marshalling.
[10] As has been stated by this court in Re Allison (1998), 38
O.R. (3d) 337 at p.341, citing Aldrich v. Cooper (1803), 8 Ves.
382, 32 E.R. 402 (L.C.), the right to marshal securities is an
equitable one intended to prevent a creditor who can resort to
two funds of a debtor from defeating another creditor who can
resort to only one of them.  Fundamentally, the doctrine is
applied for the purpose of regulating the rights of the two
creditors among themselves, although in so regulating their
rights the court will never interfere with the paramount claim of
the superior creditor (the one which has the choice of the two
funds of the debtor from which to collect) to pursue his or her
remedy against either fund, but provides that if he or she
resorts to the fund which the inferior creditor can alone resort,
then the inferior creditor shall not be prejudiced.  The doctrine
is applicable unless some other equity prevents its application
such as in the case where its application would prejudice third
parties.  There are five criteria: (a) two creditors; (b) one
common debtor; (c) two funds of the debtor with the superior
creditor having access to both and the inferior creditor to but
one; (d) no interference with the choice of remedy of the
superior creditor and (e) no prejudice to third parties.
[11]  There are a number of reasons why the doctrine of
marshalling has no application here. In the first place,
marshalling will not permit the court to instruct the Town that
it must choose one avenue of relief over another.  In the second
place, the Town was not attempting to recover a debt from the
developer, it was attempting to have remedied a default of the
developer by having someone remove top soil from the school block
so that it would be useable for school purposes. The issue of how
it would be recompensed would only come up if it chose to do the
work itself.  As we know, however, it did not make this choice
but instead chose to assign its lien to the Bank in return for
the Bank&#146;s commitment to see that the work was done.  In the
third place, there was no common debtor for both &#147;funds&#148;.  Even
assuming that the letters of credit and the lien could be treated
as sources of funds for the purposes of this doctrine, while the
Town had access to the two funds, only one of them was a resource
of the debtor.  That resource was the school block and the money
that its sale would represent. The letters of credit were an
obligation of the Bank to the Town. While admittedly access by
the Town to the letters of credit could only be triggered by the
default of the developer, it was the Bank, not the developer,
which would become the debtor on the happening of that event.
Accordingly, there was no common debtor to the appellants and the
Town with respect to the two funds that the Town had access to
such as to permit the invocation of the doctrine of marshalling.
Fourthly, the effect of the order sought would prejudice the
Bank, which is a third party to the marshalling scheme.
[12] In summary then, there are three parties that are affected
by the insolvency of the developer: the Town, the appellants and
the Bank. All are creditors. The doctrine of marshalling does not
permit the court to prefer the rights of one creditor to another.
It cannot dictate to the Town which of a number of options it
must exercise in order to protect the appellants at the expense
of the Bank because to do so would not only interfere with the
paramount claim of the Town as the superior creditor, it would
prejudice the rights of the Bank.  In this instance, the
appellants are asking the Town to do two things: first to do the
work itself and second to make a claim against the security it
holds from the Bank.  The Town apparently thought it would be
more advantageous to its interests to arrange to have the Bank
remove the topsoil in return for its first lien on the property
affected.  In this way it had no responsibility to see that the
work was properly done and it retained the full value of its
security with the Bank against any other defalcations by the
developer. What this analysis discloses is that the appellants
are asking the court to unscramble this omelette at the behest of
one creditor to the detriment of the other two.  The sole
beneficiary of such an order would be the appellants who would
receive the full proceeds of the sale of the school block. The
equitable doctrine of marshalling offers no support for this
request and I see no basis at all to provide the appellants with
the relief that they seek.
[13] Accordingly, for the above reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal with costs.
