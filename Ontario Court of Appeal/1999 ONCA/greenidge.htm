    <pre>               Joseph J. Sullivan

    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The statutory process for resolving disputes with respect to
no-fault benefits involves compulsory mediation preceding the
commencement of any action.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Section 272(2) of the Act provides:</pre>
    <pre>          s. 272(2) Every proceeding against any
          insurer under a contract in respect of
          insurance provided under section 268 [the no-
          fault benefits section] must be commenced
          within the limitation period specified in the
          contract, but in no event shall the
          limitation period be less than the period
          described in subsection 281(5).</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The provision in the contract of insurance with respect to
the limitation period for the commencement of the mediation stage
of the process does not, in our view, oust or conflict with the
statutory provisions dealing with the limitation period for the
commencement of an action. They relate to two different
proceedings and, in our view, are not in conflict.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Furthermore, we agree with the reasons of Justice Cavarzan.
The appeal must be dismissed.</pre></td>
