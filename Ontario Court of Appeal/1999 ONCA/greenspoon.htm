COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            ALLEN GREENSPOON and MED CLINIC 2000 CORPORATION
               (Plaintiffs (Appellants)) and LILLY TSAMBALIEROS
               (Defendant (Respondent))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        AUSTIN, GOUDGE AND MacPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Adam Bull
               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Moses Muyal
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 10, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Philp J. dated May 22, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant first argues that there was a new lease which,
although  unwritten, was partially performed commencing March  1,
1994. The trial judge found that while the respondent was willing
to  enter a new lease, she set certain preconditions which, it is
conceded,  were  not  met. In our view,  this  provides  a  sound
foundation for the conclusion below that no new contract was ever
reached.  This  being so, it is unnecessary to determine  whether
the doctrine of partial performance applies.
[2]  Secondly, the appellant alleges that the finding below that
no damages were proven should be reversed. In our view, it was
open to the trial judge to find, as we think he clearly did, that
the value of the removed cabinetry to the appellant was, in these
circumstances, zero. Equally, it was open to the trial judge to
find that there was insufficient evidence to prove the cost of
repairs. As to the claim for rent for part of July 1994, it was
not claimed in the statement of claim nor dealt with by the trial
judge and, in our view, ought not to be dealt with here.
[3]  Therefore, despite the candid and helpful submissions of Mr.
Bull, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
