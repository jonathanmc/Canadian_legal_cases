    <pre>MORDEN A.C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]    The   major   issue  in  this  appeal   is   whether   the
discoverability  rule  relating  to  the  determination  of   the
commencement date for the running of a limitation period  applies
to  the  limitation  period provided for  in  s.  258(2)  of  the
Insurance   Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.  I.8.  Briefly,   under   the
discoverability rule a cause of action does not accrue  to  start
the  running of the limitation period until the plaintiff  knows,
or reasonably should know, all of the material facts on which the
cause of action is based. Section 258(2) reads:</pre>
    <pre>          (2)   No  action shall be brought against  an
          insurer   under  subsection  (1)  after   the
          expiration  of  one  year  from   the   final
          determination  of  the  action  against   the
          insured, including appeals if any.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Subsection (1) of s. 258 reads:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)   Any  person who has a claim against  an
          insured for which indemnity is provided by  a
          contract   evidenced  by  a   motor   vehicle
          liability policy, even if such person is  not
          a party to the contract, may, upon recovering
          a   judgment  therefor  in  any  province  or
          territory of Canada against the insured, have
          the   insurance  money  payable   under   the
          contract  applied in or towards  satisfaction
          of  the  person's judgment and of  any  other
          judgments  or  claims  against  the   insured
          covered  by  the  contract and  may,  on  the
          person's  own  behalf and on  behalf  of  all
          persons  having  such  judgments  or  claims,
          maintain  an  action against the  insurer  to
          have the insurance money so applied.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This action was commenced under s. 258(1) and the defendant,
Canadian  General Insurance Company, pleads that it  is  statute-
barred under s. 258(2). Following the exchange of pleadings,  the
parties concurred in stating a question of law for the opinion of
the court under Rule 22. The questions are:</pre>
    <pre>          1.   Does the &quot;Discoverability Rule&quot; apply to
          s. 258(2) of the Insurance Act?</pre>
    <pre>          2.    If so, on the facts of this case,  does
          it  postpone  the running of  the  limitation
          period prescribed therein?</pre>
    <pre>[4]   All of the relevant facts are, of course, contained in  the
Special  Case  which I have reproduced, without its exhibits,  in
the  appendix to these reasons. At this point, I shall set forth,
very  briefly, those facts which afford the backdrop to the first
question - whether the discoverability rule applies to s.  258(2)
of the Insurance Act.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Fidelle  Bosse was the owner and driver of a motor  vehicle
which,  on  June  12, 1989, struck from behind  a  motor  vehicle
driven  by the plaintiff Debra Grenier in which her husband,  the
plaintiff  Raymond  Grenier, was a passenger. The  Greniers  were
injured  in  the  accident and commenced an  action  against  Mr.
Bosse.   The  action  was  undefended.  The  plaintiffs  obtained
judgment  in  this  action on May 11, 1992.  At  that  time,  the
plaintiffs  and  their  solicitor  thought  that  Mr.  Bosse  was
uninsured.  They subsequently discovered, apparently  in  May  of
1995, that Mr. Bosse did have a policy of motor vehicle liability
insurance  with the appellant Canadian General Insurance  Company
which was in force at the time of the accident. On June 12,  1995
the  plaintiffs  commenced this action under  s.  258(1)  against
Canadian General in which they seek to recover the amount of  the
judgment obtained against Mr. Bosse.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Mr.  Justice Binks heard the Special Case. His reasons  for
judgment are reported at (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 343 (Gen. Div.). He
held that:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  the discoverability rule did apply to s.
          258(2) of the Insurance Act and</pre>
    <pre>          (2)   on  the  facts set out in  the  Special
          Case,  the  rule operated &quot;so as to  postpone
          the   running   of  the  limitation   period&quot;
          prescribed in s. 258(2) of the Insurance Act.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Canadian General appeals from this disposition. I shall now
address each of the questions in the Special Case.</pre>
    <pre>     1.    Does the Discoverability Rule apply to Section  258(2)
of the Insurance Act?</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In Kamloops v. Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2, the Supreme Court
of  Canada decided that the discoverability rule applied  to  the
limitation  periods in ss. 738(2) and 739 of the  Municipal  Act,
R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255. The rule has been applied by that court in
subsequent  cases: Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986]  2  S.C.R.
147;  M.  (K.)  v.  M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6; and  Peixeiro  v.
Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  last  word  of  the Supreme Court  of  Canada  on  the
discoverability rule is the judgment in Peixeiro. In  this  case,
the  issue  was the application of the rule to s. 206(1)  of  the
Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H-8, which read:</pre>
    <pre>          206(1)    Subject to subsections (2) and (3),
          no  proceeding  shall be  brought  against  a
          person for the recovery of damages occasioned
          by  a  motor vehicle after the expiration  of
          two years from the time when the damages were
          sustained.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The action in question was commenced under s. 266(1) of  the
Insurance  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-8 which required a  &quot;threshold&quot;
level of injury as a condition of being entitled to maintain  the
action.  The Supreme Court, affirming the result in the Court  of
Appeal  for  Ontario  ((1995), 25 O.R. (3d)  1),  held  that  the
discoverability rule applied to s. 206(1) of the Highway  Traffic
Act.  To  appreciate the Supreme Court's reasons, it is necessary
to consider, first, those in this court, given by Carthy J.A. for
the court.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Carthy J.A., after referring to Kamloops, said at p. 4:</pre>
    <pre>               On   my   reading   of   the   appellate
          authorities in Canada since Kamloops,  I  can
          see   no  narrowing  of  the  scope  of   the
          rationale   expressed  by  Lord  Denning   in
          Sparham-Souter [Sparham-Souter  v.  Town  and
          Country  Developments  (Essex)  Ltd.,  [1976]
          Q.B.  858  (C.A.)] and no attempt to  confine
          the principle to particular types of actions,
          or   to   premise  its  application  to   the
          particular   language   of   the   applicable
          limitations statute. While this may appear to
          be   a   singular  example  of  the   court's
          engagement  in legislating, the rule  appears
          to  be  established that a limitation statute
          commences to run when the material facts upon
          which   the   action  is  based   have   been
          discovered  or ought to have been  discovered
          by  the  exercise  of  reasonable  diligence.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[12]  I  have  emphasized the italicized words because  they  are
central to the issue in this appeal. Does the application of  the
discoverability  rule depend upon the wording of  the  limitation
provision  in question? This question is to be kept  in  mind  in
reading the reasons of the Supreme Court given by Major J. At pp.
563-65, Major J. said:</pre>
    <pre>               Since this Court's decisions in Kamloops
          (City of) v. Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2,  and
          Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2  S.C.R.
          147,  at p. 224, discoverability is a general
          rule  applied  to  avoid  the  injustice   of
          precluding  an  action before the  person  is
          able  to raise it. See Sparham-Souter v. Town
          &amp; Country Developments (Essex) Ltd., [1976] 1
          Q.B.  858 (C.A.), at p. 868 per Lord Denning,
          M.R.,  citing Cartledge v. E. Jolping &amp;  Sons
          Ltd., [[1963] A.C. 758]:</pre>
    <pre>               It  appears to me to be unreasonable and
               unjustifiable in principle that a  cause
               of  action  should  be  held  to  accrue
               before  it  is possible to discover  any
               injury  and,  therefore,  before  it  is
               possible to raise any action.</pre>
    <pre>          See also M. (K.) v. M. (H.), supra, at p.  32
          and  Murphy v. Welsh, [[1993] 2 S.C.R.  1069]
          at pp. 1079-81.</pre>
    <pre>               In  this regard, I adopt Twaddle  J.A.'s
          statement   in  Fehr  v.  Jacob  (1993),   14
          C.C.L.T.  (2d) 200 (Man. C.A.),  at  p.  206,
          that   the   discoverability   rule   is   an
          interpretive  tool  for  the  construing   of
          limitations  statutes  which  ought   to   be
          considered each time a limitations  provision
          is in issue:</pre>
    <pre>                    In   my   opinion,  the  judge-made
               discoverability  rule  is  nothing  more
               than a rule of construction. Whenever  a
               statute   requires  an  action   to   be
               commenced  within a specified time  from
               the  happening of a specific event,  the
               statutory  language must  be  construed.
               When time runs from &quot;the accrual of  the
               cause  of  action&quot; or  from  some  other
               event   which   can  be   construed   as
               occurring  only when the  injured  party
               has  knowledge of the injury  sustained,
               the   judge-made  discoverability   rule
               applies.  But, when time  runs  from  an
               event   which  clearly  occurs   without
               regard to the injured party's knowledge,
               the  judge-made discoverability rule may
               not  extend  the period the  legislature
               has prescribed.</pre>
    <pre>               The  appellant submitted here  that  the
          general  rule of discoverability  was  ousted
          because  the  legislature  used  the   words,
          &quot;damages  were  sustained&quot;, rather  than  the
          date &quot;when the cause of action arose&quot;. It  is
          unlikely  that  by using the  words  &quot;damages
          were  sustained&quot;,  the  legislature  intended
          that  the determination of the starting point
          of  the  limitation period should take  place
          without   regard   to  the  injured   party's
          knowledge. It would require clearer  language
          to    displace    the   general    rule    of
          discoverability.  The  use  of   the   phrase
          &quot;damages  were sustained&quot; rather than  &quot;cause
          of  action arose&quot;, in the context of the HTA,
          is  a  distinction without a difference.  The
          discoverability rule has been applied by this
          Court even to statutes of limitation in which
          plain construction of the language used would
          appear to exclude the operation of the  rule.
          Kamloops, supra, dealt in part with s. 739 of
          the  Municipal  Act, R.S.B.C. 1960,  c.  255,
          which  required that notice should  be  given
          within two months &quot;from and after the date on
          which  [the] damage was sustained&quot;.  However,
          this  Court applied the discoverability  rule
          even  with  respect  to  this  section:   see
          Kamloops, supra, at pp. 35-40.</pre>
    <pre>               I agree with the Court of Appeal that to
          hold  that the discoverability principle does
          not  apply  to  s.  206  HTA  would  unfairly
          preclude actions by plaintiffs unaware of the
          existence  of  their  cause  of  action.   In
          balancing the defendant's legitimate interest
          in  respecting  limitations periods  and  the
          interest  of  the plaintiffs, the fundamental
          unfairness of requiring a plaintiff to  bring
          a  cause of action before he could reasonably
          have discovered that he had a cause of action
          is  a compelling consideration. The diligence
          rationale  would  not be  undermined  by  the
          application of the discoverability  principle
          as  it still requires reasonable diligence by
          the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Both  the  appellant and the respondents  rely  upon  these
reasons. I note, at the outset, that Major J. did not adopt  this
court's   conclusion  that  the  discoverability   rule   applies
irrespective of the wording of the provision in question.  At  p.
564, he said, &quot;adopting Twaddle J.A.'s statement in Fehr v. Jacob
(1993),  14 C.C.L.T. (2d) 200 (Man. C.A.), at p. 206&quot;,  which  he
quoted,  &quot;the discoverability rule is an interpretative tool  for
the   construing  of  limitation  statutes  which  ought  to   be
considered each time a limitations provision is in issue.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Major J. then applied Twaddle J.A.'s statement to the issue
before  him. He held that the words &quot;damages were sustained&quot;  (in
the  Highway Traffic Act, s. 206(1)) were, for the purpose of the
discoverability  rule,  the same as &quot;when  the  cause  of  action
arose&quot;  (substantially, the wording of the limitation periods  in
the previous cases which applied the discoverability rule).</pre>
    <pre>[15]  In Fehr v. Jacob, supra, a medical malpractice action,  the
limitation provision required the action to be commenced  &quot;within
two  years from the date when, in the matter complained of, those
professional  services  terminated&quot;.  Immediately  following  the
passage in his reasons which Major J. quoted, Twaddle J.A.  said,
at p. 206:</pre>
    <pre>               In  the case at bar, the statute bars an
          action if it is commenced more than two years
          after   the   termination  of  the   doctor's
          professional services. That is an event which
          occurs   without  regard  to  the   patient's
          knowledge   of   any   injury.    There    is
          consequently  no room for the application  of
          the   judge-made  discoverability  rule.  The
          present  plaintiff could only resort  to  the
          statutory  discoverability  rule.  This   she
          failed to do on a timely basis and her action
          was consequently barred.</pre>
    <pre>[16] I quote this because it clarifies, if necessary, the meaning
of  the  concluding sentence in the paragraph quoted by Major  J.
The  expression &quot;without regard to the injured party's knowledge&quot;
means knowledge of the injury which is an element of the cause of
action  asserted.  A statute which provides that  the  limitation
period  set  forth  in  it is to begin  on  the  accrual  of  the
plaintiff's  cause of action is susceptible to the interpretation
that  a  plaintiff knows, or reasonably should  know,  the  facts
which  comprise his or her cause of action before it can be  said
that  the  cause of action has &quot;accrued&quot;. An analogous  situation
exists  in the criminal law field where some statutory provisions
are  interpreted  as requiring a mens rea, on  the  part  of  the
accused, relating to the actus reus of an offence or part of  it.
The  interpretive  process  in each case  is  one  of  the  court
implying a particular state of mind as being required.</pre>
    <pre>[17] In the Manitoba statute in Fehr, it was clear that the
legislature had not conditioned the commencement of the running
of the limitation period on the state of the plaintiff's
knowledge of the existence of the injury which was the basis of
her claim. This reading of the legislation was approved by Major
J. in Peixeiro.</pre>
    <pre>[18] At this point I set forth the reasons of Binks J. for
holding that the discoverability rule applies to s. 258(2) of the
Insurance Act:</pre>
    <pre>          The 'discoverability rule' recites that a
          cause of action arises for purposes of a
          limitation period when the material facts on
          which it is based have been discovered or
          ought to have been discovered by the
          plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable
          diligence:  See Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse
          et al., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147 at p. 224, 31
          D.L.R. (4th) 481 at p. 535;  Peixeiro et al.
          v. Haberman (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 1 at p. 4,
          127 D.L.R. (4th) 475 (C.A.).
</pre>
    <pre>          The plaintiffs could only issue a statement
          of claim against the Canadian General when
          they had discovered that the at fault driver,
          Fidelle Bosse was in fact insured pursuant to
          a valid policy of motor vehicle insurance by
          them. The plaintiffs did not uncover the
          existence of the Canadian General policy
          until May of 1995.</pre>
    <pre>          If I agreed with the defendant's contention,
          the plaintiff's action would have been
          statute barred prior to the plaintiffs being
          aware of its existence. This is precisely the
          injustice the discoverability rule seeks to
          prevent.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Canadian General challenges these reasons on the basis that
they are not in accord with the reasoning of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Peixeiro. I think that the appellant is right in this
submission, although I note that the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Canada was given after Binks J.'s decision. As I have
said, the Supreme Court did not adopt the reasoning of this court
in Peixeiro that the discoverability rule applies irrespective of
the wording of the provision in question. Because Binks J. cited
this court's decision in Peixeiro it is fair to assume that he
applied its reasoning that the discoverability rule applies to a
limitation provision without regard to its wording.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Canadian General submits that the limitation provision in
this case is like that in Fehr and in other cases like it (see,
for example, Martin v. Perrie, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 41 and Snow v.
Kashyap (1995),  125 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 182 (Nfld. C.A.)) and that
its wording prevents the application of the discoverability rule
to it. The triggering event for the commencement of the running
of the limitation period in Fehr was the date when the
professional services terminated. The termination of services is,
of course, not part of the plaintiff's cause of action. With
respect, I do not think that the triggering event in s. 258(2) of
the Insurance Act - the final determination of the action against
the insured - is the same as that in Fehr. It is a constituent
element of the cause of action which is created by s. 258(1) - a
judgment against a person insured by a motor vehicle liability
policy. Under the discoverability rule this triggering event does
not come into existence until the plaintiff has, or reasonably
should have, knowledge not only that he or she has a judgment
but, also, that it is a judgment against an insured person.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Although the discoverability rule is a rule of
interpretation and not a general substantive rule, it is a strong
rule. In Peixeiro Major J. said that it applies to statutes of
limitation &quot;in which plain construction of the language used
would appear to exclude the operation of the rule.&quot;  This does
not mean that it would apply to a provision the wording of which
could not reasonably accommodate the rule's application. For the
reasons I have given, I think that the terms of s. 258(2), when
read with s. 258(1), afford reasonable accommodation for the
application of the rule.</pre>
    <pre>[22] There is an additional feature of this case which supports
the application of the rule. The cause of action in question is a
statutory cause of action and it is reasonable to think that the
Legislature assumed with respect to both subsections (1) and (2)
of s. 258 that the plaintiff, in obtaining judgment, knows, or
reasonably should know, that the person against whom he or she
obtains the judgment is &quot;an insured&quot; as described in s. 258(1). A
failure to apply the discovery rule to the interpretation of s.
258(2) would frustrate the clear legislative intent and policy of
s. 258(1). The legislative intent would not have been to impose a
limitation period that would expire before the plaintiff could
reasonably have knowledge of the cause of action which the
Legislature created for him or her. Cf. Urie v. Thompson, 337
U.S. 163 at 169 (1949).</pre>
    <pre>[23] For these reasons, I think that Binks J. was right in his
answer to the first question in the Special Case.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Before addressing the second question, I must note that the
law in this jurisdiction respecting the limitation of actions
continues to be in bad shape. As so many earlier judgments have
said, it is a clear injustice that a claim be barred before the
claimant knows, or reasonably could know, that it exists. I think
that the process of judicial interpretation has been pushed as
far as it can to alleviate the situation. Where the
discoverability rule does apply it creates the possibility of
great injustice to defendants who could be exposed to judicial
proceedings many years after events giving rise to the claim. The
only solution is statutory reform which strives to balance the
interests of plaintiffs and defendants. One approach which has
been adopted incorporates the discoverability principle and what
have been called ultimate limitation or long-stop provisions.
See, for example, the British Columbia Limitation Act, R.S.B.C.
1996, c. 266, ss. 3, 6 and 8.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   If the discoverability rule applies to s. 258(2) of the
          Insurance Act, on the facts of this case, does it
          postpone the running of the limitation period in it?</pre>
    <pre>[25] Binks J.'s reasons on this question read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The plaintiffs read the police report which
          advised that Fidelle Bosse was uninsured. The
          report could not have been made at the scene
          of the accident or shortly after because
          Bosse left the scene. The reasonable
          conclusion after reading the report was that
          Bosse was an uninsured driver. It is the duty
          of the police to investigate and report. The
          plaintiff would be justified in concluding
          that they had done so.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The question raises, essentially, a question of fact and I
query whether under the terms of rule 22.01(1) it is proper
subject matter for special case (cf. Aguonie v. Galion Solid
Waste Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) at 174).
Having said this, I would note that while the motions judge did
not enjoy any special advantage of having heard oral evidence in
this matter, his decision is still entitled to deference. We
should not interfere with it unless we think that he disregarded,
misapprehended, or failed to appreciate, relevant portions of the
Special Case, or made a finding not reasonably supported in this
case, or drew an unreasonable inference from them. See Equity
Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R.
(2d) 321 (C.A.) at 336. This test has not been met.</pre>
    <pre>[27] I could go further and note that ample materials support
Binks J.'s conclusion: the police report; the efforts made by an
investigative firm to report on Bosse's financial status and
whereabouts; the inherent unlikelihood of an insured person
concealing the existence of his or her insurance; the fact that
the action against Bosse was undefended; and the requirement in
s. 259(1) of the Insurance Act that an insured against whom an
action is commenced is to give notice thereof in writing to the
insurer within five days after service of every notice or process
in the action.

</pre>
    <pre>                    S P E C I A L   C A S E

</pre>
    <pre>THE FOLLOWING CASE IS STATED FOR THE OPINION OF THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>1.   On the 12th day of June, 1989, the Plaintiff, Debra Grenier,
     was operating her husband's motor vehicle, with the
     Plaintiff Raymond Grenier as a passenger, heading east bound
     along Montreal Road, in the City of Gloucester, when her
     vehicle was struck from behind by a motor vehicle owned and
     operated by one Fidelle Bosse (the &quot;accident&quot;).</pre>
    <pre>2.   Immediately following the accident, Constable Sandord of the
     Gloucester Police Department attended on the scene and
     prepared an accident report, a copy of which is appended
     hereto as Exhibit &quot;A&quot;. [As stated in the reasons, the
     exhibits have been omitted from this appendix.]</pre>
    <pre>3.   In the said motor vehicle accident report, Fidelle Bosse is
     identified as an &quot;uninsured motorist&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>4.   Due to the fact that Fidelle Bosse had left the scene of the
     accident without leaving his name, address or telephone
     number, he was subsequently charged by the Ottawa Police for
     leaving the scene of an accident and impaired driving
     contrary to sections 252 and 253, respectively, of the
     Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</pre>
    <pre>5.   On April 11th, 1990, the Economical [the Greniers' insurer]
     forwarded a registered letter to Fidelle Bosse at the
     address shown on the accident report requesting that he make
     arrangements to reimburse the Economical for any and all
     damages arising from the accident. The letter was returned
     to the Economical with an indication thereon that Fidelle
     Bosse had since moved from the address to which the letter
     was mailed. A copy of this letter is appended hereto as
     Exhibit &quot;B&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>6.   As a result of the accident, the Plaintiffs herein were
     injured and sustained damages which they sought to recover
     against Mr. Fidelle Bosse. The Plaintiffs issued a statement
     of claim on June 11th, 1991 against Fidelle Bosse in the
     Ontario Court (General Division). The statement of claim was
     issued as Action No. 52329/91, a copy of which is appended
     hereto as Exhibit &quot;C&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>7.   The Plaintiffs also named as a defendant in court action
     number 52329/91 their own motor vehicle insurer, namely the
     Economical Mutual Insurance Company (the &quot;Economical&quot;),
     under the &quot;Uninsured Motorist Coverage&quot; provided to the
     Plaintiffs under the motor vehicle insurance policy issued
     by the Economical.</pre>
    <pre>8.   By letter dated June 26, 1991, the Economical attempted to
     serve Fidelle Bosse with a copy of their Statement of
     Defence in action number 52329/91. The letter was returned
     unclaimed. A copy of this letter is appended hereto as
     Exhibit &quot;D&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>9.   The investigative firm of Paul Ethier &amp; Associates was
     retained by the Economical to report on Fidelle Bosse's
     financial status and whereabouts. A copy of their report,
     dated May 15, 1990, is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;E&quot;.
     Notwithstanding the extensive research undertaken by Paul
     Ethier &amp; Associates, they were unable to find any evidence
     of the existence of a motor vehicle insurance policy issued
     to Fidelle Bosse.</pre>
    <pre>10.  A further report, dated January 15, 1991, was obtained by
     the Economical from Paul Ethier &amp; Associates, regarding
     Fidelle Bosse's whereabouts and assets, if any. Again, no
     evidence was found regarding the existence of a motor
     vehicle insurance policy issued by Fidelle Bosse. A copy of
     this report is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;F&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>11.  An Order extending the time for service of the statement of
     claim was obtained on motion before the Honourable Mr.
     Justice Houston on the 20th day of November, 1991. A copy of
     this Order is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;G&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>12.  The Plaintiffs' statement of claim in action number 52329/91
     was finally served upon Fidelle Bosse by personal service on
     February 13, 1992 by the firm of Paul Ethier &amp; Associates
     who were once again retained by the Economical. A copy of
     the Affidavit of Service and the reporting letter from Paul
     Ethier &amp; Associates, dated February 13, 1992, are appended
     hereto as Exhibits &quot;H&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, respectively.</pre>
    <pre>13.  On March 3, 1992, Fidelle Bosse provided a copy of the
     Plaintiffs' statement of claim in action number 52329/91 to
     his insurance agent, Serge Desjardins &amp; Associates, who in
     turn wrote a memorandum to Fidelle Bosse's insurer, Canadian
     General Insurance Company, advising of the claim. Canadian
     General has no record that it ever received that memorandum
     or otherwise obtained notice of the plaintiffs' statement of
     claim until the events described in paragraph 30.</pre>
    <pre>14.  The only information which Canadian General has on file in
     respect of Fidelle Bosse are the computer records appended
     hereto as Exhibit &quot;J&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>15.  Fidelle Bosse failed to defend the Plaintiffs' action and
     was properly noted in default in accordance with the Rules
     of Civil Procedure.</pre>
    <pre>16.  The parties herein admit that Fidelle Bosse was fully liable
     for the accident and all resulting damages suffered by the
     plaintiffs therein.</pre>
    <pre>17.  The Economical, believing Fidelle Bosse to be an uninsured
     motorist, admitted their obligation to pay the Plaintiffs
     any and all sums that were awarded to the Plaintiffs as
     against Fidelle Bosse pursuant to the &quot;Uninsured Motorist
     Coverage&quot; and obtained an assignment of the Plaintiffs'
     rights of recovery as against Fidelle Bosse.</pre>
    <pre>18.  The Plaintiffs' damages were assessed by the Honourable Mr.
     Justice Cosgrove on the 11th day of May, 1992, and Judgment
     was accordingly signed and entered against Fidelle Bosse
     (the &quot;Judgment&quot;). A copy of the said Judgment and Bill of
     Costs is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;K&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>19.  The Judgment remains unsatisfied. The total amount owing
     thereunder as of January 28, 1997, inclusive of pre-Judgment
     and post-Judgment interest and costs is $43,167.22.</pre>
    <pre>20.  On June 23, 1992, the Plaintiffs, via their solicitors,
     Cooligan, Ryan, wrote to Fidelle Bosse requesting that he
     make arrangements to pay the Judgment entered against him.
     He was advised that if he failed to do so, his driver's
     license would be suspended, his wages would be garnished and
     his property would be subject to seizure and sale. A copy of
     this letter is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;L&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>21.  By letter dated June 23, 1992, the Plaintiffs, via their
     solicitors, wrote to the Ministry of Transportation and
     Communications and requested that Fidelle Bosse's driver's
     license be suspended. A variety of correspondence resulted
     and Fidelle Bosse's driver's license was ultimately
     suspended on or about September 21, 1992. A copy of this
     correspondence is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;M&quot;.
22.  On or about July 23, 1992, a Writ of Seizure and Sale was
     filed with the Sheriff's office for the Regional
     Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. A copy of the said Writ is
     appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;N&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>23.  On or about December 1st, 1993, the Plaintiffs' solicitors
     were advised that Fidelle Bosse had declared personal
     bankruptcy. A copy of the bankruptcy notice is appended
     hereto as Exhibit &quot;O&quot;. Again, there was no indication that
     Fidelle Bosse had, at the material time, a valid motor
     vehicle insurance policy.</pre>
    <pre>24.  At no time throughout the foregoing proceedings did Fidelle
     Bosse contact the Plaintiffs or the Economical, either
     directly or via their solicitors, until September 20, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>25.  Fidelle Bosse subsequently retained the law firm of Duekk,
     Lust. Correspondence was exchanged between Fidelle Bosse's
     solicitors and the plaintiff's solicitors, commencing
     September 20, 1994, regarding the suspension of Fidelle
     Bosse's driver's licence. A payment schedule of $100.00 a
     month was arranged with Fidelle Bosse and the suspension of
     his driver's license was lifted. Only one payment of
     $100.00, however, was received and credited against the
     Judgment. A copy of the correspondence leading to this
     result is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;P&quot;.
26.  Following the settlement of the terms of payment, further
     discussion took place between Fidelle Bosse and the
     plaintiffs' solicitors. The plaintiffs' solicitors were then
     advised by Fidelle Bosse that he did have a motor vehicle
     insurance policy at the material time, which policy of
     insurance was issued by the Defendant, the Canadian General
     Insurance Company.</pre>
    <pre>27.  The Plaintiffs' solicitors then attempted to contact Fidelle
     Bosse's previous insurance broker. On May 17, 1995, the
     Plaintiffs' solicitors received a telephone call from Serge,
     Desjardins and Associates, an insurance brokerage firm. The
     brokerage firm confirmed that Fidelle Bosse was in fact
     insured at the time of the accident under a motor vehicle
     insurance policy issued by the Canadian General Insurance
     Company. In a subsequent telephone conversation with the
     Plaintiffs' solicitors, the brokerage firm advised that they
     could not locate an actual copy of the said policy of
     insurance. A copy of an inter-office memo prepared by a
     staff member at the office of the Plaintiffs' solicitors is
     appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;Q&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>28.  Upon further request by the Plaintiffs' solicitors, Fidelle
     Bosse finally obtained and delivered to the Plaintiffs'
     solicitors a copy of his motor vehicle insurance policy
     issued by the Canadian General Insurance Company.</pre>
    <pre>29.  The motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the Canadian
     General Insurance Company provided indemnity to Fidelle
     Bosse for any and all damages awarded against him resulting
     from a motor vehicle accident. The said policy of insurance
     was in full force and effect at the time of the Plaintiffs'
     motor vehicle accident. A copy of the motor vehicle
     insurance policy issued by Canadian General Insurance
     Company is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;R&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>30.  By letter dated May 26, 1995, the Plaintiffs' solicitor
     wrote to the Canadian General Insurance Company requesting
     payment of the unsatisfied Judgment against Fidelle Bosse. A
     copy of this letter is appended hereto as Exhibit &quot;S&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>31.  A statement of claim was issued by the Plaintiffs against
     the Defendant, Canadian General Insurance Company, on June
     12th, 1995, seeking payment of the Judgment pursuant to
     section 258(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.
     Service of the statement of claim was accepted by the
     Defendant on or about July 10th, 1995.</pre>
    <pre>32.  The only defence relied upon by the Canadian General
     Insurance Company herein is that the Plaintiffs' claim is
     statute-barred by reason of section 258(2) of the Insurance
     Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, which states:</pre>
    <pre>          No action shall be brought against an insurer
          under subsection (1) after the expiration of
          one year from the final determination of the
          action against the insured, including appeals
          if any.
</pre>
    <pre>     THE QUESTIONS FOR THE OPINION OF THE COURT ARE:
     1.   Does the &quot;Discoverability Rule&quot; apply to section 258(2)
          of the Insurance Act?
     2.   If so, on the facts of this case, does it postpone the
          running of the limitation period prescribed therein?</pre>
    <pre>THE RELIEF SOUGHT on the determination of the questions states
is:
If the Court's answer to both of the questions is: YES
(a)  Judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs reacquiring the
     Defendant to satisfy the Judgment of the Honourable Mr.
     Justice Cosgrove, dated May 11th, 1992, rendered in the
     Ontario Court (General Division), Action No. 52329/91; and
(b)  Costs of the within action on a party and party basis.</pre>
    <pre>If the Court's answer to either of the above questions is: NO
(a)  Judgment dismissing the within action with costs on a party
     and party basis.</pre>
    <pre>           ALL OF THE FOREGOING IS HEREBY AGREED UPON
               BY THE SOLICITORS FOR THE PARTIES</pre></td>
