    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of  Mr. Justice Gans dated August 4, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]        This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from the order  of
Gans  J.  on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 20  of  the
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  Gans J.  granted  summary  judgment
dismissing the appellants&#146; claim for declaratory relief  and  for
an  order  transferring the garage to the respondent  Condominium
Corporation,  as  well as the appellants&#146; claim for  damages  for
inducing  breach  of contract: [1998] O.J.  No.  3147   Gans  J.,
however,  ordered  that  the appellants&#146; claim  for  damages  for
breach  of  the  Garage  Agreement could proceed  to  trial.  The
respondents seek to cross-appeal that order.</pre>
    <pre>[2]      The  appellants  were the developers  of  a  residential
condominium  complex in downtown Toronto.   The  respondents  are
past  and  present  members of the board  of  directors  of  that
complex, the York Condominium Corporation No. 75 (&#147;YCC 75&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>[3]    The dispute between the parties is over the meaning of  an
agreement  relating to the garage of the condominium (the  Garage
Agreement).  The appellants&#146; principal submissions  are  twofold:
(1)  the motions court judge failed to apply the proper test  for
summary  judgment; and (2) it was an implied term of  the  Garage
Agreement   that   title  be  transferred   to  the   Condominium
Corporation  within a reasonable period of time and  the  motions
judge erred in holding that parole evidence was inadmissible as a
&#145;factual matrix&#146; to show that the parties always intended YCC  75
to take title to the garage. Specifically, the appellants contend
that the word &#145;option&#146; in the agreement is really a misnomer, and
that  the  true nature of the garage agreement is one of purchase
and  sale.  We do not agree that the intention of the parties can
be  taken  to  have  been anything other than to  have  the  word
&#145;option&#146;  convey  its usual commercial meaning.  Accordingly,  we
would dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>
[4]      The  appellants commenced this action in the wake  of  a
threat by the respondents to sue them for the cost of repairs  to
the  garage  and for the payment of hydro arrears. The appellants
then  alleged  that YCC 75 was in breach of the Garage  Agreement
because  it  had  failed to exercise its option to  purchase  the
garage.   The  appellants also alleged that the  respondents  had
adopted  a strategy to frustrate the garage becoming commercially
viable  &#150; a prerequisite under the agreement for exercise of  YCC
75&#146;s option.</pre>
    <pre>[5]       YCC 75 was a low income housing project financed by the
Central  Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). To meet  CMHC&#146;s
financing  requirements, the garage was organized as  a  separate
condominium unit (not part of the common elements), initially  to
be  owned by some of the appellants and to be operated under  the
terms  of the Garage Agreement. Thus, some of the appellants  are
the  legal title holders.  The garage itself comprises  one  unit
out  of four hundred and ninety-two that make up the condominium.
At  the  time of the execution of the Garage Agreement, both  the
developer  and  the  board  of YCC  75  were  controlled  by  the
appellants.   Therefore, as the motions court judge  put  it,  at
paragraph  7 of the reasons for judgment: &#147;In the fall  of  1972,
the  plaintiffs  [appellants]  qua developers  entered  into  the
Garage  Agreement ostensibly with themselves as the declarant  on
behalf of the Corporation [YCC 75] with respect to the ownership,
use and operation of the Garage.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[6]    The material sections of the Garage Agreement provide:</pre>
    <pre>
     (a)  Howard [the appellants] constructed the buildings and other
       improvements which form the condominium units and common elements
       managed by the Corporation;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Howard is the registered owner of all of the condominium
       units of the Corporation, and the said condominium units are
       being sold to purchasers on the basis that Howard will lease to
       the unit owners parking spaces in the underground parking garage&#133;</pre>
    <pre>     
     (c)  Pursuant to an agreement dated the 25th day of September,
       1970 between Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Howard,
       Howard is obliged to grant an option to the Corporation to
       purchase the said underground Garage as set out in Paragraph 11
       of the said Agreement;
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Howard hereby grants to the Corporation the option to
       purchase the Garage on the terms and conditions hereinafter
       contained.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Howard shall manage the garage and be entitled to the income
       therefrom and be responsible for the expenses thereof, including
       mortgage interest, principal and taxes accruing due and payable
       prior to the time when the Corporation purchases the Garage.
     &#133;</pre>
    <pre>     4.   The profit from the operation of the Garage, after allowing
       for a five percent (5%) management fee  shall be applied by
       Howard in repayment of its equity in the Garage&#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Upon Howard being repaid its equity in the Garage, which
       equity is hereby agreed to be the sum of Twenty-four Thousand
       Eight Hundred and Forty-Five Dollars ($24,845.00), the Garage
       shall be offered for sale to the Corporation at the amount then
       outstanding on the mortgage&#133;</pre>
    <pre>     
     6.   Howard, forthwith upon being repaid its equity in the
       Garage, shall notify the Corporation that its equity has been
       repaid and the Corporation shall have the irrevocable option to
       purchase the Garage within Ninety (90) days of the giving of such
       notice for the amount then owing on the said mortgage in favour
       of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
     </pre>
    <pre>     7.   The Corporation&#146;s option to purchase the Garage shall be
       exercised as hereinafter provided within such Ninety-day period
       after which time the option shall be null and void and Howard
       shall be entitled to retain ownership of the Garage or to dispose
       of the Garage as it shall see fit. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[7]    The appellants submit that this court &#147;redefined&#148; the role
of  the  motions court judge on a Rule 20 motion in  two  of  its
recent  decisions:   Dawson  et al.  v.  Rexcraft  Warehouse  and
Storage  Inc.  et  al.; Pacific &amp; Western Trust  Co.  v.  Carroll
(1998),  164  D.L.R. (4th) 257 and Aguonie v. Galion Solid  Waste
Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161.  We disagree. These cases
confirmed  and  perhaps elaborated on the existing  jurisprudence
under  Rule  20,  but  they  did not change  that  jurisprudence.
Further,  this  court affirmed in two recent decisions  that  the
test  for summary judgment under Rule 20 remains as it has  since
the   Ungerman  and  Ontario  Jockey  Club  cases:   V.K.   Mason
Construction  Ltd.  v.  Canadian  General  Insurance  Group  Ltd.
(1998),  42  O.R.  (3d)  618  at  625  per  Finlayson  J.A.,  and
Transamerica  Occidental Life Insurance Co.  v.  Toronto-Dominion
Bank  (1999), 173 D.L.R. (4th) 468 where Osborne J.A. stated  the
following at pages 482-483:</pre>
    <pre>
           The purpose of Rule 20 and the limitations on its
     scope  are  now well-established.  See Irving  Ungerman
     Ltd. v. Galanis (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.).  On all
     summary  judgment motions, the core question  is:   has
     the  moving party established that there is no  genuine
     issue for trial.  Rule 20.04(1) makes it clear that the
     party responding to a summary judgment motion, in  this
     case  the Insurers, may not rest on the pleadings,  but
     must provide evidence from which the motions judge  can
     conclude that there is a genuine issue for trial.   See
     11061590 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario Jockey Club (1995), 21
     O.R. (3d) 547 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>           A  motions  judge  on a Rule 20 summary  judgment
     motion, should not resolve issues of credibility,  draw
     inferences from conflicting evidence, or from  evidence
     that is not in conflict when more than one inference is
     reasonably available.  As Borins J. (ad hoc)  for  this
     court,  succinctly put it in Aguonie  v.  Galion  Solid
     Waste Material (Ontario) Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)  161
     (C.A.), at p. 173:</pre>
    <pre>          Evaluating credibility, weighing evidence,  a
          nd   drawing  factual  inferences   are   all
          functions reserved for the trier of fact.</pre>
    <pre>           Borins  J.&#146;s  observations in  Aguonie  serve  to
     reinforce  Morden  A.C.J.O.&#146;s statements  in  Ungerman,
     which  makes  it  clear that the mere existence  of  an
     issue  of  credibility will not  defeat  a  motion  for
     summary judgment.  The issue of credibility must  be  a
     genuine issue.  Morden A.C.J.O. said in Ungerman at pp.
     551-52:</pre>
    <pre>          It is safe to say that &#145;genuine&#146; means not  s
          purious  and,  more  specifically,  that  the
          words  &#145;for  trial&#146;  assist  in  showing  the
          meaning  of the term.  If the evidence  on  a
          motion  for  summary judgment  satisfies  the
          court that there is no genuine issue of  fact
          which  requires  a trial for its  resolution,
          the  requirements of the rule have been  met.
          It must be clear that a trial is unnecessary.
          The  burden is on the moving party to satisfy
          the  court that the requirements of the  rule
          have  been met.  Further, it is important  to
          keep in mind that the court&#146;s function is not
          to  resolve an issue of fact but to determine
          whether a genuine issue of fact exists.
                               &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          It is a sensible general proposition that, if
          there is an issue of credibility, a trial  is
          required and summary judgment should  not  be
          granted.  &#133; the proposition that an issue  of
          credibility precludes the granting of summary
          judgment applies only when what is said to be
          an issue of credibility is a genuine issue of
          credibility.</pre>
    <pre>[8]   In  our  view, Gans J. correctly applied the  Rule  20  jur
isprudence  of this court and correctly concluded that  at  least
for  the  claims  of  equitable relief and damages  for  inducing
breach of contract there is no genuine issue for trial.</pre>
    <pre>[9]        The appellants argue that read literally the terms  of
the  Garage  Agreement produce a commercially  absurd  situation.
They  seek to introduce evidence to show what they claim  is  the
true  intent  of  the  parties.  In  making  this  argument   the
appellants  rely  on  the judgment of Estey J.  in  Consolidated-
Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance  Co.,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901 for the proposition that the object of
the  court  in the interpretation and construction of a contract,
and particularly a commercial contract, is to promote and advance
the  true  intent of the parties, and to ensure that a  realistic
result,  which  is consistent with the commercial  atmosphere  is
achieved.  This is only a partial reading of the case.  Estey  J.
also  emphasized  that the true intent of the parties  is  to  be
ascertained  at the time the parties entered into  the  contract.
He said at 901:</pre>
    <pre>
     &#133;  the  normal rules of construction lead  a  court  to
     search  for an interpretation which, from the whole  of
     the  contract, would appear to promote or  advance  the
     true  intent of the parties at the time of  entry  into
     the  contract&#133;  an  interpretation  which  defeats  the
     intention  of  the  parties  and  their  objective   in
     entering  into the commercial transaction in the  first
     place   should   be   discarded  in   favour   of   the
     interpretation  of  the  [contract]  which  promotes  a
     sensible commercial result.  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[10]       Looking only at the words of the Garage Agreement  the
appeal  must fail. The Garage Agreement is clear and unambiguous.
It explicitly refers to an option, and nothing in the language of
the  document  lends  itself  to an  interpretation  creating  an
obligation rather than an option to purchase.</pre>
    <pre>[11]       This conclusion is reinforced by paragraph  7  of  the
Garage Agreement, which provides:</pre>
    <pre>
     7.   The Corporation&#146;s option to purchase the Garage shall be
       exercised as hereinafter provided within such Ninety-day period
       after which time the option shall be null and void and Howard
       shall be entitled to retain ownership of the Garage or to dispose
       of the Garage as it shall see fit. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>If  the  Garage  Agreement were truly intended to  amount  to  an
agreement  of purchase and sale after a period of time, paragraph
7  would  have  no purpose.  Therefore from the language  of  the
document, the parties unquestionably intended to create an option
of purchase in favour of YCC 75 when the triggering condition was
satisfied.</pre>
    <pre>
[12]       However,  the  appellants  seek  to  introduce  parole
evidence  to  show that a term should be implied  in  the  Garage
Agreement.  We observe first that the appellants have not  sought
rectification;  and  second,  that  the  mere  assertion   parole
evidence  is  needed  to  interpret an agreement  is  not  itself
sufficient  to  resist  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  &#150;  the
responding  party  (here the appellants) must  at  least  show  a
reasonable basis for admitting parole evidence and, if  admitted,
that  this  evidence  would  raise a  genuine  issue  for  trial.
However,  in  seeking to rely on parole evidence  the  appellants
face two hurdles, both stemming from the observation of Estey  J.
in  Consolidated Bathurst that the court must look to the  intent
of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, not at
some future date.</pre>
    <pre>[13]      First, the appellants effectively negotiated the Garage
Agreement with themselves, and must be taken to have intended the
meaning of the agreement they drafted.  As Gans J. observed,  &#147;In
other  words, at the time the agreement was concluded, there  was
not  an  independent board and the individual directors who  have
been  joined  as  party defendants had nothing  to  do  with  the
Corporation&#146;s  management and, I dare say, with the  negotiations
that resulted in the completed agreement.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[14]       Second, on the motion the appellants were  obliged  to
put  their  best foot forward and &#147;lead trump&#148; in  the  words  of
Osborne  J.A.  in the Jockey Club case, yet they filed  only  the
affidavit of Robin Bookbinder and some documents attached to  his
affidavit.   It may be that the appellants had no other  evidence
to  lead  but  Mr.  Bookbinder was not present  for  and  has  no
knowledge  of what occurred surrounding the  negotiation  of  the
Garage  Agreement.   The documents relied on  by  the  appellants
begin  in May, 1973, some eight months after the Garage Agreement
was  signed.  Therefore the appellants produced no evidence of  a
&#147;factual   matrix&#148;  at  the  time  of  entering   the   contract.
Admittedly, the subsequent conduct of the parties can cast  light
on  their intention at the time the contract was made but on  the
facts  of this case we see no basis for using the evidence relied
on  by the appellants in that way.  Accordingly Gans J. correctly
held  that this evidence could not be admitted at trial as parole
evidence  to explain what are otherwise unambiguous terms  of  an
option agreement.  Thus, he was right in finding no genuine issue
for  trial  on whether a term should be implied in the Agreement.
That disposes of the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[15]       The respondents&#146; cross-appeal is from an interlocutory
order for which leave is required. Leave was not sought, and  had
it  been,  we would have refused it.  The respondents argue  that
the  appellants&#146;  claim  for damages for breach  of  contract  is
statute-barred.  The appellants, however, led evidence to raise a
genuine  issue  for  trial  on whether the  discoverability  rule
applies.   Gans  J.  was  correct to dismiss  this  part  of  the
respondents&#146; motion.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[16]      For these reasons, the appeal and the cross-appeal  are
each dismissed with costs.</pre>
