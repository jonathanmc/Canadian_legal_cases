    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            KAROLINE GRUNDL (Appellant) v. HERBERT LEHNER
               (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        LABROSSE, BORINS and O'CONNOR JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       David M. Goodman,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               David N. Delagran,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 6, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice J. M. Wilson dated
January 31, 1995</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The parties appeal and cross-appeal the judgment of Wilson
J. in  protracted and bitter litigation resulting from the trial
of three actions, one of which related to family law.
[2]  Numerous issues are raised in the appeal and the cross-
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues raised in the appeal
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Common-law spouses</pre>
    <pre>[3]  There was evidence that pointed for and against the issue of
whether the parties were common-law spouses.  However, there was
a sufficient evidentiary basis for the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
that the parties were not common-law spouses and we see no reason
to interfere with that finding.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Credit for interim support</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to balance and
set off the interim support payments against different
obligations which she found owing by Mr. Lehner in relation to
56 Bow Valley.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   65 Bow Valley</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge&#146;s conclusion on this issue is based on
findings of credibility.  Specifically, she rejected the evidence
of Mrs. Grundl and accepted Mr. Lehner&#146;s evidence that he did not
know what he was doing when he transferred the property.  The
trial judge concluded that the presumption of resulting trust had
not been rebutted by way of a valid gift.  We see no reason to
interfere with the conclusion of the trial judge.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   Occupation rent</pre>
    <pre>[6]  There was evidence supporting the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
that the appropriate rental value of 56 Bow Valley was $1,200 per
month. When counsel came back before her, some two and one-half
years later, it would have been preferable for the trial judge to
have permitted the introduction of evidence of fair rental value
for the period of Mrs. Grundl&#146;s occupation.  Counsel requested
that we direct a reference to determine this issue.  It was open
to counsel to apply to introduce fresh evidence before this court
regarding this matter.  That was not done.  In these
circumstances, we are not prepared to interfere with the finding
of the trial judge, both as to amount and period of time
involved.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Interest on capital contribution</pre>
    <pre>[7]  We are satisfied that the trial judge properly exercised her
discretion on this issue both as to the rate payable and the
starting date.
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   Current market value of cottage</pre>
    <pre>[8]  This issue will be dealt with in the context of the cross-
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues raised in the cross-appeal</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Cottage</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge found that Mr. Lehner made a gift of a one-
half interest in the cottage to Mrs. Grundl.  In our view, this
finding was supported by the evidence and does not conflict with
the purpose of the transfer, which was to overcome a Planning Act
problem.
[10] As a result of the re-attendance of counsel before the trial
judge, the judgment was amended to provide that the current value
of the cottage is $70,000 and that Mr. Lehner is entitled to
purchase Mrs. Grundl&#146;s interest for $33,950.  These amounts were
agreed to by counsel and we see no basis for interfering.
[11] We see no merit in the other grounds raised in the cross-
appeal.
[12] The judgment below is to be amended in accordance with the
request of both counsel.  The new amounts to be inserted in
paragraph 7, 14 and 15 are $10,600, $24,600 and $45,331
respectively.
[13] The judgment will be further amended to provide in paragraph
5 that Mr. Lehner&#146;s right to purchase Mrs. Grundl&#146;s interest in
the cottage for the sum of $33,950 must be exercised no later
than November 6, 1999.
[14] Finally, with respect to costs, we see no reason to
interfere with the determination of costs made by the trial
judge.
[15] In the result, the appeal is allowed as specified above.  In
all other respects the appeal and the cross-appeal are dismissed.
In this court, Mr. Lehner has been more successful than Mrs.
Grundl.  Accordingly, we order that he be awarded one-half of his
costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.</pre>
