    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            DALE ALEXANDRA HALL (Appellant/Applicant) v.
               TIMOTHY HALL (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ABELLA, MOLDAVER and SHARPE JJ.A.</pre>

               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Carl Zalev dated May
7, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, there is no basis for interfering with Justice
Zalev&#146;s orders with respect to the quantum of child and spousal
support.  However, having found that the interim support awarded
on April 23, 1996 was based on the husband&#146;s misleading
information as to his income, the trial judge should have awarded
support which rectified this misinformation.  We are not
persuaded, however, that a lump sum should be awarded, rather we
would correct the gap by awarding spousal support in the amount
of $550.00 per month retroactively as of April 23, 1996 in
addition to the $1,600.00 per month then ordered.
[2]  Moreover, there was no basis for imposing a time limit on
spousal support in the circumstances of this case.  The time
limit for spousal support is therefore deleted and the
commencement of the order for spousal support is varied to
commence April 23, 1996.
[3]  The appeal is otherwise dismissed and the appellant is
entitled to her costs of the appeal.  The cross-appeal is
dismissed without costs.
[4]  The parties raised issues before this court dealing with the
transfer of corporate shares, disposition of the matrimonial
home, responsibility for the joint line of credit, and
designation of the beneficiary under the insurance policy.  We
advised the parties that these were not properly before us as a
matter of first instance, and directed them, in the absence of an
agreement, to seek clarification and relief from the trial judge.</pre></td>
