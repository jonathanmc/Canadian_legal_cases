</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from a conviction for spousal assault.
The complainant and the appellant are both police officers.  They
had a brief and acrimonious marriage during the year 1988 when
the alleged assaults took place.  The criminal charges were not
laid until February of 1997.
[2]  The trial judge treated this as an uncomplicated matter
whereas, clearly, it was not.  The two parties could agree as to
almost nothing with respect to any of the alleged offences and in
this court counsel could agree as to very little of what the
record at trial revealed.  The trial judge&#146;s reasons for
convicting the appellant were very brief and of little assistance
to the court in trying to determine what it was that occurred
between the appellant and the complainant.
[3]  While, as the trial judge accurately stated, the testimony
of the complainant and the appellant provided the essential and
crucial evidence in the case, the trial judge made no attempt to
reconcile the significant contradictions in their evidence nor
did he give any analysis of the complainant&#146;s evidence in order
to reconcile its inherent contradictions. He simply said that he
did not believe the evidence of the appellant and believed and
accepted that of the complainant.  He made no attempt to analyse
the evidence as it applied to the three distinct charges and
simply concluded that the appellant &#147;was guilty as charged&#148;.
[4]  However, he could not have believed all that the complainant
swore to; otherwise he would not have put the Crown on notice
after conviction of his concern about the nine year delay between
the alleged assaults and the laying of criminal charges. If
anything, he appeared in his reasons for sentence to have
resolved this issue in favour of the appellant.  He said: &#147;These
are old occurrences, too old.&#148;
[5]  There was a good deal of evidence on this issue.  The
complainant testified that she had reported the assaults
immediately to the internal affairs office of the police
department and had done everything required of her to see that
the matter was processed within the department.  The appellant,
on the other hand, alleged that she had only laid the complaint
to internal affairs as a cover for rumours of her infidelity,
that she had failed to give the force the necessary statement
that would have permitted them to proceed with an investigation
and that the late criminal charges followed suspiciously an
extended meeting between the complainant and his second wife with
whom he was having a contentious separation and custody dispute.
There was other evidence by her superior to whom she had
complained that indicated that she had been assaulted but was
supportive of the appellant&#146;s allegations that she did not in
fact co-operate with internal affairs in pursuing the matter.
Having regard to the critical impact of this evidence on the
credibility of the complainant, it appears to us that it was
necessary for the trial judge to have dealt directly with the
relevant circumstances related to the issue of delay.
[6]  This is one of those cases contemplated by the Supreme Court
of Canada where it is our duty to intercede.  In Harper v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2, Estey J. for the majority stated at
p.14:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the right to
          reassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt
          or innocence.  The duty of the appellate tribunal does, however,
          include a review of the record below in order to determine
          whether the trial court has properly directed itself to all the
          evidence bearing on the relevant issues.  Where the record,
          including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of
          appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the
          complete disregard of such evidence, then it falls upon the
          reviewing tribunal to intercede.  This problem was before this
          Court in MacDonald v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 665, when Laskin
          C.J. stated, at p. 673:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    It does not follow, however, that
               failure of a trial judge to give reasons, not
               challengeable per se as an error of law, will
               be equally unchallengeable if, having regard
               to the record, there is a rational basis for
               concluding that the trial judge erred in
               appreciation of a relevant issue or in
               appreciation of evidence that would affect
               the propriety of his verdict.  Where some
               reasons are given and there is an omission to
               deal with a relevant issue or to indicate an
               awareness of evidence that could affect the
               verdict, it may be easier for an appellate
               Court or for this Court to conclude that
               reversible error was committed: see R. v.
               Bush, [1939] 1 W.W.R. 42, at p. 44; Ungaro v.
               R., [1950] S.C.R. 430; Horsburgh v. R.,
               [1967] S.C.R. 746; Kolnberger v. R., [1969]
               S.C.R. 213.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In our view, this verdict cannot stand.  The trial judge did
not properly direct himself to all of the evidence bearing on
relevant issues.  On the other hand, there is evidence upon which
a jury, properly instructed, could convict the appellant.  There
must be a new trial.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary
for us to deal with the Crown&#146;s sentence appeal.
[8]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are
quashed and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
