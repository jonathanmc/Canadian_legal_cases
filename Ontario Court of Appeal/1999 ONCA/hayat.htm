    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Justice
(Divisional Court) (Rosenberg, Haley and Forestell JJ.) dated
December 14, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal comes to the court with leave from the judgment
of the Divisional Court on an application for judicial review of
a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the Governing
Council of the University of Toronto (the Committee).  There are
three issues:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Did the Divisional Court err in rejecting the Committee&#146;s
  interpretation of the University Grading Practices Policy?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Did the Divisional Court err in holding that the treatment
  of the respondent was &#147;manifestly unfair&#148;?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  If the Divisional Court was correct in setting aside the
  decision of the Committee, did it err in issuing a writ of
  mandamus compelling the University to confer a diploma in
  orthodontics on the respondent?</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>II</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In June 1994, the respondent, Dr. Arif Hayat (Dr. Hayat),
gained entrance to the diploma program in orthodontics, a two-
year post graduate program offered by the Faculty of Dentistry at
the University of Toronto.  Only four people were admitted to the
program.  Unfortunately, Dr. Hayat&#146;s progress through the program
was far from uneventful.  Most of the extensive history of the
dealings between the Faculty and Dr. Hayat is not, however,
germane to this appeal.
[3]  The background necessary for the determination of this
appeal begins in April 1997 when Dr. Hayat failed a written
examination in orthodontics.  Dr. Hayat had taken the examination
under protest as it was his position that a written examination
could not be part of the evaluative process for this course.  He
claimed that he and the other students in the course had been
told that it would be evaluated through an oral exam and clinical
evaluation, and that under the University policies governing
methods of evaluation, the Faculty of Dentistry could not add the
further requirement of a written examination.
[4]  Students had to achieve a B- mark in orthodontics to
successfully complete the course and obtain their diploma.  Dr.
Hayat had received a B in his clinical work and a C on his oral
examination.  When his failing mark on the written examination
was factored into his assessment, his mark fell below B-.  A
student who did not achieve a B- in orthodontics had to repeat
the entire year.
[5]  The Faculty of Dentistry notified Dr. Hayat that he had
failed to achieve the required mark in the orthodontics course
and would be required to repeat second year.  Dr. Hayat appealed
that decision to the Faculty&#146;s Academics Appeals Committee
contending that the results of the written exam could not
properly be taken into consideration in determining his mark, and
that he had achieved a satisfactory grade when only his oral exam
and clinical work were taken into consideration.  The Faculty
Academics Appeals Committee disagreed with Dr. Hayat, but did
order that he be allowed to take a new written exam in
orthodontics.  The result of that exam, considered along with his
other evaluations, would be used to determine whether he achieved
the necessary B- grade.
[6]  Dr. Hayat did not re-write the exam but instead appealed the
decision of the Faculty Academic Appeals Committee to the
Governing Council of the University.  That appeal was considered
by the Committee.  It made several findings, none of which were
challenged in the Divisional Court or here.  The Committee found:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  The University Grading Practices Policy (the Policy) applied
  to the graduate program in which Dr. Hayat was enrolled;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Under paragraph II.2(a) of that Policy, the instructor of a
  course was required to make available to students at the
  beginning of the course the methods by which the student&#146;s
  performance would be evaluated;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The students in the orthodontics course were advised at the
  beginning of the course that they would be evaluated by their
  clinical work and the results of an oral exam;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Paragraph II.2(b) of the Policy provided:
          </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>            After the methods of evaluation have been made known, the
          instructor may not change them or their relative weight
          without the consent of at least a simple majority of the
          students enrolled in the course.</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  No consent to change the method of evaluation was asked for
  by the instructor or given by a majority of the students in Dr.
  Hayat&#146;s class;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Those administering the course had intended all along that a
  written exam would be a part of the evaluation, but through
  inadvertence had not communicated that intention in a timely
  fashion to the students.1</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[7]  Having concluded that the Policy applied and that the
Faculty of Dentistry had failed to comply with the Policy, the
Committee turned to the question of the effect of that non-
compliance.  As this is the crux of the appeal, I will set out
the Committee&#146;s reasoning in full:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The next question is, what follows?  The Policy does not set
          out consequences of non-compliance with the requirement in
          question.  A breach of this provision of the Policy, even
          inadvertently, as the Committee thinks was the case here, is
          serious, and cannot be disregarded.  In the opinion of the
          Committee, non-compliance with this portion of the Policy does
          not necessarily mean that a student is exempted from fulfilling
          an evaluation requirement of which due notice, or consent in lieu
          thereof, has not been given according to the Policy.  The
          Committee holds that, to determine the appropriate consequence of
          a breach in a particular situation, the purpose behind the
          Policy&#146;s provision should be considered.  The Committee considers
          that there are two specific purposes underlying the obvious more
          general purpose of fairness to students.  The first is to give
          students who, for various reasons, prefer one means of evaluation
          to another, an opportunity to select courses accordingly while
          they still have freedom to move from one course to another
          without penalty.  The second is to give students ample warning of
          what they must prepare for.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In this case, the first element has no
          application, and can be given no weight.  A
          candidate who wishes to receive the diploma
          must take the clinical components,
          particularly Orthodontics III, however they
          may be evaluated.  There is no alternative
          course to take if a student does not like the
          evaluation methods established by the
          Faculty.  It was never suggested that the
          Appellant, (or any other student) would have
          refused a rare place in the diploma programme
          if the student had been aware at the
          beginning that a written examination was a
          component of the total evaluation of
          Orthodontics III.
          </pre>
    <pre>               This leaves the question of prejudice
          due to lack of timely notice.  The Committee
          cannot rule out some prejudice in this case,
          and indeed, to make the Policy effective in
          practice, prejudice must really be assumed
          here.  However, the Committee believes that
          the relief ordered by the Faculty Academic
          Appeals Committee adequately protected this
          purpose of the Policy in the circumstances of
          this case.  [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The Committee made further orders that are not germane to
this appeal and directed that the test should be administered
within six months from the release of the decision.
[9]  Dr. Hayat sought judicial review of the Committee&#146;s decision
in the Divisional Court.  That court unanimously allowed the
application.  Its reasons are set out in full below:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Governing Council did not follow the clear wording of
          the University grading practices policy when they required the
          applicant who had satisfactorily completed all of the published
          requirements of the diploma course to take a further written
          exam.  This was compounded when they adjusted the weight and
          significance of marks already reviewed and determined the weight
          to be given to the results of the written exam.
          </pre>
    <pre>               While it is rare that the courts will
          interfere with the decision of the committee
          of the governing council in a case such as
          this the result of the decision in this case
          is so manifestly unfair to the applicant who
          has complied with all the requirements of
          which he had notice when he enrolled that it
          requires the court&#146;s intervention.  The
          results of the test of April 14, 1997 are
          expunged.  We find the applicant has
          fulfilled all of the requirements for
          graduation from the Orthodontic Diploma
          Program at the U of T.  Costs of applicant
          fixed at $7,500.00.</pre>
    <pre>[10] In its formal judgment, the Divisional Court quashed the
decision of the Committee, declared that the results of the
written test should be expunged from Dr. Hayat&#146;s academic record
and declared that he had fulfilled all of the requirements for
graduation from the post graduate diploma course in orthodontics.
The court directed that the University of Toronto should confer a
diploma in orthodontics upon Dr. Hayat.</pre>
    <pre>III</pre>
    <pre>Did the Divisional Court err in rejecting the Committee&#146;s
interpretation of the Policy?</pre>
    <pre>[11] The Divisional Court did not set out the standard of review
it employed in assessing the Committee&#146;s interpretation of the
Policy.  Its finding that the Committee did not follow the &#147;clear
wording&#148; of the Policy does not indicate what standard the court
applied in reviewing the decision.  The identification of the
appropriate standard of review is an essential first step in
deciding whether Dr. Hayat was entitled to relief by way of
judicial review.
[12] In recent years, the courts have recognized that the level
of judicial scrutiny of decisions made by tribunals moves along a
continuum.  That continuum ranges from patent unreasonableness at
one end (maximum deference) to correctness at the other end (no
deference).  The level of scrutiny to be applied to any specific
decision is determined by a &#147;functional and pragmatic&#148; approach
which aims at determining the extent to which the Legislature
intended that the courts should review the decision in issue:
Pezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers) (1994), 114
D.L.R. (4th) 385 at 404 (S.C.C.);  Ross v. New Brunswick School
District No. 15 (1996), 133 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 12-13 (S.C.C.);
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.
(1997), 144 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 11-12 (S.C.C.);  Pushpanathan v.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 160
D.L.R. (4th) at 193 at 209 (S.C.C.);  Baker v. Canada (Minister
of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at
224 (S.C.C.).
[13] The cases identify a number of factors which must be
considered in determining the appropriate level of review.  These
include:  the existence of a right of appeal and the scope of
that right;  the presence of a privative clause and the language
of that clause;  the nature of the decision being challenged;
and, the role or function performed by the tribunal when making
the decisions being challenged.
[14] When I apply those factors to the decision of the Committee,
I conclude that maximum judicial deference should be accorded the
Committee&#146;s interpretation of the Policy.  I think the court
should interfere only if the Committee&#146;s interpretation is
patently unreasonable.  Where as here, the decision under
consideration involves the academic standards of a University,
the courts have always been reluctant to interfere:  King v.
University of Saskatchewan, [1969] S.C.R. 678 at 686.  A standard
of review which accords maximum deference to the tribunal&#146;s
decision is consistent with the authorities.
[15] The decisions of the Committee are not protected by a
privative clause.  The other relevant considerations, however,
strongly favour maximum deference.  There is no right of appeal
from the decision of the Committee.  The decision under attack
concerns the Committee&#146;s interpretation of its own Policy. There
can be no doubt about the Committee&#146;s jurisdiction to interpret
the Policy.  Its task cannot be equated with the interpretation
of a statute of general application.  Finally, and most
importantly, in interpreting the Policy, the Committee performs a
function which goes to the core of the internal governance of the
University.
[16] The Governing Council is charged with the responsibility and
authority to &#147;determine and regulate the standards for the
admission of students to the University, the contents and
curricula of all programs and course of study and the
requirements for graduation&#148; (University of Toronto Act, 1971,
S.O. 1971, c. 56, s. 2(n) as amended S.O. 1978, c.88, s. 2(5)).
Under that authority, it has created the Policy and an internal
appeals structure for determining disputes, including disputes
arising out of the application or non-application of the Policy.
In interpreting the Policy, the Committee must maintain both the
integrity and the fairness of the evaluative process by which the
university determines entitlement to its various degrees.  In
resolving disputes over the Policy, the Committee is charged with
the responsibility of maintaining the appropriate academic
standards within the university and ensuring that students who
are subject to those standards are treated fairly.  The Committee
is much better positioned to interpret the Policy in a manner
which achieves an appropriate balance than are the courts.
[17] The Committee&#146;s analysis of the effect of non-compliance
with the Policy is set out above in paragraph 7.  I have no
hesitation in holding that the Committee&#146;s interpretation of the
Policy clears the &#147;patently unreasonable&#148; bar.  The Committee was
faced with a policy that prohibited non-consensual changes in the
method of evaluation after a certain point in time.  The Policy,
however, was silent as to the effect of non-compliance with the
rules governing changes in methods of evaluation.  In looking to
the effect of non-compliance with paragraph II.2(b) of the
Policy, the Committee examined the purposes underlying that part
of the Policy and concluded that where those purposes could be
served, an evaluative method employed in contravention of the
Policy could still be used to determine whether a student met the
necessary competence standard.  I see nothing patently
unreasonable either in the purposes ascribed to the Policy by the
Committee, or in its determination that those purposes could be
fully satisfied by permitting Dr. Hayat to redo the written exam
within six months.
[18] Counsel for Dr. Hayat submits that the Committee&#146;s
interpretation of the Policy flies in the face of the purposes
enumerated at the outset of the Policy.  The Policy describes its
purposes, in so far as they are relevant to this proceeding, as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The purpose of the University Grading Practices Policy is to
          ensure:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  that grading practices throughout
          the university reflect appropriate academic
          standards;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  that the evaluation of student
          performance is made in a fair and objective
          manner against these academic standards;</pre>
    <pre>[19] The Committee&#146;s analysis of the purposes underlying the part
of the Policy which addresses changes in methods of evaluation is
entirely consistent with the stated purposes of the policy.  The
Committee was anxious to maintain appropriate academic standards
through appropriate methods of evaluation and yet provide for
evaluation which was &#147;fair and objective.&#148;
[20] Tested against the applicable standard of review, the
Committee&#146;s interpretation of the Policy cannot be successfully
challenged on judicial review.</pre>
    <pre>Was the decision of the Committee &#147;manifestly unfair&#148;?</pre>
    <pre>[21] Fairness concerns raised on applications for judicial review
are usually directed at questions of procedural fairness.  A
failure to meet applicable procedural standards is clearly
subject to correction by way of judicial review:  Paine v.
University of Toronto et al. (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 770 (C.A.);  Re
Polten and Governing Council of the University of Toronto et al.
(1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 749 at 764 (Ont. Div. Ct.).  I see no merit
to any claim that Dr. Hayat did not receive procedural due
process from the Committee.</pre>
    <pre>[22] It is, however, urged that the result arrived at by the
Committee works a substantive unfairness on Dr. Hayat.  This
argument is in reality a reformulation of the argument that under
a proper interpretation of paragraph II.2(b) of the Policy a
student can never be required to submit to a method of evaluation
that does not comply with the Policy.  My conclusion that the
Committee&#146;s interpretation of the effect of non-compliance with
the Policy was not patently unreasonable goes a long way to
deciding this issue against the respondent.  Assuming that there
may be fact situations in which an interpretation of the Policy
that was not patently unreasonable could work a manifest
unfairness, this is not that situation.  As the Committee pointed
out, the orthodontics course was mandatory.  Dr. Hayat could not
get his diploma without taking that course.  It is inconceivable
that he would have refused to take one of the valued positions in
the orthodontics graduate program had he known beforehand that he
would be subject to a written exam.  It cannot, therefore, be
said that Dr. Hayat was treated unfairly in the sense that he
embarked on a course of conduct which he would not have
undertaken had he been told about the written exam.  This leaves
only the question of whether he received fair and adequate notice
that he would be required to take a written exam.  Any problem
associated with the notice provided to Dr. Hayat disappeared when
the Committee ordered that he could take a new test and could
have up to six months to prepare himself for it.
[23] It cannot be suggested that the Faculty of Dentistry acted
in bad faith in requiring Dr. Hayat to take a written
examination.  It regarded that examination as a necessary part of
the evaluation of the students&#146; performance in the course.  The
evaluative process, including the written exam, was aimed at
ensuring a minimum level of competence.  The Faculty&#146;s failure to
comply with the Policy by communicating that decision to the
students in a timely fashion is regrettable but, as observed by
the Committee, was inadvertent.  All that is left to support Dr.
Hayat&#146;s claim that he was treated with manifest unfairness is his
assertion that he had a vested right to be tested only by the
means that complied with the Policy.  The Committee interpreted
the Policy differently and in doing so did not give the Policy a
patently unreasonable interpretation.  The respondent was not
treated in a manifestly unfair way.</pre>
    <pre>If the Divisional Court correctly set aside the decision of the
Committee, did it err in issuing mandamus compelling the
university to give the respondent a diploma in orthodontics?</pre>
    <pre>[24] I need not address the propriety of the remedy ordered by
the Divisional Court given my conclusion that the Divisional
Court erred in setting aside the decision of the Committee.</pre>
    <pre>IV</pre>
    <pre>[25] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
Divisional Court and restore the decision of the Committee.  The
time frame set by the Committee for the administration of the
exam should run from the release of these reasons.  The appellant
is entitled to its costs on the application for leave to this
court, on this appeal, and in the Divisional Court.  The costs in
the Divisional Court will be in the amount fixed by that court
($7,500).
