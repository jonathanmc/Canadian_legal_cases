    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by the Honourable Mr. Justice
J. F. Hamilton dated July 22, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a trial before Hamilton J., the appellant was
convicted of one count of administering a noxious substance.  The
facts of the offence are highly unusual.  The noxious substance
was cocaine and the victim was the appellant&#146;s five-year-old son.
Hamilton J. imposed a sentence of two years less one day
imprisonment.  The appellant appeals that sentence.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The commission of this offence is difficult to comprehend.
It does not appear that the appellant bore any ill will towards
her child or that she was unconcerned for the child&#146;s welfare.
Indeed, the presence of cocaine was detected in the child&#146;s
system because the appellant took him to the hospital.  At best,
the commission of this offence can only be understood within the
context of the appellant&#146;s appalling background and her serious
addiction to crack cocaine.
[3]  The appellant and her younger brother first came to the
attention of the Children&#146;s Aid Society when the appellant was
under two years of age because a neighbour reported that they
were extremely thin and appeared neglected.  There is no
indication of any intervention by the Children&#146;s Aid at that
time. Children&#146;s Aid was contacted again when the appellant was
five years of age because a teacher noticed that the appellant
had a black eye and red marks around her neck.  The appellant&#146;s
mother admitted that she tried to strangle her. Children&#146;s Aid
became involved with the family.  The children were physically
and emotionally neglected.  The home was filthy.  Her mother
completely rejected the appellant.  She had to steal lunches at
school to feed herself.
[4]  Finally, when the appellant was 12 years of age, her mother
admitted that she could not manage her and she was placed in a
group home.  While the appellant was in the group home, her
mother&#146;s boyfriend became intoxicated while babysitting her
younger brother.  A fire somehow started in the home and the
appellant&#146;s brother died in the fire.  The appellant was
devastated by this loss and tried to avoid returning home after
being discharged from the group home.  Her mother insisted that
the appellant return because she needed help with a new baby.
The appellant ran away many times.  When the appellant was 14
years of age, she was placed in another residence by Children&#146;s
Aid.  Attempts to place the appellant in foster homes failed
because the appellant was using drugs and alcohol.  When she was
15, the Crown wardship was terminated and the appellant went to
live with a boyfriend.  The appellant remained with this man for
the next seven years despite his verbal and physical abuse.
[5]  The appellant then began an on-again-off-again relationship
with David W.  David is the father of the victim, who was born in
October 1991.  The appellant has been addicted to drugs since she
was 15 years of age.  She has been addicted to crack cocaine for
a substantial period of time and was using crack at the time of
the birth of her son.  It will come as no surprise that the child
was difficult to manage and that the appellant had poor parenting
skills.  The appellant took the child to several hospitals to get
help for him.  She was unsuccessful.  She decided to take matters
into her own hands and began giving the child Ritalin that she
had purchased &#147;on the street&#148;.  For at least a year prior to June
1996, the appellant was administering Ritalin to the child.  From
her point of view, it helped control the child&#146;s behaviour.
[6]  In May 1995, the appellant took the child to the Hospital
for Sick Children because of concerns about his speech and
behaviour.  The child was diagnosed with &#147;global developmental
delay&#148;.  In August 1995, the appellant began to use the services
of a babysitter.  She gave the babysitter Ritalin to administer
to the child.  In April 1996, the babysitter&#146;s older brother took
the child to the Hospital for Sick Children because of a
suspected overdose of Ritalin.  There was no overdose, but a
referral was made to the Hospital&#146;s General Paediatric Clinic.
The appellant kept the appointment and freely admitted that she
had been giving Ritalin to the child.  The appellant had been
giving the child 40 mg. daily.  This was much too high, even
assuming Ritalin was required.  The physician began a course of
treatment to wean the child from the drug.  The appellant
initially refused to follow the course of treatment because she
did not agree with it.  It appears that social workers with the
Hospital were able to convince the appellant to reduce the use of
Ritalin and to continue treatment at the Hospital.  On June 5,
1996, the appellant and David W. took the child for an
appointment at the Hospital.  A urine sample was obtained from
the child and this sample tested positive for cocaine.
Children&#146;s Aid and the police were contacted and the child was
taken into care.
[7]  The appellant was charged with two counts of criminal
negligence causing bodily harm and two counts of administering a
noxious substance in relation to Ritalin and cocaine.  The
appellant admitted using cocaine in her apartment but claimed
that she took steps to ensure that the child would not be
affected by the drug.  The expert evidence, however, showed that
not only had the child been exposed to a large amount of cocaine
through second-hand smoke, but the evidence was suggestive of
internal consumption.
[8]  The expert evidence could not establish that the child
suffered bodily harm from the exposure to the cocaine, and the
appellant was acquitted of the charge of criminal negligence
causing bodily harm for administering it.  Similarly, because
there was no referable evidence of bodily harm, the appellant was
acquitted on the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm
for administering the Ritalin.  In addition, the appellant was
acquitted on the charge of administering a noxious substance on
the Ritalin-related count.  The trial judge was satisfied that
the appellant did not administer the Ritalin with intent to
endanger the child&#146;s life.  He noted that once the appellant was
made to understand that the use of the high dosages of street
Ritalin would harm the child, she stopped giving it to him.
[9]  As for the charge of administering a noxious substance in
relation to cocaine, the trial judge found that the high levels
in the child&#146;s system could not simply have been caused by
exposure from the environment in the apartment.  To quote the
trial judge, &#147;As [the appellant] is the only source, I find she
must have administered the drug to him.  I do not find he
obtained it from environmental sources.&#148;  While the trial judge
must have rejected the appellant&#146;s evidence that she took all
possible care to keep cocaine away from her son, he made no
finding as to how or why the appellant might have administered
the drug.
[10] The appellant was 31 years of age at the time of the
sentencing in July 1998.  Remarkably, in view of her longstanding
cocaine addiction, and her admission that she has been selling
drugs and engaging in prostitution to feed this addiction, she
had no prior criminal record.  The appellant said that she had
been in numerous treatment programmes, but had been unable to
overcome her addiction.  According to the pre-sentence report,
she was not interested in taking any further treatment.  In
submissions, counsel for the appellant stated that the pre-
sentence report was not accurate and the appellant was willing to
undertake treatment as a term of a disposition imposed by the
trial judge.  On the other hand, it was a term of her bail that
she attend for treatment, and there was no evidence that she had
complied with that term.1
[11] The appellant&#146;s child was placed in a foster home following
her arrest.  The appellant visited the child until several weeks
prior to sentencing and at the time of sentencing appeared
favourably disposed to the child being adopted.
[12] At trial, counsel for the appellant suggested that the
appellant receive an 18-month conditional sentence.  The Crown
sought a four-year penitentiary sentence.</pre>
    <pre>THE REASONS FOR SENTENCE
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge was of the view that the appellant&#146;s
prospects for rehabilitation were not good in view of the
unsuccessful attempts at treatment for drug addiction.  After a
brief review of the facts, the trial judge gave the following
reasons for sentence:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have considered a conditional sentence.  I have concluded
          a conditional sentence would not be consistent with the
          fundamental purpose of the principles of sentencing as set out in
          s. 718 of the Criminal Code.  The nature and the circumstances of
          the offence are such that a period of incarceration is required
          to express denunciation and deterrence both generally and
          specifically.  There is a denunciatory aspect in this offence of
          administering a noxious substance which overrides any entitlement
          to conditional sentence.  Such conduct of giving a young child
          cocaine cannot be rewarded with a conditional sentence.  The
          public would be outraged.
          </pre>
    <pre>               This is a serious violation to the
          victim and Ms. Hayman&#146;s conduct does not
          justify clemency.  Any sentence I imposed
          must not only send a message to Ms. Hayman
          but to any other parent who might be tempted
          to.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[14] The trial judge imposed a sentence of two years less one day
imprisonment.  He did not impose any period of probation.</pre>
    <pre>FRESH EVIDENCE
</pre>
    <pre>[15] With the consent of counsel for the respondent, the court
received fresh evidence.  The appellant&#146;s child has been made a
Crown ward and continues in foster care.  The appellant has
indicated that she will consent to the child&#146;s adoption.
[16] Since her sentencing, the appellant has been incarcerated at
the Vanier Centre for Women.  She successfully completed an anti-
substance abuse course and a life skills course.  She was found
smoking marijuana in the institution on one occasion.  In
November 1998, the appellant was assessed by an addiction
counsellor with the Metro Addiction Assessment Referral Service.
She has indicated her willingness to undertake the treatment
programme recommended by the Service.
[17] Margaret Flower is a registered nurse employed by the Metro
Addiction Assessment Referral Service.  She drew up a treatment
plan for the appellant.  Upon release, the appellant would be
referred to the Addiction Research Foundation comprehensive
outpatient therapy programme.  While she is waiting for the
treatment programme to start, the appellant would be provided
with one-on-one counselling at the Metro Addiction Assessment
Referral Service.
[18] David W. provided an affidavit.  He is 43 years of age and
self-employed.  He states that he and the appellant are engaged
to be married and plan to marry after she is released from
custody.  He confirms that they have agreed with the Children&#146;s
Aid Society to put the child up for adoption.  He is supportive
of the appellant and has continued to visit her at the Centre.
He supports her plan to enter the treatment programme suggested
by the Metro Addiction Assessment Referral Service.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant committed a very serious offence, endangering
the life of her child.  The circumstances under which she
administered the cocaine to her child are largely unknown.
Despite the fact that the appellant was a first offender, this
was an offence that required a term of imprisonment.  However, it
was also a case where the trial judge should have given serious
consideration to the appellant being permitted to serve the
sentence of imprisonment in the community under a conditional
sentence order.  While denunciation was an important objective,
given the unique circumstance of the offence and the offender,
general deterrence was of lesser importance.  A conditional
sentence was not necessarily inconsistent with the sentencing
principles, provided appropriate conditions were imposed.  The
trial judge erred in principle in rejecting a conditional
sentence on the theory that such a sentence would be a &#147;reward&#148;
for giving cocaine to a child and that the appellant&#146;s conduct
does not justify &#147;clemency&#148;.  The conditional sentence is neither
a reward nor an exercise of clemency.  It is a sentence of
imprisonment to be served in the community under appropriate
conditions.  In this case, because of the appellant&#146;s serious
addiction those conditions would have had to have been strict.
[20] Nevertheless, there were at least two real impediments to
imposing a conditional sentence at the time the appellant was
before Hamilton J.  The appellant&#146;s counsel stated that, contrary
to the assertion in the pre-sentence report, the appellant was
prepared to take treatment.  However, he presented no material to
show that there was a treatment programme available that would
meet the appellant&#146;s needs.  In view of the many previous
unsuccessful attempts at treatment, there was a heavy onus on the
appellant and her counsel to address that issue.  It was not
sufficient for counsel to simply disagree with the opinion of the
pre-sentence reporter.
[21] Second, the question of risk to the community was a serious
concern.  Risk to the community within the meaning of s. 742.1 of
the Criminal Code is not limited to offences against the person.
Without treatment there was a substantial likelihood that the
appellant would commit drug and other offences to maintain her
addiction.  I also have some concern whether it could be said
that the appellant did not represent a danger to her child or
other children at the time of sentencing.  Again, without
treatment, there was still a risk that the appellant might expose
her child or Mr. W.&#146;s other children to dangerous drugs.
[22] However, there was a further error in principle that, in my
view, requires this court to consider the fitness of the sentence
in light of the fresh evidence.  The trial judge erred in
principle in placing emphasis only on the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation. A first sentence of imprisonment
especially for a first offender should be as short as possible
and tailored to the individual circumstances of the accused
rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence:  R. v.
Vandale and Maciejewski (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 250 (Ont. C.A.).
[23] As pointed out, this appellant had no prior criminal record
and rehabilitation should have been one of the principal
considerations.  It was inappropriate to reject the objective of
rehabilitation simply because the appellant had previously tried
treatment programmes before and failed, even when treatment was a
term of her bail.  I agree with Professor Manson&#146;s comments in
his article &#147;Conditional Sentences:  Courts of Appeal Debate the
Principles&#148; (1998), 15 C.R. (5th) 176 at 194:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Courts must accept that most hard core addicts who do
          succeed in overcoming addiction will try and fail a number of
          times.  Accordingly, the first occasion of failure should not
          necessarily be viewed as an affront to the court which leads to
          re-instituting the term of imprisonment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[24] Although this was said in relation to breach of a
conditional sentence order, it also applies to determining the
length and manner of sentence.  Accepting that at the time of
sentencing, the appellant had not made out a case for a
conditional sentence, the trial judge had to consider the
appropriate blend of sentence options then available.  A period
of imprisonment followed by a lengthy period of probation
directed to ensuring that the appellant received the appropriate
treatment would have offered the best prospect for rehabilitation
and thus protection of the public including the protection of the
appellant&#146;s child.  Imposing a shorter term of imprisonment would
also be consistent with the objective of denunciation, which was,
as I have said, an important consideration.
[25] In view of these errors in principle, this court must assess
the fitness of the sentence, bearing in mind the fresh evidence.
In my view, it would not be appropriate to impose a conditional
sentence at this point.  The appellant has now spent almost nine
months of the sentence in prison.  She is agreeable to taking
treatment for her addiction in the community and has put forward
a concrete plan to that end.  She has some support in the
community from David W. and the Metro Addiction Assessment
Referral Service.  It appears that her child is receiving
excellent care in the foster family and may soon be placed for
adoption.  The appropriate disposition at this point, in my view,
is to reduce the sentence to time served and impose a lengthy
period of probation.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[26] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow
the appeal and reduce the sentence to time served and three years
probation on the statutory terms and the following additional
terms:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.        Report to a probation officer within two working days
          of her release from custody and thereafter when required by the
          probation officer;
2.        Abstain from the consumption of drugs except in
	  accordance with a medical prescription;
3.        Abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon; and
4.        Participate actively in a treatment programme as
	  recommended by Margaret Flower or such other person at the Metro
	  Addiction Assessment Referral Service as designated by Ms.
	  Flower.
