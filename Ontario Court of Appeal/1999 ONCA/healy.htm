</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice H. Spiegel dated May
15, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The central question in this appeal is whether the
reciprocal scheme for the enforcement of motor vehicle liability
insurance policies across Canada requires a participating
American insurer to pay no-fault benefits to its insured as it
would if it were a licensed Ontario insurer.
[2]  In a comprehensive decision reported at (1998), 40 O.R. (3d)
270 (Gen. Div.), H. Spiegel J. answered this question in the
affirmative.  For the reasons that follow, I agree.
[3]  The relevant facts are straightforward.  The insured Healy
is a resident of New York State.  On November 8, 1996 he was a
passenger in a motor vehicle that was involved in an accident in
Thunder Bay, Ontario.  The vehicle was driven by David Blake and
owned by Lamsar Mechanical Contractors Limited.  It was insured
by the respondent Guardian Insurance Company.  Guardian is
licensed to provide automobile insurance in Ontario.
[4]  Healy was the named insured in a policy of automobile
insurance issued by the appellant Interboro Mutual Indemnity
Insurance Company.  Interboro is licensed to provide automobile
insurance in New York State but not in Ontario.  The vehicle
insured by this policy was in New York at the time of the
accident.
[5]  As a result of the filing of a Power of Attorney and
Undertaking (&quot;PAU&quot;) in 1964, Interboro is a participant in the
reciprocal scheme that exists in Canada for the enforcement of
provincial motor vehicle insurance obligations.
[6]  Unfortunately, Healy suffered serious injuries in the
accident.  All parties agree that these injuries entitle him to
receive Statutory Accident Benefits (SABS) as set out in the
Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule to the Automobile Insurance
Rates Stability Act, S.O. 1996, c. 21.  These no-fault benefits,
which are deemed by s. 268(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. I.8, as amended, to be provided for in every Ontario motor
vehicle liability policy, significantly exceed the limited no-
fault coverage provided to Healy in the Interboro policy.
[7]  The dispute is whether the SABS to which Mr. Healy is
entitled must be paid by Guardian or Interboro.  If Interboro can
assert the defence that its policy does not provide for the
payment of SABS, then under the Insurance Act, Guardian must pay.
[8]  Central to the resolution of this dispute is the reciprocal
scheme to which I referred and in which Interboro is a
participant.
[9]  In Potts v. Gluckstein (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 556 (C.A.),
Blair J.A. described the scheme and its purpose as follows at
pp. 557-58:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The reciprocal scheme is based upon a power of attorney
          and undertaking filed by each participating motor vehicle insurer
          with the superintendent of insurance of British Columbia.  He
          accepts the filing on behalf of the superintendents of insurance
          in the other provinces and territories, and sends copies to them.
          They are authorized to accept service on behalf of the insurer
          with respect to an action against it or its insured arising out
          of a motor vehicle accident in their respective jurisdictions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The reciprocal scheme provides a
          uniform basis for the enforcement of motor
          vehicle insurance claims in Canada.  This
          ensures that a person who has entered into a
          motor vehicle insurance contract in one
          province is recognized as insured in other
          provinces.  In the event of an accident, the
          insurer agrees to be bound by the law of the
          province or territory where the action is
          brought and not the province where the policy
          is issued.  The insurer also accepts
          liability to the limits prescribed in its
          policy or, at least, to the minimum limits
          established in the province or territory
          where the action is brought.  The scheme is
          open to participation by United States
          insurers.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant raised three arguments on this appeal:
     </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  The reciprocal scheme is not triggered unless, when the
          insured was injured, his insured vehicle was in Ontario.
     </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  The PAU filed by Interboro under the reciprocal
          scheme does not provide for the payment of SABS.
     </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  Because of subsequent legislative changes, the PAU
          filed by Interboro in 1964 is no longer in force in
          Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[11] I turn first to the appellant's argument that in the
circumstances of this case its obligations under the PAU are not
triggered.  In 1964, Interboro joined the reciprocal scheme by
filing a PAU that has remained in place ever since.  It reads as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               POWER OF ATTORNEY AND UNDERTAKING
          </pre>

          the United States of America hereby, with
          respect to an action or proceeding against it
          or its insured, or its insured and another or
          others, arising out a motor-vehicle accident
          in any of the respective Provinces or
          Territories appoints severally the
          superintendents of Insurance of British
          Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba,

          Island and Newfoundland, the director of the
          Motor Vehicle Bureau of Quebec, the
          Commissioners of Yukon territory and the
          Northwest Territories, or such official as
          may from time to time be designated by the
          Province or Territories concerned, to do and
          execute all or any of the following acts,
          deeds, and things, that is to say: To accept
          service of notice or process on its behalf.

               has been instituted and of which it has
               knowledge:

    <pre>               B.   . . .

               vehicle liability insurance contract entered
               into by it, which might not be set up if the
               contract had been entered into in and in
               accordance with the law relating to motor-
               vehicle liability insurance contracts of the
               Province or Territory of Canada in which such
               action or proceeding may be instituted, and
               to satisfy any final judgment rendered
               against it or its insured by a Court in such
               Province or Territory, in the claim, action

                         minimum for which a contract
                         of motor-vehicle liability
                         insurance may be entered into
                         in such Province or Territory
                         of Canada, exclusive of
                         interest and costs and subject
                         to any priorities as to bodily
                         injury or property damage with
                         respect to such minimum limit
                         or limits as may be fixed by
                         the Province or Territory.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         D.   . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[12] The appellant submits that this PAU should be interpreted in
light of the legislative context of 1964.  At that time, the
legislation required all motor vehicles driven in Ontario to have
liability insurance but no-fault benefits were not part of
mandatory coverage.  The appellant says that given the context in
which it was filed, the PAU must be read to address only the
circumstances where the vehicle insured by the offshore insurer
is in Ontario and exposed to a possible liability claim.
[13] The answer to this argument is that the terms of the PAU
nowhere limit its operation to circumstances where the vehicle
insured by Interboro is in Ontario.   Nor do those terms confine
the PAU to the kinds of claims that were permitted under Ontario
law at the time of the filing in 1964.  Rather, those terms
suggest that the PAU was intended to have not just a fleeting
effect, but a prospective reach to Ontario law as it may develop.
It is clear that, at the time of the accident in 1996, the named
insured in a motor vehicle policy issued in Ontario was entitled
to receive SABS under that policy as a result of a motor vehicle
accident even if the automobile insured under the Ontario policy
was not involved in the accident because it was not at the time
in the jurisdiction where the accident occurred: see s. 268(1)
and (2) of the Insurance Act and Prasad v. Gan Canada Insurance
Co. (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.).
[14] Moreover, the outcome urged by the appellant would be
inconsistent with the purpose of the reciprocal scheme.  To
paraphrase the description of Blair J.A. in Potts, supra, a
participating insurer agrees to be bound by the law concerning
compulsory automobile insurance coverage of the province where
the action against it is brought rather than the automobile
insurance coverage of the state or province where its policy is
issued.  In return, a participating insurer can assure those
persons whom it insures that they will be recognized as being
validly insured when driving in other participating
jurisdictions.  It assures the same statutory guarantees to
someone injured in an automobile accident in Ontario whether the
relevant automobile insurance contract was made in Ontario or
another participating jurisdiction.
[15] To limit this scheme, either by requiring that the vehicle
insured by the out-of-province insurer be in Ontario at the time
of the accident, or that the out-of-province insurer be required
to respond only to a liability claim, would frustrate the purpose
of the reciprocal scheme.  Specifically, it would disadvantage
those insured with participating out-of-province insurers
compared to those insured by Ontario insurers.
[16] Hence, I conclude that the vehicle covered by the Interboro
policy need not be in Ontario for the PAU to be triggered.
[17] The appellant's second argument is that its obligations
under the PAU are circumscribed by the phrase &quot;motor vehicle
liability insurance contract&quot; in paragraph C of the PAU.  The
appellant says that it is only in actions under such a contract
that Interboro has agreed to limit its defences, and that this
phrase should be read to mean &quot;motor vehicle liability policy&quot; as
defined in the Insurance Act thereby restricting the limitation
on defences to liability coverage.  Hence it is said there is no
limitation on Interboro's defences to a no-fault claim, including
an insured's claim for no-fault benefits such as SABS.
[18] In my opinion, Potts, supra provides a complete answer to
this argument.  In that case, Blair J.A. decided that the
reciprocal scheme required a participating out-of-province
insurer, in that case ICBC, to provide the uninsured automobile
coverage mandated to be a part of the standard Ontario motor
vehicle insurance contract even though such coverage was not
required in its home jurisdiction.  He put his conclusion this
way at p. 560:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Second and most important, ICBC in its undertaking
          agreed not to raise a &quot;defence&quot;, which was not available in
          Ontario, by denying coverage mandated by the Act.  The denial of
          liability by ICBC with respect to an uninsured automobile, is a
          &quot;defence&quot; within the meaning of the undertaking. In reaching this
          conclusion, I agree with and approve the interpretation placed
          upon the word &quot;defence&quot; in the undertaking by the Divisional
          Court in Schrader v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. [59
          O.R. (2d) 178, 37 D.L.R. (4th) 120 (Div. Ct.)]. J. Holland J.,
          speaking for the court, said at p. 182 O.R., p. 123 D.L.R.:
               </pre>
    <pre>                         It will be seen that the section
               clearly dealt with any defence.  This would
               include any defence that the policy did not
               include coverages or limits mandated by the
               Ontario Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis is Holland J.'s]</pre>
    <pre>[19] In this case, the PAU equally precludes Interboro from
asserting the defence that its policy does not include SABS
coverage given that this coverage is mandated by s. 268(1) of the
Insurance Act to be a part of the standard Ontario policy.  This
result serves the &quot;level playing field&quot; objective of the
reciprocal scheme.
[20] The appellant's third argument is that the 1964 PAU is no
longer in force in Ontario for either of two reasons.  First,
Interboro says that Ontario effectively dropped out of the
reciprocal scheme in 1970 when it repealed the financial
responsibility provisions of the Highway Traffic Act with the
result that for the next ten years, those insured with out-of-
province insurers were arguably not required to be able to
demonstrate satisfactory insurance when driving their vehicles in
Ontario.  Hence it is argued, for that ten years Interboro and
its insureds got nothing in return for Interboro's undertaking
concerning Ontario law.
[21] In my view, this argument is flawed.  The Interboro PAU
(which on its face extends to Ontario proceedings) was filed in
1964 and has never been withdrawn or modified.  This alone would
be enough to conclude that the Interboro obligation set out in
the PAU has remained alive throughout for Ontario proceedings.
[22] In addition, it is conceded by Interboro that for a number
of provinces the PAU has remained a necessity without
interruption.  The reciprocal scheme which Interboro joined in
1964 must be viewed as a single national scheme rather than a
series of separate provincial schemes.  The undertaking made by
the appellant in 1964 has provided significant and continuous
benefit to its insureds who drove their vehicles in Canada.  This
benefit remained even if it did not apply in Ontario for a period
of time. There is no reason to find any interruption in
Interboro's obligations undertaken in the PAU including those
applicable to Ontario.
[23] Alternatively, the appellant says that the passage of the
Automobile Rates Stability Act, S.O. 1996, c. 21 (effective
November 1, 1996) renders the 1964 PAU functus.  This legislation
permits an out-of-province insurer to file with Ontario
authorities an undertaking of equivalent coverage when the
insured automobile is operated in Ontario.  This filing entitles
the insurer to rely on certain specified defences not available
to out-of-province insurers who do not file such an undertaking.
[24] In my view, this submission is also flawed.  There is
nothing in the 1996 legislation that expressly negates the 1964
PAU.  Nor is that achieved by necessary implication.  The
undertaking permitted by the 1996 act is not mandatory.  An out-
of-province insurer may decline to file such an undertaking.
Moreover, at the date of the accident in this case Interboro had
not done so.  I can see no basis for concluding that the 1996
legislation renders the 1964 PAU ineffective.
[25] In summary, I conclude that the 1964 PAU was in force on
November 8, 1996 and applies to the circumstances of this
accident.  Because of its undertaking, the appellant is obliged
by s. 268(2), para. (1), to pay SABS to its insured Mr. Healy.
It cannot raise a defence to this claim that it could not raise
if its contract with Mr. Healy was validly entered into in
Ontario.
[26] The appeal must be dismissed with costs.  Although Mr. Healy
appeared on this appeal, no submissions were made on his behalf
and he should be accorded no award of costs.
