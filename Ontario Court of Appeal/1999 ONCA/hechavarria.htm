    <pre>[1]  The appellant argues that the wording of the charge
screening form creates an appearance of injustice given the plea
of guilty to two charges rather than one.  We do not agree.
There is no suggestion that the appellant relied in any way on
the charge screening form or its particular contents.  While the
written portion of the form might have been expressed more
clearly, there is no doubt in our minds that the system of
justice and those affected by it regard charge screening forms as
speaking to resolution at an early stage of the proceedings.
That did not happen here.  Hence, there is no appearance of
injustice.
[2]  The appellant's second argument is that the plea of guilty
in these particular circumstances required a further inquiry by
the trial judge.  Again, we disagree.  Through duty counsel the
appellant admitted the truth of the facts essential to sustain
the charge.  We think that the trial judge was entitled to accept
this admission and indeed to treat this as the appellant's final
position on the material facts despite his contrary testimony on
a prior occasion, particularly where there is no evidence that
the appellant misunderstood his plea or its effect.
[3]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
