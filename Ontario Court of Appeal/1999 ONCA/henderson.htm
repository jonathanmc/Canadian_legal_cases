</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Flinn J. with a jury, dated June
13, 1995.

</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault by a court
composed of Flinn J. and a jury.  He was sentenced to three
years' imprisonment.  He appeals both his conviction and his
sentence.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant raises four substantive issues with respect to
this appeal:
     1.   The improper and unfair cross-examination of the
          appellant;</pre>
    <pre>     2.   The use that could be made of the spray-painted words
          on the appellant's trailer;</pre>
    <pre>     3.   The failure of the trial judge to put the defence
          position to the jury; and</pre>
    <pre>     4.   The trial judge's answer to the jury's request to
          rehear the complainant's testimony.</pre>
    <pre>The appellant also seeks to tender fresh evidence of matters
relating to the jury's deliberations.  It is common ground
between the parties that, according to the existing common law
and statutory principles respecting the secrecy of jury
deliberations (&quot;the jury secrecy rules&quot;), this evidence cannot be
admitted.  The appellant attacks the constitutionality of these
principles.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  I see no merit in issue number 3.  This was not a
complicated case and there can be no doubt that the jury would
have understood the position of the defence.  The trial judge
reviewed the positions of the Crown and the defence with respect
to the specific issues and reviewed the evidence in support of
these positions.  None of the alleged inadequacies complained of
by the appellant would have affected the verdict.  However,
issues 1, 2 and 4 all have merit and each ground on its own would
result in a new trial.  As the conviction must be set aside,  the
constitutionality of the jury secrecy rules, which was argued
together with the appeal in R. v. Pan (released with this
judgment), need not be addressed for reasons which will be stated
in the disposition of this appeal.
[1]  THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant and the complainant met for the first time at
a party on the evening of May 7, 1993.  They socialized with each
other and other persons present at the party.  In the early hours
of May 8, the complainant drove the appellant to his residence in
a trailer park.</pre>
    <pre>     i) the complainant's evidence</pre>
    <pre>[5]  According to the complainant, the appellant asked her to
drive him home because he was too intoxicated to drive his car.
She agreed.  Once they arrived at his trailer, the appellant
invited the complainant inside for a drink.  When she declined,
he took her car keys out of the ignition of her car and went into
the trailer.  She entered the trailer to retrieve her keys.  He
tried to hug her and kiss her and she resisted him.  Eventually,
he forced himself upon her and sexually assaulted her, including
sexual intercourse.  During the assault, he was angry and was
yelling and swearing at her.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As the complainant left the trailer, the appellant asked her
for a ride back to the party so that he could retrieve his car.
She agreed to drive him because she did not want him to get angry
and yell at her again.  When they arrived at the party, she went
inside to see her best friend N.L..  The complainant
was crying and shaking and walked directly into a bedroom because
she did not want the others to see her.  She was sore from the
struggle with the appellant and her inner thighs were bruised.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The complainant did not seek medical attention and did not
report the incident to the police.
</pre>
    <pre>     ii) the appellant's evidence</pre>
    <pre>[8]  According to the appellant, he and the complainant agreed to
leave the party together.  They arranged that he would tell the
others that he was too drunk to drive and that she would give him
a ride to his trailer.  When they arrived at his trailer, they
listened to music, had a drink and talked.   Eventually, they had
consensual sexual intercourse.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  When the complainant left, the appellant asked her for a
ride back to the party in order to retrieve his car and she
agreed.  After they arrived, the complainant went inside to see
N.L..  He waited for the complainant to come back out
because he wanted to get her phone number.  He then decided to go
inside and  N.L. said to him, &quot;you know what you did&quot;
and tried to hit him with a beer bottle.  He did not know why
N.L. had been hostile towards him.</pre>
    <pre>[10] It was the appellant's position that the complainant had
fabricated the sexual assault complaint so that her boyfriend
would not discover that she had been unfaithful.</pre>
    <pre>     iii) other evidence</pre>
    <pre>[11] There was evidence from persons present at the party with
respect to comments allegedly made by the appellant, which was
capable of supporting the complainant's version of events.</pre>
    <pre>     iv) the mischief</pre>
    <pre>[12] Approximately three months after the incident, the
complainant and  N.L. decided to spray-paint the
appellant's trailer.  The words &quot;You Rapest&quot; [sic] were spray-
painted on the side of the trailer.  Upon discovering the
mischief, the appellant contacted the police and their
investigation led them to the complainant and N.L.   At
that time, the complainant denied any involvement in the mischief
and alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by the
appellant.   N.L., who had done the actual spray-
painting, eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of mischief.  The
complainant was not charged as a result of this incident.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUE 1: THE IMPROPER AND UNFAIR CROSS-EXAMINATION
           OF THE APPELLANT</pre>
    <pre>[13] Counsel for the appellant alleges that Crown counsel&#146;s cross-
examination of the appellant was improper and unfair.  He points
to four incidents in support of this submission.  I have reviewed
the record of the cross-examination and I am satisfied that the
Crown's conduct seriously prejudiced the appellant in his
defence.  Moreover, the trial judge did nothing at any time to
alleviate the potential prejudice resulting from the cross-
examination.</pre>
    <pre>     i) Questions Regarding the Complainant's Credibility</pre>
    <pre>[14] The first incident involved questions by Crown counsel that
effectively forced the appellant to comment on the complainant's
credibility.  At pp. 524-25 of the transcript the following
exchange took place between Crown counsel, defence counsel and
the appellant:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Sir, will you agree with me that if what
          [the complainant] told us about what happened
          at the time in the trailer is true, all the
          things that you have had to suffer since the
          phone calls and the spray painting and the
          graffiti in the bar, even if they're not
          right, they are understandable if what [the
          complainant] says is true?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don't understand your question.</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   If what [the complainant] described in
          her evidence before this jury under cross-
          examination is true, then all these
          subsequent events that have been following
          you; the phone calls, the spray painting and
          the graffiti, are at least understandable,
          are they not?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I still don't understand your question.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   They're consistent with someone's
          actions who have been raped?</pre>
    <pre>          [Defence counsel]:  That's not . . .</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You'll agree with me, will you not . . .
          .</pre>
    <pre>          [Defence counsel]:  That's not a matter that
          anyone could answer, Your Honour.</pre>
    <pre>          A. [the appellant]: I don't think I'm in that
          position to say.  If she felt she'd been
          raped, why didn't she come forward that
          night?</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well  . . .</pre>
    <pre>          [Defence counsel]:  I say these are all
                         improper questions.</pre>
    <pre>          A. [the appellant]: I don't -- I don't
          understand.</pre>
    <pre>          [Crown counsel]:    There's nothing improper,
          sir.</pre>
    <pre>          [Defence counsel]:  Oh, if  . . .</pre>
    <pre>          [Crown counsel]:    If you're having some
          difficulty saying to this court that if a
          girl was raped, it would be understandable
          that she might be angry and her friends might
          be angry and you might have some -- the
          rapist, alleged, might have some actions
          taken against him?  Are you having some
          difficulty saying that?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   No, I'm just not following where -- what
          your question is.</pre>
    <pre>          . . .
</pre>
    <pre>[15] Crown counsel's questioning required the appellant to
provide an alternate explanation for the complainant's behaviour
that was not premised on his guilt.  Such an explanation would
have required the appellant to either comment upon the
complainant's credibility or to give an opinion that he was
clearly not qualified to give, explaining why her conduct was
inconsistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted.
Clearly questions of this nature are improper and unfair.  This
Court has on numerous occasions disapproved of such questions:
see, for instance, R v. Vandenburge (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 371 at
372-3 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>     ii) Questions Regarding the Appellant's Reputation</pre>
    <pre>[16] The second incident involved questions regarding the
appellant's reputation in the community.  At pp. 521-22 of the
transcript this exchange occurred:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Now I take it particularly from the last
          few questions my friend has asked you, but
          there has been quite a public opinion
          campaign waged against you between May and
          August 22nd, is that correct?  There'd been
          graffiti on trailer; in fact, you said two
          times when you spoke to the police?</pre>
    <pre>           A.  That's right.
</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And I take it, certainly from your
          attitude today, that you were probably upset
          and to a certain extent, rightfully so, that
          this public opinion war was going, is that
          correct?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I was annoyed.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And there was a fair bit of talk.  It
          was a small community and there was a fair
          bit of talk, wasn't there?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   In certain circles.</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well, I'm going to suggest to you that
          after this -- after the graffiti in the
          washroom and the spray painting of your
          trailer and the rumours that were going
          around, it must have come as something of a
          relief to you when you were put in the
          position of having to call the police, didn't
          you.  This would finally get cleared up.</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>[17] Crown counsel's reference to the &quot;public opinion campaign&quot;
against the appellant, her suggestion that there had been a &quot;fair
bit of talk&quot; about him, and her remarks about &quot;the rumours that
were going around&quot; were all unfair and prejudicial.   The
appellant had not put his character in issue and as such, Crown
counsel's insinuations that the appellant's reputation in the
community had been adversely affected were irrelevant and clearly
improper: see R v. Hill (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 314 at 321 (Ont.
C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>     iii) Questions Regarding the Alleged Violation of the Rule
     in Browne v. Dunn</pre>
    <pre>[18] The third allegation of improper and unfair questioning by
Crown counsel involved the rule set out in Browne v. Dunn (1893),
6 R. 67 at 70-71 (H.L.).  This well-known rule stands for the
proposition that if counsel is going to challenge the credibility
of a witness by calling contradictory evidence, the witness must
be given the chance to address the contradictory evidence in
cross-examination while he or she is in the witness-box.  In her
cross-examination of the appellant at pp. 529-30, Crown counsel
sought an explanation from the appellant for defence counsel's
alleged violation of the rule in Browne v. Dunn:
</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Now, you'll agree with me, sir, that all
          through the Crown's case, all the evidence
          was that [the complainant] was crying on the
          drive back to your car on May 8th, that she
          was crying when she ran into Greg Chute's;
          that she was shaking, her face was puffy, and
          you'll agree with me, sir, that that was
          never challenged in cross-examination at all.
          None of those witnesses were challenged on
          that cross-examination, were they?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   Well, what you said first there that she
          was crying in the car.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   That was her evidence.  It was not
          challenged on cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   She didn't cry in the car.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well, sir, I'm asking you to answer my
          question.  I'm asking you, was she challenged
          on that in cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   You're asking me about a specific point
          of law and . . .</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   No, sir, I'm asking you about the
          evidence.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   Um hmm.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Was she ever, in cross-examination
          challenged on whether or not she was crying
          as she was driving back to your car?  I
          submit to you that she wasn't, was she?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don't believe so.
</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   [Defence counsel] never suggested to her
          that she hadn't been crying, did he?
          [Defence counsel] never suggested to any of
          the other witnesses who saw her running in,
          that she wasn't crying and upset, did he?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don't recall, no.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And you're saying now -- and none of
          this has ever been put to any of the Crown
          witnesses -- you're giving a totally
          different version, sir.  Can you tell me when
          it is that you arrived at this version?</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>[19] The failure of defence counsel to cross-examine the
complainant or the Crown witnesses on these issues did not
constitute a breach of  the rule in Browne v. Dunn.  It was clear
from defence counsel's extensive cross-examination of the
complainant that the appellant was alleging an account of events
which contradicted the complainant's.  The defence was not
required to put the Crown on notice of every detail that the
defence did not accept: see R. v. Verney (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d)
363 at 375-76 (Ont.C.A.).  As such, Crown counsel's questions
implying that the appellant had somehow acted improperly in his
defence were unfair.  Furthermore, Crown counsel's suggestions
that the appellant was responsible for the tactical decisions of
his trial counsel to not cross-examine the Crown witnesses were
unfair and prejudicial.</pre>
    <pre>     iv) Questions Regarding the Appellant's Plea</pre>
    <pre>[20] The fourth incident deals with the cross-examination of the
appellant on his plea to the charge.  When the appellant was
asked to enter his plea, he pleaded &quot;Innocent&quot;.  This plea was
immediately corrected by his counsel to &quot;Not Guilty&quot;.  During
cross-examination, after the appellant conceded to Crown counsel
that he had entered pleas in court on previous occasions, the
following exchange occurred:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And you knew perfectly well, only
          because of that, sir, that the pleas in this
          court are either guilty or not guilty,
          correct?  Correct?  You had done it twice
          before.  Isn't that so?  You know that the
          proper pleas are guilty or not guilty?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I haven't been in court that often, but
          I'm not sure what you're getting at.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well, you just have to answer . . .</pre>
    <pre>          [Defence counsel]:  I don't even know myself.</pre>
    <pre>          [Crown counsel]:    Now, please, Counsel, you
          just have to answer the question.  You know
          the proper pleas are guilty or not guilty,
          isn't that so?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   No I don't.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You entered those pleas on the two prior
          occasions relating to this very matter,
          correct?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I think I was told by my lawyer at any
          given time what I was to say.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well, sir, you were aware, I put it to
          you, that it was a little bit of showmanship
          when you stood up on Wednesday and instead of
          entering one of the pleas that you are to
          enter, when you were asked, you said
          &quot;Innocent&quot;.  It was a bit of showmanship,
          wasn't it?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don't think so.</pre>
    <pre>          . . .</pre>
    <pre>[21] On my reading of the transcript, it seems more likely that
the irregular plea was the result of an honest mistake.  In any
event, this portion of Crown counsel's cross-examination served
no relevant purpose but to embarrass the appellant in front of
the jury.  As such, these questions were also unfair and
improper.</pre>
    <pre>     Role of Crown Counsel</pre>
    <pre>[22] The effect of Crown counsel's conduct must be assessed in
light of the fundamental role of Crown counsel during a criminal
trial.  Crown counsel's role within the criminal justice system
is unique.  In addition to  responsibilities as a public
advocate, Crown counsel also serves in a quasi-judicial capacity.
In R. v. Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 12 (S.C.C.),
Sopinka J. highlighted this aspect of the Crown's role:  &quot;The
tradition of Crown counsel in this country in carrying out their
role as 'ministers of justice' and not as adversaries has
generally been very high.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[23] The classic articulation of Crown counsel's role was set out
in R v. Boucher (1954), 110 C.C.C. 263 at 270 (S.C.C.) where Rand
J. stated:</pre>
    <pre>          It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose
          of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a
          conviction; it is to lay before a jury what
          the Crown considers to be credible evidence
          relevant to what is alleged to be a crime.
          Counsel have a duty to see that all available
          legal proof of the facts is presented:  it
          should be done firmly and pressed to its
          legitimate strength, but it must also be done
          fairly.  The role of prosecutor excludes any
          notion of winning or losing; his function is
          a matter of public duty than which in civil
          life there can be none charged with greater
          personal responsibility.  It is to be
          efficiently performed with an ingrained sense
          of the dignity, the seriousness and the
          justness of judicial proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>In Boucher, Taschereau J. added the following comments which were
cited with approval by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Sweitlinski, [1994] 3
S.C.R. 481 at 494-95:</pre>
    <pre>          [Translation]  The position held by counsel
          for the Crown is not that of a lawyer in
          civil litigation.  His functions are quasi-
          judicial.  His duty is not so much to obtain
          a conviction as to assist the judge and jury
          in ensuring that the fullest possible justice
          is done.  His conduct before the court must
          always be characterized by moderation and
          impartiality.  He will have properly
          performed his duty and will be beyond all
          reproach if eschewing any appeal to passion,
          and employing a dignified manner suited to
          his function, he presents the evidence to the
          jury without going beyond what it discloses.</pre>
    <pre>[24] In this case, the performance of defence counsel (not
counsel on appeal) was not a model of advocacy.  On the contrary,
he was at times provoking, defiant and argumentative and his
questioning of witnesses was difficult to follow and
unnecessarily lengthy.  Such conduct on the part of defence
counsel should not be condoned and should be addressed by the
trial judge.  However, even when, as in this case, the trial
judge fails to intervene, improper conduct by defence counsel
does not justify improper conduct by Crown counsel.  In all
circumstances, regardless of defence counsel's behaviour, Crown
counsel should remain scrupulously fair.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Generally, Crown counsel perform all aspects of their
functions honourably and fairly, and in most cases the
respectable conduct of Crown counsel undoubtedly enhances public
confidence in the criminal justice system.  To this extent, I
note the comments made by Cory J. in R. v. Bain (1992), 69 C.C.C.
(3d) 481 (S.C.C.) where he states:  &quot;[a]s a rule the conduct and
competence of Crown Attorneys is exemplary.  They are models for
the Bar and the community.&quot;   The efforts of Crown counsel are
particularly admirable given their significant case loads and
considerable resource restrictions.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Notwithstanding the overall commendable conduct of  Crown
counsel,  in recent years, there appear to have been a number of
appeals based upon improper Crown counsel conduct during cross-
examinations and jury addresses: see, for example, R. v. Peavoy
(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (C.A.); R. v. Munroe (1995) 96 C.C.C.
(3d) 431 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Nugent (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 295
(C.A.); and R. v. R.(A.J.) (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 168 (Ont.
C.A.).  Unfortunately, this Court's message that improper conduct
by Crown counsel will not be tolerated has not always been
heeded.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The line between Crown counsel conduct that is merely
inappropriate and conduct that is so prejudicial that it deprives
the accused of a fair trial is not easily drawn: see R. v. Daly
(1992), 57 O.A.C. 70 and R. v. Yakeleya (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d)
193 (Ont. C.A.).  This line is particularly difficult to draw in
cases that essentially turn on the credibility of Crown and
defence witnesses.  In such cases, there often appears to be a
temptation to cross the line in an effort to attack the
credibility of a witness.  The prejudice that results is not
easily measured.  Respect for the administration of justice is
not enhanced where the courts appear to condone improper conduct.
In my opinion, the preservation of the criminal justice system
requires that appellate courts focus on the classic role of Crown
counsel when reviewing allegedly improper Crown counsel conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[28] I recognize that in the midst of a cross-examination of the
accused, the dual roles of Crown counsel as both an advocate and
a minister of justice  may not appear easily reconciled.
However, it is appropriate to keep in mind the comments of Cory
J.A. in R. v. Logiacco (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 374 at 383-84
(Ont.C.A.), where he said:  &quot;There is no reason why a cross-
examination cannot be conducted by a Crown prosecutor with some
measure of respect for a witness which would not be inconsistent
with a skilful, probing and devastating cross-examination.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[29] The impact of  Crown counsel's improper conduct in this case
must also be assessed in light of this Court's decision in R. v.
R. (A.J.), supra, where Doherty J.A., while acknowledging that
Crown counsel is entitled to vigorously cross-examine the
accused, adds the following qualifications:</pre>
    <pre>          There are, however, well-established limits
          on cross-examination.  Some apply to all
          witnesses, others only to the accused.
          Isolated transgressions of those limits may
          be of little consequence on appeal.  Repeated
          improprieties during the cross-examination of
          an accused are, however, a very different
          matter.  As the improprieties mount, the
          cross-examination may cross over the line
          from the aggressive to the abusive.  When
          that line is crossed, the danger of a
          miscarriage of justice is very real.  If
          improper cross-examination of an accused
          prejudices that accused in his defence or is
          so improper as to bring the administration of
          justice into disrepute, an appellate court
          must intervene.</pre>
    <pre>[30] Counsel for the Crown on appeal characterized the cross-
examination of the appellant as &quot;imperfect&quot;.  In my view this
characterization does not go far enough.  Crown counsel's conduct
during cross-examination, viewed in its totality and with regard
to the obligation on Crown counsel to act in a scrupulously fair
manner, crossed over the line and must be characterized as
improper and unfair.  While an isolated improper incident may not
be sufficient to impugn the verdict, in the present case, the
cumulative effect of the improprieties in the cross-examination
of the appellant resulted in serious prejudice.  In total, the
cross-examination of the appellant was only 23 pages.  The cross-
examination did not assist the jury to understand the real issues
in the case and was not a proper test of the reliability or
credibility of the appellant's defence.  The four incidents that
have been reviewed covered a substantial portion of the total
cross-examination.  Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of Crown
counsel's cross-examination was in no way diffused by the trial
judge.</pre>
    <pre>     Failure of  the Trial Judge to Comment Upon Remarks
     Made by Crown Counsel</pre>
    <pre>[31] The duty upon the trial judge to ensure an accused receives
a fair trial is undisputed.  In Brouillard v. The Queen (1985),
17 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 196 (S.C.C.), Lamer J. makes the following
comments regarding the role of the trial judge:</pre>
    <pre>           ...[J]udges are no longer required to be as
          passive as they once were; to be what I call
          sphinx judges.  We now not only accept that a
          judge may intervene in the adversarial
          debate, but also believe that it is sometimes
          essential for him to do so for justice in
          fact to be done.</pre>
    <pre>In support of this contention, Lamer J. cites Lord Denning's
statement in Jones v. National Coal Board, [1957] 2 All E.R. 155
at 158-59: &quot;... a judge is not a mere umpire....  His object
above all is to find out the truth, and to do justice according
to law.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[32] It is a rare case where the prejudice that could otherwise
flow from an improper cross-examination cannot be effectively
checked by the trial judge.  At the first sign by either counsel
of questions which may lead to an improper cross-examination of a
witness, a well-placed comment by the trial judge or a more
explicit reminder in the absence of the jury of the proper role
of counsel has, in my experience, invariably nipped any problem
in the bud.  If not, other means are available to the trial judge
to assure the proper conduct of counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[33] Crown counsel's conduct during the cross-examination of the
appellant was sufficiently prejudicial to impose a legal duty on
the trial judge to intervene: see R .v Romeo (1991), 62 C.C.C.
(3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge never intervened, even when
requested to do so by defence counsel.  Nor did he say anything
in his charge to erase the prejudicial effect of Crown counsel's
improper questions and remarks.  This failure of the trial judge
to comment would have given the jury the misleading impression
that the cross-examination was fair and proper.  The improper
cross-examination compounded by the failure of the trial judge to
intervene clearly prejudiced the appellant in his defence and
resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUE 2: THE USE THAT COULD BE MADE OF THE SPRAY-PAINTED
           WORDS ON THE APPELLANT'S TRAILER</pre>
    <pre>[34] There is no dispute that the spray-painted words &quot;You
Rapest&quot; were prima facie inadmissible as evidence of a prior
consistent statement.  It is also not in dispute that if the
statement was admissible under an exception to the rule governing
the admission of prior consistent statements, it could not be
used to prove the truth of its contents.
[1]
[35] The rationale for the rule prohibiting the introduction of
prior consistent statements was articulated by this court in R.
v. Jones (1988), 44 C.C.C (3d) 248 (Ont. C.A.).  Goodman J.A.,
speaking for the court, stated at p. 255:</pre>
    <pre>               It is a general rule at common law that
          a witness may not be called to prove that
          another witness has previously made a
          statement asserting certain facts in order to
          prove the truth of those assertions.  That
          would offend the rule against hearsay.  Nor
          can a witness be called to prove that another
          witness has made a prior statement consistent
          with the evidence which such other witness
          gives at trial.  Such a prior statement falls
          within the category of self-serving evidence,
          which is easily fabricated and generally
          speaking is excluded on this basis or on the
          basis of the rule against self-corroboration.
          Evidence of a prior consistent statement made
          by a witness is generally speaking not
          admissible as evidence of the consistency of
          such a witness.</pre>
    <pre>[36] As a prior consistent statement, the spray-painted words
were inadmissible subject to two exceptions: for purposes of
rebutting recent fabrication and as part of the narrative.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Dealing with the first exception, in R. v. Garofoli (1988),
41 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) rev'd on other grounds (1990), 60
C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.), Martin J.A., speaking for this court,
stated at p. 145:</pre>
    <pre>          Where it is suggested that a witness has
          fabricated his testimony because of  some
          motive or influence, evidence that the
          witness made a similar statement before the
          alleged motive existed is admissible: see R
          v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C (2d) 6 (Ont.
          C.A.) [other citations omitted].</pre>
    <pre>[38] Although it is not always entirely clear from the lengthy
cross-examinations and the closing address of defence counsel, I
am satisfied that it was not the position of the defence that the
complainant fabricated the sexual assault in response to the
mischief investigation which occurred three months after the
incident.  Rather, the defence contended that the mischief
investigation merely prompted the complainant to report a sexual
assault which she had previously fabricated in order to prevent
her boyfriend from discovering she had been unfaithful.</pre>
    <pre>[39] It was undisputed that the complainant had alleged a sexual
assault had occurred when she spoke to N.L.  in the early
morning of May 8, 1993.  As the defence contended, the
fabrication was made, not recently, but a few hours after the
incident at the appellant's trailer and it cannot be maintained
that the admission of the spray-painted words &quot;You Rapest&quot; [sic]
was needed to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The only basis on which the spray-painted words were
admissible was as part of the narrative necessary to explain the
circumstances in which the police were contacted and the charges
were laid.  It would appear that the evidence was introduced as
such at trial and no objection was made to its admissibility.  As
succinctly stated by Finlayson J. A. in R. v. F.(J.E.) (1993), 85
C.C.C. (3d) 457 at 474:</pre>
    <pre>          However, narrative is justified as providing
          background to the story C to provide
          chronological cohesion and eliminate gaps
          which would divert the mind of the listener
          from the central issue.   It may be
          supportive of the central allegation in the
          sense of creating a logical framework for its
          presentation C but it cannot be used, and the
          jury must be warned of this, as confirmation
          of the sworn allegation.  [Emphasis added].
</pre>
    <pre>[41] As pointed out by Finlayson J.A., the jury must be warned
that the narrative evidence cannot be used as confirmation of the
truth of the complainant's allegation.  I agree: see also R. v.
Codina (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 311 at 330 (Ont. C.A.).  Not only
did the trial judge err in failing to give a limiting
instruction, he further erred in inviting the jury to find that
the spray-painted words could be used to support the
complainant's version of events.   The fact that N.L.,
with the concurrence of the complainant, had painted the
accusation on the trailer in no way made it more likely that the
allegation of a sexual assault was true.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The Crown properly conceded that a limiting instruction
should have been given, and in my view, a limiting instruction
was essential.  In a case where credibility was of paramount
importance, the absence of a limiting instruction together with
the instruction inviting the jury to find that the spray-painted
words supported the complainant's story were highly prejudicial
to the appellant.  The two errors combined &#150; the invitation to
make improper use of the statement and the failure to give a
limiting instruction &#150; amount to a reversible error and the
failure of defence counsel to object to this part of the charge
does not rectify these errors.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUE 4:  THE TRIAL JUDGE'S ANSWER TO THE JURY'S REQUEST
            TO REHEAR THE COMPLAINANT'S EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[43] Approximately three hours after commencing its deliberation,
the jury returned with a question which was correctly answered by
the trial judge and which is not in issue on appeal.  One hour
and fifteen minutes later (the jury had been deliberating for
four hours and fifteen minutes), the jury returned to report that
it was at an impasse.  The trial judge gave the jury a fair
exhortation and the jury retired to continue its deliberation.
At approximately 8:15 p.m. (the jury had been deliberating for
approximately nine hours), they returned again and made the
following request:</pre>
    <pre>          Is it possible for the jury to hear the
          testimony and cross-examination of [the
          complainant]?</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge answered the question as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Members of the jury, you have asked another
          question of the court.  The question is:</pre>
    <pre>          &quot;Is it possible for the jury to hear the
          testimony and cross-examination of [the
          complainant]?&quot;</pre>
    <pre>          The simple answer is, yes it is.  The
          difficult side of the answer is as follows:
          Her examination started on Thursday at
          about noon and continued through until Friday
          at 12:30 which means that the transcript, if
          you wanted to hear that, would take the
          better part of a day.</pre>
    <pre>               To have you hear the transcript, I am
          told by the court reporter that it doesn't
          function well in this room.  We have to set
          up the machinery in the small courtroom down
          the hall, which would take 15 to 20 minutes
          and you could then gather in that and hear
          the tapes.</pre>
    <pre>               If that was your choice, we would decide
          right now then, that you couldn't go home.
          You'd be sequestered overnight and have to
          stay here hearing all of those tapes and then
          go back to your deciding. Now, I thought with
          that information you should reconsider your
          question.  If there's some particular part of
          the testimony that perhaps counsel and I can
          recite to you from a combination of our
          notes, we'd be pleased to do that, but
          otherwise, you can appreciate it's a very
          time-consuming proposition and certainly not
          one convenient to you, but you're the boss.</pre>
    <pre>               If you would retire and consider what
          I've said, please.
</pre>
    <pre>[44] The jury retired again and returned an hour and a half later
with a verdict of &quot;guilty&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The jury asked to rehear all the evidence of the
complainant.   It was obviously concerned about the complainant's
evidence which was essentially the whole Crown's case.  The trial
judge told the jury it was possible but that it would take a long
time to rehear her evidence.  Having already heard the
complainant's evidence once, the jury no doubt knew how long it
would take to hear it again before making the request.  The trial
judge also told the jurors that they would not be able to go
home.  &quot;You'd be sequestered over night and you'd have to stay
here hearing all those tapes and then go back to your deciding.&quot;
[Emphasis added.]  The jurors may have been led to believe they
would have to remain in the court house overnight to hear the
tapes and then continue deliberating.   This court has
disapproved of juries being made to deliberate through the night:
see R. v. Kulak (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 30 (Ont. C.A.).  The trial
judge gave the jury the alternative of having some particular
part of the testimony reviewed from his notes and counsel's
notes, which the jury did not accept.  Finally, he told the jury
that their request was time-consuming and not convenient.</pre>
    <pre>[46] The importance of answering a question from the jury cannot
be overstated.  In R. v. S.(W.D.) (1995), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.), Cory J., speaking for the majority, dealt with the
significance and importance of questions from the jury.   At p.
6, he said:</pre>
    <pre>          It is true that directions to a jury must
          always be read as a whole; however, it cannot
          ever be forgotten that questions from the
          jury require careful consideration and must
          be
          clearly, correctly and comprehensively
          answered.  This is true for any number of
          reasons which have been expressed by this
          court on other occasions.  A question
          presented by a jury gives the clearest
          possible indication of the particular problem
          that the jury is confronting and upon which
          it seeks further instructions.  Even if the
          question relates to a matter that has been
          carefully reviewed in the main charge, it
          still must be answered in a complete and
          careful manner.  It may be that after a
          period of deliberation, the original
          instructions, no matter how exemplary they
          were, have been forgotten or some confusion
          has arisen in the minds of the jurors.  The
          jury must be given a full and proper response
          to their question.  The jury is entitled to
          no less.  It is the obligation of the trial
          judge assisted by counsel to make certain
          that the question is fully and properly
          answered.</pre>
    <pre>[47] In this case, the jury never got to rehear the complainant's
evidence: neither the whole of her evidence nor particular parts
of it.  The words of the trial judge may well have discouraged
the jury from rehearing and resolving whatever aspect of the
complainant's evidence it found troubling.  In my view, the trial
judge should have ensured that the jury's concerns were met and
that it received the assistance it required.  In effect, the jury
received no assistance from the trial judge with respect to its
request.</pre>
    <pre>[48] In a case which turned on the respective credibility of the
complainant and the accused, the trial judge's error was fatal
and the conviction cannot stand.
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[49] Ordinarily, the proper disposition of this appeal would be
to order a new trial.  However, this is not an ordinary
situation.</pre>
    <pre>[50] Before this court, the appellant has appealed both his
conviction and his sentence of three years' imprisonment.  His
conviction was the result of a second trial, a first having
resulted in a mistrial.  The appellant has already served two and
one-half years of the sentence imposed before he was released on
bail pending appeal.  With respect to the sentence appeal, the
Crown acknowledges that it would be appropriate to reduce the
sentence to time served.</pre>
    <pre>[51] It has been stated in numerous cases that a stay of
proceedings should be ordered only in the &quot;clearest of cases&quot;:
see R. v. Young (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v.
Burlingham (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 400 (S.C.C.).  This is
one of those cases.  The appellant has served two and one-half
years of his sentence and Crown counsel concedes that the
appellant should not be reincarcerated.  The appellant has had
two trials and a third trial is necessitated in part due to Crown
counsel's conduct.  In my view, it would offend the standard of
decency to require the appellant to proceed with a third trial
and a stay of proceedings is the appropriate disposition.</pre>
    <pre>[52] With respect to the issue of the constitutionality of the
jury secrecy rules, the most favourable result which the
appellant could expect if he were successful on that ground would
be a stay of proceedings of the charges against him.  As this
result has been achieved, nothing more could be gained by the
appellant and it is therefore not necessary to address this
issue. As such, I would dismiss the motion to tender fresh
evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[53] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
conviction and enter a stay of proceedings.
