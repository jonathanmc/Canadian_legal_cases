    <pre><b>GOUDGE J.A.:</b>

</pre>
    <pre>[1]       On December 8, 1997 the respondent Henry Heyink
Construction Ltd. pleaded guilty before a justice of the peace to
two charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. O.1. The fines imposed were $35,000 and $7,000
respectively. By automatic operation of s. 60.1 of the Provincial
Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 surcharges of twenty percent
were added to each fine. On appeal, a judge of the Ontario Court
(Provincial Division), taking account of the size of these
surcharges in all the circumstances of this case, reduced the
fines to $30,000 and $5,000 respectively. With leave the Crown
appealed to this court. After argument the appeal was dismissed
with reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[2]       In 1996 the respondent was a small family construction
company which had been hired by the City of Sarnia to install
fire hydrants on Lakeshore Road, in Sarnia. On July 31, 1996,
during that project, the boom of an excavator engaged in
positioning a fire hydrant came into contact with live overhead
wires.</pre>
    <pre>[3]       As a consequence, one employee, the daughter of the
president of the company, received minor burns and was
hospitalized for four days for observation and treatment. She
received no lasting injuries. Three other employees, including
the operator of the excavator, felt an impact but escaped any
injury.</pre>
    <pre>[4]       The respondent pleaded guilty to the charge of bringing
the boom of an excavator closer than three meters to an energized
overhead line and to the charge of failing to have a competent
signaller directing the operator of the excavator.</pre>
    <pre>[5]       The respondent had been in business for seventeen years
with no prior convictions. It was a small family business which
was in relatively precarious financial circumstances, operating
at a loss in 1997 and carrying significant indebtedness.</pre>
    <pre>[6]       The justice of the peace imposed a fine of $35,000 on
the first charge and a fine of $7,000 on the second charge.
Thereafter, she reminded counsel that there would be a surcharge
added to each fine. In passing sentence this was her only
reference to the surcharge.</pre>
    <pre>[7]       That surcharge is prescribed by s. 60.1 of the
Provincial Offences Act. This section was enacted in 1994 and
reads as follows:
               60.1  (1)  If a person is convicted of
          an offence in a proceeding commenced under
          Part I or III and a fine is imposed in
          respect of that offence, a surcharge is
          payable by that person in the amount
          determined by regulations made under this
          Act.
               (2)  The surcharge shall be deemed to be
          a fine for the purpose of enforcing payment.
               (3)  Any payments made by a defendant
          shall be credited towards payment of the fine
          until it is fully paid and then towards
          payment of the surcharge.
               (4)  Surcharges paid into the
          Consolidated Revenue Fund shall be credited
          to the victims' justice fund account and
          shall be deemed to be money received by the
          Crown for a special purpose.
          . . .
               (7)  The Lieutenant Governor in Council
          may make regulations,
          (a)  prescribing the amount of the surcharges
               or the method by which they are to be
               calculated;
          . . .
          (c)  exempting any offence or class of
               offence from the application of
               subsection (1).</pre>
    <pre>[8]       The applicable regulation sets the surcharge for a fine
of $1,000 or greater at twenty percent of the actual fine. Hence,
in this case surcharges of $7,000 and $1,400 respectively were
automatically imposed.</pre>
    <pre>[9]       On appeal, the issue as set out in s. 122(1) of the
Provincial Offences Act was the fitness of the sentence. In
determining that the fines imposed at trial were unfit and should
be reduced to $30,000 and $5,000 respectively the judge of the
Ontario Court (Provincial Division) concluded as follows:
          The total financial consequence of this
          prosecution, including the fine and
          surcharge, results in a penalty to the
          Defendant which exceeds the range of fines
          imposed upon companies of like size and
          nature (i.e. local based family business as
          opposed to a larger corporation) where no
          permanent injury or fatality occurred. As a
          result, this court concludes that the impact
          of the fines imposed here is harsh and
          excessive, particularly in relation to the
          considerations contained in section 59(2).</pre>
    <pre>[10] While her reference to s. 59(2) of the Provincial Offences
Act is erroneous, her conclusion displays no error. Section 59(2)
permits the court, where there is a minimum fine, to impose a
fine less than that minimum where the interests of justice
require it. Since the Occupational Health and Safety Act
prescribes no minimum fine for the offences charged here,
s. 59(2) simply has no application to this case.</pre>
    <pre>[11] However, in my view it was entirely appropriate for her to
consider the surcharges in determining the fitness of the
sentence imposed at trial. Indeed, in argument the appellant
conceded as much.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The surcharges are automatically imposed by legislation. For
fines greater than $1,000 they are fixed at twenty percent of the
amount of the fine, and are therefore significant. They are
deemed by the statute to be a fine for the purposes of enforcing
payment.</pre>
    <pre>[13] In imposing sentence a trial judge can properly have regard
to the surcharge and its economic impact on the accused. Having
in mind the surcharge does not mean simply a proportionate
reduction in the fine so that with the surcharge added, a
predetermined amount is reached. Rather, in passing sentence it
means taking account of the surcharge as a real life
consideration that affects the economic circumstances of the
accused and his or her capacity to pay. For the same reason it is
a relevant consideration on appeal in determining the fitness of
the sentence. That is what happened in this case.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The respondent also raised in this court the argument that
the surcharge constitutes an invalid imposition of a tax, relying
on Eurig Estate (Re) (1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). Because
it was not addressed below and was not pressed in this court, we
do not make any comment on this argument.</pre>
    <pre>[15] I would therefore dismiss this appeal.
