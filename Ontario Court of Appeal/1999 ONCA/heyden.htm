</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On October 22, 1999, after a very lengthy trial, Jack Heyden
was  convicted by Mr. Justice McIssac and a jury of first  degree
murder. He was tried together with his son William Vander Heyden,
who   was  similarly  convicted.  Both  were  sentenced  to  life
imprisonment without parole eligibility for 25 years. Jack Heyden
now applies for release pending appeal.
[2]  Both the applicant and the Crown have filed voluminous
materials on this motion, which I have now had the chance to
carefully review. These include affidavits from trial counsel,
the applicant and his proposed sureties. Because the court
reporting was done with a real time system, it was also possible
to include a number of evidentiary rulings and the charge to the
jury.
[3]  The applicant is 55 years of age and has resided in the
Barrie area since he was a small child. He has had a very
successful career as a developer. Indeed, it appears that at the
time of trial he was worth several millions of dollars. He has
one prior conviction for assault causing bodily harm and uttering
threats. The complainant in that matter was the applicant&#146;s
spouse from whom he is now separated and with whom he has a
continuing family law dispute. His children are all grown.
[4]  The killing took place on March 20, 1992. The victim, Paul
Kneeshaw, was a friend of the applicant and someone with whom he
had done business.
[5]  The applicant was charged on February 1, 1994. On March 31,
1994, he was released on bail pending trial. He remained free on
bail from that point through the commencement of his trial in
September 1996, the empanelling of the jury in April 1998, until
his conviction on October 22, 1999.
[6]  In very large measure, the case against the applicant was
based on circumstantial evidence. There was no question that Mr.
Kneeshaw was brutally murdered. The issue was whether the
applicant was criminally responsible for it. The theory of the
Crown was that he hired his son to do the killing. The jury
determined that together with his son he was, indeed, responsible
for this murder.
[7]  The applicant puts forward a large number of grounds of
appeal. Many relate to evidentiary rulings said to prejudice the
conduct of the defence. Others relate to alleged inadequacies in
the charge to the jury. Suffice it to say that while I find a
number of these grounds to be arguable, I think none are
overwhelming. They are not such that, to borrow the language of
Carthy J.A.1, they leave me with a very strong opinion in favour
of the applicant&#146;s chances of success on appeal.
[8]  It is clear, I think, that unless the appeal has a very
strong probability of succeeding it is not in the public interest
to release pending appeal a person convicted of a planned and
deliberate murder such as this. See R. v. Trotta, July 30, 1999
(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Pan, (supra).
[9]  There can be little debate that the appeal raises arguable
issues that are more than frivolous. Nor did the Crown seriously
advance a concern that the applicant would not surrender into
custody.
[10] However, the applicant must also establish that his
detention is not necessary in the public interest.
[11] In assessing this aspect of the matter, I must balance the
competing principles of reviewability and enforceability as
described by Arbour J.A. (as she then was) in R. v. Farinacci
(1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32.
[12] Factors relevant to this task include the nature and gravity
of the offence, the relative merits of the appeal and the time
anticipated to be needed to dispose of the appeal.
[13] In this case, these considerations all point against release
and are enough to determine that release would not be in the
public interest. This was a brutal premeditated killing. The
applicant has been convicted of the most serious offence known to
Canadian law. While the appeal raises grounds which are clearly
arguable, I cannot say that it has a very strong probability of
success. Finally, since a real time reporting system was used, I
am advised that the full transcript can be available in 6 to 12
months. Given this court&#146;s currency, the appeal can be heard
within several months of its perfection.
[14] In all the circumstances, I find that the applicant has not
met the public interest requirement in s.679(3) of the Criminal
Code.
[15] The application for release must be dismissed.
