</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of MacPherson J. dated November 12, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   After  23  years  of working for the  respondent  Frito-Lay
Canada, the appellant was fired on April 1, 1993. As a result, he
sought  compensation  pursuant to the Employment  Standards  Act,
R.S.O.  1990, c.E-14, (the Act). His claim under s.57 of the  Act
for  termination pay was denied, but his claim under s.58 of  the
Act for severance pay was allowed. A year later he commenced this
action for wrongful dismissal.
[2]  MacPherson J. dismissed the action at trial finding that the
denial of the appellant&#146;s claim for termination pay met all three
requirements for the application of the doctrine of issue
estoppel. He went on to indicate that had he reached the merits
of the action he would have found that the respondent employer
did not have just cause to dismiss the appellant and would have
awarded damages for the period of notice that the parties had
agreed was reasonable.
[3]  There are two issues on this appeal.
[4]  First, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
finding that the &#147;same question&#148; requirement of issue estoppel is
met in this case. He says that the question decided in the denial
of his claim for termination pay is different from that presented
in his civil action. For the reasons that follow I agree.
[5]  Second, the respondent submits by way of cross-appeal that
the trial judge erred in finding that it did not have just cause
to dismiss the appellant. For the reasons that follow, I
disagree.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   For the 23 years of his employment the appellant worked for
the respondent as a driver-salesman. He was acknowledged to be an
excellent   employee.  Indeed,  following  his  termination   his
immediate supervisor gave him a glowing letter of reference.
[7]  On January 25, 1993, the appellant began a medical leave of
absence that was scheduled to last until March 8, 1993. On
February 12, 1993, while still on leave, he was sentenced for two
criminal convictions unrelated to his work. Instead of the
suspended sentence he expected, he received a sentence of four
months incarceration followed by eighteen months probation.
Assuming good behaviour in jail, his expected release date was
May 1, 1993. The appellant advised his employer of this state of
affairs and on March 8th the respondent extended his leave
temporarily while it considered what to do.
[8]  On April 1, 1993, the respondent terminated the appellant.
The termination letter read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Basis[sic] the current information we have on file, your
          return to work was to have been March 8 1993 from your medical
          short-term disability. Since that time we have put you on a
          temporary leave of absence while we have investigated your return
          to work status. Since you are not able to return to work at this
          time, you are terminated for failure to return to work per
          Company Policy.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   After  he  was released from jail on May 1,  the  appellant
asked  the respondent to reconsider its decision, but it  refused
to do so. Subsequently, in October 1993, he filed his application
under  the  Act  seeking some compensation for his  23  years  of
service.
[10] His first claim was for termination pay in lieu of notice
pursuant to s.57 of the Act. That section prescribes escalating
periods of required notice or pay in lieu thereof depending upon
the years of service of the terminated employee. It also
specifies certain circumstances where this notice is not
required. The relevant parts of s. 57 read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    57(1)   No employer shall terminate the employment
               of an employee who has been employed for three months or
               more unless the employer gives,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (h)   eight  weeks notice in writing  to
               the  employee  if his or her  period  of
               employment is eight years or more,
          </pre>
    <pre>               and such notice has expired.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (10) Subsections (1) and (2) do not
               apply to,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  an employee who has been guilty  of
               wilful  misconduct  or  disobedience  or
               wilful neglect of duty that has not been
               condoned by the employer;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  a contract of employment that is or
               has become impossible of performance  or
               is   frustrated   by  a  fortuitous   or
               unforeseeable event or circumstance; &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The  appellant&#146;s second claim was for severance  pay  under
s.58  of  the  Act.  In this section, termination  includes  both
dismissal and lay-off. It provides for severance pay of up to  26
weeks  regular wages for employees with more than five  years  of
service  who are terminated by an employer of sufficient size  to
have  a payroll of at least $2.5 million. This section also  sets
out  circumstances  in which no severance pay  is  required.  The
relevant parts of s.58 are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    58(1) In this section,
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#147;termination&#148; means,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  a dismissal, including a constructive dismissal,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  a lay-off that is effected because of a permanent
               discontinuance of all of the employer&#146;s business at an
               establishment, or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  a lay-off, including a lay-off effected because of a
               permanent discontinuance of part of the business of the employer
               at an establishment, that equals or exceeds thirty-five weeks in
               any period of fifty-two consecutive weeks,
          </pre>
    <pre>          and  &#147;terminated&#148; has a corresponding
          meaning.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2) Where,
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  one or more employees have their employment terminated by an
               employer with a payroll of $2.5 million or more,
          </pre>
    <pre>          the  employer shall pay severance pay to each
          employee whose employment has been terminated
          and who has been employed by the employer for
          five or more years.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (4) The severance pay to which  an
          employee is entitled under this section shall
          be   in  an  amount equal to  the  employee&#146;s
          regular wages for a regular non-overtime work
          week multiplied by the sum of,
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (a)   the  number of the employee&#146;s
                    completed years of employment and
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (b)  the number of the employee&#146;s
                    completed   months  of   employment
                    divided by 12.
          </pre>
    <pre>          but   shall   not  exceed   twenty-six
          weeks    regular   wages   for   a    regular
          non-overtime work week.
          </pre>
    <pre>           &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (6)  Subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not
          apply to,
          </pre>
    <pre>           &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (c)    an employee who has been guilty of
                   wilful misconduct or disobedience or wilful
                   neglect of duty that has not been condoned by
                   the employer.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  The  decision of the Employment Standards Officer on  these
two  claims was communicated to the appellant on April 14,  1994,
in the following letter:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This confirms that I have denied your claim for termination
          pay per Clause 57-(10)(d) of the Employment Standards Act.
          However, I have upheld your claim to severance pay.
          </pre>
    <pre>                As  explained  to  you,  based  on  the
          average  weekly  wage rate of  $827.15,  your
          severance   pay  entitlement   is  $18,955.52
          gross.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  Employer  will  forward  the  said
          amount  to you, less legal deductions, within
          2  weeks.  If you have not received the  said
          payment by May 10, 1994, please call me.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Neither the appellant nor the respondent sought  to  appeal
this decision as permitted by the Act. However, a year later  the
appellant commenced this litigation claiming damages for wrongful
dismissal.
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  first  issue is whether the denial of the  appellant&#146;s
claim  for termination pay under the Act triggers the application
of  the  doctrine  of  issue  estoppel  thereby  precluding  this
lawsuit.  This  doctrine prevents a party  from  relitigating  an
issue  already  decided  in  an  earlier  proceeding.  The  three
requirements of the doctrine are well settled. They are: a)  that
the prior proceeding must have decided the same question as is in
issue in the subsequent proceeding; b) that the decision said  to
create  the  estoppel  be judicial and final;  and  c)  that  the
parties to the earlier decision be either the same or the privies
of the parties in the subsequent proceeding.
[15] At trial the appellant took no issue with the third of these
requirements. As to the second requirement, MacPherson J.
determined that it was met by the decision of the Employment
Standards Officer. His reasoning was subsequently confirmed by
the decision of this court in Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies
Inc. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 235 (Ont.C.A.).
[16] Hence, before this court the appellant properly conceded
that only the first requirement remained in issue. The question
is whether the issue in this wrongful dismissal litigation is the
same as the issue decided in the previous proceedings, namely,
the decision of the Employment Standards Officer.
[17] Relying primarily on the reasons of Abella J.A. in Rasanen
v. Rosemount Instruments Ltd. (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 683 (Ont.
C.A.), MacPherson J. answered this question in the affirmative.
He found that the issue in the wrongful dismissal litigation was
the same as that determined against the appellant when his claim
under the Act for termination pay was dismissed.
[18] In reaching this conclusion MacPherson J. did not have the
benefit of this court&#146;s subsequently released reasons for
judgment in Minott v. O&#146;Shanter Development Co. [citation to be
added], which explains and builds upon Rasanen. Laskin J.A.
writing for the court in Minott made clear that Rasanen ought not
to be read to stand for the proposition that termination under
the Employment Standards Act always raises the same question as
just cause at common law.
[19] Rather, he explained that the determination of whether the
same issue requirement has been met depends on a careful analysis
of the factual context and the statutory standard applied in the
earlier proceeding. The specific issue determined in that earlier
proceeding can thus be identified and compared to the issue to be
resolved in the subsequent proceeding.
[20] This method of analysis is consistent with the observation
of Morden A.C.J.O. in Rasanen, supra, at p.687 that the courts
have taken a &#147;fastidious approach&#148; to the &#147;same question&#148; test.
Although at a high level of generalization, two proceedings might
seem to address the same question, this requirement of issue
estoppel is met only if on careful analysis of the relevant facts
and the applicable law the answer to the specific question in the
earlier proceeding can be said to determine the issue in the
subsequent proceeding.
[21] It is in this light that the &#147;same question&#148; requirement of
issue estoppel must be addressed. The Employment Standards
Officer made clear that the appellant&#146;s claim for termination pay
was dismissed based on s.57(10)(d) of the Act. That section
provides that no termination pay need be paid in the case of a
&#147;contract of employment that is or has become impossible of
performance or is frustrated by a fortuitous or unforeseeable
event or circumstance&#148;.
[22] This statutory standard is quite different from the legal
question in the wrongful dismissal action, namely, whether the
employee engaged in any misconduct that was sufficiently wrongful
to constitute just cause for his dismissal. The finding that the
appellant&#146;s contract of employment had become impossible to
perform due to an unforeseeable event says nothing about the
relative wrongfulness of the employee&#146;s conduct. The finding by
the Employment Standards Officer simply does not determine the
question presented for decision in this action. The issues are
not the same.
[23] In this action the employer did not rely on the common law
doctrine of frustration. It was not pleaded and does not appear
to have been raised at trial, where the only issue to be resolved
on the merits of the litigation was whether the appellant was
wrongfully dismissed, not whether the employment contract was
frustrated. Hence, at trial the doctrine of frustration was not
the basis of the issue estoppel argument. Likewise it was not
argued on appeal. Hence, it is unnecessary to decide whether the
statutory standard set out in s.57(10)(d) of the Act duplicates
the common law doctrine for the purposes of the &#147;same issue&#148;
analysis.
[24] In the same way, the Employment Standards Officer did not
base the dismissal of the appellant&#146;s claim for termination pay
on s.57(10)(c), which denies termination pay to an employee found
guilty of wilful misconduct. Nor does the appellant argue that
his wrongful dismissal action must succeed because his successful
claim for severance pay necessarily reflects a finding that the
statutory denial of entitlement for an employee guilty of
wrongful misconduct (found in 58(6)(c)) did not apply to him.
Hence, it is unnecessary to decide whether in the context of
these facts the statutory standard of wilful misconduct found in
both s.57(10)(c) and s.58(6)(c) raises the same issue as that to
be decided in a wrongful dismissal action.
[25] In summary, given the way this action has been framed by the
parties, I conclude that the Employment Standards Act proceedings
did not determine the same issue as that to be addressed in this
litigation. This requirement of issue estoppel has not been met
and the doctrine therefore does not preclude the action. The
appeal on this issue must be allowed.
[26] Turning to the issue raised by way of cross-appeal,
MacPherson J. determined that the respondent did not have just
cause to dismiss the appellant. As I have indicated I agree with
this conclusion.
[27] The appellant was absent from work on sick leave from
January 25 to March 8, 1993. He was on unpaid leave of absence
from March 8 to April 1 when he was terminated. From then until
his release from jail on May 1 he was absent without leave.
[28] While there is no doubt that this 30-day absence was due to
the appellant&#146;s misconduct, MacPherson J. was correct in finding
that it did not rise to the level of just cause for the
appellant&#146;s dismissal.
[29] The appellant&#146;s misconduct which caused the absence was
entirely unrelated to his employment. At trial the respondent
offered two reasons for being unable to accommodate the absence.
First, it was restructuring its sales force and required its
employees to bid for the new routes on the basis of seniority.
However, as the trial judge pointed out, the respondent was in
touch with the appellant while he was in jail and could easily
have solicited his preferences for a new route.
[30] MacPherson J. addressed the second reason offered as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The second reason Hostess advanced for terminating Mr.
          Heynen on April 1 was the difficulty his long absence posed in
          terms of coverage of his route. I acknowledge that this was a
          difficulty. However, in the context of 23 years of loyal and
          effective service, and bearing in mind that Hostess serviced his
          route with a replacement driver-salesman for the nine weeks
          immediately before April 1, I would label this difficulty &#147;minor
          inconvenience&#148;; it was, in my view, far removed from any fair
          interpretation of &#147;just cause.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[31]  I  agree with this conclusion. In light of the  appellant&#146;s
length  of  service, his unblemished record and the  demonstrated
ability  of the respondent to cover his absence there was nothing
approaching just cause for his termination.
[32] I would, therefore, dismiss the cross-appeal.
[33] The parties are agreed that the appropriate payment in lieu
of notice is an additional 10½ months pay over and above the
funds already received by the appellant as a result of the
allowance of his claim for severance pay.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[34]  The appeal is therefore allowed with costs. The action  for
wrongful  dismissal succeeds. The respondents shall  pay  to  the
appellant the amount referred to above together with pre-judgment
interest.  Failing agreement on the rate of interest,  the  Court
may  be  spoken  to.  There would seem to be no  reason  why  the
appellant should not have his costs of the action.
[35] The cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.
