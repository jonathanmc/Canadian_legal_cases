    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Binks J. dated December 9,
1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a Crown appeal from the decision of Binks J. of the
Ontario Court (General Division) in which he imposed a sentence
for sexual assault of 21 months and ordered it to be served
conditionally.  In addition, he ordered two years probation.
[2]  The appeal proceeded in this court on the basis of an agreed
statement of facts.  The facts leading up to the assault are
instructive as to the relationship between the complainant and
the respondent.  At the time of the assault, the respondent was
37 years of age.  The complainant was 18 years old.  The
respondent was the manager of an Ottawa bowling alley known as
Aladdin Lanes.  The complainant worked at the bowling alley,
doing general jobs, including cleaning, emptying ashtrays,
cooking, serving and bartending.  The respondent was the
complainant&#146;s direct supervisor.  At the time of the offence, the
complaint was 6 months pregnant and living with her ill father.
She worked part-time to earn money, while also attending school
on a part-time basis.
[3]  The respondent and the complainant&#146;s family had known each
other for about five or six years.  The complainant&#146;s family had
bowled at Aladdin Lanes for some years.  The complainant had
started bowling there when she was around twelve years old.  The
complainant and her father trusted the respondent to give her
rides home after work.  On his own evidence, he had driven her
home 100 or 200 times.
[4]  On January 12, 1997, both the complainant and the respondent
had worked the late shift.  He was to drive her home.  After the
last bowlers left the alley, the respondent went outside, started
his car, came back inside and locked the door to the building.
It was just after midnight.  Due to the stage of her pregnancy,
the complainant had been experiencing back pain.  When the
respondent came back inside, he offered to give her a backrub,
which she accepted.  The respondent had previously given her
massages on two or three occasions, to alleviate the back pain
caused by her pregnancy.  He asked her to remove her coat, which
she did.  The complainant was sitting in front of the respondent
with her back facing him.  He slid his hands under her shirt.  He
then wrapped them around her and began feeling her stomach and
breasts, while kissing her neck.  He told the complainant he was
&#147;horny&#148;, that she was &#147;hot&#148;, and that she was turning him on.
[5]  Without dealing with the specifics of the sexual assault
itself, the respondent&#146;s conduct continued and resulted in a full
act of forced sexual intercourse against the resisting
complainant.
[6]  We are all of the opinion that both the term of the sentence
and the fact of its being served conditionally are totally out of
proportion to the seriousness of the offence committed.  This
should have been a custodial sentence and should have been for a
penitentiary term.
[7]  Adopting the suggestion in R. v. Melvyn MacLaren, unreported
judgment of this court dated June 30, 1999, at paras. 18 and 19,
we would impose a custodial term commencing as of today&#146;s date.
In doing so, we take into account the fact that the respondent
has served 9 months of a conditional sentence that was imposed at
trial.  In these circumstances, an appropriate custodial term is
18 months to be served commencing on this date.
[8]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is
allowed and the sentence below is set aside to be replaced by a
sentence of 18 months, said sentence to commence as of this date.</pre>
