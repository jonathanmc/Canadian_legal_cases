</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the  judgment of the Divisional Court
of February 6, 1998 wherein that court quashed the order of the
inquiry officer of May 27, 1997. In their reasons for judgment,
the majority held that the standard of review of a decision of
the inquiry officer under s. 23 of the Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act R.S.O. 1990 c. F. 31 is correctness. We
disagree. We are in substantial agreement with the reasons set
out in the dissenting judgment of MacDougall J., in particular on
the issue of the standard of review.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The legislature has entrusted the application of s. 23 to
the issue of disclosure of any particular record first to the
head, and then to the inquiry officer. Both the application of
the section and therefore its interpretation are within the
expertise of the inquiry officer under the Act whose decision
must be accorded deference by the courts. The standard of review
is therefore reasonableness.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view both the interpretation of the section and its
application in this case by the inquiry officer to the documents
sought by the requester were reasonable and therefore his
decision ought not to be set aside. Contrary to the submission of
the respondent, in our view the reasons of the inquiry officer
make clear that in adopting a dictionary definition for the term
&quot;compelling&quot; in the phrase &quot;compelling public interest&quot;, the
inquiry officer was not seeking to minimise the seriousness or
strength of that standard in the context of the section. In fact
he noted that the issue of the Quebec referendum and the
potential impacts of a &quot;yes&quot; vote were of &quot;virtually
unprecedented importance&quot; and went on to describe the public
interest in the disclosure of the documents in question to
therefore be &quot;very compelling&quot;. Furthermore, as found by
MacDougall J., the inquiry officer turned his mind to the second
issue of whether that interest &quot;clearly outweighed&quot; the prejudice
and injury which forms the basis for the original exemption of
the documents from disclosure. His conclusion on this issue was
reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appeal is therefore allowed, the order of the Divisional
Court is set aside and the order of the inquiry officer of May
27, 1997 is reinstated.  Costs of the appeal to the requester
fixed at $4000.</pre></td>
