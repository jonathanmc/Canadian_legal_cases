    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This is an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The
defendant employer appeals from the judgment granted in favour of
the employee for $26,145 damages and costs of $13,000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appeal has three aspects:  fresh evidence, interventions
by the trial judge, and the quantum of damages. In our opinion,
it is only necessary to deal at any length with the matter of
interventions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The employer’s position is that the employee was discharged
for cause. The cause is either that she stole a large of sum or
she was part of a scheme involving theft from the employer or as
store manager she did less than was required of her to prevent
the thefts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The defendant’s complaint is that from the outset of the
trial, the trial judge manifested his disbelief and non-
acceptance of any of these defences. This position was
demonstrated by his frequent intervention in the defence’s
examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The result of
such interventions, it is argued, was the impression on the part
of the defendant that the trial judge had closed his mind to the
possibility that a defence could be established and that the
outcome was pre-determined.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Counsel for the appellant made specific reference to 48
interventions. Some of these could be construed as requests or
suggestions for clarification or as humorous asides. Most of the
interventions, however, could not be explained away.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Early in the cross-examination of the plaintiff, an exhibit
under discussion had a page missing. The trial judge remarked:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Maybe  Ms  Hilson  stole it,  who  knows?   I
          suppose that’s the…is that the theory?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  The business in question was a McDonald’s Restaurant. While
the plaintiff was being cross-examined with respect to which
documents she signed, the trial judge observed:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  know  we’re  going to get the  handwriting
          expert  from Hamburger U. eventually to  make
          sense  for me, but I thought I should have  a
          vague idea now. Which do you say you signed?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  During the cross-examination of the plaintiff, counsel
attempted to have a cheque to another employee filed as an
exhibit. The cheque was evidence of a transaction under
investigation. Plaintiff’s counsel objected to its admission.
Before defence counsel could respond to this objection, the trial
judge said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Well,  the  defence,  as  I  understand   it,
          without  appearing to be frivolous, from  the
          opening  statement, was any port in a  storm.
          We are going to try and show she stole. If we
          can’t show that, we are going to try to  show
          that she was involved in a scheme whereby  we
          lost money, and if we can’t show that we  are
          going  to try to show that somebody else  was
          stealing and she should have known about  it,
          she and maybe whoever could push a button  at
          head  office and get the bank statement every
          afternoon, but she should have known, and she
          is  the  one we are going to lay it on.  That
          is,  I  understand, the nature of the defence
          as it was explained to me. And if that is the
          case,  and  that  is  the  way  it  has  been
          pleaded, and I know, and now I see, that this
          is  the  performance  that  there  have  been
          numerous dress rehearsals, I would imagine  a
          preliminary,  I  see there  was  a  trial,  a
          criminal  trial,  I  am  told  there  was   a
          criminal  action,  obviously  there   was   a
          criminal  trial, discoveries. So am I  fairly
          putting  it without being cruel…that you  are
          going  to see what sticks to the wall by  the
          end  of this trial and then find out who pays
          for   it  when  we  peel  it  off  the  wall?
          Yes?…Okay. That’s great. I can take a joke as
          well  as  anyone. Let’s stick around and  see
          who  does  the peeling and how much it  costs
          for the room rental. Okay.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Counsel for the defendant had not yet made an
          opening statement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  When the plaintiff corrected a question in cross-examination
respecting dates, the trial judge commented:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          So  do  not, when somebody is cross examining
          you  and  they  tell  you something,  do  not
          necessarily eat it. Dissect it first. You are
          right. You are absolutely right.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] That led to the following discussion:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   Well,  Mr.  Sanderson  [defence
          counsel]  is  hoping he can do  another  half
          hour  or so of cross-examination without  the
          information  wherein  you  are  of  necessity
          required  to  say, “I can’t help you  without
          that,”  and  then tomorrow he  will  probably
          show them to you.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Okay.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  And maybe he will show  you  the
          back  of  Bruce’s cheque, too, and  the  date
          that it was finally deposited. If he doesn’t,
          somebody  else will, and that may  help  you,
          too.  But what you are being asked to do  now
          is  to  speculate, and if somebody  wants  to
          spend a half hour on speculation, it is their
          dime.  But  I  am  going to now  insist  that
          before any further cross-examination on  this
          point takes place tomorrow or the next day or
          next  week,  or whenever we get back  to  it,
          that  you be provided with pages 1 and  2  of
          those documents and not just the back pages.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Okay.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Okay?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  SANDERSON:  Q. That suggests to me  that
          you  really, well, we’ve been down  the  road
          enough,  I  think, in terms of fairness,  and
          that’s  fine.  I think we have  the  evidence
          necessary already without those pages.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  So you are not going to  produce
          them?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  SANDERSON:   I  am  absolutely  when  we
          finish  today going to look for them, and  if
          we find them, great, we’ll produce them.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  And if you do not, I do not want
          you to be misled in that observation you just
          made  that  you have enough evidence  because
          what you have up until now is you seem like a
          very nice man, Mr. Sanderson, you are dressed
          in a black coat and nice starched white tabs,
          and  if you say so, that could be so. On  the
          other  hand, I just do not know and I  cannot
          tell you till I have those pages. So the  end
          result  is you do not have an answer. If  you
          think you have an answer, that is great,  but
          I  do not want you to be misled because I can
          tell you right now, I do not have one.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  SANDERSON:  Okay. Then that concerns  me
          greatly.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Sure.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  SANDERSON:  And what I would like to  do
          is  make  sure that we have been talking  the
          same language.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   Yes.  Okay, now,  Margo  [Margo
          Lonergan, the defendant’s bookkeeper] has not
          been fired for stealing, I presume?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR. SANDERSON:  No.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  She is still there?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR. SANDERSON:  Yes.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   The same one that  could  check
          these  same results every afternoon that  you
          are  saying  this  witness did  not  do  and,
          therefore,  she should get fired?   Okay.  So
          she  is still there. So tell her. Do not  ask
          her. Tell her, “Give us pages 1 and 2.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR. SANDERSON:  Oh, absolutely.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Good.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          MR.  SANDERSON:  And if they exist, here they
          come.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   If  not,  then  they  were   in
          somebody’s  hamburger. Okay,  all  right,  we
          shredded them. All right.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] On the second day of trial, defence counsel was trying to
establish how long it takes a cheque to clear. The trial judge
responded:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Oh,  isn’t that interesting?  Okay. Well, you
          suggest that till you are blue in the face.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Shortly after that he told the plaintiff, who was still
being cross-examined:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Just  because the nice man in the black  suit
          and  the white tie tells you that it  is  so,
          does not mean it is so, yes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] While the plaintiff was still under cross-examination
regarding where the deposit envelopes were kept at the store, the
trial judge interrupted the examination to query:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Okay,  all right, with all these fingerprints
          all  over  them. Okay. Is there going  to  be
          some evidence that that goop that they put on
          Big  Macs,  the  patented  stuff,  makes  you
          sleepy, especially if you are a bookkeeper or
          an area manager.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Margo Lonergan was a bookkeeper and David Cropper the area
manager. Both testified on behalf of the employer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Counsel for the defence did not give an opening statement
until the plaintiff’s case was in. Part of the statement dealt
with the details of the money handling and accounting systems at
the store. One of the questions was whether Bruce Williams was a
salaried employee and as such got paid every time a payroll was
run. The evidence of the plaintiff was that she was the only
salaried employee. This apparent conflict in the evidence drew
the following comments from the trial judge:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  think you [defence counsel] told her  [the
          plaintiff]  several times, and as  I  pointed
          out  as gently as I could, sometimes when the
          nice  man  with the black suit and the  white
          tie  says something, often witnesses who  are
          by  that  time hypnotized after a day  and  a
          half  of cross examination say “yeah”. But  I
          have a category of answers. I put them in  my
          bench  book  under “the moon is made  out  of
          green  cheese”  and  it goes  something  like
          this. Nice looking man in the black suit  and
          the  white tie looking very official says  to
          the  witness in the stand, “I suggest to you,
          witness,  the  moon  is  made  out  of  green
          cheese”. And I look at the witness,  and  the
          witness’s  eyes don’t appear  to  be  rolling
          around  in  his or her head, and  until  that
          point I haven’t had a lot of reason to wonder
          about  their  credibility or reliability  and
          they  say, “Yes Mr. Nice Man”. So I put down,
          “Yes,  moon made out of green cheese”, but  I
          put  it  in  a separate category.  So  that’s
          where  I  had that one because I thought  the
          evidence was clear and uncontradicted that no
          matter how many times you used that phrase it
          wasn’t accurate. But I may be wrong. I’m sure
          that  Mr. Cropper will clarify that  for  us,
          and  that  one  of  them  wasn’t  a  salaried
          employee, and therefore, there was only  one.
          Okay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Later in the discussion which took place between Judge and
defence counsel following his opening, the trial judge said the
following:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Well,  he’s not going to be able to  tell  us
          what  they  told him though unless they  come
          here  and  tell us who can do  that  and  who
          can’t  do that and whether you can. Ms Hilson
          has  said categorically, “you can’t  do  what
          you’re  saying  I did”. Mr.  Cropper  and  Ms
          Lonergan each of whom may…if one were to be a
          cynic, and unfortunately, that is my job. I’m
          trained  to  be  a cynic. I  don’t  have  the
          luxury  of  approaching a  trial  with  rose-
          coloured glasses as counsel do. I look at  it
          objectively. I might say, “Wait a minute. Why
          am  I hearing you tell me this?  Why don’t  I
          hear  it  from  somebody who doesn’t  have  a
          potential interest in this case such  as  the
          computer  person who runs this  whole  system
          and  knows  it better than any of us?”   Hey,
          just an observation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] On the third day of the trial, counsel was examining his
first witness, David Cropper. In one of his responses, Mr.
Cropper noted that the plaintiff had no explanation for certain
discrepancies. The trial judge said, “Neither did Susan Nelles,
did she?”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] When counsel asked to put up a chart to demonstrate a point,
the trial judge commented:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Sure,   yes.   I   feel  like   one   of   my
          grandchildren  with  the  Christmas  calendar
          though. I keep waiting for the Lamborghini to
          be  turned over but put that one up for  now,
          sure.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The Lamborghini was presumably the luxury car the plaintiff
had bought with the money she was alleged to have stolen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] After a break to permit Mr. Cropper to refresh his memory
with respect to a certain exhibit, the trial judge was advised
that Mr. Cropper did not need the break. He responded as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I  am  sure  he is. Sure, sure.  This  little
          evasion  earlier  was  just  a  little  smoke
          screen.  Yes,  of course he is familiar  with
          them.  Okay. So you do not have  to  look  at
          them,  is  that  what you  are  saying?   Mr.
          Cropper  has  lived and breathed  this  thing
          since 1991. Okay, do you want to look at them
          or  do  you  not have to, Mr. Cropper?   Your
          call. We took the break so you could.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] During the course of the re-examination of Margo Lonergan,
the defendant’s bookkeeper, the trial judge remarked:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  Okay. Tell me what you  do  when
          you  leave. I gather you do not go  into  the
          office at 4:30 every morning.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. No.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  Okay. How does that all  happen?
          What  exactly do you do to…I thought  it  was
          pulling. It is polling, is it?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.  The  polling  is  actually  done  in  the
          restaurant,  and  if it is successful,  their
          computer  is,  then moves onto what  we  call
          another mode, another part of a program,  and
          it’s sitting there waiting for my computer to
          call  across  to get all the financial  data,
          and when my computer does that, it stores it,
          and it’s sitting there waiting for me to come
          in in the morning. My computer is left on all
          the time.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Even on a weekend?

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Even on a weekend.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  So what about on Saturday night?
          You don’t work Saturdays, I hope?

          Well,  that’s  great. That’s a great  system.
          Okay, now, I’ve got to tell you something I’m
          marvelling at. Tell me again what it is  that
          you   remember  Ms.  Hilson  saying  in   the
          meeting, just as best you recall it.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. It was comments like, you know, “I’ve been
          stupid.  I didn’t follow up on things.”   And
          she  made  a reference about not firing  her,
          demote  her. She was extremely emotional  and
          she was crying, and I found it very emotional
          for myself.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:  Okay. And who said what  to  her
          just before that?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.  Mr.  Cropper and Mr. Chandler were asking
          her  questions about, “Why did  this  happen?
          What did you do?”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   Do  you remember  the  question
          itself?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Not specifically, no.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   No?  How about after?   Do  you
          remember the question after she said that?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.  Well,  she  didn’t  say  it  all  in  one
          sentence.  She just said it, you  know,  like
          comments, and I was asked to leave  the  room
          just shortly afterwards.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  And the first time you were asked
          to recall that was sometime this year?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.  I  wasn’t  even asked  to  recall  it.  I
          actually  mentioned it myself. I  brought  it
          into the conversation about the meeting.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   Oh, you raised it?   Okay.  All
          right.  I  will tell you why.  Again  I  have
          trouble understanding computers and I  cannot
          remember  what I had for dinner  last  night.
          That  is  a bit of a problem I have. And  the
          way,  I  will  tell you the way you  said  it
          here:   “I’ve  been stupid. I’m an  idiot.  I
          haven’t  followed up on things like I  should
          have.  Please demote me. Don’t fire me.”   It
          sounds  like a bit of a mantra. Do  you  know
          what  a  mantra is?  It sounds like a mantra.
          But  what I was doing was while I was writing
          that  down, I was looking at my notes of  Mr.
          Cropper’s  evidence,  and  it  was  the  same
          mantra,  and I just thought, “This is  really
          terrific. I wish I could do that.”   So  were
          there any meetings on August the 17th?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Not with me. I wasn’t present at any.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  No?  Do you remember what you did
          on August 17th?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. Went to work.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Do you remember what anybody said
          to you?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.  The  main topic of conversation was  this
          subject and how….
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE  COURT:   Do you remember the words  that
          were used?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A. No specifically, no.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE COURT:  Okay. Just it really impressed me
          that  identical  words  almost  verbatim  six
          years later. That’s great. Okay,…</font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Interventions  by  the  judge  creating   the
          appearance of an unfair trial may be of  more
          than  one type and the appearance of  a  fair
          trial  may  be destroyed by a combination  of
          different types of intervention. The ultimate
          question  to  be answered is not whether  the
          accused  was  in  fact  prejudiced   by   the
          interventions but whether he might reasonably
          consider that he had not had a fair trial  or

          subjectively    present    and    objectively
          demonstrated  to the informed and  reasonable
          observer.  If  the words or  actions  of  the

          apprehension  of  bias to  the  informed  and

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is right and proper that judges be held to
          the  highest standards of impartiality  since
          they   will  have  to  determine   the   most
          fundamentally important rights of the parties
          appearing  before them. This is true  whether
          the  legal dispute arises between citizen and
          citizen or between the citizen and the state.
          Every  comment  that a judge makes  from  the
          bench   is  weighed  and  evaluated  by   the
          community as well as the parties. Judges must
          be  conscious  of this constant weighing  and
          make  every effort to achieve neutrality  and
          fairness  in carrying out their duties.  This
          must be a cardinal rule of judicial conduct.</font></pre>
