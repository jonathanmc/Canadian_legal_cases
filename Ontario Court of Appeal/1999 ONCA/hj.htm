</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from an order by King J. of the Ontario Court of
Justice (Provincial Division).
</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent was charged as a young person with attempted
theft under $5000 and possession of tools to break and enter a
vehicle.  Her application to the Ontario
Legal Aid Plan (&#147;OLAP&#148;) for a publicly-funded counsel was
rejected, and she then applied for an order under s.11(4)(b) of
the Young Offenders Act R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 (hereinafter
sometimes the &#147;Act&#148;),  to have counsel appointed.  The hearing of
that application appears to have proceeded on the basis of
tacitly and explicitly agreed facts disclosed in the course of
submissions and accepted in the reasons for judgment of King J.,
the youth court judge.  The application was allowed and an order
under s.11(4)(b)  was made on August 24, 1998.  On September 14,
1998, at the invitation of the Crown, the court stayed
proceedings against the respondent until such time as the
propriety of the order could be resolved on appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent was 15 years old when the offences are
alleged to have been committed and turned 16 on August 13, 1998
(before the order in issue here).  She applied to
OLAP for legal aid as a young person.  In the ordinary course,
OLAP considered her personal means as well as the means of 
her parents. OLAP assesses each application on an
individual basis and determines eligibility based on criteria
that determine whether an individual&#146;s income, after expenses and
necessities have been deducted, is sufficient to allow them to
afford to hire a lawyer.   The respondent&#146;s application to
OLAP was declined because, in the opinion of OLAP (applying their
normal standards), her parents had the financial means to retain
counsel privately to defend these charges.  It appeared from the
facts before the youth court judge that the respondent&#146;s parents
had a disposable income exceeding $1,000 each month and that they
owned their house.  There was no suggestion or evidence that the
financial standard applied in this case was unfair or
inappropriate.  That is, there was no challenge to the fact that
the respondent&#146;s parents actually had the financial means to fund
counsel for their daughter privately.  The only issue on the
application before the youth court judge was whether, on a proper
interpretation of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act, young
persons are &#147;unable&#148; to retain counsel privately even if their
parents can afford to do so and there is no meaningful impediment
to their doing so.
[3]  In her reasons for judgment, reported at (1998), 128
C.C.C.(3d) 149, the youth court judge reviewed the relatively
simple facts of the application and the mandatory nature of the
order under s.11(4)(b) upon a showing of the statutory
preconditions.  The youth court judge then said of the central
issue:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The only issue that a court might consider in determining an
          order under subsection 11(4) is whether the young person is
          unable to obtain counsel. In other words if the young person is
          indeed able to obtain counsel, then a section 11 order need not
          be made. The real question in the two cases at hand are whether
          the financial position of the young person's parents can be
          considered in considering whether the young person is &quot;unable&quot; to
          obtain counsel. Subsection 11(4) clearly refers to the young
          person's inability to obtain counsel not to the family's
          inability. Indeed, it would seem contradictory to every other
          section of the Young Offenders Act to consider the parent's
          financial means when determining the young person's
          constitutional rights and legal rights and responsibilities.
          Paragraph 3(e.1) of the Young Offenders Act states that &quot;young
          persons who commit offences should ... bear responsibility for
          their contraventions&quot;. Not the mother, not the father, but the
          young person. As stated by Provincial Judge John Kukerin in R. v.
          T.W.P. supra, at paragraph [54], &quot;there is nothing in the Young
          Offenders Act requiring parents or guardians to be financially
          responsible for their children's legal expenses. At most
          paragraph 3(h) of the Young Offenders Act states that parents
          have responsibility for care and supervision of their children.&quot;
          [emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The youth court judge considered the reasons for judgment of
Feldman J. of the youth court in R. v. A.C. et al. (1998), 18
C.R. (5th) 313 (Ont. Prov. Div.) in which Feldman J. held that
parental resources were relevant to a determination of a young
person&#146;s ability to retain counsel privately.  The youth court
judge rejected Feldman  J.&#146;s approach on the grounds that the
parents have no moral or statutory obligation to provide for
their children&#146;s legal expenses and that inquiring into the
parent&#146;s finances would pose serious practical difficulties.
[5]  The provisions for the right to counsel and for court
authority to order that counsel be provided are found in 
s.11 of the Young Offenders Act and specifically:
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.(1) Right to retain counsel &#150; A young person has the
          right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, and to
          exercise that right personally, at any stage of proceedings
          against the young person and prior to and during any
          consideration of whether, instead of commencing or continuing
          judicial proceedings against the young person under this Act, to
          use alternative measures to deal with the young person.
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.(4) Trial, hearing or review before
          youth court or review board &#150; Where a young
          person at his trial or at a hearing or review
          referred to in subsection (3) wishes to
          obtain counsel but is unable to do so, the
          youth court before which the hearing, trial
          or review is held or the review board before
          which the review is held
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) shall, where there is a legal aid or
          assistance program available in the province
          where the hearing, trial or review is held,
          refer the young person to that program for
          the appointment of counsel; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) where no legal aid or assistance
          program is available or the young person is
          unable to obtain counsel through such a
          program, may, and on the request of the young
          person shall, direct that the young person be
          represented by counsel.
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.(5) Appointment of counsel &#150; Where a
          direction is made under paragraph (4)(b) in
          respect of a young person, the Attorney
          General of the province in which the
          direction is made shall appoint counsel, or
          cause counsel to be appointed, to represent
          the young person.</pre>
    <pre>     Issue
          </pre>
    <pre>               Did the youth court judge err in holding that the court
          cannot consider the means of the parents of the young person in
          determining whether that young person is &#147;unable&#148; to retain
          counsel?</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[6]  It must be stated clearly at the outset that this case
is not about the right of a young person to be represented at
trial by counsel. That, in my view, is a given. This case deals
with the extent of the duty of the youth court to participate in
the administrative process available to fund and provide counsel
for young persons.  The point of inquiring into
parental financial resources before making an order under
s.11(4)(b) is not to attempt to limit the right to counsel in any
way.  Rather, it is an attempt to ensure that state-provided
counsel be reserved, as contemplated in the Young Offenders Act,
for those young persons who are genuinely unable to obtain
counsel.
[7]  Under the scheme of the Act, the assistance of the court is
brought into play where the young person advises the court that
he or she wishes to obtain counsel but is unable to do so.  It is
the inability of the young person to obtain counsel that triggers
the remaining provisions in s.11.  In this province, the youth
court judge then refers the young person to OLAP which
administers the program for the appointment of counsel in civil
and criminal cases. In practice, the young person has often made
an application to OLAP prior to appearing before the youth court
judge and in these circumstances the preliminary step set out in
s.11(4)(a) need not be repeated. Where the young person has
qualified for legal aid and a certificate to that effect has been
issued, a trial date can be set.  Where the young person, for any
reason, has been refused a legal aid certificate, under
s.11(4)(b), the youth court may, and on the request of the young
person shall, direct that the young person be represented by
counsel. The only issue before this court is whether the youth
court judge is required to hold some sort of enquiry, however
cursory, to determine why the young person was refused a legal
aid certificate.  The purpose of such of an enquiry would be to
ensure that the young person is unable to obtain counsel.
[8]  It was the position of the youth court judge, supported and
enlarged upon in this court by the respondent and intervener,
that the inquiry is restricted to asking the young person if, in
this case, she is able to obtain counsel.  If the answer is
&#147;Yes&#148;, there is no problem.  If the answer is &#147;No&#148;, the youth
court judge is mandated by s.11(4)(b) to direct that the young
person be represented by counsel.  There is no inquiry as to the
reason why legal aid was refused.  In the case on appeal, the
reason given by OLAP in refusing a certificate to the young
person was that her parents had the financial means to retain
counsel privately.  The youth court judge ruled that this reason
was irrelevant.  On this appeal, the respondent and the
intervener made the point that there was no reason that could be
relevant.  The responsibility of the youth court judge was to
determine if the young person had a certificate.  If the answer
was in the negative, the youth court judge was mandated to direct
that the young person be represented by counsel.  The effect of
this direction was to bring s.11(5) into play. The Attorney
General would then appoint counsel or cause counsel to be
appointed.  In this province, the Attorney General as a matter of
practice directs OLAP to issue a certificate, effectively
overruling the administrative decision already made.
[9]  It is the position of the Crown, as appellant, that a
hearing is required before the youth court can have recourse to
s.11(4)(b).  As a practical matter, this modest remedy  will be
available without any substantial inquiry. However, the Crown
submits that before ordering the reallocation of scarce state
resources under this section to be paid to the benefit of a young
person of means (whether those means are her own or are available
to her through her parents), the court should be satisfied that,
notwithstanding those means, the young person is unable to retain
counsel.  It is not sufficient for the young person to simply
attend with a legal aid refusal based on personal and parental
means.  There must be some showing that the legal aid assessment
&#150; which amounts to a conclusion that the young person is able to
obtain counsel &#150; should not be dispositive in the particular
case.
[10] I agree with the position of the Crown.  OLAP is financed
and largely administered by the province.  It is available to
citizens in criminal and civil cases where the party applying
meets the financial and other criteria set by the administrators
of the plan.  A party applying is not entitled to counsel as of
right.  In fact, the Supreme Court has recently affirmed in
Winters v. Legal Services Society [1999] S.C.J. No.49 (Q.L.) that
a legal aid plan retains the discretion to determine, on a case-
by-case basis, the level of legal services to which an individual
is entitled.  Nor is a young person entitled, as of right, to
state-provided counsel under the Young Offenders Act.  In this
conclusion, I draw some comfort from the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada in New Brunswick (Minister of Health and
Community Services) v. G.(J.) [1999] S.C.J. No. 47 (Q.L.), in
which the Court held that the constitutional right to state-
funded counsel in the context of a custody hearing involving a
mother and the state is not absolute where the parent wishes to
retain counsel and is unable to afford one, but is limited to
situations in which the provision of such counsel is necessary to
ensure a fair hearing.
[11] Unlike in G.(J.), the right to counsel in this case is found
in the direct language of the statutory provision rather than in
s.7 of the Charter.  However, as in G.(J.), supra, she is not
entitled to be provided with a state appointed counsel as of
right. The relevant provisions of the Young Offenders Act provide
for the appointment of state funded counsel where the young
person is &#147;unable&#148; to obtain counsel, not &#147;unwilling&#148; to retain
counsel privately.  The requirement of inability stated in the
opening sentence of s.11(4) is a precondition to the operation of
the rest of the section and, therefore, a youth court judge
cannot refer the young person to legal aid or order the provision
of counsel unless satisfied that the young person is unable to
obtain counsel.  It seems only logical that, because so much
turns on this inability, the youth court judge should conduct
some independent inquiry to ensure that there is actually an
inability to obtain counsel.
[12] The practical implication, therefore, is that where OLAP has
refused a certificate to the young person, the youth court should
make some enquiry as to why he or she was refused.  The extent of
the enquiry should be determined by the good judgment of the
youth court judge.  In my opinion, this will include a
consideration of the young person&#146;s ability to access the
resources normally available to a youth, including having
reasonable recourse to the financial resources of their parents.
As Demetrick J. put it in R. v. E.M.C. [1993] A.J. No. 578 (at
para.16):
          </pre>
    <pre>               What is repugnant, legally or socially, about requiring a
          youth or his parents to pay for any legal services the youth
          wants if they can afford it? Isn&#146;t that more logical than having
          those services paid for in such circumstances out of public
          funds?  Wouldn&#146;t allowing the type of judicial inquiry in issue
          help reduce the chance of public funds being spent needlessly
          through appointment of counsel for youths who one way or another
          are fully capable of obtaining counsel privately?</pre>
    <pre>[13] It should be noted that, although the decision in E.M.C. is
cited by all parties in this appeal for the proposition that the
inquiry into parental resources is inappropriate, the Provincial
Court Judge only made that finding because he felt bound by
another higher court case from Alberta and he expressed serious
reservations about the conclusion that he felt obliged to reach.
[14] On the other hand, where financial resources either do not
exist or for some other valid reason are not available to the
young person, then the young person is unable to obtain counsel.
In these circumstances, the preconditions of s.11(4) have been
met and the order under s.11(4)(b) must be made.  The mandatory
provision in s.11(4)(b) is only triggered once the youth court
judge is satisfied that the young person is legitimately unable
to obtain counsel.
[15] In this case, the youth court judge erred in failing to have
regard to, or to inquire into, the parental resources available
to the respondent.  The structure of s.11 provides that the youth
court judge has the responsibility to order that counsel be
provided and I simply cannot accept the argument that this must
be done without any enquiry at all.  In fact, the opposite must
be true.  Because the Act makes inability to obtain counsel the
touchstone for the analysis, the youth court judge has every
right to determine inability and has the discretion to determine
on a case-by-case basis when such inability actually exists.
This is similar in principle to the case-by-case inquiry mandated
by the Supreme Court in G.(J.), supra, to determine when state-
funded counsel is necessary to ensure a fair hearing.
[16] By the conclusion of argument, the respondent and the
intervener seemed prepared, albeit reluctantly, to concede that
if the young offender had personal assets or income sufficient to
permit him or her to retain counsel privately, there was no
justification for requiring OLAP to pay for counsel out of public
funds.  The young person was not &#147;unable&#148; to retain counsel.  The
emphasis of the argument then became the issue of the
accessibility of parental resources.  Here, the submission was
made that such an enquiry is a waste of time, because the young
offender&#146;s entitlement to counsel is not tied to the financial
resources of his or her parents.  The response of the Crown was
that unless enquiry is made, the youth court does not know
whether the parents have even been asked to assist in retaining
counsel.
[17] The arguments of the respondent and the intervener were in
large measure in terrorem.  They raised the spectre of young
persons in their early teens facing serious criminal charges
without benefit of legal representation.  Counsel could give no
examples in support of such a charge.  Indeed, there was no
evidence before the court that the interaction of the Young
Offenders Act with the mandate of OLAP to deliver legal
representation for young persons has not worked effectively or
will not work in the case in appeal.  This argument and others in
support of the order below that I will touch on briefly, while
couched in principle, are theoretical and hypothetical.
[18] The provisions for the supply of legal aid to young persons
must be looked at in the context of the Young Offenders Act.
Under that Act, the entitlement to counsel is not restricted to
what could be regarded as the more serious offences.  The
entitlement embraces all offences.  There is no requirement of a
showing that the young person may be denied a fair hearing.
However, the reality is that some offences are more serious than
others and some are more complex.  Accordingly, within the range
of possible offences, there are many that involve trials of short
duration where the cost of retaining private counsel is not
prohibitive and is available to persons of modest means. It is
the responsibility of those who administer the legal aid plan to
see that its limited resources are husbanded for those most in
need of representation and to ensure that the plan is not taken
advantage of by accused persons who have directly or indirectly
the resources to retain counsel privately.  To this end, OLAP
has, over time, developed certain financial criteria for
entitlement to a certificate for the provision of state funded
legal representation.  The reasonableness of these criteria is
not even raised as an issue in this appeal.  Rather, it is said
they have no application to young persons. There is no authority
for such a proposition.  If there were, there would be no
requirement in s.11 of the Young Offenders Act to have the matter
referred to OLAP in the first place.  If the young person is
going to obtain state-founded counsel in any event, why go
through such a charade? To in effect order OLAP to provided
counsel where its criteria for assistance have not been met is
destructive of the program itself.
[19] The arguments of the respondent and intervener ignore the
perfectly logical proposition that the characteristics of the
parent-child relationship in any particular case can be taken
into account by the youth court judge in the exercise of his or
her proper discretion.  The statute stresses inability to obtain
counsel, and the common-sense meaning of inability, at least as
regards a young person, must include a consideration of possible
access to the funds of one&#146;s parents. Although parental resources
are by no means the only consideration that will be taken into
account by the judge determining the issue of inability to obtain
counsel, they are certainly relevant to the inquiry.
[20] In my opinion, this is a case where the youth court should
work with OLAP to ensure that young persons and their families
who have the resources to fund, in some degree, the retention of
counsel do not take advantage of the legal aid plan.
Regrettably, the youth court judge in appeal considered the
administrative safeguards applied by OLAP in the administration
of its fund to be irrelevant, stating that parents have no moral
or statutory obligation to provide for their children&#146;s legal
expenses. Although correct about the lack of statutory
obligation, I think that she goes too far in concluding that
parents with adequate financial resources have no moral
obligation to assist in providing counsel for their children.
There certainly is nothing in the Young Offenders Act&#146;s
Declaration of Principle to support that conclusion.  The
Declaration recognizes, at s.3(1)(h), that &#147;parents have
responsibility for the care and supervision of their children&#148;.
This Court is mindful of the fact that there exists an
administrative process whereby OLAP strives to enlist the
financial resources of the parents of young persons seeking legal
aid.  Limiting the reach of financial scrutiny by OLAP respecting
young persons simply reduces the funds available to properly
compensate counsel in all cases, including cases involving young
persons.
[21] Other arguments of the respondent and the intervener were
largely emotional and unrelated to what is basically a problem of
statutory interpretation: what is the meaning of &#147;unable&#148; in the
context of the power of the court to order the Attorney General
to provide counsel where the young person is &#147;unable&#148; to do so?
They were also premised on the false assumption that any enquiry
into the resources of the parents, or indeed the young person,
was tantamount to the denial of counsel.  Counsel emphasized
the vulnerability of young persons and the fact that the criminal
charges could create stress between the young person and the parents.
The youth court, it is said, should do nothing to interfere with 
whatever process of reconciliation was ongoing between parent and
child by asking potentially embarrassing questions of the parents
as to their ability to provide any financial support to their child
in his or her present predicament.  Then, having argued in support 
of the supportive role of the parent in the proceedings, the 
respondent, in a complete non sequitur, submitted that it is 
preferable that the parents not provide counsel for the young person
because this might well cause the parents to sacrifice resources set
aside for siblings of the young person, might encourage the parents 
to interfere with the conduct of the trial of their child and
generally  create a potential for conflict in trial counsel
inclined to defer to the wishes of the parent who pays their fees
to the detriment of the best interests of the young client.
[22] The respondent also conjured up a pre-trial hearing to
resolve the issue between child and parent as to why the parent
should not pay for his or her defence.  No reason was advanced as
to why adversarial proceedings were called for when all parties
agreed that there was no power in the youth court to order the
parents to fund counsel.  Another submission of both the
respondent and the intervener was the trumpets reminder of our
international obligations directed toward the protection o f the
right of the child without explaining just what there is in the
present administration of OLAP that contravenes such obligations.
These arguments can hardly be described as going to statutory
interpretation.
[23] Finally, I am unimpressed with the argument that this court
should dismiss this appeal because there is the possibility that
legislation will be enacted soon which will address the issue of
the financial responsibility of a parent to a young offender in
the context of a criminal offence.  This court must decide this
case on the basis of the law as it stands and we will not play
the dangerous game of predicting the outcome of the vagaries of
the legislative process.
[24] In the final analysis, this case is about the simple matter
of the proper administrative process to be followed before a
youth court judge is required to order state-funded counsel for a
young offender.  Before the state pays for counsel, the inability
of the young person to obtain counsel must be established.  This
question cannot completely be answered without reference to the
finances of the young person&#146;s parents.  That is all that has
been decided in this case.  Nothing in this decision should be
read as in any way denigrating or casting doubt on the
proposition that young people in this province have the right to
counsel.
[25] I cannot leave this case without commenting again upon the
lack of a record that would justify the fears of the respondents&#146;
that the inquiry mandated by the Act could result in a young
person being deprived of the right to counsel.  I think we can
rely upon the continuing good sense of those who administer OLAP
and the youth court judges who conduct the necessary inquiries
under s.11(4) to see that this does not occur.  There is no
suggestion that it could occur in the case in appeal.  The
sweeping ruling of King J. as to the relevance of the parents&#146;
financial resources was unnecessary.  The system is working just
fine.  While not necessary to my reasoning in this case, I would
note that with the recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court in
G.S., supra, there is now an additional safeguard in that the
young person has an overriding constitutional right to a state
assisted counsel where the youth court judge is of the opinion
that to force him on without counsel would expose him to an
unfair trial.  I mention this only because it reposes in the
youth court judge an ultimate discretion to deal with any
situation that could arise from the mandatory inquiry under
s.11(4) of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[26] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, vacate the order King
J. of August 24, 1998, and return the matter for trial in the
youth court.  The youth court judge should entertain a fresh
application for counsel under s.11(4)(b) of the Young Offenders
Act.
