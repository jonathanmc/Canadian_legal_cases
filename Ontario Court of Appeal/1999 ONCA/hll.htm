    <pre>HEARD:         June 30, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the convictions by Cusinato J. dated September 24,
1997 and on appeal from the sentences imposed by Cusinato J.
dated October 1, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  There were two complainants in this case; both were the
younger sisters of the appellant&#146;s wife.  The two sisters
complained of sexual acts committed by the appellant, including
full acts of intercourse.  The appellant&#146;s position was a denial
of any sexual activity with respect to the one complainant but
his position with respect to the other is that, while there were
sexual acts, they were consensual and, in fact, it is apparently
accepted that a child was born of this second relationship.
[2]  There was no suggestion at trial that the acts with respect
to the one complainant were admissible against the appellant with
respect to the counts respecting the other complainant.  In these
circumstances, and particularly in the light of the different
defences put forward by the appellant, it was necessary for the
trial judge to give an appropriate limiting instruction.
[3]  The Crown concedes that the instruction given has its
shortcomings but she submits that it is, nevertheless, sufficient
in the circumstances.  We do not agree.  In the first place, the
trial judge did not make clear that the evidence called with
respect to the counts involving one complainant are not evidence
against the appellant with respect to the counts against the
second complainant.  While the trial judge did say that neither
complainant could testify or confirm the evidence of the other,
he puts it on the basis that they were not present when the acts
on the other were committed.  He should have said that, as a
matter of law, the allegations of the one complainant were
irrelevant and could not be used as evidence with reference to
the allegations involving the other complaint.
[4]  In the second place, even within the counts involving the
one complainant, the trial judge did not clearly explain to the
jurors that they could not use the evidence of all of the counts
to prove any one count.
[5]  The Crown submits that the trial judge, on numerous
occasions, stated that the jury must consider each count
separately.  However, such an instruction was criticized by this
court in R. v. MB (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) at 353 at p. 368 in
paragraph [35]:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In his careful and helpful submissions, Mr. Trotter conceded
          that if the jury were not adequately instructed to treat the
          counts separately, there must be a new trial.  He did not suggest
          that the proviso in s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code could
          be applied.  He argued, however, that the instruction in excerpt
          (b) would be understood by the jury as an instruction to treat
          the evidence relevant to each count separately.  I cannot agree.
          The instructions taken as a whole at most made it clear that the
          jury must return a separate verdict in relation to each count.
          Those directions cannot fairly be read as restricting the
          evidence relevant to any particular count to that count alone.
          Nothing in the balance of the charge to the jury would lead the
          jury to that conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Another problem is with respect to the defence put forward
to the allegations of the second complainant.  It is conceded
that the acts of the appellant, even if consensual, meant that he
was guilty of adultery and that that adultery resulted in the
birth of a child.  There was no instruction about the potential
misuse of this evidence of discreditable conduct, that is to say
that it cannot be considered as proof that the appellant was the
sort of person who would commit the offences charged.  In our
view, there must be a new trial.
[7]  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to deal with the
other grounds of appeal.
[8]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment below is
set aside and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
