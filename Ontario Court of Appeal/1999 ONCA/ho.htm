</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Watt,
sitting with a jury, dated June 21, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>ABELLA J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Elena Tchoudakova, a 23 year-old recent immigrant from
Russia who was studying interior design in Toronto, was killed on
January 9, 1995.  Her beaten body was found in the bathtub of her
apartment on January 12th.  On June 21, 1996, the appellant,
Gilbert Ho, a friend of Ms. Tchoudakova, was convicted of first-
degree murder in connection with her death.  He gave four
statements to police, but did not testify at trial.
[2]  The Crown&#146;s theory was that Mr. Ho was obsessed with Ms.
Tchoudakova and killer her in a jealous rage.  The defence at
trial was that there was insufficient evidence to identify Mr. Ho
as the murderer and that the verdict was, accordingly,
unreasonable.  In addition, the appellant challenged the
introduction of aspects of the expert evidence of Dr. Robert
Wood, a forensic odontologist, and Dr. Ron Langevin, a forensic
psychologist.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Ms. Tchoudakova arrived in Canada in February 1992.  In June
of that year, she married Igor Shor, a young man she had known in
Russia, who arrived in Canada two years before she did.  They
separated less than three months later, but remained friends.
[4]  Ms. Tchoudakova met Gilbert Ho early in the summer of 1994
when she was hired as a part-time waitress in the bar he managed.
Over time, he became, as his employer Ronald LeBlanc testified,
smitten to the point of obsession with Ms. Tchoudakova.  His
preoccupation with her became so intense that it affected his
work.  He went to Lake Placid with her for a &#147;romantic&#148; weekend
in June 1994, and, in the same month, drove her to Hull, Quebec
so that she could make arrangements to get a passport.  The Hull
trip resulted in both of them being fired since they missed work
for two days.
[5]  Mr. Ho was married and had two young children.  He was 32
years old at the time of his relationship with Ms. Tchoudakova.
[6]  Ms. Tchoudakova had been living with her boyfriend, Edward
Garkavi, for a year and a half when Mr. Ho met her.  She moved
out of Mr. Garkavi&#146;s apartment at the beginning of August 1994,
and moved into an apartment rented for her by Mr. Ho.  She and
Mr. Garkavi, however, continued to see each other several times a
week at her new apartment.  They talked daily and their sexual
relationship was ongoing. Mr. Garkavi kept some of his clothing
and personal items at Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s apartment.
[7]  William Sergautis was a stockbroker who started dating Ms.
Tchoudakova in the summer of 1994 while she was still living with
Mr. Garkavi.  They were involved in an &#147;intense whirlwind
relationship&#148;, and were even engaged briefly in the fall of 1994.
Mr. Sergautis testified that Mr. Ho appeared to be very
possessive of Ms. Tchoudakova, but he was under the impression
that the relationship with Mr. Ho was a platonic one.
[8]  Mr. Sergautis described his own relationship with Ms.
Tchoudakova as increasingly volatile.  Their engagement was
terminated in December 1994 after a serious argument. Mr.
Sergautis tried to kick down Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s apartment door,
eventually using a sledgehammer, to recover the engagement ring
he had given her.  Once inside, he threatened her with a pair of
garden shears, pulled her hair, and demanded the return of the
ring.  She received a cut on her right breast as a result of this
assault.  Ms. Tchoudakova was very upset after this incident and
changed her phone number.
[9]  No one knew that her relationship with Mr. Ho was a sexual
one.  Mr. Ho, on the other hand, knew about Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s
sexual involvement with other men, and that she was continuing
her relationship with Mr. Garkavi.
[10] Mr. Ho wanted to marry Ms. Tchoudakova, but Ms. Tchoudakova
told him that having just extricated herself from a long-term
relationship with Mr. Garkavi, she was unwilling to make a new
commitment. She preferred merely to have &#147;recreational sex&#148; with
him.
[11] On July 28, 1994, after Mr. Ho and Ms. Tchoudakova were
fired, they rented a one-bedroom apartment as co-tenants from
August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995.  The apartment was to be Ms.
Tchoudakova&#146;s residence.  Mr. Ho assumed responsibility for the
monthly rent of $678.  He continued to live with his wife and two
children in their apartment, and stayed overnight with Ms.
Tchoudakova in her apartment only three times.
[12] For purposes of getting the tenancy approved, Mr. Ho told
the rental agent that he made $75,000 annually and that Ms.
Tchoudakova earned an annual salary of $22,000.  In fact, he was
receiving unemployment insurance and, when these payments
stopped, social assistance.
[13] Mr. Ho paid the first and last month&#146;s rent and, in
addition, provided postdated cheques for the months of September,
October, November and December, 1994.  The four post-dated
cheques Mr. Ho gave to the landlord were all returned NSF.  In
December, a fifth cheque in the amount of $3,000, which purported
to cover the arrears, was also returned NSF.  He was the only one
who dealt with any tenancy issues.
[14] In October 1994, the landlord started eviction proceedings
for non-payment of rent.  These were temporarily delayed as a
result of a letter from Mr. Ho complaining of problems in the
apartment.  The eviction was re-activated in December.
[15] Mr. Ho was the main source of income for Ms. Tchoudakova.
In addition to renting the apartment for her, he used his savings
of $3,000-$4,000 to buy her a bedroom set, a television, a VCR, a
stereo, and a microwave.  In total, he spent about $5,000 for her
benefit, including giving her money for a trip to Portland,
Oregon to visit her grandmother.  Mr. Ho acknowledged to police
that he would have done &#147;pretty much&#148; anything for Ms.
Tchoudakova.
[16] Ms. Tchoudakova spent the Christmas holidays with a woman
who was a friend from school.  While she was away, Mr. Garkavi
stayed in her apartment and looked after her dog.
[17] After she returned from holiday early in January 1995, Ms.
Tchoudakova spent time with Mr. Garkavi.  They last had sexual
intercourse on Friday, January 6, 1995.  Two days later, after an
argument, they decided to terminate their relationship again. Ms.
Tchoudakova called him at 2:00 a.m. that night, but they spoke
only briefly.  Ms. Tchoudakova was upset about the relationship
with Mr. Garkavi ending.
[18] Albert Shaheen, a friend of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s, was a retired
salesman who had some experience in marketing and sales.  He
visited Ms. Tchoudakova on the afternoon of Sunday, January 8th
after Mr. Garkavi had left, to assist her with a project she was
trying to complete for school.  He left shortly after 11:00 p.m.
that night.  After he left, Ms. Tchoudakova met another of her
friends, Michael Khanaliev, and went with him to a local
restaurant until about 1:00 a.m.
[19] At around noon the next day, Mr. Shaheen called Ms.
Tchoudakova and made arrangements to help her with her project at
11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, January 10th at her apartment.
[20] On January 6, 1995, Mr. Ho was advised by the landlord that
he and Ms. Tchoudakova would be evicted on the 9th or 10th of
January at noon.  On Monday morning, January 9, 1995, Mr. Ho
called the landlord, hoping to delay the eviction.  The
landlord&#146;s agent advised him that when the Sheriff came, Mr. Ho
would be allowed to gather some possessions and the door would
then be locked.  When the Sheriff did not arrive at noon that
day, Mr. Ho thought that the eviction would take place the next
day, Tuesday, January 10, 1995.
[21] At 11:30 Monday morning, Mr. Ho came to the apartment  to
help Ms. Tchoudakova both with her school project and with the
documents she needed for her divorce from Mr. Shor.  During the
afternoon, they did their errands separately, then met back at
the apartment at about 6:30 p.m., continuing to work both on the
divorce papers and the school project.  It was the theory of the
Crown that Mr. Ho killed her later that night.
[22] At about 6:45 p.m., Ms. Tchoudakova called  Mr. Shor, who
lived in Calgary, to tell him that she needed a divorce so that
she could get a student loan.  According to Mr. Shor, she sounded
calm.
[23] After the telephone call to Mr. Shor, Mr. Ho and Ms.
Tchoudakova had dinner between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m.  Mr. Ho said
they had quiche, and possibly some toast.  After dinner, he
washed the dishes, including a frying pan.  Although a frying pan
was the kitchen utensil Ms. Tchoudakova used to make her
favourite dish - which contained meat, carrots and onion - Mr. Ho
told police that she did not make that meal for herself that
evening.
[24] Mr. Khanaliev called at about 10:30 p.m. and they spoke
briefly.  He too testified that Ms. Tchoudakova did not appear to
be nervous.  She asked Mr. Khanaliev to call her later in the
evening before he went to work, even though it meant a phone call
to her at around 2:30 or 3:00 a.m.   She also told him she would
be home the next day to finish her project.  Mr. Ho was present
during this conversation.  Mr. Khanaliev did not call back that
night.
[25] After dinner, according to Mr. Ho, they worked on the school
project until about 12:15 a.m.  Then, as was customary before
they had sex, Ms. Tchoudakova took a shower and Mr. Ho walked her
dog.
[26] Mr. Ho claimed that when he returned to the apartment
fifteen minutes later, Ms. Tchoudakova was in bed. He undressed
and joined her in bed.  Ms. Tchoudakova told him she did not wish
to have intercourse. They gave each other a massage for almost an
hour.  At about 1:30 a.m., Ms. Tchoudakova suddenly asked Mr. Ho
what time it was, told him that he had to go, and rushed him out
of the apartment.  Mr. Ho assumed she was expecting Mr. Garkavi,
so he left immediately.  Even though he did not ejaculate, he
told police he was not frustrated by the abruptness with which
the sexual activity was terminated by Ms. Tchoudakova.
[27] Mr. Ho said he left the apartment and took the last subway
home just before 2:00 a.m.  The next day, Tuesday, January 10,
1995, he called Ms. Tchoudakova  at 10:15 a.m., and then again at
2:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, January 11, 1995, he
called her at 11:20 a.m.
[28] Mr. Ho&#146;s first voicemail message at 10:14 on Tuesday
morning, January 10th was flippant, even when referring to the
pending eviction:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Gilbert HO:    Hey Princess.  It&#146;s me.  Good
          morning.  Okay, the um,(tone)
          </pre>
    <pre>               Gilbert HO:    Divorce stuff is all done
          waiting for Federal Express.  I&#146;ve got a copy
          of it already for you and a copy of the
          certificate, so not to worry there.  Okay, so
          I hope you got the rent money by the way
          because otherwise we&#146;re gonna get evicted.
          Or you will I don&#146;t.  (Laughs)  And now, the
          ah, labels, okay, I don&#146;t have any clear
          labels with me, so if you need it by today,
          let me know and I&#146;ll go out and buy some.
          Otherwise we can photocopy it onto, to clear
          stuff.  Like you said at that place and then
          ah, I won&#146;t need to buy any and I&#146;ll just
          print it on plain paper okay?  So call me
          back and let me know.  Talk to you later,
          bye.  And oh, and ah, if you need anything
          beside Coke, let me know okay?  Bye sweetie.
          Talk to you later.  See ya (inaudible) bye.</pre>
    <pre>[29] At about 2:00 or 2:30 on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Ho arrived
at the office of Miguel Viera, the rental manager in Ms.
Tchoudakova&#146;s building, bringing some groceries for her
apartment.  He asked Mr. Viera if he had seen Ms. Tchoudakova,
since he had been ringing her apartment, but getting no answer.
[30] Mr. Ho usually waited in the lobby for Ms. Tchoudakova.  On
this occasion, however, for the first time, he waited in the
rental office with Mr. Viera for 2 to 2 ½ hours.  He engaged him
in lengthy conversation, relating intimate details of his
relationship with Ms. Tchoudakova, including her sexual practices
and his frustration with the relationship.  Mr. Viera listened,
but did not participate in the conversation.
[31] Mr. Ho waited in the rental office until it closed at 5:00
p.m., at which time Mr. Viera advised Mr. Ho that since his name
was on the lease, he could go into the apartment and leave the
groceries there.  Mr. Ho declined, and asked Mr. Viera to keep
the groceries in his office refrigerator.  Mr. Ho&#146;s explanation
to the police about why he did not want to go into the apartment
with the groceries, was that he was afraid of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s
reaction.
[32] Mr. Ho and Edward Garkavi went to Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s
apartment together on Wednesday, January 11th.  They looked
through the mail slot and saw the dog and an open balcony door,
but Mr. Garkavi testified that they did not try to open the door
because they knew that Ms. Tchoudakova did not like to be
surprised.  Mr. Garkavi then called the school Ms. Tchoudakova
attended, and was told that she and a colleague were talking to a
teacher.  As a result of that information, Mr. Garkavi and Mr. Ho
stopped the search for the day.
[33] On Thursday, January 12th, Mr. Garkavi called another
friend, Mark Milman, and told him that he had not heard from Ms.
Tchoudakova in days.  Mr. Milman had expressed this same kind of
concern to Mr. Ho earlier in the week, but said that Mr. Ho did
not seem very worried at that point.
[34] Mr. Ho went to the apartment with Mr. Milman on Thursday.
They asked Mr. Viera, the rental manager, to open the door.  The
apartment door was not locked.  Mr. Milman testified that when he
opened the bedroom door, he saw a lot of blood, open dresser
drawers, and sheets on the floor.
[35] Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body was found in a bathtub full of water,
her head beaten in, and nylons tied around her neck, wrists, and
ankles.  A hammer, an empty container of Pine-Sol, a dildo, and a
hair brush were found in the bathtub. Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s face had
been smashed with a blunt instrument.  Her killer had inflicted
about 20 blows. There were defensive wounds on her hands and on
the back of her arms.  Mr. Ho called the police, and, according
to Mr. Viera, appeared visibly shaken.
[36] The Chief Forensic Pathologist at the office of the Chief
Coroner, Dr. David Chiasson, performed the autopsy.  He testified
that the condition of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s skin when her body was
discovered was such that it appeared she had been submerged in
the bath water for at least three or four days.  He concluded
that Ms. Tchoudakova died from blunt force head injuries or
possibly from drowning.
[37] An examination by him of her stomach contents indicated that
there was a large quantity of onions, meat, carrots and green
vegetables.  While he admitted that stomach content analysis was
a controversial and somewhat uncertain method for determining the
time of death, Dr. Chiasson was nonetheless of the opinion that
death had likely occurred within 1 to 1 ½ hours after Ms.
Tchoudakova had eaten.
[38] Dr. Frederick Jaffe, a pathologist called by the defence,
agreed that digestion analysis is too uncertain to be scientific,
but nonetheless expressed the opinion that a meal is usually
digested within 4 hours.  It was his view that if Ms. Tchoudakova
had eaten dinner between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., death had
likely occurred prior to 1:00 a.m. that night.  But Dr. Jaffe
pointed out that unlike Dr. Chiasson, he had not actually seen
the stomach contents.  He therefore deferred both to Dr.
Chiasson&#146;s presence at the autopsy and to his expertise
generally, with respect to the timing of the death based on a
stomach content analysis.
[39] Dr. Susan Kern, a forensic biologist at the Centre of
Forensic Science, testified that the pattern of blood staining in
the bedroom indicated that Ms. Tchoudakova was struck in the
bedroom and then dragged to the bathtub.  She testified that
semen found in Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body matched the DNA profile of
Mr. Garkavi, but could not be assessed for the length of time it
had been in Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body. Dr. Chiasson&#146;s evidence, on
the other hand, was that semen can remain in a body cavity for up
to a week.  It was his view that since cold temperatures could
slow the course of semen decomposition, Mr. Garkavi&#146;s semen could
have stayed in Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body since January 6th because
her body had been in cold water for days.
[40] Both Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s and Mr. Ho&#146;s fingerprints were found
on the hot water tap in the bathroom sink.  Mr. Ho&#146;s fingerprints
were also found on the kitchen hot water tap and on the handle of
a hacksaw in the toolbox located on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s balcony.
[41] There was a bite mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s left breast. Dr.
Chiasson characterized the mark as an injury, and one which
appeared to have occurred at the same time as the other injuries.
His description of the breast injury was as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>    In my view, I would not expect the injury that is seen in
    this photograph to occur simply as a result of the teeth coming
    into contact, sort of a gentle contact.  The fact that the skin
    is damaged, is abraded, requires a minimal degree of force to
    have been applied, at least a minimal degree of force to be
    applied.</pre>
    <pre>[42] Dr. Jaffe, based on an examination of a photograph of the
breast mark, also described it as an injury.  He characterized it
as a bruise that resulted from sufficient force to leave a mark.
In his view, there was some internal bleeding related to the
injury on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast, but no sign of external
bleeding.
[43] A forensic odontologist, Dr. Robert Wood, was present during
the autopsy performed by Dr. Chiasson.  He was qualified at trial
as an expert in the effect on skin of different kinds of biting.
Based on his experience, it was his view that the degree of force
required to cause the injury on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast was
&#147;significant&#148; or &#147;extreme.&#148;
[44] Dr. Ron Langevin, a forensic psychologist called as an
expert by the defence, testified that injuries can occur during
sexual relations even if the sexual activity is consensual.  In
his view, it is not unusual for marks to be left during the &#147;heat
of the excitement&#148; of sexual contact.
[45] At trial, it was conceded by Mr. Ho that the bite mark on
Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast was his.  In an earlier statement to
police, he admitted that in the course of their sexual activity
on Monday night, Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast was in his mouth but he
denied biting her.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[46] The Crown&#146;s theory was that Mr. Ho was obsessed with Ms.
Tchoudakova, realized that he could not have her, and went into a
rage for a number of cumulative reasons.  He wanted to marry her,
but knew that she continued to see Mr. Garkavi and others, and
was not interested in a commitment from Mr. Ho; she was about to
be evicted from the apartment he had rented for her, and
therefore his financial usefulness was about to end; and he was
angry and frustrated that his sexual activity with her on the
night of January 9, 1995 was abruptly interrupted so she could
see Mr. Garkavi.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The appellant&#146;s submission that the verdict is unreasonable
is based on the following:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Notwithstanding the evidence that Mr. Sergautis and a friend
  were at a movie and dinner until almost midnight on the night of
  the murder, Mr. Sergautis was nonetheless the more likely
  assailant since he had broken into Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s apartment
  and assaulted her only one month prior to her death.  The attack
  by Mr. Sergautis on Ms. Tchoudakova was traumatic for her and
  caused her to tell a friend that she was afraid of Mr. Sergautis
  and his family.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  This assault resulted in charges being laid against Mr.
  Sergautis.  These charges would have jeopardized his pending
  application for a visa to the United States. Mr. Sergautis,
  therefore, had a motive for killing Ms. Tchoudakova.  (The
  charges against Mr. Sergautis were dropped in March 1995 after
  Mr. Sergautis provided police with a dental impression.)</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The turbulence of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s relationship with Mr.
  Garkavi made him a suspect as well, particularly since on Sunday,
  January 8, 1995, the day before her death, there had been an
  upsetting argument between them.  Moreover, the DNA profile of
  the semen found in Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body belonged to Mr.
  Garkavi.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Other than the bite mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s left breast,
  there was no forensic evidence linking Mr. Ho to the murder.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The evidence about the amount of force necessary to place a
  bite mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast was inconclusive.  Only Dr.
  Wood gave evidence that the amount of force required to cause the
  mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s breast was &#147;significant&#148; or &#147;extreme.&#148;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The Crown did not sufficiently establish that the time of
  death was January 9, 1995 and, as a result, did not establish
  that Mr. Ho had the exclusive opportunity to commit the murder.
  The stomach content analysis was too unreliable to be used to
  determine the time of death.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The evidence that Mr. Ho dominated or attempted to control
  Ms. Tchoudakova was merely speculative.  Mr. Ho&#146;s relationship
  with Ms. Tchoudakova was a protective one, and he acted as her
  confidant when she was in a crisis, including the time she wanted
  to leave Mr. Garkavi in the summer of 1994 and when Mr. Sergautis
  assaulted her in December.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  There was, in addition, evidence from a number of witnesses
  that Mr. Ho and Ms. Tchoudakova appeared to enjoy each other&#146;s
  company and were affectionate with one another.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[48] The court&#146;s jurisdiction to quash a conviction on the
grounds that it is unreasonable, is found in s. 686(1)(a)(i),

    <pre>          686(1)  On the hearing of an appeal against a
          conviction &#133;., the court of appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  may allow the appeal where it is of
          the opinion that
               </pre>
    <pre>               (i)  the verdict should be set aside on
               the ground that is unreasonable or cannot be
               supported by the evidence,</pre>
    <pre>[49] The scrutiny for unreasonableness requires that this court
&#147;conduct its own, albeit limited, review of the evidence adduced
at trial&#148; (R. v. Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 at 540).
[50] In R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at 186, McIntyre J.
summarized the governing principles for appellate courts:
          </pre>
    <pre>     The function of the Court of Appeal, under s. 613(1)(a)(i)
     of the Criminal Code, goes beyond merely finding that there is
     evidence to support a conviction.  The Court must determine on
     the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that a
     properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably
     have rendered.  While the Court of Appeal must not merely
     substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the
     test the Court must re-examine and to some extent reweigh and
     consider the effect of the evidence.  This process will be the
     same whether the case is based on circumstantial or direct
     evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[51] Despite the appellant&#146;s submissions about the evidence
deflecting guilt away from Mr. Ho, there was, in my view, ample
evidence upon which a properly charged jury could reasonably have
agreed with the Crown&#146;s theory that Mr. Ho&#146;s obsession and
jealousy over Ms. Tchoudakova created a fatally destructive rage
in him on Monday night, January 9, 1995.  The following
paragraphs set out some of the evidence supporting the
reasonableness of the verdict.
[52] A number of people had testified that Mr. Ho appeared to be
obsessed with Ms. Tchoudakova.  Mr. Ho&#146;s former employer, Ronald
LeBlanc, testified that Mr. Ho visited him a few times after Ms.
Tchoudakova&#146;s death to discuss the killing, and asked him if he
told the police that he was obsessed with Ms. Tchoudakova.
[53] Mr. Ho&#146;s financial destitution was the result of his
contributions to Ms. Tchoudakova.  He used practically his entire
savings on her.  After she was evicted, as she was imminently to
be, he would no longer be able to be of financial assistance to
her, and, according to the Crown, would therefore lose his hold
over her.  In none of his four statements to the police, did he
mention the pending eviction.
[54] Mr. Ho lied about whether he had bitten Ms. Tchoudakova
during sex with her on the night of January 9, 1995.  Only at
trial was the concession made by the defence that the bite mark
was his.  In fact, Mr. Ho told police that his sexual relations
with Ms. Tchoudakova were always gentle.  In response to the
question of whether he had ever left marks on her body, he
responded:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No, I&#146;ve never, uh, I  don&#146;t  leave
	  marks on her body or  nothing, but, uh, she&#146;s
	  never  told  me  that  I left any marks and I
          never bite hard enough to leave marks.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   No?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.  She&#146;s scratched me a couple of
          times but.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Yeah.  Did she bi&#146; did you bite her
          that night?  Hard?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You were gentle with her that night?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   [Appellant nods yes in video]</pre>
    <pre>[55] Notwithstanding this statement, two pathologists, Drs.
Chiasson and Jaffe, were of the view that the bite mark on the
breast could be considered an injury, and Dr. Wood was of the
view that the force used was significant.
[56] Mr. Ho&#146;s conduct after the murder could have led the jury to
conclude that he was attempting to &#147;cover his tracks.&#148;  Despite
his numerous phone calls to Ms. Tchoudakova, he made no serious
effort to try to find out why she was not responding to his
calls, even though he had arranged to see her on Tuesday and
believed that she was about to be evicted from the apartment.
[57] The rest of Mr. Ho&#146;s voicemail messages were as jocular as
the one he left on Tuesday morning, reflecting no sense of
urgency:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Tuesday, January 10, 2:00 p.m.:

          downstairs.  Ah, the rental office let me put
          it in the caretaker&#146;s fridge.  Okay, there&#146;s

          </pre>
    <pre>          Gilbert HO:    Princess, good morning.
          Ah, where are you?  (Tone)
          </pre>
    <pre>          Gilbert HO:    Everybody&#146;s looking for
          you.  Okay, can you give me a call.  Mark
          called me last night and said Eddie was
          trying to get ahold of you so you&#146;re not with
          Eddie and you&#146;re not with Mark, so nobody
          knows where you are.  So can you call us
          please.  Okay?  Please call us.  We&#146;re just a
          little worried to make sure you&#146;re okay,

          Just talk to the super or the rental office.
          I&#146;ll see you a little later.  I have your
          labels okay?  Bye.  Call me please.  My
          pager.  Thanks.  Bye.</pre>
    <pre>[58] The transcript of his first telephone message to Ms.
Tchoudakova at 10:14 a.m. on Tuesday morning (set out above in
paragraph 27), was particularly bizarre.  Mr. Ho knew when he
made that call that she had no money, that he had no money, and
that she was about to be evicted.  In the context of these
realities, his flippant message could have been seen by the jury
as part of a deliberately nonchalant pose by Mr. Ho to create an
impression that he had no reason to worry about Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s
well-being.
[59] It was a unique act for him to wait in the rental manager&#146;s
office for any period of time, let alone for over 2 hours.  His
attendance with Mr. Garkavi at the apartment on Wednesday without
going in, and then his going again the next day with Mr. Milman,
could also cumulatively have been seen by the jury as behaviour
indicative of someone manipulating events so it would appear that
he saw nothing unusual in Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s three-day silence.
[60] By his own admission, Mr. Ho was alone with Ms. Tchoudakova
on Monday, January 9, 1995 from at least 6:30 p.m. until 1:30
a.m.  There was no evidence that anyone saw or spoke to Ms.
Tchoudakova after that night.
[61] The time of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s death was estimated through a
number of indicators:  the condition of her skin;  the results of
the stomach content analysis; voicemail recordings seized at her
apartment on January 12, 1995 indicating that she had not
answered the phone after January 9th;  the fact that the last
pill taken from her birth control package was &#147;Monday&#148;;  the fact
that Mr. Garkavi, Mr. Milman, and a friend from school all
indicated that they could not reach her by telephone after
January 9th; the fact that Albert Sheen, who had an appointment
with her for lunch on January 10th, said she answered neither the
door, nor his phone calls that day;  and the fact that Mr. Shor
tried unsuccessfully to contact her on January 11th when he
received the divorce papers. There was, therefore, evidence from
which the jury could reasonably conclude that the murder took
place on the night of Monday, January 9, 1995 during the time
when Mr. Ho admitted he was alone with her.
[62] There was also evidence which could lead the jury reasonably
to conclude that Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s killer was someone she knew.
There was no sign of forced entry into her apartment or that
anything in the apartment had been taken or disturbed, other than
evidence that efforts had been made to clean up the blood in the
bathroom and in the hallway connecting the bedroom to the
bathroom.  Whoever killed Ms. Tchoudakova was sufficiently
familiar with the apartment to know where the hammer, the dildo,
and her nylons were kept.
[63] Finally, the jury saw almost five hours of Mr. Ho&#146;s
videotaped statements and heard 1 ½ hours of his audio statement.
[64] The judge&#146;s charge was an excellent one &#150; balanced, fair and
instructive.    It was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude,
based on all of the evidence available to it, including Mr. Ho&#146;s
misrepresentations, contradictions, and outright lies, that Mr.
Ho was the person who killed Ms. Tchoudakova.</pre>
    <pre>Expert evidence</pre>
    <pre>Dr. Robert Wood</pre>
    <pre>[65] Dr. Robert Wood, a forensic odontologist, was a Crown expert
on bite mark identification. The appellant argued that the trial
judge erred in permitting him to express an opinion about the
force required to create the bite mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s left
breast. Defence counsel objected to qualifying Dr. Wood to give
this opinion because he lacked sufficient qualifications and his
evidence would not be reliable.
[66] The defence&#146;s theory at trial was that the bite mark was the
result of consensual sexual behaviour.  It was the theory of the
Crown, on the other hand, that the bite mark had been made in
anger in the course of a violent assault on Ms. Tchoudakova.
[67] A voir dire was held to determine if Dr. Wood had the
necessary expertise to give evidence both about the amount of
force required to cause the mark on Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s  breast and
about the amount of pain such a bite likely caused.
[68] The nature of defence counsel&#146;s objection at trial to Dr.
Wood&#146;s evidence went to the question of reliability.  He made the
following submissions to the trial judge at the end of the voir
dire:
          </pre>
    <pre>    [Defence counsel]   My Lord, some of the cases that deal
    with expert evidence relate to the difficulties where experts in
    the witness box become sort of an aura to their evidence because
    they are experts. What we have in this case in terms of the
    force, stress, to be applied in my respectful submission to try
    to correlate putting a machine on a pig, there is no evidence
    from this witness that he has had any experience in terms of
    force applied to the breast at all.
          </pre>
    <pre>    THE COURT:  I don&#146;t think hardly surprising, Mr. Durno.  I
    don&#146;t imagine there would be a line up for subjects.
          </pre>
    <pre>    [Defence counsel]   That&#146;s what we are talking about and
    he has indicated that different parts of the body can react
    in different ways.  The Crown wants to lead in evidence, an
    area that this doctor does not have expertise.   The fact
    that he has done it and read some books, in my respectful
    submission, in terms of comparison what would happen on a
    dead pig and human being really falls into the area of speculation.</pre>
    <pre>[69] The trial judge permitted Dr. Wood to testify about the
amount of force required to create the mark, but not about the
extent of the pain suffered by Ms. Tchoudakova.  His ruling
reflects a proper analysis and application of the principles in
R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, and he applied the requisite four
factors of relevance, necessity in assisting the trier of fact,
the absence of any exclusionary rule, and the proper
qualifications of the expert.  His reasons for permitting Dr.
Wood to give evidence were as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is not now contested that Gilbert Ho
	  was the person who made the bite impression
	  observed at the autopsy on the deceased&#146;s breast.
	  There is controversy, however, concerning the
          circumstances of its creation and the degree of
	  force or stress required to cause the impression
	  left.  It would seem asserted by  the defence
	  that the mark made occurred during the course of the
          consensual love-making.  At all events, the burden
	  of the cross-examination of Dr. Chiasson, a forensic
	  pathologist, was to that effect.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my respectful view, it cannot be
          seriously contested that the degree of force
          or stress required to cause the observed
          injury is a material issue in this case.  It
          has already been the subject-matter of
          evidence and remains a live issue for the
          trier of fact.  It is an issue upon which
          evidence of opinion is necessary.  The
          opinion of a properly qualified expert will
          provide information that is likely to be
          outside the experience and knowledge of
          jurors.  The admission of the evidence will
          neither overwhelm the jury, nor distract them
          in their task.  Th[ere] is no exclusionary
          rule, apart from the opinion rule which would
          exclude the evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is said that the witness lacks the
          necessary expertise in the area in which it
          is proposed to elicit his opinion. It is
          necessary that he possess special knowledge
          and experience going beyond that of the trier
          of fact.  See R. v. Marquard (1993), 85
          C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 224 (see) per McLachlin,
          J.  I am satisfied that he does so through
          study, practice, and to some extent, related
          experience.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In my respectful view, Dr. Wood can give
          evidence giving the nature of force or stress
          required to cause a wound of the nature
          observed here.  He is not permitted, however,
          to give opinion evidence concerning the
          extent of pain suffered.  It is an inference
          which the trier of fact are equally equipped
          to draw on the basis of the opinion of Dr.
          Wood or others concerning the degree of force
          necessary to cause the injury.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Further, by the witness&#146; own admission, pain
          is a very subjective matter.  Permitting him
          to express an opinion on the subject, in my
          respectful view, may be apt to mislead, and
          is of minimal probative value in light of his
          stated opinion on the very issue on which his
          opinion is sought.</pre>
    <pre>[70] In my view, the above reasons of the trial judge reflect no
error of law.  It is apparent, moreover, from his decision to
exclude Dr. Wood&#146;s evidence on the infliction of pain, that he
was aware of the limits of Dr. Wood&#146;s expertise.
[71] The trial judge was satisfied that Dr. Wood had demonstrated
that he had specialized knowledge as a result of his professional
expertise in the area of how bite marks affect human skin.  Dr.
Wood had conducted experiments on the force necessary to cause
bite marks, and his expertise was clearly greater than that of
the trier of fact.  Since the evidence was not objected to on the
basis that it was novel science, and there is no basis before
this court for deciding that Dr. Wood&#146;s evidence was so
unreliable as to be of no assistance to the jury, the trial
judge&#146;s decision to admit it should not be disturbed.
[72] The second aspect of the appellant&#146;s concern about the
reliability of Dr. Wood&#146;s evidence related to inconsistencies in
his evidence.  In chief, Dr. Wood had used inconsistent
terminology to describe the force necessary to cause the bite
mark. He had said that the amount of force required was
significant or extreme.  On cross-examination, defence counsel
elicited a concession from Dr. Wood that he had earlier said that
the bite mark was significant.
[73] These inconsistencies in Dr. Wood&#146;s evidence were properly
dealt with by the trial judge in his charge as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>    In cross-examination, Dr. Wood acknowledged a number of
    professions [of] which he is not a member.  He is not a medical
    doctor, pathologist, psychologist, anthropologist or expert on
    human sexual behavior.  His work is principally in the
    identification of bite marks as human, and as having been made by
    a particular person or source. He pointed out that &#147;significant&#148;
    and &#147;extreme&#148; are both qualitative measures.  They are, however,
    different.  &#147;Significant&#148; is more a statistical term.  &#147;Extreme&#148;
    designates a place on a continuum.  At times, they are
    interchangeable.  He testified that he may have described the
    degree of force on an earlier occasion as &#147;significant&#148; without
    reference to &#147;extreme&#148;.  It is admitted that he did so.  I have
    earlier advised you of the evidentiary value of [a] prior
    inconsistent statement.  It was also the evidence of Dr. Wood
    that there appears in the centre of Exhibit 51 minor evidence of
    sucking.</pre>
    <pre>[74] Moreover, the trial judge carefully and fairly reviewed the
evidence of Drs. Chiasson, Wood and Jaffe in his charge, making
particular reference to the inconsistencies in Dr. Wood&#146;s
evidence.  The jury could, in any event, look at the photographs
of Ms. Tchoudakova&#146;s body to determine for themselves whether the
evidence of Drs. Chiasson and Jaffe represented more realistic
characterizations than those of Dr. Wood.  In other words, the
questionable reliability of Dr. Wood&#146;s testimony with respect to
the force necessary to cause the bite mark was clearly before the
jury.
[75] Defence counsel did not object to the manner in which the
trial judge addressed the issue of Dr. Wood&#146;s expertise or the
substance of the evidence in his charge.  Although the failure to
object is not determinative, in this case it reflects, in my
view, not a prejudicial error, but trial counsel&#146;s experienced
opinion, which I share, that the judge&#146;s charge in connection
with Dr. Wood was fair and balanced.
[76] There was also expert evidence that supported the theory of
the defence that the bite mark was caused by consensual sexual
activity from which the jury could have concluded that the mark
was not caused by violence.  Expert evidence from Dr. Ron
Langevin, a forensic psychologist, supported this theory.
[77] The bite mark was not the centerpiece of the Crown&#146;s theory.
Rather, it was only one of many significant evidentiary offerings
by the Crown in support of its theory that the murderer was Mr.
Ho.  The evidentiary significance of Dr. Wood&#146;s testimony was,
moreover, reduced by the evidence of Drs. Chiasson and Jaffe that
the bite mark was an injury requiring at least some degree of
force.  On balance, therefore, even if the evidence of Dr. Wood
should not have been admitted, in my opinion its admission
resulted in no prejudice to the accused since his evidence
reflected only a different opinion as to the degree of force
required.</pre>
    <pre>b)  Dr. Ron Langevin</pre>
    <pre>[78] The appellant argued that during the evidence of Dr. Ron
Langevin, the defence&#146;s expert in sexual behaviour and practices,
the Crown elicited inadmissible opinions that exceeded the
witness&#146;s area of expertise.  Dr. Langevin was qualified as an
expert in forensic psychology, including the area of sexual
behaviour and violence. In cross-examination by the Crown, based
on his curriculum vitae, Dr. Langevin was examined about his
opinion on sadism, masochism and the profiles of sexual/serial
killers.  In the course of this cross-examination, Dr. Langevin
stated that sexual killers typically return to the scene of the
crime, observe the discovery of the victim&#146;s body, keep souvenirs
of the murder, and participate in the investigation.  The
appellant argued before us that the Crown, having failed to have
Dr. Langevin qualified to testify as an expert in profiles of
serial/sexual killers and in sadism, was not entitled to ask
these questions.
[79] The consequence of Dr. Langevin&#146;s evidence in cross-
examination, according to the defence, was that the jury was able
to hear evidence that implied that Mr. Ho&#146;s conduct after the
murder corresponded to the profile of sexual/serial killers and
that, accordingly, the only reasonable inference to be drawn was
that Mr. Ho was the person who killed Ms. Tchoudakova.
[80] In addition, the profile of sexual/serial killers was a
novel scientific theory and should therefore have been qualified
as &#147;science&#148; before being admitted.  The absence of a firm
scientific foundation for the admission of this evidence rendered
the evidence not only unreliable, but prejudicially distracting
to the jury as it took their attention away from the core issue
of whether Mr. Ho killed Ms. Tchoudakova.  The trial judge was
therefore required to give a clear instruction to the jury that
they were not to rely on the offending portions of Dr. Langevin&#146;s
evidence to attenuate any inflammatory or prejudicial effect.
[81] At trial, defence counsel raised no objection to Dr.
Langevin&#146;s evidence with respect to sexual/serial killers.  His
tactic instead, was to attack the evidence about sexual killers
in re-examination, through which he was able to get Dr. Langevin
to confirm that it was unusual for sex killers to kill someone
they knew, unlike Mr. Ho who had a prior intimate relationship
with the victim.
[82] In my view, Dr. Langevin&#146;s opinions about sexual/serial
killers were within the scope of his expertise in sexual
behaviour and violence.  In particular, it was open to the Crown
to explore with Dr. Langevin his views as to whether Ms.
Tchoudakova&#146;s murder could be considered a violent, sex killing.
[83] The trial judge&#146;s charge dealt fairly with Dr. Langevin&#146;s
evidence, and reminded the jury of Dr. Langevin&#146;s conclusion that
strangers, rather than persons like Mr. Ho who are familiar with
the victim, are more likely to be sex killers.
[84] I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.
