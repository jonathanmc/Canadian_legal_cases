               HOLDINGS LTD. (Defendants/Respondents)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        AUSTIN, CHARRON and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Robert L. Jenkins,
               for the appellants</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Jerome Stanleigh,
               for the respondents</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         January 12, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                          ENDORSEMENT
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, the issue of damages is dispositive of this</pre>
    <pre>appeal.  The trial judge found that the shortfall realized on the</pre>
    <pre>sale of the property was not caused by the act of waste, i.e. the</pre>
    <pre>demolition of the building, but by the severe downturn in the</pre>
    <pre>real estate market.  He also held that the market value of the</pre>
    <pre>property was not decreased but increased by the demolition.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In our view, these findings are reasonably supported by the</pre>
    <pre>evidence.  Consequently, there is no reason to interfere.  Even</pre>
    <pre>accepting the appellants' argument that the differential in value</pre>
    <pre>may not be the only measure of damages in some cases, the</pre>
    <pre>appellants' interest in this property was economic only.  It</pre>
    <pre>follows that the appellants have  failed to prove damages and the</pre>
    <pre>action was rightly dismissed.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In light of this conclusion, we do not find it necessary to</pre>
    <pre>deal with the other issues raised on the appeal on the issue of</pre>
    <pre>liability.  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at</pre>
    <pre>$2,500.00.</pre></td>
