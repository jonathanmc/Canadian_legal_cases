    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Hryn J. dated April 2, 1998 and
sentence April 21, 1998.

</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction of one count of sexual
assault and his sentence of 38 months reflecting credit for 10
months pretrial custody.  The appellant was assisted by duty
counsel in respect of the appeal against conviction. Four grounds
of appeal were raised:
     1)   The appellant&#146;s statement to police should not have
          been admitted as the Crown failed to prove that it was
          made voluntarily.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
     2)   The appellant&#146;s statement should have been excluded as
          it was obtained in a manner which breached his Charter
          rights.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3)   The trial judge placed undue weight on the statement.</pre>
    <pre>     4)   Certain evidence elicited first by the Crown, then in
          cross-examination by the defence, without the required
          Seaboyer hearing, was ultimately ignored by the trial
          judge to the prejudice of the appellant.

</pre>
    <pre>THE VOLUNTARINESS OF THE CONFESSION
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was arrested in Allen Gardens at 11:25 p.m. on
November 28, 1997 by 7 police officers. He was taken to the
station and placed in a cell. Two officers testified that at the
time of his arrest, he was drinking an alcoholic beverage from a
bottle in a bag. Some officers who saw him on arrest or when he
was paraded at the station said he appeared to be under the
influence of crack cocaine but not alcohol, others said he
appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, while others said
he did not appear at all impaired.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  At 1:24 a.m. on November 29, four officers came to the cell
to remove his clothing, as it had been determined that the
clothing would be tested for possible evidence of the commission
of  an offence. There was some evidence that Mr. Hoilett was
asleep at the time. All of his clothing was taken including his
underwear, shoes and socks. He was left naked in the cell, which
contained a metal bunk, a stainless steel toilet bowl and a water
fountain. There were neither sheets nor blankets. Other clothes
were supposed to be provided for the appellant when his were
seized, but in this case, apparently due to a delay in obtaining
clothes from the Salvation Army, the appellant was left naked in
the cell with no covering for one and one half hours. Shortly
before 3:06 a.m., he was given some light clothes, but no
underwear and shoes that did not fit.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Officer Moyer was present at the arrest and was also one of
the officers who removed the appellant&#146;s clothes at 1:24 a.m.,
and who brought him from his cell at 3:06 a.m. to be interviewed.
He testified that the appellant appeared to be under the
influence of both cocaine and alcohol at the time of his arrest
and that after he was awakened in his cell at 3:06 and taken up
for his statement, he appeared to be more affected by whatever he
was on and more agitated.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Detective Ralph and Detective Constable Clements were the
two officers who took the appellant&#146;s statement. Detective Ralph
testified on the voir dire that he woke the appellant in his cell
at about 3:00 a.m. and at that time he seemed tired. He was
wearing tan slacks and a white shirt. Detective Ralph was aware
that the appellant had consumed wine earlier that evening and
crack cocaine, but said that he believed the appellant was not
impaired during the interview but only tired, which was why he
kept nodding off during the interview. Although the appellant was
detained and under arrest, Detective Ralph testified that the
reason he proceeded with the interview at that hour, after waking
the appellant and knowing he was tired, was because he was not
sure that he would have another opportunity to do so.
[6]  On the voir dire, the appellant testified that he had had
three bottles of wine that evening and had smoked more than two
grams of crack. He described how he was placed in the end cell,
as the officers had stated, that it was cold and that the
officers had deliberately opened a window. This was denied by the
officers who said there was no window nearby. When he was
arrested that night, he was wearing a three-quarter length
leather jacket, pants, a t-shirt, a shirt and running shoes. He
also had underwear and socks. When the officers came and asked
for his clothes he first thought they were joking and he refused.
They came in and took his clothes and he was left naked with no
blanket. He said he was still under the influence of drugs and
alcohol at that time. When they left him, he kept banging and
asking for clothes, as he could not see any officers from his
cell. He believed he was left for about two hours without
clothes. When clothes were finally brought, there was no
underwear and the shoes were too small. He was cold, his nose was
running and he was not given any tissues. He felt he was treated
like an animal. He said that by the time the statement was taken
he was exhausted because he had had to stand up the whole time
until he received clothes, as it was too cold to sit on the steel
bed. He said that by that time he was still under the influence,
but mostly he was exhausted.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In cross-examination the appellant agreed that he knew from
his previous arrest experience that he did not have to speak with
the police. He also said  he had nothing to hide. He agreed that
there were no promises nor threats.  He then said the following:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And whether you were left naked in the cell for 15
     minutes or two hours, that didn&#146;t play a role in you deciding to
     talk to the police, correct?
     </pre>
    <pre>           A.   In a way it did, yeah.  I thought maybe
     talking  to  them  or whatever I  would  get  some
     clothes.   That  was  a part  of  it.   Some  warm
     clothes.
     </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   And you already had clothes at the time
     you were taken to ---
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yeah, but they weren&#146;t warm enough.  And
     another thing, at least I will get some kleenex to
     wipe my nose, so I thought about that too.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And ---
     </pre>
    <pre>           A.    If I cooperate with them they will  at
     least give me some kleenex to wipe my nose.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   But, Sir, I thought you told me that you
     answered the questions because you had nothing  to
     hide?
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   That was one of the reasons, yes.
     </pre>
    <pre>           Q.    And, in fact, when Mr. Lyon asked  you
     how  you  felt once you got the clothes, you  told
     him you felt better?
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I felt a little better, yeah.  Something
     ---  yeah, I wasn&#146;t running around nude, so I  had
     to feel better.
     </pre>
    <pre>           Q.    And I&#146;m going to suggest to you,  Sir,
     that  you weren&#146;t really too concerned what  these
     detectives thought of you because you don&#146;t have a
     whole lot of respect for them, did you?
     </pre>
    <pre>           A.    Why shouldn&#146;t I have respect for them?
     They never disrespect me.
     </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   Well, I&#146;m going to suggest to you, Sir,
     that  you  did  exactly what  Detective  Constable
     Clements  said, you sat there and you sicked  your
     teeth at them, isn&#146;t that right?
     </pre>
    <pre>            A.    Sucked  &#150;  she  said,  that  was  her
     allegation.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And you deny that?
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don&#146;t really remember.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well, you&#146;d agree with me that that is a
     sign of disrespect?
     </pre>
    <pre>           A.    No, that&#146;s not &#150; yeah, it would  be  a
     sign  of disrespect.  But, as she said, she didn&#146;t
     write  it  down in her note.  Maybe it&#146;s  just  an
     allegation she had.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Actually, Sir, she said she did write it
     down  in her notebook and it happened enough  that
     she  made a note of it.  Do you disagree with  the
     fact that it happened?
     </pre>
    <pre>           A.   I wouldn&#146;t really disagree.  Maybe when
     I  kiss  my  teeth it was an act in asking  for  a
     kleenex  and not getting any and they keep putting
     the questions to me and my nose is running.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   But you would agree with me that kissing
     your  teeth would be a sign of disrespect  to  the
     officers?
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I wouldn&#146;t say that.  Maybe it&#146;s just to
     say  that  my nose is running and I&#146;m  asking  for
     some kleenex and people won&#146;t even do that for me.
     </pre>
    <pre>           Q.    And  you&#146;d agree with me that  hanging
     your  head and not looking at a person,  that&#146;s  a
     sign of disrespect?
     </pre>
    <pre>          A.   No, I wouldn&#146;t say that.  I&#146;d say it&#146;s a
     sign of tiredness.
     </pre>
    <pre>          (pp. 35-37)
     </pre>
    <pre>     
[8]  On the voir dire the trial judge listened to an audio tape
of the appellant&#146;s statement. The interview lasted 30 minutes.
Near the beginning of the interview the appellant asked for a
tissue. Detective Ralph responded:
     </pre>
    <pre>          RALPH:    We&#146;ll do our best to accommodate you. I don&#146;t have
     any at the moment, but I will make sure that it&#146;s brought to the
     Staff  Sergeant&#146;s attention. Okay? Mr. HOILETT we want try to
     talk to you about what happened tonight, if you&#146;re willing to do
     that, it&#146;s entirely up to yourself.  Of course you know, as I&#146;m
     sure you do know, that you have the right to speak to legal
     counsel before you talk to us, if you so choose but ah, we&#146;d like
     to ask you some questions about what happened tonight.  Are you
     prepared to do that?
     </pre>
    <pre>          HOILETT:  &#133;(inaudible).
     </pre>
    <pre>          RALPH:    Sorry?
     </pre>
    <pre>          HOILETT:  I&#146;m prepared to what I&#146;m cold man.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
[9]  A few minutes later in response to a question from Detective
Constable Clements, the appellant said:
     </pre>
    <pre>          HOILETT:  I heard what you said&#133;(inaudible) no warm
     clothes&#133;(inaudible).
     </pre>
    <pre>           CLEMENTS:  We  don&#146;t  have  that  right  now
     Courtney, but we will do what we can to  get  that
     for  you.  We&#146;ll mention it to the&#151;the Officer  in
     Charge of the Station and have him attempt to  get
     something.  Okay?  But right now we want  to  give
     you  your opportunity to tell us your side of  the
     story, if you want to do that.  There&#146;s always two
     sides  to a story and we&#146;re prepared to listen  to
     both sides.  Do you want to do that  Courtney?</pre>
    <pre>[10] It is also clear from the transcript that the officers noted
five times that the appellant was having trouble staying awake
during the interview.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUE
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The only issue raised on appeal was that &#147;the taking of the
statement had an aura of oppression&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In his ruling, the trial judge first addressed whether the
appellant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol by the time
of the interview. He concluded, based on all the evidence
including the evidence of the accused himself, that by the time
he gave the statement, his operating mind was not so affected. He
made no reference however, to the undisputed evidence that the
accused was very tired throughout the interview.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge then dealt with the issue of leaving the
accused without clothing for one and one half hours. He found
that it was improper for the police to leave the appellant
without clothing for a substantial period of time. Also it was
unnecessary to do so as he could have been watched if there was a
concern about the destruction of evidence. He observed that at
the very least,  the police station should have had a blanket
which would have provided some warmth as well as helped to
maintain the appellant&#146;s dignity and self respect. Finally he
observed that the appellant should have been provided with a
tissue and stated that &#147;No one should be put in the position of
having to use their clothing as a tissue&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge then articulated the legal issue in this
way: &#147;But again, the issue in the end for me to resolve isn&#146;t
this conduct, whether it&#146;s proper or improper, but whether the
accused statement was a statement of an operating mind.&#148; He
concluded, based on the evidence of the appellant on the voir
dire, which he accepted, that &#147; it may be that a lot of
individuals, but not Mr. Hoilett, would have been put in such a
state of mind being left naked for an hour and a half  that most
courts would exclude their statements&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The trial judge found that the appellant &#147;knew where he was,
he knew what he was doing, he knew he was being interrogated
about a sexual assault, he knew he could speak or not speak&#133; he
knew he could answer questions or not and that is what he did.&#148; &#147;
He wouldn&#146;t show disrespect to the police because they didn&#146;t
show disrespect to him.&#148; &#147;His evidence was that he answered the
questions because he had nothing to hide.&#148; The trial judge
concluded: &#147;His evidence simply does not bear out a finding that
it was either crack cocaine, alcohol, or the taking away of his
clothing which led to statements made by someone without an
operating mind. That&#146;s just not his evidence.&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[16] The issues to be addressed in the test for the admissibility
of an accused&#146;s statement are succinctly set out in R. v. McLeod,
Pinnock and Farquarson (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 29 (Ont.C.A.) by
Grange J.A. at pp. 34-5:
     </pre>
    <pre>          To be admissible statements must not be obtained by fear of
     prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a person
     in authority. Nor must they be prompted by oppressive conduct:
     Horvath v. The Queen (1979), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 385. They must be
     voluntary in the sense that the words are the utterance of an
     operating mind: Ward v. The Queen (1979) 44 C.C.C. (2d) 498.
</pre>
    <pre>[17] In that case there was a skin search of the accused before
the statements were taken.  The court stated at p. 34:
     </pre>
    <pre>          It may well be that in some cases and for some offences a
     skin search is so demeaning and unnecessary as to be oppressive
     and detract from the voluntariness of a statement.  It is to be
     remembered that the accused in the case at bar were arrested on
     charges of attempted murder and armed robbery.  In such
     circumstances it was conceded by counsel that strip-searching for
     weapons was not unreasonable.  No unnecessary indignity was
     perpetrated and the accused were not questioned, nor were their
     statements taken, while they were naked.
</pre>
    <pre>[18] The history of the role of oppressive conduct in the
voluntariness analysis was reviewed by the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Oickle  (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 506 . The court
noted that the role of oppressive conduct was referred to by
Laskin C.J. speaking for the court in Hobbins v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 553 at 556-7 where he said:
     </pre>
    <pre>          There is no doubt that the state of mind of the accused is
     relevant to the admissibility of a statement made by him to the
     police after interrogation, and even if he has been
     cautioned...An atmosphere of oppression may be created in the
     circumstances surrounding the taking of a statement, although
     there be no inducement held out of hope of advantage or fear of
     prejudice, and absent any threats of violence or actual violence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
[19] Hill J. elaborated on the issue in the case of R. v. Alexis
(1994), 35 C.R. (4th) 117 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) at 155:
     </pre>
    <pre>          The courts have extended the voluntariness test to exclude
     statements taken by persons in authority in circumstances of
     oppressiveness.  A critical area of focus is the intersect of the
     common law right of silence with the legitimate interest of the
     state in investigating crime.  However, where the conduct of the
     authorities is such as to create a general atmosphere which is so
     oppressive that the declarant&#146;s free will is effectively
     overborne by the interrogator then the ensuing statement is
     thereby rendered inadmissible.  In effect, such impugned conduct
     on the part of the police is seen as sapping the will of the
     interviewee to resist and to effectively control his or her right
     to choose to speak or to remain silent.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
     &#133;.
     </pre>
    <pre>           A  judicial  finding  of  oppressiveness  is
     necessarily contextual.  The circumstances of each
     case  must  be scrutinized with no one  factor  or
     combination of factors reducing themselves  to  an
     automatic formula.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
[20] In  Oickle  the court noted at p.520-1 after referring to
Hobbins and Alexis, that fairness in the criminal process has
been recognized as an underlying consideration in the confession
rule, and referred to the comments of Sopinka J. in R. v. Whittle
(1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 11 (S.C.C.) at p. 24:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Although the confession rule in its traditional formulation
     had as its raison d&#146;etre the reliability of the confession, a
     strong undercurrent developed which also supported the rule in
     part on fairness in the criminal process. &#133;.
     </pre>
    <pre>           The  preoccupation  of the  common  law  and
     Charter  cases in preserving for the  suspect  the
     right  to  choose  has been in relation  to  state
     action.  Did  the  action  of  police  authorities
     deprive the suspect of making an effective  choice
     by  reason of coercion, trickery or misinformation
     or the lack of information?
</pre>
    <pre>[21] In this case, the trial judge relied extensively on an
earlier decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Owen
(1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 538, where the accused was left naked for
15 minutes in a small cell before he began to be questioned over
a period of 14 hours. He eventually gave an incriminating
statement. The court upheld the trial judge&#146;s ruling that the
statement was voluntary and the utterance of an operating mind.
The trial judge reached the same conclusion in this case.
</pre>
    <pre>[22] In his ruling, the trial judge deplored the improper and
inhumane conduct of the police in leaving the accused naked and
cold with nowhere to even sit down for one and one half hours in
the middle of a cold November night. He concluded however, that
this accused&#146;s free will was not affected by this treatment by
the police. He reached that conclusion based on the accused&#146;s
evidence on the voir dire, which he appeared to accept
completely, that he had nothing to hide and knew he could answer
or not as he determined.</pre>
    <pre>[23] However, in reaching this conclusion the trial judge made no
reference to other parts of the accused&#146;s testimony where he said
that his decision to speak was influenced by how cold he was and
that he needed a tissue, and that the officers suggested that
these things could be made available to him after the
interrogation.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Oppressive conduct by the police, in and of itself, will not
in every case render a statement of an accused inadmissible as
involuntary. There may be circumstances where an accused person
has the self-confidence to withstand the more subtle intimidation
that is communicated by the police through an atmosphere of
oppression. Or an accused may have his or her own reasons for
believing that it is in their interests to speak to the police so
that oppressive police conduct may not have the effect of  making
a statement involuntary.</pre>
    <pre>[25] However, as the trial judge clearly recognized, many
individuals, and I would suggest virtually everyone, would have
their state of mind and their will to say no to the police
significantly influenced by the spectre of receiving inhumane
treatment at their hands for failure to co-operate, a spectre
created not by direct threat but by an atmosphere of oppression.
Where there has been such conduct in the context of taking a
statement of an accused person, the circumstances of the conduct
and of the statement, together with the evidence on the voir
dire, must be fully and carefully scrutinized by the court in its
assessment of whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused person was truly speaking freely and
without fear or hope of how he or she would be physically treated
by the police afterward.</pre>
    <pre>[26] In my view, the trial judge in this case, although alive to
the issue of the effect of the clearly oppressive conduct of the
police, and having accepted and acted upon the evidence of the
accused on the voir dire, failed to consider or refer to the
portion of his evidence where he specifically said that the fact
that he was left naked in his cell did play a role in his
decision to speak to the police. He thought he might get some
warmer clothes and a tissue to wipe his nose. That evidence on
the voir dire was borne out by the transcript of  the audio
recording of the statement where the appellant first asked for a
tissue and later for warm clothes. On both occasions, the
officers said they would speak to the staff sergeant or the
officer in charge about his requests. In fact, these promises can
also be viewed as inducements, particularly when seen in the
context of the accused having just been left alone, naked and
cold for 1 and ½ hours.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Also in considering the issue of whether the appellant had
an operating mind, the trial judge failed to advert to the
evidence that the accused was awakened and interviewed after 3:00
a.m., how tired he was, and the fact that the officers had to
repeatedly inquire as to whether he was awake.
[28] In my view, based on this record, and on the basis of the
accused&#146;s evidence on the voir dire, which the trial judge
accepted, it is impossible to say that a court could be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant made his statement
to the police voluntarily in the sense that it was not induced by
the oppressive conduct of the police.</pre>
    <pre>[29] The Crown submitted that if this court was satisfied that
the trial judge had erred in admitting the statement of the
accused, it should apply the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code and decline to allow the appeal on the basis that
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
The Crown relied first on the fact that the accused did not admit
the offence in his statement but only said that there was
consent, which was also what he testified to in the trial.
Furthermore, the Crown had another witness, a gas station
attendant, who testified that the accused had said to him that he
did not do anything to the complainant and that she had taken his
money. This was a statement of the accused which contradicted his
trial evidence and therefore impugned his credibility without the
evidence of his police statement.</pre>
    <pre>[30] In my view this is not a case for the application of the
proviso. The reasons for judgment of the trial judge put
considerable emphasis on the lack of credibility of the accused.
His conclusion was based in part on the contradictory statements
made by the appellant during his police statement including,
first, a complete denial, later a suggestion that the complainant
took money from him, and finally the fact there was consensual
sex. It was also based on contradictions between the statement
and his story at trial. Furthermore it cannot be said that the
accused would necessarily have testified in the trial had the
statement not been admitted. In my view, it cannot be said that
the admission of the statement caused no prejudice to the
accused.</pre>
    <pre>THE CHARTER GROUND
[31] The second ground of appeal raised by the appellant is that
the statement should have been excluded because it was obtained
following a breach of the appellant&#146;s rights under ss.7 and 8 of
the Charter. In particular, the appellant submits that both the
timing and the manner of  the seizure of his clothes constituted
an unreasonable search and seizure. The police removed his
clothes in the middle of the night when he was either asleep or
resting and not doing anything to destroy evidence, then left him
naked, cold and standing up for one and one half hours. This
constituted a flagrant breach of his Charter right under s. 8.
His statement was taken shortly after he was given some light
clothes, but no shoes that fit, and when he was still very cold
and sleepy. The appellant submits that the statement should have
been excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter on the basis of a
combination of its causal connection with the unreasonable search
and seizure, as well as the very close temporal connection. The
appellant relies on the recent decision of this court in R. v.
Flintoff (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 321 where the court excluded the
results of a breathalyzer test taken after the accused was strip-
searched in violation of his s. 8 Charter right.</pre>
    <pre>[32] At trial the accused did not raise any Charter violation. In
fact counsel specifically advised the court that he was not
relying on any Charter breach, although it appears from the
context in the transcript that he was referring at that time to
the s.10(b) right to counsel. In light of our conclusion as to
the inadmissibility of the statement of the appellant as
involuntary, it is not necessary for this court to deal with the
statement and the circumstances on the basis of a violation of
the appellant&#146;s Charter rights, now raised on appeal.
[33] As there will be a new trial, it is also unnecessary for the
court to deal with the last two grounds of appeal, as they both
raise issues as to the weight given to parts of the evidence by
the trial judge in the reasons for judgment. It is also
unnecessary to address the appeal against sentence.</pre>
    <pre>RESULT
</pre>
    <pre>[34] The appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered.
