    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of R.C. Sills J. dated April 22, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge was confronted with the daunting task of
sorting out the accounts between the two parties to the joint
venture.  He got very little assistance from either party.  The
books and records of the joint venture were disorganized and
incomplete.  The trial judge described them as a &#147;rats nest.&#148;
The appellants are now asking this court to revisit some parts of
the accounting exercise carried out by the trial judge.
[2]  This court will only interfere with the conclusions of the
trial judge if we are satisfied that he made unreasonable
findings of fact unsupported by the evidence or made errors in
law that resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.
[3]  The appellant raised a number of grounds of appeal.  We will
specifically address only three of those.  First, the appellants
complain that the trial judge was inconsistent in attributing
value to quilts that remained in the possession of the parties
after the termination of the joint venture at the end of October
1993.  In 1994 or 1995 the respondents sold the 1,184 quilts
remaining in their possession to Just Treasures, a business
operated by the respondent Mary Klimm and her daughter, for
$54.31 per quilt. That was approximately the same amount that the
joint venture had paid to purchase those quilts.
[4]  At the time of trial in 1997 the appellants had 1,311 quilts
from the fifth load remaining in their possession.  These had not
yet been sold.  The trial judge placed a value of $75 each on
these quilts.  In doing so he relied upon the evidence of the
appellant Dong who said that he could sell them for a price of
between $70 and $75.  The trial judge was entirely justified in
valuing these quilts at $75 each.
[5]  The thrust of the appellants&#146; argument is that the sale
price to Just Treasures was unreasonably low and that the trial
judge erred in not attributing at least the same price to the
quilts sold to Just Treasures as that attributed to the quilts
still being held by the appellants at the time of the trial.
[6]  We see no basis to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s approach
to this issue.  In the course of the accounting exercise the
trial judge used actual purchase and sale prices, where
available.  Consistent with this approach, he used the sale price
of the 1,184 quilts to Just Treasures.
[7]  The appellants argue that this price was unreasonably low
when compared to prices realized on the sale of other quilts and
when compared with the price attributed to the quilts being held
by the respondents at the time of trial.  We note, however, that
the sale to Just Treasures was on a wholesale basis.  Comparison
to retail sale prices or prices for much smaller quantities of
quilts may or may not be helpful.  Similarly, comparison to sales
at market prices at different points in time may be of limited
use.  Market conditions change.  Moreover, the appellant Hans
Klimm gave evidence that Just Treasures did not make a profit
when it sold these quilts.  It was open to the trial judge to
accept this evidence which supported his use of the sale price to
Just Treasures for the purpose of reconciling the accounts
between the parties.  We are not prepared to interfere with the
use of this figure by the trial judge.
[8]  Turning to the appellants&#146; next argument we do not agree
that the trial judge erred by including the anticipated profits
from the fifth load of quilts in the reconciliation of accounts.
The financing for the purchase of these quilts came from joint
venture funds.  The appellants consulted the respondents about
the source of supply for these quilts.  There was evidence that
the parties intended that these quilts be purchased on behalf of
the joint venture.  The trial judge&#146;s finding was supported by
the evidence.
[9]  Finally, we do not agree with the appellants&#146; submission
that the trial judge erred by attributing to the respondents one-
half of the estimated profit from the sale of the fifth load of
quilts rather than ordering that one half of those quilts be
turned over to the respondents.  The appellants had held on to
these quilts for several years after the joint venture was
terminated.  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to
dispose of this issue in the manner that he did.
[10] We see no merit in the other grounds of appeal raised by the
appellants.
[11] In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
