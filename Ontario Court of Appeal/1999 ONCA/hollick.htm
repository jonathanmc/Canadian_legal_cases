    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (O&#146;Leary, Flinn
and Sedgwick JJ.) dated December 17, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This appeal concerns the proposed certification of a  class
action  on  behalf  of  30,000 persons  seeking  damages  and  an
injunction largely related to noxious odours said to be emanating
from a waste disposal site in Maple, Ontario.
[2]  Section 5(1) of the Class Proceeding Act, 1992, S.O. 1992,
c. 6 reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    5.-(1) The court shall certify a class
	       proceeding on a motion under s.2, 3 or 4 if,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  the pleadings or the notice of
               application discloses a cause of action;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  there is an identifiable class
               of  two  or more persons that  would  be
               represented    by   the   representative
               plaintiff or  defendant;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (c)  the claims of defences of the class
               members raise common issues;
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (d)   a class proceeding would  be
               the   preferable   procedure   for   the
               resolution of the common issues; and
               </pre>
    <pre>                     (e)   there  is  a  representative
               plaintiff or defendant who,
                    </pre>
    <pre>                         (i)  would fairly and adequately
                    represent the interests of the class,
                    </pre>
    <pre>                          (ii) has produced a plan  for
                    the  proceeding  that  sets  out  a
                    workable  method of  advancing  the
                    proceeding on behalf of  the  class
                    and  of notifying class members  of
                    the proceeding, and
                    </pre>
    <pre>                          (iii)      does not have,  on
                    the common issues for the class, an
                    interest   in  conflict  with   the
                    interests of other class members.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The plaintiff appellant&#146;s position is that he has pleaded  a
valid cause of action, has identified a class with a common issue
of  liability for the alleged nuisance, and that the court should
not  look  behind  the statement of claim at the  merits  of  the
action  at the certification stage. The respondent&#146;s position  is
that  there  is  no  commonality  in  the  issues  and  that,  if
certified, the action would become unmanageable as it breaks down
into   questions  of  cause  and  effect  related  to  individual
claimants.
[4]  The motions judge, Jenkins J., certified the action as
presented except for the claim of an injunction which could, in
his view, be more appropriately obtained by an application to set
aside the Certificate of Approval or to seek cancellation of the
licence of the waste disposal site.
[5]  Leave was granted to appeal to the Divisional Court. That
court set side the certification order without prejudice to the
plaintiff&#146;s right to bring a fresh application on further
evidence. Leave was then granted to appeal to this Court.</pre>
    <pre>Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>[6]   I will do as O&#146;Leary J. did in the Divisional Court reasons
and  simply quote the recitation of facts set out in the  reasons
of the motions judge:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The defendant operates an approved landfill
	  site known as the Keele Valley Landfill Site
 	  (here and after referred to as Keele Valley). The
	  defendant has a responsibility for the disposal
	  of waste generated within its boundaries as well as
          municipal waste from the Regional Municipality of
	  York, and its area municipalities, and the Regional
	  Municipality of Durham. It is also required to
	  accept waste from other areas on an emergency
          basis.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The plaintiff claims that since at least
          February  3, 1991, by reason of the operation
          of   the  Keele  Valley,  the  defendant  has
          wrongfully  caused, or failed to  permit,  or
          permitted, the landfill to emit:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (a)   large quantities of methane,
               hydrogen sulphide, vinyl chloride and other
               toxic gases, obnoxious odours, fumes, smoke
               and  airborne, bird-borne  or  air-blown
               sediment, particulates, dirt and  litter
               (collectively referred to  as  &#147;Physical
               Pollution&#148;); and
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  loud noises and strong vibrations
               (collectively  referred  to  as   &#147;Noise
               Pollution&#148;);
          </pre>
    <pre>                onto  the  lands  and premises  in  the
          geographical    boundaries    claimed.    The
          plaintiffs    claim    that     they     have
          sustained  physical  and  emotional   damages
          as a causal consequence.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                 &#133;&#133;..
          </pre>
    <pre>               FACTUAL BACKGROUND
          </pre>
    <pre>                The plaintiff&#146;s motion is supported  by
          the  affidavits  of  John  Hollick  sworn  on
          November  28, 1997 and January 14,  1998.  He
          was  cross-examined  on January  26  and  27,
          1998.  The defendant did not file a statement
          of  defence but filed an affidavit of Angelos
          Bacopoulos sworn on December 31, 1997. He was
          cross-examined  on his affidavit  on  January
          27, 1998.
          </pre>
    <pre>               These affidavits disclose that the Keele
          Valley site was originally an enormous gravel
          pit  known as Maple Pits. An approval process
          was  carried out from 1976 to 1980, including
          an  80  day  hearing before the Environmental
          Assessment Board (July 1976 to November 1977)
          and  a  further  28  day hearing  before  the
          Environmental Appeal Board (November 1978  to
          June  1980). A Certificate of Approval (C.A.)
          was  thereafter issued to private owners. The
          defendant  purchased the site  in  1983.  The
          Ministry of the Environment issued a new C.A.
          governing the operation of Keele Valley.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The   C.A.  provides  that  only  non-
          hazardous  municipal or commercial  waste  be
          received   at  Keele  Valley.  It  does   not
          authorize  the receipt of residential  sewage
          sludge.  The  C.A. covers an  area  of  375.9
          hectares (928.5 acres) of which 99.2 hectares
          (245 acres) is the actual disposal area.  The
          remaining lands provide for a buffer area  of
          over 650 acres.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The   C.A.  provides  for   a   staged
          construction plan, purge wells, a clay liner,
          monitoring  wells, a leachate collection  and
          discharge system, a gas collection system and
          a  bypass road for the use of refuse  trucks.
          The  C.A.  also provides for a  small  claims
          trust  fund  in the total amount of  $100,000
          which  was established by the defendant prior
          to  the  commencement of operations at  Keele
          Valley,  to  deal  with claims  arising  from
          offsite  impact to a maximum  of  $5,000  for
          each  claim. The fund is administered by  the
          Ministry of the Environment. Awards from  the
          fund  are to be made on a no-fault basis.  To
          date,  no claims have been made against  this
          fund by any person or corporation.
          </pre>
    <pre>               GAS COLLECTION
          </pre>
    <pre>                 Keele   Valley   operates   a   highly
          sophisticated  landfill gas  extraction  plan
          which removes gases from the site. The gas is
          used  to  generate electricity at the Eastern
          Power  Limited,  a privately  owned  facility
          located on the site.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 As   a  result  of  its  landfill  gas
          extraction  initiatives,  the  defendant  has
          been  commended to the United  Nations  as  a
          world  leader in the reduction of  greenhouse
          gases.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The   C.A.  provides  that  the  final
          contours  of Keele Valley, once the  landfill
          is   completed,   should   be   designed   to
          approximate  the  land  configuration  as  it
          existed  before  sand and  gravel  extraction
          commenced in the former Maple Pits. The  area
          surrounding Keele Valley contains a number of
          industries  including  an  active  quarry,  a
          private  transfer station for waste,  various
          recycling  related  activities,  a   plastics
          factory,  an  asphalt plant, private  compost
          operations and farms.
          </pre>
    <pre>                On  numerous occasions, local residents
          have complained about the manner in which the
          local  planning  authority  of  the  City  of
          Vaughan, permitted development in and  around
          Keele  Valley; for example, in  permitting  a
          large  residential subdivision and school  to
          be   built   on  a  by-pass  road  that   was
          specifically   constructed  to   keep   truck
          traffic  away  from  populated  areas.   This
          development  was  permitted  by  the  Ontario
          Municipal   Board  after  a  two-month   long
          hearing.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 SUPERVISION  OF  ACTIVITIES  AT  KEELE
          VALLEY
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Ministry of the Environment oversees
          operations at Keele Valley through  the  C.A.
          and  by  maintaining two full-time inspectors
          at  the  site, and through ongoing review  of
          detailed  reports that the defendant provides
          to  the  Ministry  on  all  aspects  of  site
          operations.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Any potential violations of the C.A. or
          other    applicable   statutory    provisions
          governing the operations of Keele Valley  may
          be   investigated  and  prosecuted   by   the
          Ministry of the Environment pursuant  to  the
          provisions  of  the Environmental  Protection
          Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  Various    administrative   tribunals
          including the Ontario Municipal Board and the
          Environmental  Assessment  Board  have   also
          reviewed  the  operations  of  Keele   Valley
          during   the  operation  of  the  site.   The
          operations at Keele Valley have been found to
          be  satisfactory  and Keele Valley  has  been
          permitted to continue to operate.
          </pre>
    <pre>                On  one  occasion,  the  defendant  was
          charged by the Ministry of the Environment in
          relation to the composting of grass clippings
          at  the Avondale composting facility which is
          located  north  of the Keele Valley  landfill
          site. Grass composting was required under the
          recycling  regulations  of  the  Province  of
          Ontario  and  has  proved to be  problematic.
          Ultimately,  the defendant stopped  receiving
          grass   clippings  collected  by   its   area
          municipalities and thereafter the  complaints
          relating  to  odour  from the  composting  of
          grass  stopped. The defendant  made  a  joint
          submission   with   the   Ministry   of   the
          Environment resulting in a $16,000 fine and a
          pilot  program to assist the Ministry of  the
          Environment in addressing the minimization of
          odour  problems associated with the recycling
          of grass clippings.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The City of Vaughan has also established
          a committee known as the Keele Valley Liaison
          Committee   whose  purpose  is   to   address
          community concerns related to the site. Prior
          to 1998, staff of the defendant have attended
          and participated regularly at these meetings.
          In addition, a telephone complaint system has
          been  set up by the defendant. The complaints
          received are investigated. There were a total
          of  150  complaints concerning  Keele  Valley
          since   1991  which  were  investigated   and
          documented by the defendant.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It was pointed out to us that the 150 complaints were to the
City  and  that  the  number is close to  500  if  those  to  the
provincial  ministry  are included. It  is  not  known  how  many
complainants made these complaints.
[8]  The essence of the reasoning of the Divisional Court can be
taken from these excerpts from the reasons of O&#146;Leary J.:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [16] In my view the evidence does not make
	  it likely that  those 30,000  persons  suffered
	  such interference. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 [17]  &#133;  What  is  needed  to  satisfy
          s.5(1)(b) is evidence from which the  motions
          court  judge  can conclude that  all  members
          included in the class likely have a cause  of
          action against Toronto for interference  with
          their use and enjoyment of their property.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 [19]   Because  the  class  that   was
          certified  &#150;  the 30,000 people who  occupied
          land  in  a  16 square mile area &#150;  bears  no
          resemblance  to  any group that  was  on  the
          evidence   likely  injured  by  the  landfill
          operation,  there  are  no  apparent   common
          issues relating to the members of the class.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  appellant complains that the Divisional Court violated
the  well-established principle that the merits of the action are
not  to  be  examined on the certification motion. As  stated  by
Moldaver J. in Abdool v. Anaheim Management Ltd. (1995), 21  O.R.
(3d)  453  (Gen. Div.) at 469, &#147;all allegations of fact  [in  the
pleadings],  unless  patently ridiculous or incapable  of  proof,
must  be  accepted as proved.&#148;  The appellant refers  us  to  the
excerpts  from the reasons of O&#146;Leary J., quoted above,  and,  in
particular,  his  references to the evidence not  supporting  the
likelihood that the members of the class suffered interference in
the  enjoyment of property, as going beyond what the  legislation
permits. The appellant says the court should  not be concerned as
to  whether  an  action of this nature should,  as  a  matter  of
policy, be certified; the sole issue is whether the statement  of
claim reveals facts which, if proved, satisfy the criteria in  s.
5(1) of the Act.
[10] It is certainly well established that the pleadings must be
taken at face value to determine if a cause of action is
disclosed under s.5(1)(a). However, the Divisional Court
specifically refers to s.5(1)(b) and appears to be searching for
evidence that a class exists. In doing so it turns its attention
to the likely merits of the claims of members of the class. The
class should not be defined in terms of the merits of the
individual claims. However, the question remains whether the
ascertainment of the existence of a class can include some
consideration of the merits and whether the court can look beyond
the statement of claim to make that assessment.
[11] As stated, when the court is considering s.5(1)(b) it is not
appropriate to define that class in terms that depend upon the
merits; e.g., those who have suffered injury. In Bywater v.
Toronto Transit Commission (1998), 27 C.P.C. (4th) 172 (Gen.
Div.) dealing with a fire that occurred in a subway tunnel which
forms part of the TTC subway system, Winkler J. gives a very
clear explanation of this problem at paragraphs 10 and 11.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The purpose of the class definition is
	  threefold: a) it identifies those persons who have
	  a potential claim for relief against the defendant;
	  b) it defines the parameters of the lawsuit so as
	  to identify those persons who are bound by its
          result; and lastly, c) it describes who is entitled
	  to notice pursuant to the Act. Thus for the mutual
	  benefit of the plaintiff and the defendant the class
	  definition ought not to be unduly narrow nor unduly
	  broad.

    <pre>                      In  the  instant  proceeding  the
          identities  of  many  of the  passengers  who
          would  come  within the class definition  are
          not presently known. This does not constitute
          a defect in the class definition. In Anderson
          v. Wilson (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 235 (Ont. Div.
          Ct.),  Campbell J. adopted the words  of  the
          Ontario  Law Reform Commission and stated  at
          248:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    &#133;a class definition that would enable
               the court to determine whether any person
               coming forward was or was not a class member
               would seem to be sufficient.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 On   this  point,  Newberg  on   Class
          Actions    (3d    ed.    Looseleaf)     (West
          Publishing) states at 6-61:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    Care should be taken to define the class
               in objective terms capable of membership
               ascertainment when appropriate,  without
               regard to the merits of the claim or the
               seeking  of  particular relief.  Such  a
               definition   in   terms   of   objective
               characteristics of class members  avoids
               problems of circular definitions which depend
               on  the outcome of the litigation on the
               merits  before  class  members  may   be
               ascertained&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The  Manual  for  Complex  Litigation,
          Third  (1995,  West  Publishing)  states   at
          217:
               </pre>
    <pre>                     Class  definition is  of  critical
               importance because it identifies the persons
               (1) entitled to relief, (2) bound by a final
               judgment, and (3) entitled to notice in a
               [class] action. It is therefore necessary to
               arrive  at a definition that is precise,
               objective, and presently ascertainable &#133;
               Definitions &#133; should avoid criteria that are
               subjective (e.g. a plaintiff&#146;s state of mind)
               or that depend upon the merits (e.g., persons
               who  were  discriminated against).  Such
               definitions frustrate efforts to identify
               class members, contravene the policy against
               considering the merits of a claim in deciding
               whether  to certify a class, and  create
               potential problems of manageability.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  The    defendant   urges,   in    the
          alternative,   that  the   class   definition
          should   include  a  reference   to   damages
          resulting   from   smoke   inhalation.   This
          requirement,    if   adopted,    would    run
          contrary  to  the tenets set  out  above.  It
          would   unduly  narrow  the  class   and   it
          anticipates    entitlement.   Moreover,    it
          would   eliminate   persons   with   strictly
          property  damage  claims.  The  reference  to
          damages  impinges  on  the  merits   of   the
          claim  and,  thus,  goes beyond  the  purpose
          of    class    definition.   The   definition
          proposed   by   the  plaintiff  is   approved
          with   the  deletion  of  words  &#147;and   toxic
          gases&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  This leaves open the question of whether the merits may  be
considered  in  any respect under s.5(1)(b). I see  no  error  in
looking  beyond  the pleadings and to the evidence  presented  to
assist   in  the  application  of  the  criteria  set  forth   in
ss.5(1)(b),  (c) and (d). If it were otherwise any  statement  of
claim  alleging the existence of an identifiable group of  people
would  foreclose  further consideration by the court.  Similarly,
the  mere  allegation  that the class action  is  the  preferable
procedure  would prevent the court from making its own assessment
of the evidence under s.5(1)(d).
[13] On the other hand, it would be wrong to test the existence
of a class by looking for evidence that the members of the
proposed group have, individually, a claim on the merits. The
Divisional Court may have overstepped that line in the excerpts
quoted above, but reading the reasons as a whole, I think O&#146;Leary
J. was expressing his concern about a perceived lack of reality
to any proposed linkage between the plaintiff&#146;s claim and the
class which is defined as 30,000 persons in a large geographic
area.
[14] In circumstances such as are described in the statement of
claim one would expect to see evidence of the existence of a body
of persons seeking recourse for their complaints, such as, a
history of &#147;town meetings&#148;, demands, claims against the no fault
fund, applications to amend the Certificate of Approval, and, in
general, evidence to give some credence to the allegation that,
in the words of s.5(1)(b) &#147;there is an identifiable class &#133;&#148;.
There was evidence of complaints over an extended period of time
from a sizeable geographic area, but the Divisional Court seemed
to be dubious that this was sufficient evidence of a class.
[15] In most instances, such as disasters or defective autos,
evidence to assist in the identification of a class will be
unnecessary, its identity being self-evident. In Bywater for
instance, the certified class was defined as &#147;all persons &#133; who
were exposed to smoke and toxic gases in TTC vehicles or on TTC
premises &#133;&#148; In the instant case the existence of a class with
claims for damages that the members wish to assert is more
problematic and, if that was the concern of the Divisional Court,
rather than the merits of the claims, then I would not disagree
with their inquiry and concern under s.5(1)(b). In the end,
s.5(1)(b) requires that the judge be satisfied from the statement
of claim or, if necessary, from the evidence as well, that there
is some credence to the allegation that there is an identifiable
class.
[16] That being said, I take a different approach than the
Divisional Court by commencing with an analysis under s. 5(1)(c)
to determine whether there are common issues &#150; the  centrepiece
of any class action. My conclusion is that there are no common
issues which can be manageably tried or will advance the
litigation and thus, in the end, I would deny certification on
this basis without leave to re-apply.
[17] The motions judge directed that the common issues be
&#147;liability and punitive and exemplary damages.&#148; Before this court
the appellant supported that broad definition and then suggested
alternatives including, respecting the central issue of nuisance,
&#147;did the defendant&#146;s operation of the Keele Valley Landfill
interfere with class members&#146; use and enjoyment of their
properties?&#148;  The latter is really a definition of a legal
nuisance and thus returns one to the liability issue designated
by the motion judge.
[18] The statement of claim alleges negligence, nuisance, a claim
based on Rylands v. Fletcher and on s. 99 of the Environmental
Protection Act (for a spill of a pollutant). No one of these
claims can be established unless a nuisance is proved and thus
the search for a common issue can be confined to the claim of
nuisance. Counsel before this court stated that the prime
complaint was odours emanating from the site, and I shall
therefore confine my analysis to nuisance by reason of odours.
[19] In Russell Transport Ltd. v. Ontario Malleable Iron Co.
(1952), O.R. 621 (Gen. Div.) the court addressed the emission of
harmful matter from the defendant&#146;s foundry. McRuer C.J.H.C.
adopted a description of a legal nuisance from the House of
Lords. At p. 628 he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The statement of the Lord Chancellor  in
	  St. Helen&#146;s Smelting Company v. Tipping (1865), 
	  11 H.L. Cas. 641 at 650, 11 E.R. 1483, is the 
	  classic authority in all cases similar to the
	  one before me:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     &#145;My  Lords,  in  matters  of  this
          description  it appears to me that  it  is  a
          very  desirable thing to mark the  difference
          between an action brought for a nuisance upon
          the ground that the alleged nuisance produces
          material  injury  to  the  property,  and  an
          action  brought for a nuisance on the  ground
          that  the  thing alleged to be a nuisance  is
          productive  of sensible personal  discomfort.
          With  regard  to  the  latter,  namely,   the
          personal inconvenience and interference  with
          one&#146;s  enjoyment, one&#146;s quiet, one&#146;s personal
          freedom,   anything   that   discomposes   or
          injuriously affects the senses or the nerves,
          whether that may or may not be denominated  a
          nuisance, must undoubtedly depend greatly  on
          the  circumstances  of the  place  where  the
          thing complained of actually occurs. If a man
          lives  in  a  town, it is necessary  that  he
          should subject himself to the consequences of
          those  operations  of  trade  which  may   be
          carried  on in his immediate locality,  which
          are   actually   necessary  for   trade   and
          commerce,  and  also  for  the  enjoyment  of
          property,   and  for  the  benefit   of   the
          inhabitants of the town and of the public  at
          large. If a man lives in a street where there
          are numerous shops, and a shop is opened next
          door  to him, which is carried on in  a  fair
          and  reasonable  way, he has  no  ground  for
          complaint,  because  to himself  individually
          there  may  arise  much discomfort  from  the
          trade  carried on in that shop. But  when  an
          occupation is carried on by one person in the
          neighbourhood of another, and the  result  of
          that trade, or occupation, or business, is  a
          material  injury  to  property,  then   there
          unquestionably   arises  a   very   different
          consideration. I think, my Lords, that  in  a
          case  of  that  description,  the  submission
          which  is  required  from persons  living  in
          society  to  that amount of discomfort  which
          may  be necessary for the legitimate and free
          exercise  of  the trade of their  neighbours,
          would   not   apply   to  circumstances   the
          immediate result of which is sensible  injury
          to  the  value of the property.&#146; (The italics
          are mine.)</pre>
    <pre>[20]  It follows that liability for nuisance in the present  case
in  favour of any individual property owner or resident, can only
be   established  by  evidence  that  the  particular  individual
personally   suffered  sensible  discomfort  or   evidence   that
emissions from the defendant&#146;s premises have interfered with  the
reasonable enjoyment of their properties.
[21] We are not dealing with a plume that enveloped a
neighbourhood for a defined period where, upon proof of the
event, it can be assumed that everyone was similarly affected by
a legal nuisance. The events complained of occurred sporadically
over a number of years and with varying intensity of odour. The
members of the proposed class live at various distances and
directions from the landfill site and, of course, wind directions
and velocity are constantly changing. The evidence also suggests,
as an added complication, that there are alternative potential
sources of odours in the community.
[22] This group of 30,000 people is not comparable to patients
with implants, the occupants of a wrecked train or those who have
been drinking polluted water. They are individuals whose lives
have each been affected, or not affected, in a different manner
and degree and each may or may not be able to hold the respondent
liable for a nuisance. A trial judge dealing with liability as a
common issue would immediately discover that there was no economy
in the proceedings and that the trial would be unmanageable.
Every incident complained of would have to be separately examined
together with its impact upon every household and a conclusion
reached as to whether each owner or occupier had been impacted
sufficiently that a finding of nuisance is justified. To add to
the already impossible task, complaints of odours are by their
nature subjective and thus would have to be individually assessed
in order to ascertain whether emissions from the respondent&#146;s
site had materially affected each class member&#146;s enjoyment of
property or caused personal discomfort justifying compensation.
[23] No common issue other than liability was suggested and I
cannot devise one that would advance the litigation. An issue
such as &#147;Did the defendant emit pollutants into the atmosphere
over a six-year period, and if so, when, and to what extent?&#148;
would result in a virtual Royal Commission into the operation of
this landfill site without any measurable advance in the
litigation. One could assume from the evidence of complaints that
odours have escaped this site from time to time over the years.
The issue is whether these odours caused sensible personal
discomfort or interfered with  the enjoyment of property to such
an extent that the individuals affected are deserving of
compensation.
[24] This is to be contrasted with the circumstances in Bywater
where Winkler J. observed at p. 178:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Evidence of the circumstances surrounding the fire, the
     general background of the events on August 6, 1997, including the
     evacuation of the affected portion of the subway system, the
     composition of the smoke, the manner in which TTC staff reacted
     to the emergency, and other evidence of general application to
     all the individual claims is relevant and indeed essential for a
     determination of individual damage claims. It is expedient, and
     in the interests of judicial economy, that this evidence and any
     consequent findings be dealt with as common issues of fact. Apart
     from the obvious efficiencies, this has the added advantage of
     removing the risk of inconsistent findings which accompanies a
     multiplicity of proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  My  analysis and conclusion are similar to those of Winkler
J.  in  Mouhteros v. DeVry Canada Inc. (1998), 41  O.R.  (3d)  63
(Gen. Div.), addressing a claim that the defendant misrepresented
the  quality  of  the  programs and  facilities  offered  at  the
educational institution it was running, he stated at p. 73:
          </pre>
    <pre>           The presence of individual issues will not be fatal to
     certification. Indeed, virtually every class action contains
     individual issues to some extent. In the instant case, however,
     what common issues there may be are completely subsumed by the
     plethora of individual issues, which would necessitate individual
     trials for virtually each class member. Each student&#146;s experience
     is idiosyncratic, and liability would be subject to numerous
     variables for each class member. Such a class action would be
     completely unmanageable.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  Sharpe  J.  came  to  a similar conclusion  in  Controltech
Engineering  Inc.  v. Ontario Hydro (1998), 72 O.T.C.  351  (Gen.
Div.),  arising  from an Ontario Hydro request for  proposals  to
provide it with the electricity from renewable energy technology,
where he stated at paragraph 16:
          </pre>
    <pre>     [para16]  While there is a common factual core to the claims
     of the various bidders, I am not persuaded that this common core
     amounts to a common issue for the purposes of s. 5. In
     particular, I fail to see how the proposed common issues would
     resolve anything that would &#147;move the litigation forward&#148; in as
     much as it would still be necessary to examine what was said to
     each individual bidder with respect to each individual claim.
     This is not a case that lends itself to determination of the
     discrete issues of misrepresentation and negligence or
     recklessness, leaving cleanly for individual consideration the
     issue of reliance on the specific statement dealt with at the
     common issue stage. Here, the facts and issues cannot be broken
     down into appropriate and distinct categories that would allow
     the case to proceed in that manner. No single or common statement
     can be identified as having been made at the same time, or in a
     sufficiently similar context, and because different statements
     were made to various class members at various stages of the
     bidding process and in relation to various proposals, it would be
     necessary to determine on an individual basis precisely what the
     individual bidder was told. The plaintiff simply cannot escape
     the consequences of the fact that claims do not all flow from the
     same misrepresentation. I conclude, accordingly, that there is no
     common issue with respect to the claims for misrepresentation.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appellant further seeks to justify certification on  the
grounds  that this is an action for a public nuisance as well  as
for  private  nuisances.  In Ryan v. Victoria  (City),  [1999]  1
S.C.R. 201; at p. 17 Major J. refers to public nuisance in  these
terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>     ¶ 52 The doctrine of public nuisance appears as a poorly
     understood area of the law. &#147;A public nuisance has been defined
     as any activity which unreasonably interferes with the public&#146;s
     interest in questions of health, safety morality, comfort or
     convenience&#148;: see Klar, supra, at p. 525. Essentially, &#147;[t]he
     conduct complained of must amount to &#133; an attack upon the rights
     of the public generally to live their lives unaffected by
     inconvenience, discomfort or other forms of interference&#148;:  See
     G.H.L. Fridman, The Law of Torts in Canada, vol. I (1989), at p.
     168.</pre>
    <pre>[28] Before recent statutory changes such an action could only be
instituted  on  the  relation of, and with the  consent  of,  the
Attorney  General  and  was  normally directed  to  obtaining  an
injunction  against  a  public nuisance. In  Attorney  General  v
P.Y.A.  Quarries  Ltd.,  [1957] 2 Q.B. 169  (C.A.)  the  Attorney
General  on the relation of the county council and rural district
council  was  seeking  to restrain a quarry owner  from  blasting
stones and splinters through the neighbourhood.
[29] Romer L.J. stated at p. 187:
          </pre>
    <pre>     In general, however, a public nuisance is proved by the
     cumulative effect which it is shown to have had on the people
     living within its sphere of influence. In other words, a normal
     and legitimate way of proving a public nuisance is to prove a
     sufficiently large collection of private nuisances.</pre>
    <pre>[30]   The   Ontario   Law  Reform  Commission   recognized   the
insufficiency  of  relator proceedings  to  deal  with  pollution
claims  and thus recommended class actions as a means of  redress
for  environmental  claims.  Following  that,  the  Environmental
Protection Act,  R.S.O. 1990, c.E.19 created a statutory cause of
action  for spills in s. 99(2) and s. 103(1) of the Environmental
Bill  of  Rights,  S.O.  1993, c.28 and eliminated  the  need  to
proceed by way of relator proceedings for a claim based on public
nuisance.
[31] Against this background the appellant contends that he has a
legitimate claim for a public nuisance and that his claim should
proceed by way of a class proceeding.
[32] As I see it, the authorization of class actions provided a
remedy against polluters in appropriate circumstances, and the
elimination of the need for relator proceedings opened up another
avenue for pursuit. However, one should not assume an overlap
between the two. The action as presently constituted may proceed
to trial asserting a public nuisance and the plaintiff may prove
that there are a sufficient number of private nuisances to
justify a finding of public nuisance. This would presumably lead
to some form of injunctive relief and, perhaps, damages to the
plaintiff for his private nuisance claim. If the emissions are as
troublesome as the plaintiff alleges, it should not be too
difficult to call witnesses in his neighbourhood to prove a
&#147;sufficiently large collection of private nuisances&#148; to justify
relief. The onus would then shift to the defendant. That form of
proceeding is straightforward and not cumbersome or unduly
expensive and is one alternative avenue for relief.
[33] However, changing the label from private to public nuisance
doesn&#146;t provide an alternative justification for a class action.
If the individual claims for liability to damages of the members
of the class are to be asserted then there must be a common issue
which will advance the litigation and, as stated, I do not see
one.
[34] I therefore conclude that there is no common issue to
justify certification and the appeal should be dismissed except
for the deletion of paragraph 2 of the Divisional Court order,
dealing with a fresh application before a different judge.
[35] The order of the Divisional Court awarded costs to the
defendant, fixing those for the certification application at
$10,000 and those on appeal at $5,000.
[36] The Law Foundation of Ontario sought and was granted leave
to appeal to this court from the costs order of the Divisional
Court. Under the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, the Law
Foundation maintains a fund to assist claimants in class
proceedings with disbursements, and, where it does provide such
assistance, to make payments to defendants who are awarded costs.
[37] Rule 12.04 provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    12.04(1)  This rule  applies to class
	  proceedings in which the plaintiff or applicant
	  has received financial support from the Fund.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      (2)    No  order  for  costs   or
          assessment of costs shall be made unless  the
          Foundation  has had notice and an opportunity
          to  present evidence and make submissions  in
          respect of the costs.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (3)  The Foundation is a party for
          the  purpose  of  an appeal  in  relation  to
          costs.</pre>
    <pre>[38]  In  this case the Foundation was informed by the  defendant
prior  to the hearing that it would be seeking costs. It was  not
represented   at  the  hearing  and,  in  fact,   no   one   made
representations  as  to  costs.  The  Divisional  Court  reserved
judgment and made its costs order without inviting submissions.
[39] The Foundation&#146;s position before this court was that it was
not complaining of the costs order or its amount, but wished the
court to give directions as to the implementation of rule
12.04(2). Counsel also conceded that costs of this appeal should
follow the event.
[40] This issue is entwined in practical problems. A defendant
and the court do not necessarily know that the Foundation is
involved. The Foundation cannot afford to monitor the entirety of
motions and proceedings. Courts, notably appeal courts, often
assume that costs submissions are unnecessary because the
appearance is that they will follow the event or be dealt with on
some purely discretionary basis.
[41] The appearance is that rule 12.04 was put in place to
protect the Foundation against a plaintiff and counsel, with no
stake in the costs award, failing to properly press the issue of
costs to the detriment of the Foundation. In most cases,
including this one that would not be an issue.
[42] The simplest way to give force to the rule is to make it
standard practice that plaintiff&#146;s counsel inform the court in
each instance that the action is or is not Foundation assisted.
If it is, counsel should inform the court that the Foundation has
been informed of the motion, appeal or other proceeding, and
whether it wishes to present evidence or make submissions as to
costs. A rule amendment is probably in order but, in the
