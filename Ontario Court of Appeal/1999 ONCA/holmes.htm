    <pre>COUNSEL:       John F.L. Rose, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Martin J. Prost, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         December 2, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Hogg J. dated June 22, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  We think that this appeal must be allowed.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In November 1996, Morin J. pronounced judgment in an action
in which he ordered that the amount awarded to the respondent,
inclusive of interest and costs, totalling some $30,000 &#147;shall
take priority over any mortgages that may be registered in favour
of Elaine Garbe and Alfred Garbe or either of them against the
premises known as 495 Sixth Avenue, Port McNicoll, Ontario&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant made an assignment in bankruptcy in May 1998.
In August 1998, an appeal by the respondent from the trustee&#146;s
disallowance of his claim as a secured creditor of the bankrupt
by virtue of the provisions of the judgment of Morin J. was
dismissed by the Registrar in Bankruptcy.  No further appeal was
taken from that order.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant received her discharge from bankruptcy in
February 1999.  In November 1998, between the date of the
bankrupt&#146;s assignment and her discharge, the respondent obtained
an order under s.38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act
authorizing him to commence and prosecute proceedings to set
aside the Garbes&#146; mortgage and for sale of the Port McNicoll
property.  Acting in purported furtherance of that order, the
respondent made a motion in the action in which Morin J. had
granted judgment, premising his entitlement to relief on that
judgment.  In June 1999, Hogg J. granted the respondent&#146;s motion.
This is an appeal from that order.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  With respect, we think that the proceeding before Hogg J.
was misconceived.  The respondent&#146;s status as a secured creditor
in respect of the Port McNicoll property had been decided
adversely to him in August 1998.  The bankrupt&#146;s discharge from
bankruptcy in February 1999 had the effect of releasing the
bankrupt from her indebtedness to the respondent in the absence
of any showing that that debt arose out of fraud, false pretence
or fraudulent misrepresentation.  With the release of that debt,
the foundation for the respondent&#146;s motion before Hogg J. was
gone.  On the state of the record before him, there was no basis
for the order made by him on the ground on which it was advanced,
namely, the November 1996 judgment of Morin J.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  While we think that the order of Hogg J. cannot stand, it is
our further view that any disposition of this appeal should be
without prejudice to the right of the respondent to commence such
proceedings as he may be advised, supported by proper material,
to claim the following relief:</pre>
    <pre>   (a)  in his personal capacity, for a declaration that, by reason
        of fraud, false pretence or fraudulent misrepresentation, or such
        other basis as he may consider applicable, the bankrupt&#146;s debt or
        liability to him has not been released by her order of discharge;
        and
     </pre>
    <pre>   (b)  in his capacity as assignee of the right, title and interest
        of the trustee, for a declaration that the Garbes&#146; mortgage on
        the Port McNicoll property is null and void and should be set
        aside and that he is entitled to sell the property and to retain
        and dispose of the proceeds of such sale, in the manner set out
        in the s.38 order, free and clear of any claim in respect of that
        mortgage.
     </pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appeal is allowed.  The order of Hogg J. is set aside.
In its place, an order will go dismissing the respondent&#146;s
motion, which order will be expressly without prejudice to the
matters referred to in the foregoing paragraph.  There will be no
order as to costs either of the motion or of the appeal.</pre>
