    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Juriansz J., dated October 15,
1998.
</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent brought a motion under Rule 20(3) of Rules of
Civil Procedure and obtained an order dismissing the appellant&#146;s
action for negligence on the grounds that the limitation period
had expired.
[2]  The issue before the motions judge was whether the appellant
had sufficient facts prior to December 11, 1990 to recognise that
it had a cause of action in negligence against its solicitor, the
respondent Linton.
[3]  The respondent had acted for the appellant with respect to
the execution and reporting on mortgage loans to Chagan Patel and
Savita Patel, who were spouses to each other. In March of 1990,
the respondent reported to the appellant that the mortgages were
completed in accordance with the appellant&#146;s mortgage loan
commitment and certified that the mortgages were good and valid
first and second charges.  The mortgages went into default and
the appellant exercised its rights under the mortgages and
commenced legal proceedings against the Patels as mortgagors on
the covenants.
[4]  In her statement of defence dated September 5, 1990, Savita
Patel alleged:

             The Defendant states that at no time did she execute a
       mortgage document as alleged in the statement of claim.  If in
       fact such a mortgage was executed by a person claiming to be the
       Defendant, such person executed the document without the
       Defendant&#146;s knowledge or consent, and therefore the mortgage is
       not enforceable against the Defendant.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The following further facts are not in dispute:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.   On May 14, 1991, counsel for the appellant wrote to the
respondent solicitor giving notice of a potential claim against
him for failing to make sure that the mortgage documents were
properly executed.
2.   The appellant brought a motion for summary judgment against
Savita Patel and in response to that motion, Mrs. Patel swore an
affidavit dated July 11, 1991 in which she swore that the
signatures on the mortgages were forgeries.
3.   On her cross-examination on that affidavit on September 9,
1991, Mrs. Patel continued to deny that the signatures were hers
and alleged that her husband had attended at the offices of the
respondent Linton with a woman who posed as Mrs. Patel and forged
her signature on the mortgages.
4.   The Centre of Forensic Sciences issued a report dated
September 14, 1992 stating that Mrs. Patel &#147;probably did not&#148;
sign the mortgages in question.
5.   The appellant did not commence its action against the
respondent until December 11, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant appears to take the view that if there are
different dates that can trigger the commencement of a limitation
period, the motions judge must defer the determination of which
date is applicable to the trial judge. The appellant relies upon
Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)
161 (C.A.).  However, Aguonie does not stand for such a
proposition.  It is only where there are material facts in
dispute as to the commencement of the limitation period that the
matter must be remitted to the trial judge.  Where, as here, none
of the material facts are in dispute, the requirements of Rule 20
have been satisfied and the motions judge can make whatever
findings are necessary on the limitation issue: see Soper v.
Southcott (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.).
[7]  In this instance, the motions judge found that the appellant
had ample opportunity within the six-year period following the
receipt of the mortgagor&#146;s pleading to make whatever inquiries
were necessary to satisfy it that it had a cause of action.  He
also found that obtaining the forensic report and the sworn
deposition of the mortgagor did not provide the appellant with
additional facts but merely additional evidence.  He concluded
with the finding that the appellant had sufficient facts prior to
December 11, 1990 to &#147;recognise&#148; that it had a cause of action
against the respondent.  The motions judge was fully entitled to
make these findings.
[8]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
