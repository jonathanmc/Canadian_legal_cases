    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Registrar of
Motor Vehicles (&#147;Registrar&#148;), appeals the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Stong of the Ontario Court (General
Division) dated August 5, 1997. Stong J. allowed the application
brought by Ronald Horsefield under s. 6(2) of the Judicial Review
Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1 (&#147;JRPA&#148;) and declared
inoperative s. 48.3 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
H.8, as am. by S.O. 1996, c. 20, s. 8 (&#147;HTA&#148;).
[2]  Section 48.3 of the HTA establishes the so-called
Administrative Driver&#146;s Licence Suspension Program (&#147;ADLS
Program&#148;). The Program provides for a 90-day licence suspension
effective immediately upon the Registrar receiving notice that a
peace officer is satisfied that a driver person driving or having
the has care, charge or and  control of a motor vehicle with had
a blood alcohol concentration exceeding 80 mg milligrams of
alcohol in 100 ml millilitres of blood as revealed by a
breathalyser or blood sample taken pursuant to s. 254 or s. 256
of the Criminal Code or fails or has refused to provide a breath
or blood sample in response pursuant to a demand by a police
officer pursuant to under s. 254 of the Criminal Code or pursuant
to s. 256 of the Criminal Code (blood samples taken by a
physician pursuant to a warrant).
[3]  On August 8, 1997, Stong J. further ordered the Registrar to
pay Horsefield his costs of the application on a solicitor-client
basis.  The Attorney General also appeals this order.  Stong J.&#146;s
judgment is reported at (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 509.</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On December 29, 1996 at 12:18 a.m., Horsefield was stopped
while driving in the City of Oshawa by a R.I.D.E. program
operated by the Durham Regional Police. During a brief
conversation with Horsefield, the officer detected a moderate
odour of alcohol on his breath. Horsefield complied with a demand
to provide a breath sample for a road-side screening device,
which registered a &#147;fail&#148; reading. He was then arrested for
driving with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood (&quot;over 80&quot;).   The officer then read him his
rights to counsel and made a further demand of him to provide a
breath sample for an approved breath analysis instrument pursuant
to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Horsefield accompanied the investigating officer to the
police station where, slightly more than two hours after the
arrest, he submitted two breath samples. The results of the
breathalyzer tests showed a blood alcohol concentration (&#147;BAC&#148;)
of 90 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for both samples. The
breathalyzer technician prepared a certificate of analysis
showing these results and the appellant was charged with driving
with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
blood.
[6]  After the certificate was obtained, a notice of licence
suspension was given to Horsefield at the station on the basis
that an analysis of his blood breath sample showed that he had a
concentration of alcohol in his blood in excess of 80 milligrams
in 100 millilitres of blood (&quot;over 80&quot;). This suspension
procedure was authorized by the ADLS Program that is here
impugned.</pre>
    <pre>Procedural History</pre>
    <pre>[7]  On February 6, 1997, Horsefield commenced an application for
judicial review of the Registrar&#146;s decision to suspend his
licence. He also sought an interlocutory and permanent injunction
to prohibit the Registrar from suspending his licence pending the
hearing and/or trial of the charge of over 80 as well as an
interim and permanent order staying the suspension of his
driver&#146;s licence pending the determination of the judicial review
application.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Stong J. denied the application for an interlocutory
injunction and interim order. As a result, Horsefield served the
90-day licence suspension in full. The over 80 charge against him
under the Criminal Code was withdrawn at the request of the Crown
on May 5, 1997.
[9]  The application for judicial review was disposed of on
August 5, 1997. Stong J. declared that s. 48.3 of the HTA is
unconstitutional because it is ultra vires the jurisdiction of
the Province of Ontario and is inconsistent with paramount
federal legislation in ss. 254, 256 and 258 of the Criminal Code.
In addition, Stong J. declared that s. 48.3 constitutes a
deprivation of liberty within the meaning of s.7 of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms (&#147;Charter&#148;) and is not saved by
s. 1. He concluded that the Registrar acted without legal
authority in imposing the 90-day administrative driver&#146;s licence
suspension on Horsefield and quashed this decision.
[10] The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Registrar,
brought a motion before a single judge of this court on August
15, 1997 seeking a stay of Stong J.&#146;s decision  pending the
motion for leave to appeal, and if leave were granted, pending
the appeal. The motions judge granted the stay. Leave to appeal
from the judgment of Stong J. was granted by a panel of this
court on February 5, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>Relevant Statutory Provisions</pre>
    <pre>[11] The statutory framework of the ADLS Program consists of the
following provisions of the HTA, which read as follows at the
time of the application before Stong J.:
          </pre>
    <pre>               s.48.3  (1) Where a police officer is satisfied that a
          person driving or having the care, charge or control of a motor
          vehicle meets one of the criteria set out in subsection (3), the
          officer shall notify the Registrar of that fact, or cause the
          Registrar to be so notified, in the form and manner and within
          the time prescribed by the regulations.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Upon being notified under
          subsection (1), the Registrar shall suspend a
          person&#146;s driver&#146;s licence for a period of
          ninety days.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  The criteria for the purpose of
          subsection (1) are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The person had a concentration of
          alcohol in his or her blood in excess of 80
          milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood, as
          shown by an analysis of the person&#146;s breath
          or blood taken pursuant to a demand made
          under section 254 of the Criminal Code
          (Canada) or pursuant to section 256 of the
          Criminal Code (Canada).
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The person failed or refused to
          provide a breath or blood sample in response
          to a demand made under section 254 of the
          Criminal Code (Canada).
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  The suspension takes effect from
          the time notice of the suspension is given,
          in accordance with section 52, to the person
          whose licence is suspended.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               (7)  Whether or not the person is unable
          or fails to surrender his or her driver&#146;s
          licence under subsection (5) or (6), the
          licence is suspended and invalid for any
          purpose for a period of ninety days from the
          time notice is given to the person.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               (10)      The suspension of a driver&#146;s
          licence under this section is intended to
          safeguard the public and does not constitute
          an alternative to any proceeding or penalty
          arising from the same circumstances or around
          the same time.
          </pre>
    <pre>               49.1 (1) The board known as the Licence
          Suspension Appeal Board is continued under
          the name Licence Suspension Appeal Board in
          English and Commission d'appel des
          suspensions de permis in French.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               50.1 (1) A person whose driver&#146;s licence
          is suspended under section 48.3 may appeal
          the suspension to the Board.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The only grounds on which a person
          may appeal under subsection (1) and the only
          grounds on which the Board may order that the
          suspension be set aside are,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)            that the licence was suspended solely because of a
               mistake as to the identity of the person who met one of the
               criteria set out in subsection 48.3(3); or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)            that the person failed or refused to comply with a
               demand made under section 254 of the Criminal Code (Canada) to
               provide a sample of breath or blood because he or she was unable
               to do so for a medical reason.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                             . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  The Board may confirm the suspension or may
          order that the suspension be set aside.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               (6)  The decision of the Board under
          this section is final and binding.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (7)  The suspension under section 48.3
          continues to apply despite the filing of an
          appeal under this section unless the
          Registrar reinstates the licence pursuant to
          the Board&#146;s order that the suspension be set
          aside, and this subsection prevails over the
          Statutory Powers Procedure Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (8)  The Board is not required to hold
          an oral hearing under this section unless the
          appellant requests an oral hearing at the
          time of filing the appeal and bases the
          appeal on one of the grounds set out in
          subsection (2).
          </pre>
    <pre>               (9)  Despite a request by the appellant
          for an oral hearing, the Board may order that
          the suspension be set aside on the basis of
          the material filed with the Board without
          holding an oral hearing.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (10)      One member of the Board is a
          quorum for the purposes of an appeal under
          this section.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] Subsequent to the application before Stong J., ss. 48.3 and
50.1 were amended by the Comprehensive Road Safety Act, 1997,
S.O. 1997, c. 12 proclaimed in force 1 August 1997. The changes
to s. 48.3 do not address the constitutional impediments
identified by Stong J.  These amendments are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               3. (1)  Section 48.3 of the Act, as enacted by the Statutes
          of Ontario, 1996, chapter 20, section 8, is amended by adding the
          following subsection:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2.1)     A person has no right to be
          heard before or after the notification by the
          officer, or before or after the Registrar
          suspends the licence, but this subsection
          does not affect the taking of any proceeding
          in court.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Paragraph 1 of subsection 48.3(3)
          of the Act, as enacted by the Statutes of
          Ontario, 1996, chapter 20, section 8 is
          repealed and the following substituted:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The person is shown, by an analysis
          of breath or blood taken pursuant to a demand
          made under subsection 254(3) of the Criminal
          Code (Canada) or pursuant to section 256 of
          the Criminal Code (Canada), to have a
          concentration of alcohol in his or her blood
          in excess of 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres
          of blood.
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   Clause 50.1 (2)(a) of the Act, as
          enacted by the Statutes of Ontario, 1996,
          chapter 20, section 10 is repealed and the
          following substituted:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)       that the person whose licence
               was suspended is not the same individual to
               whom a demand for a sample of breath or blood
               was made, or from whom a sample of breath or
               blood was taken, as the case may be, under or
               pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal
               Code (Canada) referred to in subsection
               48.3(3); or
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The relevant provisions of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Life, Liberty and Security of Person
          </pre>
    <pre>               7.   Everyone has the right to life,
          liberty and security of the person and the
          right not to be deprived thereof except in
          accordance with the principles of fundamental
          justice.
</pre>
    <pre>Issues
     </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  Is s.48.3 of the HTA constitutionally valid
               under the division of powers established by ss. 91
               and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867?
     </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  If the legislation is within the legislative
               competence of the provincial government under s.92
               if the Constitution Act, 1867, is there
               nevertheless a violation of s. 7 of the Charter?
     </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  Does the administration of the license
               suspension provisions of the ADLS Program offend
               the principles of natural justice?
     </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  How should the costs of the application and
               the appeal be awarded?</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[14] The Criminal Lawyers&#146; Association took the lead in
presenting the argument on behalf of the respondent, Horsefield.
It supported the reasons of the application judge for striking
down the impugned legislation on the basis of both the federalism
or separation of powers argument and the submission that s. 48.3
of the HTA violates s. 7 of the Charter. In my opinion, neither
constitutional attack on the ADLS Program in the HTA can succeed.
The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled conclusively that the right
to build and operate highways, including the right to provide for
the circulation and safety of traffic, is wholly within the
purview of the provinces under one or more heads of s.92 of the
Constitution Act, 1867. As for the Charter argument, the weight
of judicial authority is against the conclusion that the right to
drive a motor vehicle is a liberty within the meaning of s. 7.
Accordingly, it is not a constitutionally protected interest. A
subsidiary argument that the ADLS Program somehow interferes with
mobility rights under s. 6 of the Charter has no currency
whatsoever.</pre>
    <pre>[15] It seems to me that the same argument is being advanced
under both arms of the constitutional challenge. It is submitted
that the ADLS Program in using the provisions in the Criminal
Code relating to procedures for conducting breathalyser and blood
tests thereby injects itself into a field already occupied by
federal legislation. Similarly, the intervenor Criminal Lawyers'
Association submits that the Registrar, by making use of the Code
procedures to initiate license suspensions that in turn can be
enforced by criminal sanctions including imprisonment, has
engaged a liberty interest protected by the Charter. As the
intervenor put it in its factum:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  As to the separation of powers analysis:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In enacting the ADLS scheme the
          Government of Ontario has attempted to
          combine a valid legislative objective with
          the criminal law and procedure in a manner
          which gives the provincial proceeding the
          benefit of the criminal enactment while, at
          the same time, bypassing the protection
          accorded an individual by the same criminal
          law and procedure. In so far as s. 48.3 of
          the Highway Traffic Act does so, it is ultra
          vires the province and should be declared of
          no force and effect.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  With reference to s. 7 of the
          Charter:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is respectfully submitted that the
          suspension of a driver&#146;s license enforced by
          penalty provisions including the possibility
          of imprisonment for breach of the license
          suspension represents an interference with a
          person&#146;s right to liberty within section 7 of
          the Charter of Rights such that a person has
          the right under that section not to be
          deprived thereof except in accordance with
          the principles of fundamental justice.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The reference to imprisonment is to s. 53 of the HTA
providing for the imposition of fines and imprisonment for a term
of up to six months for driving while a motorist&#146;s license is
under suspension. The factum continues:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In other words, if this Honourable Court were not, contrary
          to the above submissions, persuaded that the license suspension
          per se represents an interference with a liberty interest which
          can only be carried out in accordance with the principles of
          fundamental justice, then it is submitted that by penalizing
          driving in violation of such suspensions with the threat of
          imprisonment as enforcement, then a liberty interest is created,
          whose impairment must live up to the rules of fundamental
          justice. Therefore, the initial element in that impairment, the
          suspension, must be examined for compliance with the rules of
          fundamental justice in precisely the same way.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Almost the entire argument before us, whether directed to
the separation of powers issue or the issue whether the
legislation interferes with a protected right under the Charter,
was focussed on the additional burden this legislation is said to
impose on the motorist who is under suspicion for driving while
under the influence of alcohol. The first and most obvious
argument was that an over 80 reading  would bring about an
automatic suspension of the motorist&#146;s license, a penalty over
and above what the motorist is already exposed to under the Code.
A second argument was that a motorist who complied with a demand
and had an over 80 reading would be reluctant to test the
validity of the demand or the reading in court because he or she
would be subject to the 90-day license suspension while awaiting
a trial date, a suspension for which he would receive no credit
against the suspension that is called for following a conviction
under the Code. It was submitted that this affected the
motorist&#146;s options in that it made more difficult the motorist&#146;s
choice of complying with the breathalyzer demand or refusing with
the intention of contesting the lawfulness of the demand.
[18] In my opinion, these arguments are irrelevant to either
constitutional challenge. Matters of inconvenience or economic
hardship or difficult legal choices have nothing to do with the
constitutional authority of the provincial legislature to suspend
a driver&#146;s license. Similarly, these matters are of no concern
under the Charter unless a driver&#146;s license is a protected
interest or some other right is engaged under the Charter. The
immateriality of the intervenor&#146;s concerns becomes apparent when
one takes the traditional approach and subjects the legislation
to a segregated analysis, the first under the heading of
separation of powers and the second under the heading of
compliance with the Charter.
[19] Admittedly, it is possible that a given piece of legislation
could be impugned under either approach, but problems arise when
the two issues are combined and addressed as one constitutional
problem. A good example is the result achieved in this case. The
applications judge decided that the legislation is ultra vires
the province because it makes use of a criminal law enacted by
the Government of Canada under s. 91(27) to impose a sanction on
a motorist without incorporating the Criminal Code safeguards
that justify the deprivation of basic rights under the Charter.
This led him to hold that the provincial legislature had enacted
legislation in an area occupied by Parliament that created an
actual conflict with federal legislation sufficient to invoke the
doctrine of paramountcy.
[20] In my opinion, the fact that a provincial enactment has the
object or effect of violating Charter rights of a citizen is
immaterial to its constitutionality under s. 92 of the
Constitutional Act, 1867. The separation of powers analysis
should proceed without reference to the Charter. The enactment of
the Charter postdates the separation of powers under our
constitution and gives a separate and distinct authority to the
court to strike down legislation which is otherwise
constitutional in the event that it violates the fundamental
freedoms enshrined therein. This is an additional constitutional
tool. The court always has had the power to declare provincial
legislation ultra vires as not being supportable under s.92.
     </pre>
    <pre>               Issue 1   Is s.48.3 of the HTA constitutionally
               valid under the division of powers established by
               ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867?</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellant properly relies on the Supreme Court of Canada
decision in Prince Edward Island (Provincial Secretary) v. Egan,
[1941] S.C.R. 396 as authority for the constitutionality of s.
48.3 of the HTA with respect to the separation of powers issue.
At issue in Egan was the legislative competence of the province
of P.E.I. to enact a provision of the Highway Traffic Act of that
province which imposed a 12-month licence suspension on a person
convicted of driving while impaired. In addition, the provision
prohibited the Provincial Secretary from issuing a licence to any
person during the suspension period.</pre>
    <pre>[22] The appellant in particular cites Rinfret J.'s statement at
pp. 415-416:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The right of building highways and of operating them within
          a province&#133; is wholly within the purview of the province&#133;and so
          is the right to provide for the safety of circulation and traffic
          on such highways. The aspect of that field is wholly provincial,
          from the point of view both of the use of the highway and of the
          use of the vehicles. It has to do with the civil regulation of
          the use of highways and personal property, the protection of the
          persons and property of the citizens, the prevention of nuisances
          and the suppression of conditions calculated to make circulation
          and traffic dangerous. &#133;It has nothing to do with the Dominion
          aspect of the creation of a crime and its punishment.  And it
          cannot be said that the Dominion, while constituting the criminal
          offence of driving while intoxicated and providing for certain
          penalties therefor, has invaded the whole field in such a way as
          to exclude all provincial jurisdiction&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Surely the authority to issue such
          licences, or permits, carries with it the
          authority to suspend or cancel them, upon the
          happening of certain conditions. The
          provision that a person convicted of driving
          while intoxicated will lose his licence for a
          time or forever is, in a certain sense, a
          condition upon which the licence, or permit,
          is granted by the province. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant also relies on Ross v. Registrar of Motor
Vehicles, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 5, wherein the court reaffirmed its
holding in Egan that the provincial legislature has authority to
regulate the system of driver's licences to secure the observance
of regulations enacted in the public interest. Like Egan, Ross
was decided in the context of a constitutional challenge to a
provincially imposed post-conviction licence suspension.
[24] The argument is made that the facts in Egan and Ross are
distinguishable from those in Horsefield because the licence
suspension in the former cases followed a conviction under the
Criminal Code for an alcohol-related driving offence whereas the
ADLS Program mandates suspension prior to and consequently,
irrespective of, a conviction. This attempted distinction ignores
the seminal finding by Rinfret J. that the suspension scheme in
Egan had nothing to with the creation of crime and its
punishment; rather, the suspension scheme created a civil
disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence.
The fact that the suspension in the case in appeal is not tied to
a conviction for a criminal offence, but is connected to the
failure to supply a breath sample with a reading that is not over
80, distances the scheme further from the federal criminal law
jurisdiction under s. 91(27).
[25] This point was made by Melvin J. of the British Columbia
Supreme Court in Buhlers v. British Columbia (Superintendent of
Motor Vehicles) (1998), 33 M.V.R. (3d) 164 where he heard a
constitutional challenge to the ADLS program enacted by
amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318. The
nature of the challenge was identical to that brought by
Horsefield. Melvin J. was satisfied that the impugned legislation
relates to the entitlement of an individual to hold a valid
driver's licence, which is a subject properly and solely within
provincial jurisdiction. He found at p. 173 that this conclusion
was unaffected by the fact that the behaviour leading to the
suspension may also support a conviction under the Criminal Code.
[26] In reaching this conclusion, Melvin J. relied on the
decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wolff
(1979), 9 B.C.L.R. 390, which considered the constitutionality of
a roadside suspension of a driver's licence by a peace officer on
suspicion of alcohol consumption by the driver. At p. 172 Melvin
J. quoted the following observation of the Court in Wolff:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;I cannot see why the Egan case should be distinguished
          merely because the provincial legislature provided that the
          action with regard to the licence would be taken after a
          conviction under the Criminal Code. If the legislation is within
          the competence of the provincial legislature, it is valid whether
          the powers be exercisable before or after a conviction under the
          Criminal Code. The legislature is trying to ensure the safety of
          the users of the highway, and is legislating within its
          jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The judgment of Melvin J. was upheld by the B.C. Court of
Appeal in a judgment that was released February 24, 1999.  Hinds
J.A., speaking for the court, dismissed both constitutional
challenges against  the B.C. legislation:  see [1999] B.C.J. No.
408.  In extensive reasons, he reviewed many of the same
authorities that I have considered, including without comment as
to its merit, the decision of Stong J. in Horsefield.
[28] On the division of powers issue, Hinds J.A. concluded at
paragraph 61:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Upon reviewing the provisions of the Legislation and the
          extrinsic evidence adduced in the court below, I conclude that
          the purpose and effect of the Legislation, its pith and
          substance, is the licensing of persons to drive motor vehicles
          and the enhancement of public safety on the highway. Those are
          matters within the jurisdiction of the province. The authorities
          to which I have referred (with the exception of the Horsefield
          decision), establish that the Legislation did not improperly
          encroach upon the federal jurisdiction under s. 91(27) of the
          Constitution Act, 1867. I therefore conclude that the
          Legislation, on a division of powers analysis, is not ultra
          vires.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Lower courts in Manitoba, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. have also
upheld the constitutionality of  ADLS programs in their
provinces.  The Manitoba ADLS program was challenged in R. v.
Leclair (1990), 67 Man.R. (2d) 265 (Man. Q.B.) on the basis that
it was criminal law and thus was outside the province's
jurisdiction to enact. However, the court concluded at p. 274
that the purpose and effect of the impugned provisions are to
regulate and control traffic on provincial highways and are thus
within the legislative competence of the Province under s. 92(13)
of the Constitution Act, 1867. The ADLS program in Nova Scotia
was upheld by MacAdam J. in White et al. v. Nova Scotia
(Registrar of Motor Vehicles) (1996), 426 A.P.R. 259 (N.S.S.C).
His decision, which did not consider the federalism issue, was
affirmed without reasons by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on
May 27, 1996. In R. v. MacCormick, [1998] 1 P.E.I.R. 298, Webber
J. rejected a challenge to the scheme of P.E.I., which included
the argument that the impugned legislation offended the division
of powers.  She analysed the reasons of Stong J. on the
federalism issue and declined to follow them.  Her judgment was
recently upheld by the P.E.I. Court of Appeal in very brief
reasons dated March 12, 1999.
[30] To my way of thinking, the conclusion that the legislation
is intra vires the province is clear. However, Stong J. reached
the opposite conclusion. He said at pp. 518-19:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Parliament of Canada has from its exclusive jurisdiction
          over the criminal law given evidentiary vitality and viability to
          the breath test, but only within the safeguards of s. 258 of the
          Criminal Code&#133;. Parliament has legislated the permissible
          evidentiary effect of breath tests. The province on the other
          hand has attempted to legislate to utilize those tests while at
          the same time ignoring the safeguards that Parliament has imposed
          on the tests to give them not only life, but scientific and
          factual validity. The province has adopted a scatter-gun approach
          to the federal legislation upon which it bases s. 48.3 of the
          Highway Traffic Act.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               While it is accepted that the province
          may make a licensing decision contingent upon
          the happening of an event, when that event is
          a reference back to an action which itself is
          a creation of federal law, the province acts
          at its own peril when it alters the action so
          as to destroy its validity. When the
          reference is back to an action taken pursuant
          to federal law, then that action itself must
          be a legitimate action [Emphasis in
          original].</pre>
    <pre>[31] Stong J. held:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Insofar as the province has legislated inconsistently with
          an area occupied by Parliament, s. 48.3 of the Highway Traffic
          Act runs afoul of the &#147;division of powers&#148; in the Constitution,
          and creates an actual conflict sufficient to invoke the doctrine
          of paramountcy. The provincial scheme cannot stand and so is
          declared inoperative by virtue of its unconstitutionality.
</pre>
    <pre>[32] The reasons of Stong J. are not consistent with those of the
Supreme Court in Egan and Ross, supra. His conclusion on the
federalism issue has also been the subject of academic criticism
by Professors Solomon, Hovius and Usprich in an article entitled,
&quot;90-Day Administrative Licence Suspensions:  Constitutional
Challenges on the Road to Traffic Safety&quot; (1998), 30 M.V.R.(3d)
119. The authors concluded that Stong J.'s decision in Horsefield
should not be upheld.</pre>
    <pre>[33] These authors contend that the ADLS Program is
constitutionally valid legislation based on the provincial
authority over property and civil rights, citing Egan, supra, in
support of that conclusion. The authors disagree with Stong J.'s
conclusion that the impugned legislative scheme conflicts with
the Criminal Code procedural safeguards so as to invoke the
doctrine of paramountcy. In doing so they comment critically on
his objection that the breathalyzer demand in this particular
case was not made within the two hours called for by the Code.
The authors state at pp. 135-136:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Stong J. concluded that Ontario's 90-day ALS provisions
          conflicted with the Criminal Code because they impose a licence
          suspension on motorists based on a single Breathalyzer test, even
          if it was conducted more than two hours after the alleged
          impaired driving incident.
          </pre>
    <pre>               His conclusion appears to be based on
          the view that Parliament has occupied the
          field on the validity of Breathalyzer and
          blood tests. As indicated, however, the
          Canadian courts have repeatedly rejected the
          &quot;occupied field&quot; or &quot;negative implication&quot;
          test in recent years [see Multiple Access v.
          McCutcheon, [1982] S.C.R. 161]. Moreover, the
          clear language of s. 258(1)(c) and (d) limits
          the application of that section to the
          criminal prosecution of drinking and driving
          offences. Finally, even if Parliament had
          intended to control the provinces' use of
          Breathalyzer and blood tests in licensing
          matters and had used unequivocal language to
          that effect, its constitutional authority to
          do so is highly questionable. Parliament has
          no constitutional authority to dictate to the
          provinces the standards and procedures that
          they must use in regulating the licensing of
          drivers. In our view, Parliament did not have
          the intent, nor would it have the
          constitutional authority, to limit how the
          provinces use Breathalyzer and blood test
          results.  [Emphasis added].</pre>
    <pre>[34] In addition to rejecting the possibility that the federal
legislation occupied the field, these authors reject the notion
that the Criminal Code and HTA provisions are in actual conflict.
They point out at p. 136 that compliance with one statute does
not necessitate violating the other:  &quot;Consequently, the doctrine
of paramountcy does not apply and both provisions are operable&#148;.
[35] In conclusion, I am of the view that the ADLS Program was
enacted in accordance with the Province's jurisdiction under s.
92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and, further, that there is no
conflict, either actual or by implication, between the ADLS
Program and the Criminal Code provisions.
     </pre>
    <pre>               Issue 2   If the legislation is within the
               legislative competence of the provincial
               government under s.92 if the Constitution Act,
               1867, is there nevertheless a deprivation of a
               liberty protected by the Charter?</pre>
    <pre>[36] The applications judge found that the ADLS Program
constituted a deprivation of a liberty protected by the Charter.
He observed at p. 524 that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;once a licence is granted and the citizen is qualified to
          drive, there attaches to that licence a general liberty to employ
          one's skill and ability, in this case the ability to drive.  A
          driver's licence properly obtained and validly held&#133; can be
          characterized in modern society as a major component of the
          liberty known as freedom of movement.  When one considers the
          vastness of Ontario, it is little wonder that the automobile of
          the 20th century has been compared to the steam locomotive of the
          19th century. &#133; In our highly mobile and mechanized society
          communities are so geographically separated and the people so
          demographically scattered that entitlement to legally drive a
          motor vehicle can be more properly characterized as a necessity
          than a luxury.  The mobility of the citizenry has taken on the
          quality of an essential &quot;need&quot; in this large province. [Emphasis
          added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[37] However, the weight of judicial authority is firmly against
the conclusion that the right to drive is a liberty within the
meaning of s. 7 of the Charter. While the question has not been
directly considered by the Supreme Court of Canada, several
provincial appellate courts have ruled on the matter.</pre>
    <pre>[38] A leading case is the early Charter decision of the Alberta
Court of Appeal in R. v. Neale (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 345, from
which the Supreme Court denied leave to appeal:  [1987] 1 S.C.R.
xi (note). This decision was not referred to by Stong J. in
Horsefield. In Neale, the Court held that circulation in a motor
vehicle is not a right protected by s. 7 of the Charter. In the
words of Lieberman J.A. for the Court at p. 352:  &quot;On the face of
it, a suspension of driving privilege has no effect on the
accused's liberty as the suspension does not restrict his right
to go where he chooses. There is no physical restraint on him.&quot;
In Yehia v. Alberta (Solicitor General) (1992), 40 M.V.R. (2d)
57, the Alberta Court of Appeal reaffirmed its decision in Neale.
[39] Neale  was referred to by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Gray (1988), 54 Man. R. (2d) 240 as establishing that the
suspension of a driver's licence does not constitute a
deprivation of liberty under s. 7 of the Charter.
[40] Neale was also relied on by the P.E.I. Court of Appeal in
P.E.I. (Registrar of Motor Vehicles) v. Rankin (1991), 30 M.V.R.
(2d) 122 as authority for the proposition that the right to drive
is not protected by the Charter. The issue in that case was
whether the absence of a provision in the Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. H-5, for a stay of a licence cancellation
pending an appeal of a conviction on a charge of driving over 80
violated s. 7. Mitchell J.A. for the Court held as follows at pp.
123-124:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The absence of a stay provision only matters if the Charter
          gives some protection to a right to drive in the first place. I
          have concluded that it does not. Section 7 comes under the
          heading of &quot;Legal Rights&quot; in the Charter. Considering the
          historical origins of our notion of liberty in that context, I
          have concluded that in s. 7 that term refers to an absence of
          legal restraints on physical movement. Its purpose is to allow
          people to freely move about and go where they choose. However, it
          does not go so far as to guarantee that they can move according
          to the mode of their choice. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
          Dedman &#133; has already characterized the so called &quot;right to drive&quot;
          a motor vehicle on the highway in a way which puts it beyond the
          pale of s. 7&#133;. It follows, therefore, that the failure of the
          Highway Traffic Act to provide a stay of licence cancellation
          pending appeal does not offend s. 7 of the Charter because that
          section does not guarantee any right to drive in the first place.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court recognizes that cancellation
          of a licence while an appeal is still pending
          seems unfair. Perhaps the Highway Traffic Act
          ought to be amended to allow for a stay by
          adding a provision similar to s. 261 of the
          Criminal Code. However, that is a matter for
          the Legislature, not the Courts. The Charter
          neither provides constitutional protection
          for all human activities nor a remedy for
          every grievance. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[41] The Quebec Court of Appeal has also ruled that the right to
drive a motor vehicle is not a fundamental right protected by the
Charter, but is a right of an economic character:  see R. v.
Duguay;  R.v. Lepage, [1993] R.J.Q. 722 (Q.C.A.);  leave to
appeal to S.C.C. refused [1987] 1 S.C.R. xi.  Similarly, the
Saskatchen Court of Appeal in Ginther v. Saskatchewan Government
Insurance, [1988] 4 W.W.R. 738 (Sask. C.A.) ruled at p. 741 that
&quot;&#133;the right to life, liberty and security of the person as
contemplated by s. 7 of the Charter does not include the &quot;right&quot;
to drive an automobile.&quot;
[42] The only exception to this line of jurisprudence at the
appellate level is the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision
in R. v. Robson (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 137.  The Court in that
case held that legislation empowering a peace officer to require
a driver to surrender his licence where the officer has reason to
suspect that the driver had consumed alcohol violated s. 7 of the
Charter.  The Court expressed the view at p. 140 that once a
driver's licence &quot;&#133;is granted there becomes attached to it the
general liberty to employ one's skill and ability -- in this case
the ability to drive.  Accordingly, such liberty constitutes a
right under the Charter and a person cannot be deprived of it
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&quot;
[43] However, in the very recent decision in Buhlers, supra, the
British Columbia Court of Appeal expressly refused to follow
Robson. Hinds J.A. for the Court at paragraph 110 held that &quot;&#133;the
right or privilege to drive a motor vehicle on a public highway
is not a liberty protected by s. 7&quot;.
[44] Although the Supreme Court has not directly considered
whether the right to drive is a liberty interest protected by s.
7 of the Charter, it has considered s.7 in the driving context.
Passages from several of the Court's judgments in this area
provide support for the conclusion that the right to drive is not
protected by s. 7. For example, in R. v. Richard, [1996] 3 S.C.R.
525 the Court considered whether a New Brunswick provision, which
permitted conviction for an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act,
S.N.B. 1987, c. P-22.1 where a driver fails to appear in court at
the time and place indicated in the ticket, infringed s. 11(d) of
the Charter. La Forest J. for the Court raised the issue whether
s. 7 of the Charter was engaged. He held at p. 546 that it was
not:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the case at bar, however, there is absolutely no
          possibility of imprisonment, since the penalties that can be
          imposed in proceedings initiated by means of a ticket are limited
          to fines, and the failure to pay a fine for contravening the
          Motor Vehicle Act can in no case result in imprisonment. Thus,
          the liberty component of s. 7 of the Charter does not come into
          play.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  The decision of the Supreme Court in R. v. Pontes, [1995] 3
S.C.R. 44 is capable of supporting the same conclusion.The facts
in Pontes were that the accused had been prohibited from driving
a motor vehicle under s. 92 of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle
Act.  That section provided that a person convicted of an offence
under certain sections of the Act was &quot;automatically and without
notice&quot; prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for 12 months.
The accused was later found driving a motor vehicle during the
period of prohibition and was charged under s. 94(1) of the Act,
which provided that a person who drives a motor vehicle on a
highway while he is prohibited from doing so under s. 92 is
liable on conviction to a fine and imprisonment.  The issue
before the Supreme Court was whether s. 94(1) created a strict or
absolute liability offence.
[46] Cory J. concluded that ss. 92 and 94 created an absolute
liability offence.  Nonetheless, he held that the absolute
liability offence did not contravene the Charter.  The reason for
this holding was that ss. 4.1 and 72(1) of the Offence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305, as amended, prohibited imprisonment with
respect to an absolute liability offence.  Cory J. had earlier
noted at p. 50 that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Obviously, if the offence is one of absolute liability, but
          there is no risk of imprisonment, then the provision will not
          offend s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</pre>
    <pre>[47] Accordingly, because an accused convicted under ss. 92 and
94 faced no risk of imprisonment, the Court concluded that no s.
7 violation was established.
[48] Hinds J.A. made the following observation about the majority
decision in Pontes at paragraph 83, with which I agree:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The majority concluded that the provisions of s. 7 were not
          involved because, although the offence was an absolute liability
          offence, the accused faced no risk of imprisonment and,
          therefore, the accused's personal liberty was not affected.  But
          if the majority had been of the opinion that, absent the
          liability to imprisonment, the accused's right to drive was,
          nevertheless, a liberty protected under s. 7 of the Charter, it
          is anticipated that the majority would have so stated.</pre>
    <pre>[49] It would thus run counter to the weight of authority at the
appellate level throughout Canada to hold that the right to drive
is a liberty within the meaning of s. 7 of the Charter. The
reluctance to find the right to drive as being a liberty interest
protected by s. 7 no doubt stems in part from a fear of
trivializing the Charter. Along these lines, Webber J. in
MacCormick, supra stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There are good reasons for restricting &quot;liberty&quot; in the
          Charter to fundamental rights in the tradition of our common law.
          This should ensure that the principles that we as a society hold
          very dear and believe are fundamental to a democratic system of
          government are upheld while, at the same time, ensure that the
          courts don't become the legislators of society.</pre>
    <pre>[50] Also as pointed out by Webber J., there was no evidentiary
basis before Stong J. to establish that the right to drive is as
essential to liberty as Stong J. assumed. On the contrary, the
evidence showed that Horsefield was able to make alternate
arrangements to get to work and to run his errands. As well,
Stong J. cited the study submitted by the appellant in the form
of an affidavit of John Hughes, Director of the Safety Policy
Branch at the Ministry of Transportation, which concluded that
suspended drivers are able to make alternative arrangements to
get to and from work. The evidentiary record thus does not
provide a firm basis for concluding that the right to drive falls
within the s. 7 guarantee.
[51] I adopt the latest word on this subject as expressed by
Hinds J.A. in Buhlers, supra. On the Charter challenge, he had
this to say at paragraph 109:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the broadened scope of the liberty interest
          protected by s. 7, as expressed by some of the members of the
          Supreme Court in B. (R.) [B. (R.) v. Children's Aid Society,
          [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315]and in Godbout [Godbout v. Longueil (City),
          [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844], does not extend to the driving of a motor
          vehicle on a public highway. It is not a matter that is
          fundamental or inherently personal to the individual. It is not a
          matter that goes to the root of a person&#146;s dignity and
          independence. To hold otherwise would trivialize the liberty
          sought to be protected by s. 7.</pre>
    <pre>[52] The Supreme Court decision of Godbout v. Longueil (City),
[1997] 3 S.C.R. 844 was referred to this court as well.  The case
involved a resolution by the City of Longueil requiring all
permanent employees of the City to live in Longueil.  Ms.
Godbout, a permanent employee, moved to a neighbouring
municipality and was discharged.  She sued for wrongful dismissal
maintaining that her right to privacy under s.5 of the Quebec
Charter and her rights under s.7 of the Charter had been
violated. In upholding her claim, the Supreme Court was unanimous
in agreeing that her right to privacy under the Quebec Charter
had been violated and three members of the court agreed that
there was also a violation of her s.7 rights under the Charter.
The reasoning was that s.7 was an interference with her right to
make an inherently private choice of her residence free from
state interference.  It was suggested in this court that the
decision could also be supported by invoking the mobility rights
provision in s. 6 of the Charter.
[53] I hardly think that losing for 90 days the privilege or
license to drive a motor vehicle is in the same category as
suffering the state to dictate one&#146;s place of residence. The
suggestion does trivialize the Charter, which is intended to
protect fundamental liberties, not to insulate the citizen from
inconvenience, no matter how great that inconvenience may be in
the individual case.  As La Forest J. put it in expressing the
minority view with respect to s.7 in Godbout, supra, at p.893:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Moreover, I do not even consider that the sphere of autonomy
          includes within its scope every matter that might, however
          vaguely, be described as &#147;private&#148;.  Rather, as I see it, the
          autonomy protected by the s.7 right to liberty encompasses only
          those matters that can properly be characterized as fundamentally
          or inherently personal such that, by their very nature, they
          implicate basic choices going to the core of what it means to
          enjoy individual dignity and independence . . . . In my view,
          choosing where to establish one&#146;s home is, likewise, a
          quintessentially private decision going to the very heart of
          personal or individual autonomy.</pre>
    <pre>[54] For the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that s.
48.3 of the HTA establishing the ADLS Program does not interfere
with a liberty protected by s.7 of the Charter.
[55] I think the reasoning set out above also disposes of the
alternative argument advanced by the intervenor Criminal Lawyers'
Association that even if a licence suspension under s. 48.3 of
the HTA does not per se represent an interference with a liberty
interest protected by s. 7 of the Charter, by penalizing driving
in violation of such suspensions with the threat of imprisonment,
the legislature has created a liberty interest is created, whose
impairment must live up to the rules of fundamental justice. We
are dealing here with the power to suspend a license. The offence
of driving without a licence contrary to s.53 of the HTA is not
restricted to the 90 day suspension that this appeal is
considering.  It involves all driving suspensions for whatever
reason. To suggest that any person who is operating an automobile
without a license or while his or her license is suspended can
raise a Charter argument that he should not be required to have a
license or that the license he did acquire was unconstitutionally
suspended is simply arguing in circles. There is, I repeat, no
constitutional right to acquire or preserve a license to drive a
car.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Issue 3   Does the administration of the license suspension
               provisions of the ADLS Program offend the
               principles of natural justice?</pre>
    <pre>[56] This issue was argued by the Registrar but was not seriously
contested by the intervenor.  It has no application to the
constitutional challenges.  Having found that the province has
plenary powers to enact the impugned legislation, there is no
issue that it has the power to proceed to an administrative
suspension of a driver&#146;s licence without a hearing or a full
right of appeal.  A brief reference to authority makes that
clear.</pre>
    <pre>[57] The principles of natural justice were recognised by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Cardinal and Oswald v. Kent
Institution (Director), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643 at 653:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This Court has affirmed that there is, as a general common
          law principle, a duty of procedural fairness lying on every
          public authority making an administrative decision which is not
          of a legislative nature and which affects the rights, privileges
          or interests of an individual&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[58] The common law duty of fairness may be modified or abrogated
by statute.  As stated by Estey J. in Inuit Tapirisat of Canada
and National Antipoverty Organization of Canada v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735 at 755:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While it is true that a duty to observe procedural fairness,
          as expressed in the maxim 'audi alteram partem', need not be
          express &#133; it will not be implied in every case.  It is always a
          question of construing the statutory scheme as a whole in order
          to see to what degree, if any, the legislator intended the
          principle to apply.</pre>
    <pre>[59] The Supreme Court of Canada has also established that the
intent to modify or abrogate the rules of natural justice must be
revealed by clear statutory language.  As stated by L'Heureux-
Dubé J. in Knight v. Board of Education of Indian Head School
Division No. 19, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 653 at 677-678:
          </pre>
    <pre>               However, as was pointed out by Dickson J. in Kane v. Board
          of Governors of the University of British Columbia &#133;&quot;To abrogate
          the rules of natural justice, express language or necessary
          implication must be found in the statutory instrument.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[60] The legislative scheme that the respondent Horsefield
challenges does not provide for a pre-suspension hearing.  That
such a hearing is not contemplated was implicit in the
legislation considered by Stong J., but has since been made
explicit by the 1997 amendment to s. 48.3 of the HTA, which for
convenience I will repeat:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2.1)     A person has no right to be heard before or after
          the notification by the officer, or before or after the Registrar
          suspends the licence, but this subsection does not affect the
          taking of any proceeding in court.</pre>
    <pre>[61] Section 50.1 of the HTA provides a right to appeal the
suspension decision to the Licence Suspension Appeal Board.
However, a suspension order will be rescinded only on the grounds
of mistaken identity or by showing that a medical reason existed
for refusing to provide a breath sample. The Registrar is not
required to consider relevant statements or information in
deciding whether to affirm or rescind the suspension.
[62]   In contrast, the review proceedings in the Manitoba, Nova
Scotia, P.E.I. and British Columbia ADLS programs require that
relevant information be considered by the Registrar.  As well,
the Manitoba, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. legislation requires the
Registrar to consider whether the driver had an over 80 blood-
alcohol level or whether the driver in fact failed to comply with
a demand for breath or blood samples.  The B.C. legislation, in
addition to directing the Registrar to consider these issues,
adds that a ground for revoking the suspension is if the driver
had a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply with a
breath demand.
[63] Although the legislation of other provinces provides greater
review rights than does the Ontario ADLS Program, there is no
legal requirement that constitutionally valid legislation provide
for any right of appeal from an administrative act.  Accordingly,
the sufficiency of the right of review in the ADLS Program is a
matter for the legislature.
[64] It is also noted that the British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island programs, unlike the Ontario
program, provide for the issuance of a temporary licence after
the brief roadside suspension expires. This temporary licence
allows the motorist to make alternative transportation
arrangements and to seek review by the Registrar of the
suspension. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia. and P.E.I., the temporary
licence is valid for seven days;  in B.C. it is valid for 21
days.
[65]  I mention these distinctions only to indicate that I am
aware of them. The absence of a more elaborate procedural
safeguards does not impact on the fundamental principle that  the
legislature has the right to override common law administrative
law principles relating to natural justice.  Accordingly, the
ADLS Program is immune from attack on this ground as well.

      Issue 4   How should the costs of the application and
the appeal be awarded?

[66] The applications judge awarded solicitor and client costs to
Horsefield following his success in challenging the ADLS Program.
The Registrar appeals this award as to costs and suggests that
party and party costs would have sufficed.  The Registrar also
submits that if it is successful on this appeal, all of the
parties to the appeal should bear their own costs.
[67] Horsefield was never convicted of an offence under the
Criminal Code.   Since his license suspension has long expired,
he has no personal interest in these proceedings except to
preserve his award of costs.  The two intervenors were thus of
great assistance in ensuring that all the issues relating to the
constitutionality of the ADLS Program were fully explored.
[68] I am well aware that the Registrar had no choice but to
appeal the judgment of Stong J., but he had to be aware that an
attack on the constitutionality of the legislative scheme was
inevitable. Horsefield, a private citizen of modest means who
found himself caught up in the ADLS Program, was entitled to
challenge the scheme.  His arguments were obviously not frivolous
because they were successful in the first instance. Horsefield,
through his counsel, appeared before me on the stay application.
His simple request was that the Registrar exclude the cost order
from the stay application but the Registrar declined to do so.
No intervenors appeared at that time and accordingly the only
effective opposition to the motion came from Horsefield&#146;s
counsel, Mr. MacLean.  His submissions were most helpful and the
fact that the matter was fully argued made me more comfortable in
making my decision to grant the stay.
[69] I think that Horsefield should receive his costs on a
solicitor and client basis throughout.
[70] Similarly, I think the court and the administration of
justice were well served by the two intervenors who presented
arguments on both sides of this important constitutional case.  I
think that both should receive costs on a solicitor and client
basis for this appeal and for any participation in the
preparation of or cross-examination upon any affidavits that were
prepared for the purposes of this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[71] I note in passing that there was a motion by the appellant
to admit fresh evidence that made current the experience of law
enforcement agencies in dealing with the new legislation.  It was
not necessary for my determination of this case and consequently
I have not relied upon it.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[72] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of Stong J.
is set aside, except for the order as to the costs awarded to
Horsefield. In its place an order is to go declaring that s. 48.3
of the HTA is intra vires the province under s. 92 of the
Constitution Act, 1867 and that it is not in violation of s. 7 of
the Charter.  Notwithstanding the outcome, Horsefield and the two
intervenors are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a
solicitor and client basis.
