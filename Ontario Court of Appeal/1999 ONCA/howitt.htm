    <pre>WEILER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants are a group of former employees of Howden
Group, the respondent Company. The parties are engaged in a
dispute over entitlement to the surplus funds in a pension plan
[&#147;the Plan&#148;]. Howden established the Plan in 1958 and, after
several amendments, the Plan was finally wound up in 1995 when
the plant closed. During this time, the Plan accumulated a
surplus, or an excess of assets over the pension liabilities, of
$3.8 million.

[2]  Under the Pension Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8, s. 78,
no money may be paid out of a pension fund to an employer without
the prior consent of the Ontario Pension Commission. The
legislation, however, provides little or no guidance on how to
resolve the issue of entitlement to a pension surplus. As a
result, pension commissions and courts have had to resolve the
issue on a case by case basis by an analysis of the pension plan
in question, the funding structures under the plan, and by the
application of contract or trust principles.

[3]  In this case, upon the winding-up of the Plan, the Company
applied to the Ontario Pension Commission for consent to
distribute the surplus funds, with 70% to be paid to the
Company&#146;s account and the remaining 30% to the employees. The
Commission granted consent to the Company &#145;s proposed
distribution on the basis that the surplus funds were not
impressed with a trust in favour of the employees. The result was
upheld on appeal to the Divisional Court, Campbell J. dissenting,
reported at (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 185. The appellants obtained
leave to appeal to this Court on December 2nd, 1997.

[4]  From the appellants&#146; perspective, the money put into the
Plan was placed in trust for the employees and all of the surplus
funds belong to the employees. They argue that, if there has been
some express or implied declaration of trust and an alienation of
trust property for the benefit of the employees, then the pension
will be a trust. In other words, if the Company has irrevocably
disposed of its property by contributing it to the Plan, the
Company cannot take it back. From the Company&#146;s perspective, the
money was put into the Plan pursuant to a contract to pay fixed
pension benefits to employees according to predetermined
formulas. Once the pension benefits have been provided for, the
Company submits that the surplus should be distributed roughly in
proportion to the employer&#146;s and &#150;employees&#146; contributions to the
fund, that is, 70% is to be distributed to the company and 30% to
the employees.

[5]  At the time of the Plan&#146;s termination, Section 14.05 of the
Plan provided that if there should remain a surplus in the
pension fund after the satisfaction of all liabilities, such
surplus would revert to the Company or be used as the Company
might direct.  This provision did not appear in the original
version of the Plan, but was added by amendment in 1973.

[6]  The appellants submit that the original 1958 plan created an
irrevocable trust over all funds in it for the employees. If so,
then the 1973 amendment to the plan which provided that any
surplus, after payment of all liabilities &#147;shall revert to the
Company or be used as the Company may direct&#148; would be invalid.

[7]  For a trust to come into existence, the appellants must
adduce evidence demonstrating that the Company intended to create
a trust. For the reasons that follow I would dismiss the appeal
on the basis that when the plan was originally created in 1958
there was no intention by the Company to create a trust and
therefore the money in the plan does not represent trust funds.
Applying contract principles I am in agreement with the
respondent that the Company&#146;s proposed distribution should be
allowed to proceed. Accordingly, I would uphold the decisions
below of the Pension Commission and the Divisional Court.</pre>
    <pre>Was there an Intention to Create A Trust?</pre>
    <pre>[8]  A pension trust may be created by express or implied
declaration of trust. Whether or not a pension trust is created
is determined by the application of the ordinary principles of
trust law: Schmidt v. Air Products of Canada Ltd. (1994), 4
C.C.E.L. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.), Cory J. for the majority at 24. Trust
law requires that three &#147;certainties&#148; exist before a trust will
be found. There must be certainty of intention to create a trust,
certainty of subject matter in the sense that the subject matter
of the trust is ascertained or ascertainable, and certainty as to
the objects of the trust, namely the beneficiaries. As both the
subject and objects are readily ascertainable, the issue in this
case is whether the Company intended to create a trust when it
set up the pension plan. In order to answer this question I will
consider the funding structure of the plan, the original
insurance contract, and the history and relevant provisions of
the pension plan, as well as the amendments thereto. An
abbreviated version of the text of these provisions is attached
as an Appendix to these reasons.

[9]  The Company established the Plan on May 1, 1958, as a
contributory defined benefit plan. Contributions of the
employees, referred to as Members, and of the Company were paid
into a Deposit Fund established under the terms of a Deposit
Administration contract with Standard Life Assurance Company.

[10] In Schmidt, supra, Cory J. made it clear at p. 29 that where
the funding mechanism underlying the plan is a trust, trust law
is the dominant set of legal principles to be applied. If a trust
is created it will, in most cases, extend to the surplus created
as well as to the funds actually needed to provide the defined
benefits. Here, the vehicle used to fund the pension plan was a
contract and not a trust. Funding by way of a contract is not,
however, necessarily inconsistent with the intention to create a
pension trust: La Have Equipment Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Supt. Of
Pensions) (1994), 7 C.C.E.L. (2d) 245 (N.S.C.A.) at 255; Bull
Moose Tube Ltd. v. Ontario (Supt. Of Pensions)   (1994), 3
C.C.P.B. 187 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).  La Have, supra, is
distinguishable on the basis that although the funding was by
contract there was an express declaration by the employer that
the policy itself would be held in trust for the benefit of the
employees.  Bull Moose, supra, is similarly distinguishable. As
in La Have, the pension policy expressly provided that the
employer held the policy in trust for the Members. Moreover, the
original pension policy in Bull Moose stated that the company was
not to have any beneficial interest in &#147;the pensions and other
benefits&#148; except pursuant to any express provision to that effect
contained in the policy. The policy contained no express
provision giving the Company any interest in the funds. Yates J.
held that the words &#147;other benefits&#148; were distinct from pension
benefits and referred to surplus. In both cases the intention of
the parties as expressed in the policy was clearly that the
monies administered under the policy were to be held in trust. No
such similar wording exists here.

[11] Standard Life Policy 10554, which became effective May 1,
1958, was the initial Deposit Administration Contract entered
into pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Paragraph 9 of Policy
10554 provided that the policy was to be discontinued if the
Company purchased pensions for Employees from another insurance
company. In that event Standard Life was to hold the Deposit
Fund, in trust, either for the continued purchase of pensions for
Employees or until the money was transferred to the new insurance
company. Standard Life remained as the funding agent until the
winding-up of the Plan and its services were never terminated.
The event that would have given rise to a trust, that is, the
purchase of a policy from another insurance company, did not take
place. The reference to a trust in the circumstances contemplated
is not evidence that the Company intended to create a trust.

[12] Another provision in Policy 10554 is indicative of an
intention not to create a trust. That provision states that any
amounts payable out of the funds administered under the Policy,
other than pension and death benefits, were to be paid to the
Company, not the employees. This is exactly the opposite of what
was to occur under the policies in La Have, supra, and Bull
Moose, supra. The words used in the Policy are not a plain
designation of surplus but they are relevant to the question of
intent.

[13] I now turn to the provisions of the 1958 Plan itself. Under
the heading &#147;Change, Suspension or Discontinuance of Plan&#148;, the
Company reserved the right in its discretion to &#147;change, modify,
suspend or discontinue the Plan or to reduce its contributions.&#148;
If the Company intended to create a trust, the general power to
change or modify the Plan would not allow the company to revoke
the trust because such a power cannot be inferred from the
general unlimited power of amendment; Schmidt, supra, at 36. To
the extent that the majority decision of the Divisional Court
relies on the general power of amendment to uphold the 1973
amendment to the Plan allocating the surplus to the Company, the
Divisional Court erred. (The wording of the 1958 Plan did,
however, specifically provide under Section XVIII that the
Company could discontinue the Plan. At the time the Policy was
amended in 1973 to provide that any surplus belonged to the
Company there was no surplus in existence. Had the Company chosen
to discontinue the 1958 Plan and to establish a new Plan
containing the provision that any surplus belonged to the Company
this dispute might not have arisen.)

[14] The appellants submit that the requirement of an express or
implied declaration of trust is satisfied by the following
provision, found in Section XVIII of the 1958 Plan, which is an
exception to the power to, &#147;change modify, suspend or discontinue
the Plan&#148;:
               [&#133;]
          </pre>
    <pre>               However, all contributions made by the
          Company are irrevocable and together with all
          contributions made by the Members may only be
          used conclusively (sic) for the benefit of
          Members, retired Members, former Members and
          the designated beneficiaries and estates of
          Members, retired Members and former Members,
          no change or modification will affect any
          rights which a Member, retired Member or
          former Member may then have with respect to
          the terms of payment of, or the amount of,
          retirement income to which the Member shall
          have become entitled by reason of his service
          with the Company up to the effective date of
          such change or modification.
               If it ever should be necessary to
          discontinue the Plan, contributions made by
          the Company shall remain in the Deposit Fund
          which shall be distributed among the Members,
          retired Members, former Members and their
          respective designated beneficiaries as the
          case may be, in an equitable manner
          determined by the Company in consultation
          with the Actuary&#133;. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellants submit that, while there was no express
provision in the Plan respecting the distribution of any surplus
pension funds, these exclusive benefit and distribution clauses
establish a clear intention to create a trust. Campbell J., in
his dissenting reasons in the Divisional Court, accepted this
submission. Before dealing with this submission, however, it is
important to further consider the decision of Cory J. in Schmidt,
supra.

[16] In Schmidt, supra, Cory J. reviewed two pension plans, one
established by Catalytic Enterprises Ltd. and the other by
Stearns-Rogers Canada Ltd. These companies merged to create Air
Products Ltd. When Air Products sold most of its assets, the
pension plan resulting from the merger was terminated and a
dispute arose with respect to the surplus. Cory J. held that the
original Catalytic plan created a trust over the surplus in favor
of the employees but that the Stearns plan did not. As in the
present case, the Stearns plan made no mention of any trust,
trust fund or trustee in the originating documents. Rather, as in
the present case, the Stearns fund was not created pursuant to a
trust agreement but pursuant to a contract: Schmidt, supra, at
44. The Stearns plan reserved to the employer the discretion to
deal with surplus funds. Here, the original plan was silent as to
surplus but the original Policy reserved to the employer that
discretion. The Stearns plan did have wording stating:

               13.2 No part of the Fund shall be used for or diverted to
          purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and
          their beneficiaries&#133;
                                  &#133;
               14.1&#133;
                                  &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  No amendment shall have the effect
          of diverting any part of the Fund to purposes
          other than for the exclusive benefit of the
          Participants.</pre>
    <pre>[17] This wording is similar in intent to the wording of the
present case. Cory J. had this to say about it at p. 44:

               It is true that the alleged subject matter of the trust, the
          pension fund, was defined under the two Stearns plans, and that
          the employees were identified as those entitled to receive the
          fund monies. Furthermore, the exclusive benefit and non-diversion
          clauses relied upon by the employees above are consistent with
          the existence of a trust. Nonetheless, I am not convinced that a
          trust was ever created. Certain phrases, such as the exclusive
          benefit and non-diversion clauses identified above, are commonly
          found in plans which do create pension trusts. They may point to
          the existence of a trust but of themselves they cannot be taken
          as demonstrating an intention by the employer to create a trust.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[18] Similarly, although the exclusive benefit and distribution
clauses on which the appellants rely in this case are consistent
with the existence of a trust, these clauses cannot, of
themselves, satisfy the evidentiary requirement that the employer
intended to create a trust.

[19] Where, as here, the pension plan is a contributory plan, the
intention of the employees, as well as those of the employer,
must be considered: Schmidt, supra, at 36. In Schmidt, the
Stearns pension plan, although a non-contributory plan at the
time of its termination, began as a contributory plan and the
pension brochure provided to Stearns&#146; employees contained the
following statement:
               &#133; In  the event that there is a surplus in the fund after
          all benefits have been paid it is the Company&#146;s intention that
          the surplus be distributed in an equitable manner to the
          employees active in the plan at the date of termination.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[20] Cory J. acknowledged at p. 45 that the brochure might form
part of the &#147;legal matrix&#148; used to determine the rights of the
employees. There was, however, no evidence as to the effect that
this brochure had on the employees of the company. There was no
indication that Mr. Schmidt, the appellant former employee, had
been induced to join the company on the basis of the terms of the
brochure. Nor was there any evidence that either the employees or
their union had relied upon the brochure in such a way as to
affect their position during collective bargaining sessions.
Having regard to these circumstances, Cory J. held that the
statement did not amount to a promise that was intended to affect
the legal relationship between the parties: Schmidt, supra, at 46-
47. Accordingly, it could not form the basis for an estoppel, as
there was no evidence of inducement or reliance upon it by the
appellant employees.

[21] The situation in Schmidt, supra, may be contrasted with the
situation in Bathgate v. National Hockey League Pension Society
(1992), 44 C.C.E.L. 1 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.), affirmed and varied
on other grounds (1994), 16 O.R. (3d) 761 (C.A.). , In that case
Adams J. found that very similar language to the language at
issue in this case led to a belief amongst the hockey players
that the fund would belong to them. As a result he held that
while there was no formal trust agreement, there was clear
evidence of intent to create a trust. The evidence of the
employee hockey players that, during negotiations with the clubs,
representations had been made to them that all of the money in
the plan was to belong to them was of valuable assistance to
Adams J. in his determination that a trust had been created. He
stated at p. 65:
               In summary, both the language of the regulations and the
          cumulative effect of all the intrinsic evidence clearly establish
          an exclusive and irrevocable entitlement in the players to all
          &#147;excess&#148; funds in the original plan regardless of source. I have
          come to this conclusion essentially by reference to the &#147;plain
          meaning&#148; of the regulations and, alternatively, through a
          contactual (sic) analysis based on the various representations to
          the players. The players provided their services up to 1966 on
          the basis of their represented entitlement to all such moneys,
          with the contractual result that this entitlement was irrevocably
          earned upon the expenditure of their efforts. This latter
          conclusion is reinforced by the defined employer contributions
          which, in the circumstances, are reasonably characterized as
          deferred wages.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[22] In this case, however, as in Schmidt, there is no evidence
from the employees that representations were made by the Company
that all of the money in the plan would belong to the employees.
There is also no evidence that the employees relied on the
exclusive benefit and distribution clauses either at the time of
joining the Company or in bargaining with the Company respecting
wages. The pension benefits brochure in this case does not
contain any statement respecting the disposition of any surplus.
Accordingly, I do not think that the Company&#146;s plan was subject
to a trust at its inception.

[23] In 1965 the Plan was amended in a number of respects. The
only amendment germane to the issue before this Court was to
Section V, which was amended to read as follows:

               The Company will contribute from time to time, but not less
          frequently than annually, such amounts as are not less than those
          certified by the Actuary as necessary to provide the benefits
          accruing to Members during the current year pursuant to the Plan
          and to make provision for the proper amortization of any initial
          unfunded liability or experience deficiency, as defined in The
          Pension Benefits Act, 1962-63 of Ontario and regulations
          thereunder, after taking into account the assets of the Trust
          Fund, the contributions of Members during the year and such other
          facts as may be deemed relevant. [Emphasis added.]        
</pre>
    <pre>
[24] The appellants argue that this amendment is evidence of the
existence of a trust. I do not agree. The term &#147;Trust Fund&#148;
referred to in the 1965 amendment is not a defined term in the
Plan. With the sole exception of this reference, the term
&#147;Deposit Fund&#148; was used throughout the plan documents to identify
the fund held by Standard Life for the provision of Plan
benefits. It cannot be that the Company&#146;s intention to create a
trust was only perfected five years after the creation of the
fund. As was found by Cory J. in Schmidt, supra, at 44, there was
no significant change in circumstances between 1958 and 1965
which warrants a finding that a trust that did not exist at the
inception of the plan suddenly came into existence in 1965. The
isolated reference to the words &#147;Trust Fund&#148; when &#147;Deposit Fund&#148;
is used elsewhere supports this conclusion.

[25] In July 1967, a consolidated Plan text was published to
incorporate the amendments made to the Plan since 1958. In
November 1967, the Plan text was amended by the insertion of a
clause into Section XVII stating that contributions to the
pension fund were to be held, &#147;under the terms of the Deposit
Administration Contract between the Company and The Standard Life
Assurance Company and /or under an agreement between the Company
and a trustee which shall be a corporate trust company or
companies&#133;&#148;

[26] The references in the 1967 amendments are to different types
of funding arrangements which the Company, under the terms of the
Plan and the applicable legislation, was permitted to use for the
purposes of funding the Plan. In fact, the Company never chose to
fund the plan through a trust agreement but continued the Deposit
Fund established under the earlier plan documents and
administered under the Deposit Administration Contract with
Standard Life.

[27] I cannot construe these isolated references in the 1965 and
1967 amendments as constituting an intention to create a trust.
See also:  Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Supt. Of Pensions
(Alta.) (1992), 130 A.R. 360 (Q.B.).

[28] A trust was never created and therefore the distribution of
the surplus is to be determined in accordance with contract
principles.</pre>
    <pre>Contractual Provisions</pre>
    <pre>[29] In 1973 the Plan was amended so as to make provision, for
the first time, for payment of surplus to the Company or in
accordance with the Company&#146;s direction if the Plan was wound up.
The appellants submit that the Company must now direct the
surplus funds be paid to the employees on the basis of the
wording in the original Plan.

[30] The following wording contained in Section XVIII of the
original Plan documents is of particular importance:

   &#147;&#133; No change or modification will affect any rights which a
    Member&#133; may then have with respect to the terms of payment of, or
    amount of retirement income&#133;&#148;  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>In Schmidt, supra, the Stearns plan, in addition to the
exclusive benefit clause, also contained a clause which stated:

          No amendment shall have the effect of reducing any
          Participant&#146;s, former Participant&#146;s, beneficiary&#146;s, or 
	  estate&#146;s then existing interest in the Fund. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[31] Cory J. held at p. 48 that the amendment to the Stearns plan
which provided that surplus funds belonged to the employer did
not violate the provisions of the original plan because at the
time the amendment was enacted it did not reduce any &#147;then
existing&#148; interest of the employees. He further held that the
amendment was not inconsistent with the non-diversion and
exclusive benefit clauses.

[32] It is equally true that in this case the amendment did not
affect any rights, which a member may then have had. Until 1973,
there was no surplus in existence and hence the employees could
have had no interest in something which did not exist. The
prohibition on diversion of funds and the distribution clauses
applied only in respect of the defined benefits to which the
employees were contractually entitled. They did not apply to the
distribution of a plan surplus. The amendment did not reduce any
interest the employees may then have had in the Plan. The 1973
amendment was, therefore, a valid amendment. On the basis of
contract principles the proposed distribution of surplus should
be allowed to proceed.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[33] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

    <pre>     The Company shall provide for the administration of the
     Plan. The Company shall conclusively determine all
     questions arising in the administration, interpretation
     or application of the Plan, consistently, however, with
     the terms of the Plan, and with the provisions of the
     Deposit Administration Contract. The Company shall pay
     all costs, charges and expenses incurred in
     establishing and administering the Plan, including the
     cost of all actuarial valuations.</pre>
    <pre>As well, Sections XIII and XVII of the original Plan make similar
reference to the Deposit Administration Contract:</pre>
    <pre>     Section XIII &#150; Deposit Fund
     </pre>
    <pre>     All contributions of the Members and the Company will
     be paid into a Deposit Fund established under the terms
     of the Deposit Administration Contract between the
     Company and the Standard Life Assurance Company.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Section XVII &#150; Funding
     </pre>
    <pre>     For purposes of providing benefits herein provided,
     there will be established a Deposit Fund to be held by
     the Standard Life Assurance Company under the terms of
     the Deposit Administration Contract between the Company
     and the Standard Life Assurance Company. [&#133;]
     </pre>
    <pre>The Company&#146;s power to amend the Plan was set out in Section
XVIII thereof:</pre>
    <pre>     Section XVIII &#150; Change, Suspension or Discontinuance of
     Plan
     </pre>
    <pre>     [&#133;] The Company reserves the right in its discretion to
     change, modify, suspend or discontinue the Plan or to
     reduce its contributions.
     </pre>
    <pre>     However, all contributions made by the Company are
     irrevocable and together with all contributions made by
     the Members may only be used conclusively for the
     benefit of Members, retired Members, former members and
     the designated beneficiaries and estates of Members,
     retired Members and former Members, no change or
     modification will affect any rights which a Member,
     retired member or former Member may then have with
     respect to the terms of payment of, or the amount of
     retirement income to which the Member shall have become
     entitled by reason of his service with the Company up
     to the effective date of such change or modification&#133;
     
</pre>
    <pre>Standard Life Policy 10554, which first became effective May 1,
1958, was the initial Deposit Administration Contract entered
into pursuant to the terms of the Plan. At paragraph 13 of their
factum, the appellants make reference to paragraph 9 of Standard
Life Policy 10554 as relevant to determining an intention by the
original employer to create a trust. The excerpt contained in the
appellants&#146; factum is incomplete and fails to include the
complete text of paragraph 9(b), which is important in addressing
its meaning. Paragraph 9(b) reads, in full:</pre>
    <pre>     9.   Discontinuance</pre>
    <pre>          [&#133;]
          </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  This policy shall also be discontinued if the
     Person Assured shall, under the pension plans stated in
     the Schedule, purchase pensions for Employees from
     another Insurance Company, or deposit money with
     trustees for the payment of such pensions to Employees,
     without first obtaining the agreement of the Company to
     such an act; or if the Person Assured shall notify the
     Company of its desire to discontinue making further
     deposits hereunder. In any of such events, no further
     deposit shall be made into the Deposit Fund and the
     Company [Standard Life] will hold the Deposit Fund, in
     trust, either for the continued purchase of pensions
     for Employees in respect of whom deposits have been
     made or until the Person Assured requests the
     withdrawal of money from the Fund for transfer to
     another Insurance Company or to trustees. Such a
     transfer shall only be made if it has the approval of
     the Taxation Division of the Department of National
     Revenue, and subject to a deduction of not more than 5
     % of the amount to be transferred. If the amount to be
     transferred is more than one-third of the Deposit Fund
     at that time, the Company shall have the right to make
     payment in equal annual instalments over a period not
     exceeding ten years. Payment of the amount withdrawn
     from the Deposit Fund less the said percentage
     deduction shall be deemed to discharge fully the
     liability of the Company for the amount withdrawn.
          </pre>
    <pre>Standard Life Policy 10554 also contained the following provision
stating that any amounts payable out of the funds administered
under that policy, other than pension and death benefits, were to
be paid to the Company, not to the employees:</pre>
    <pre>     To whom any payments by the Company [Standard Life],
     other than pensions and death benefits, are payable:
     The Person Assured [Howden] or the assigns of the
     Person Assured in trust, or to such other person as may
     be designated by the Person Assured.
     

</pre>
    <pre>In 1965, the Plan was amended in a number of respects. At
paragraph 14 of the appellants&#146; factum, they make reference to an
amendment to subparagraph (b) of Section V, &#147;Company&#146;s
Contribution&#148; as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     The Company will contribute from time to time, but not
     less frequently than annually, such amounts as are not
     less than those certified by the Actuary as necessary
     to provide the benefits accruing to Members during the
     current year pursuant to the Plan and to make provision
     for the proper amortization of any initial unfunded
     liability or experience deficiency, as defined in The
     Pension Benefits Act, 1962-63 of Ontario and
     regulations thereunder, after taking into account the
     assets of the Trust Fund, the contributions of Members
     during the year and such other facts as may be deemed
     relevant.</pre>
    <pre>By way of illustration, subparagraph (c) of Section V, &#147;Members&#146;
Additional Voluntary Contributions&#148; states, in part:</pre>
    <pre>     All additional voluntary contributions will be placed
     to the Member&#146;s credit and will accumulate until
     retirement at an interest rate approximating to that
     earned by the Deposit Fund as determined by the Company
     in consultation with the Actuary.
     
</pre>
    <pre>As well, Sections XIII, &#147;Deposit Fund&#148;, and Section XVII,
&#147;Funding&#148;, state:</pre>
    <pre>     Section XIII -  Deposit Fund
     </pre>
    <pre>     All contributions of the Members and the Company will
     be paid into a Deposit Fund established under the terms
     of the Deposit Administration Contract between the
     Company and the Standard Life Assurance Company.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Section XVII - Funding
     </pre>
    <pre>     For purposes of providing benefits herein provided,
     there will be established a Deposit Fund to be held by
     the Standard Life Assurance Company under the terms of
     the Deposit Administration Contract between the Company
     and the Standard Life Assurance Company&#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>In November 1967, the Plan text was amended to insert, inter
alia, the following provisions:</pre>
    <pre>     XIII - Pension Fund
     </pre>
    <pre>     All contributions of the Members and the Company will
     be paid into a Pension Fund to be held under the terms
     of the Deposit Administration Contract between the
     Company and the Standard Life Assurance Company and /
     or under a deed of trust with a corporate trust company
     or companies, as selected by the Company.
     </pre>
    <pre>     [&#133;]
     </pre>
    <pre>     XVI &#150; Funding
     </pre>
    <pre>     For purposes of providing benefits herein provided,
     there will be established a Pension Fund to be held by
     the Standard Life Assurance Company under the terms of
     a Deposit Administration Contract between the Company
     and the Standard Life Assurance Company and / or a
     trust agreement between the Company and a trustee which
     shall be a corporate trust company or companies as
     selected by the Company. [&#133;]
     
</pre>
    <pre>Effective January 1, 1973, the respondent amended the Plan, so as
to make provision for the first time, for payment of surplus to
the respondent in the event of wind-up of the Plan, by the
inclusion of the following provision in new Section 15, which
replaced former Section XVIII:</pre>
    <pre>     15.05  If after the satisfaction of all liabilities of the
            Plan pursuant to Section 15.03 or 15.04 above, there should
            remain a surplus in the Pension Fund, such surplus shall 
	    revert to the Company or be used as the Company may direct.
</pre>
    <pre>Standard Life Policy 10554 was the original Deposit
Administration Contract entered into in 1958 to fund the pension
obligations under the Plan. As an administrative matter, that
policy was replaced with Standard Life Group Policy 11442, which
became effective January 1, 1973, and which remains in effect as
the funding document for the Plan. Paragraph 5 of the current
policy also provides for the Company&#146;s entitlement to any
surplus:</pre>
    <pre>     [&#133;]</pre>
    <pre>     If the Plan is to be discontinued, the Person Assured
     may instruct the Company [Standard Life] to redeem all
     the Credited Units in accordance with section (c) of
     Condition 2 and to apply the total amount realized
     after deduction of any expense charges to purchase paid-
     up pensions for all Participants at that time. If the
     realized amount is in excess of the amount required to
     provide all the benefits to be provided under the Plan,
     the Company will dispose of such excess according to
     written directions from the Person Assured.
