</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice McGarry on March 11,
1998 and from the sentence imposed on May 8, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of assault  and  sentenced  to
sixty days' imprisonment to be served intermittently.  He appeals
his conviction on the basis that the verdict is unreasonable.
[2]  The appellant, a bailiff, was alleged to have assaulted the
complainant, a young offender who was being transported with
other young offenders from a youth centre to a detention centre
because they had been rioting.
[3]  Numerous witnesses were called by the prosecution and the
defence including young offenders, bailiffs, corrections and
police officers, and nurses.  There was conflicting evidence and
evidence inconsistent with earlier statements.  The credibility
of witnesses was an issue.  Certain witnesses had extensive
criminal records and other witnesses were alleged to be subject
to a code of silence.
[4]  During the trip to the detention centre, the van
transporting the young offenders and their guards stopped at a
gas bar.  It was during this stop that the complainant alleged
that he had been assaulted.  There was no question that one young
offender had been removed from the locked cage of the van to have
his restraining devices changed because they were too tight.  An
important issue was whether a second young offender had been
removed from the cage, namely the complainant who alleged that it
was at that point that he had been assaulted.
[5]  The complainant, two young offenders and a corrections
officer testified that two young offenders had been removed from
the cage.  The appellant himself in a statement to the police and
at trial testified that a second youth was outside the van during
the stop.  The appellant, who had the key to the locked cage,
denied that he applied any force to that person.  At trial,
defence counsel agreed that it was open to the trial judge to
make the finding that two young offenders had been removed from
the cage.
[6]  The reasons of the trial judge reflect no misapprehension of
evidence.  His finding that two young offenders were removed from
the van, one being the complainant who was removed for
disciplinary purposes, is supported by the evidence.  His further
conclusion that the appellant assaulted the young offender by
kicking him is entirely reasonable.  This was a case of
credibility.  The trial judge disbelieved the appellant and he
was satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
verdict is one that a jury properly instructed could have
rendered.
[7]  With respect to sentence, the trial judge declined to impose
a conditional sentence.  The reasons of the trial judge reflect
no error in principle and the sentence imposed was fit.
[8]  The appeal is dismissed.
