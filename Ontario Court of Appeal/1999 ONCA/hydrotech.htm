    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"><b>McKINLAY J.A.:</b>

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [1] This is an appeal of a declaratory order of The Honourable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Justice Spence dated October 8, 1997.  The matter was argued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">by way of motion based on an agreed statement of fact.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [2] The trial judge succinctly explains the background and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nature of the issue before him and before us as follows:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         The issue in this case arises
          in the following way. By a transfer of the
          trademark in 1991 from Lawrason’s to Min-
          Chem, Min-Chem acquired the trademark. Min-
          Chem therefore ceased to hold the security
          interest in the trademark which it had
          earlier held under a General Security
          Agreement. Counsel accepted that this
          consequence flowed from the transfer. The
          issue in the case arises from the transfer in
          1991 having been followed, some time after
          1994, by the order of this court which
          rendered that transfer void.

                         The issue is as follows. By
          reason of the transfer of the trademark to
          Min-Chem having been rendered void, may Min-
          Chem assert that the general security
          interest which it formerly held in the
          trademark has in effect been revived so that
          it takes priority over any recovery by the s.
          38 Creditors in respect of the sale of the
          trademark at public auction? Or, on the
          contrary, does the rendering void of the
          transfer of the trademark to Min-Chem simply
          leave it in the position it was in
          immediately beforehand, i.e. that it no
          longer holds security on the trademark
          because the security interest was terminated
          by virtue of Min-Chem’s acquisition of the
          trademark itself from Lawrason’s.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [3] The agreed statement of facts is quoted below:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Hydrotech Chemical Corporation
          (“Hydrotech”) carries on business as a
          manufacturer and supplier of chemicals. Min-
          Chem Canada Ltd. (“Min-Chem”) carries on
          business as a distributor of chemicals and
          related products. Lawrason’s Chemicals Ltd.
          (“Lawrason’s”) was an Ontario company which
          also carried on business as a distributor of
          chemicals and related products. It is
          bankrupt.
                    Between 1988 and 1991, Min-Chem
          loaned in total the sum of approximately
          (CDN.) $1.4 million to Lawrason’s. All of
          these loan advances were secured by way of a
          General Security Agreement duly registered
          under the Personal Property Security Act
          against all of Lawrason’s assets. The
          security held by Min-Chem in Lawrason’s
          included all trademarks. Lawrason’s owned the
          trademark “Aquabrome”. “Aquabrome” was a
          trademark used with respect to Lawrason’s
          bromine products for swimming pools.
                    On the 18th day of January, 1991,
          Lawrason’s transferred the “Aquabrome”
          trademark to Min-Chem. The consideration was
          nominal (“$5.00 and other good and valuable
          consideration”).
                    On December 18, 1991, a Petition in
          Bankruptcy relating to Lawrason’s was filed
          by Hydrotech. Subsequently, a Receiving Order
          was made and as such the effective date of
          the bankruptcy of Lawrason’s is December 18,
          1991. The remaining assets of Lawrason’s were
          sold by Min-Chem under its General Security
          Agreement at a public auction on February 8,
          1992.
                    Min-Chem takes the position that it
          is still owed substantial funds by
          Lawrason’s. Hydrotech takes the position that
          Min-Chem is not owed any monies by
          Lawrason’s, but that there was an over-
          realization by Min-Chem.
                    On July 26, 1994, Hydrotech
          obtained an Order under Section 38 of the
          Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. It obtained an
          assignment of the rights that the trustee in
          Bankruptcy of Lawrason’s might have against
          Min-Chem to pursue Min-Chem:
                    (a)  for over-realization;
                    (b)  to claim an Order setting
          aside the transfer of the trademark
          “Aquabrome” to Min-Chem.
                    With respect to the Section 38
          action, the parties have consented, through
          counsel, to an Order finding the transfer of
          the trademark “Aquabrome” from Lawrason’s to
          Min-Chem on January 18, 1991 fraudulent and
          void as against the creditors of Lawrason’s,
          under Section 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances
          Act, R.S.O. 1990. The parties also agreed
          that the trademark should be sold at public
          auction. The Order was consented to without
          prejudice to the claims of both parties to
          the proceeds of the sale of the trademark.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [4] Section 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">F.29 reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               2.  Every conveyance of real property or
          personal property and every bond, suit,

          just and lawful actions, suits, debts,

          are void as against such persons and their
          assigns.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [5] The appellant takes the position that, although the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction was agreed by the parties to be fraudulent and void</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant to s. 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act, it is still a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">valid and subsisting transfer between the original parties to it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The motions judge held, to the contrary, that the transaction was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">void for all purposes and that, as a result, the position of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent as a secured creditor, which obtained before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transfer of the trademark, was revived as a result of the voiding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the transfer.  In coming to that conclusion, he followed the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of White J. in Bank of Montreal v. Bray (1993), 12 O.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3d) 545 (Gen. Div.).  That decision has since been reversed by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this court, as reported in (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 99.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [6] Bank of Montreal v. Bray was a case involving a transfer by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">a husband to his wife of his joint tenancy interest in real</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">property.  The bank held a guarantee from the husband for debts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of a company incorporated by him to the extent of $750,000.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bank brought an action pursuant to s. 2 of the Fraudulent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Conveyances Act to set aside the guarantor's transfer to his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">wife.  The husband died before the bank could obtain an execution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against him.  The action was defended on the basis, inter alia,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the status quo ante could not be revived (that is, that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">joint tenancy could not be reinstated because of the death of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">husband) and that, therefore, the conveyance to the wife could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not be set aside.  This court was of the view that the revival of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the joint tenancy was not necessary, since the transfer as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">between the husband and the wife had the effect of severing the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">joint tenancy, and the effect of the transfer as between them was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not altered by an order voiding the transaction as against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditors.  Rosenberg J.A., speaking for all of the court on this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">issue, stated at pages l06 and l07:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                         There is little ambiguity in
          s. 2 of the Act. Transactions made with
          intent to defraud creditors are void as
          against those creditors. There is nothing in
          s. 2 that renders the transaction void as
          against the parties to the transaction. This
          issue was settled by the Supreme Court of
          Canada in Donohoe v. Hull Bros. &amp; Co. (1895),
          24 S.C.R. 683.
                               . . . .
                     As between the parties to it, the
          transaction is valid and is only void as
          against the creditors. Accordingly, in my
          view,  the conveyance by Mr. Bray to his wife
          was valid as between them.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [7] The respondent argues that this case is different because</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the appellant proceeded under s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, taking an assignment of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rights of the trustee in bankruptcy.  It argues that the trustee</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could have sued to set aside the transfer, and the benefit</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">derived from the suit would have been for the benefit of all</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">creditors of the bankrupt.  A judgment in favour of the trustee,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondent says, would have the effect of reviving its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security interest.  It gives no authority for that proposition</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other than the decision of the motions judge in this case, and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the motions judge, as stated above, relied on the trial decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in Bank of Montreal v. Bray.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [8] If the trustee had sued and recovered pursuant to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions of s. 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act, he could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only have sued on behalf of those creditors whose interests were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">defeated, hindered, delayed or defrauded by the transfer of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">trademark.  However, because of the specific provisions of s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">38(3), the benefit derived from the action would belong to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">estate to be shared by all creditors, and not just those whose</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">interests were affected.  As between the parties to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">transaction, the transfer would be a good and valid one.  That</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">being the case, there could be no revival of the respondent's</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security interest in the trademark: it could not be the owner of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and a secured creditor in the same property.  Nonetheless, in my</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">opinion, it would be entitled to share in the estate as an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsecured creditor.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3"> [9] As a result, the appeal is allowed and the order of Spence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">J. is set aside with party and party costs here and below.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant is entitled to an order declaring that the respondent,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Min-Chem Canada Ltd., does not have a security interest in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds of the sale of the Aquabrome trademark.  Pursuant to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provisions of s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellant, Hydrotech Chemical Corporation, and any creditors who</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">joined in the action, are entitled to recover against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">proceeds of the sale of the trade-mark the total amount of their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claims in the bankruptcy of Lawrason's Chemicals Ltd. plus any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">costs of the motion and of this appeal not recovered from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondent.  If there is any shortfall, the appellant will rank</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the extent of the shortfall as an unsecured creditor in the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">bankruptcy estate.  The respondent is entitled to claim as an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">unsecured creditor for any amount of the indebtedness to it not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">recovered on realization of other assets over which it held or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">holds security.
