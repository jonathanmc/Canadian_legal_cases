    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Foster J. on February 25,
1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The only issue in this appeal is whether the maximum driving
prohibition was fit in the circumstances.
[2]  The trial judge, in careful reasons for judgment, has
obviously weighed the penalties that might be imposed: the
penalties of incarceration, probation and the driving
prohibition.  He chose to give the appellant the advantage of a
modest term of imprisonment and chose a lengthy period of
prohibition from driving as the meaningful deterrent aspect of
the sentence.
[3]  Turning then to the circumstances and to the authorities
that we have been referred to, we cannot say that the judge was
wrong in principle in imposing this sentence.
[4]  However, in our view, the period of suspension should be
reduced.  We think the reduction should be from ten years to
eight years to give the appellant credit for his voluntary
abstention from driving from the time of the offence until the
time of his trial.  We do not think that the sentence that was
imposed reflects that voluntary choice by the appellant and, in
fairness, it should do so.  To this extent, then, the appeal
succeeds and the driving suspension is reduced from ten years to
eight years.</pre>
