    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault in the Ontario
Court (General Division) before the Honourable Mr. Justice
McIsaac sitting with a jury.  He appeals conviction and sentence.
[2]  There are a number of grounds against conviction raised in
this appeal, but we find it necessary to deal with only one: the
correctness of the trial judge&#146;s instruction to the jury
respecting the effect of the complainant&#146;s purported dissociative
state on her ability to consent to sexual activity with the
appellant.  Because of the disposition that we propose, our
analysis of the evidence will be brief.
[3]  The complainant was a 28-year-old single mother with a 9-
year-old daughter.  At the time of the alleged offence she lived
with a man whom she had known for two years.  She met the
appellant at Durham College in Whitby where they were both taking
courses.  He had worked in a psychiatric hospital in some not
clearly defined role as a counsellor, and had some exposure to
incest survivors.  She was an incest survivor; her father had
sexually abused her when she was a child.  Since the appellant&#146;s
driver&#146;s license was under suspension, the complainant drove him
to and from the College.  Over a short period of time, they
became friends.
[4]  About one month after they met, the sexual activity that is
the subject of this charge took place in the appellant&#146;s
apartment.  The complainant&#146;s testimony is that she did not
consent to an act of intercourse with the appellant, but her
actions and statements relating to consent were equivocal and
were in conflict with the evidence of the appellant.  The
appellant testified that the closest she came to saying &#147;No&#148; was
&#147;J., we shouldn&#146;t do this&#148;.  He testified that she expressly
consented by nodding in agreement to his statement: &#147;Hey S.  In
this situation we are consenting, right?&#148;
[5]  The appellant further testified that after he commenced
having intercourse with the complainant, he noticed that she had
a flat expression on her face, &#147;a deep space look&#148;.  Her eyes
were open, her mouth was open a little and she was staring ahead
with a trance-like expression.  This frightened the appellant and
he got off the bed and squatted near her and asked her if she was
all right.  She said nothing in reply but moved towards him, one
leg on either side of him, until her vagina touched his penis.
At this point he thought to himself: &#147;well, we&#146;re in business
again&#148;.  He then proceeded to renew their act of intercourse.
[6]  However ambiguous the conduct of the complainant before and
during the act of intercourse, the same can not be said of her
acts and statements thereafter. She suddenly jumped off the bed,
quickly put on her clothes and started out the door of the
apartment.  She drove to Durham College and to the Access Office
where she saw a counsellor, Brenda McGowan.  She was upset,
crying and shaking.  Her clothes were rumpled and her hair
dishevelled.  She could not talk for some minutes.  Ms. McGowan
drove her to the Oshawa Hospital and from there she was sent to
the Sexual Assault Crisis Unit at the Whitby Hospital.  The
police were contacted and the complainant gave a full statement
to P.C. Lorimer detailing a sexual assault.
[7]  Dr. John V. Chiarot was qualified to give expert opinion
evidence generally with respect to psychology and specifically in
relation to the impact of incest.  He was presented with a
hypothetical situation that approximated the appellant&#146;s version
of the events of December 1, 1992 as indicated in brief outline
above.  He indicated that the glazed  look would lead him to
investigate the possibility of a dissociative state.  He
explained that flashbacks are not uncommon among incest victims
and they can be so overwhelming that the person can believe that
they are actually back at a time when they are being sexually
assaulted by their parent.  The experience can be so overpowering
that it can alter their perception of what is actually going on.
Dr. Chiarot was asked about the complainant&#146;s statement to P.C.
Lorimer that she had &#147;reverted back to a little girl&#148;.  He said
that it was not only consistent with a flashback, but it was also
consistent with a dissociative state where she emotionally is
back in time and she perceives herself being victimized by her
father.  Dr. Chiarot said that the complainant positioning her
legs on either side of the appellant could be consistent with a
dissociative state where the person acts as a compliant child,
obediently going along with her father.  Dissociative states can
vary in duration and he said that the complainant&#146;s sudden
departure and refusal to discuss what had happened would be
consistent with the actions of an incest survivor who wanted to
remove herself from the incestuous situation as soon as possible.
[8]  Under cross-examination, he agreed that the complainant&#146;s
statement to P.C. Lorimer, taken by itself, could simply mean
that while she was sexually assaulted by the appellant, she was
reminded of being sexually assaulted by her father.  However, if
one included the details about the glazed face and the way the
complainant positioned herself, his opinion was that the
statement most likely reflected a dissociative reaction.
[9]  In terms of the issue of consent, Dr. Chiarot commented that
there was an inconsistency between the laying of the sexual
assault charge and the behaviour described in the hypothetical,
i.e., the actions suggest that the complainant wanted the sexual
act to occur while the charge implies the contrary.  He suggested
a possible explanation for this contradiction in the following
terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               As a clinician I would look at that as being certainly
          consistent with the dissociative state, however. In terms of her
          perception, her emotional perception, of the - of the incident,
          she can indeed look at it in terms of &#150; in terms that are quite
          different from Mr. I. In other words, what he saw as you&#146;ve
          described it &#133; implies consent to Mr. I. &#133; that it was a
          consensual act. From the victim&#146;s point of view, if she&#146;s saying
          that it was not consensual, then I have no reason to doubt that
          she &#150; that she does indeed perceive it in that manner, but if
          she&#146;s having a dissociative reaction &#133; the victim&#146;s perception
          can be quite a bit different because she&#146;s looking at the
          situation &#150; her perception is being filtered through a lot of
          emotions, emotions that stem back &#150; can stem back &#150; to her period
          in her life where she was undergoing an incestuous relationship
          with her father. It does not necessarily mean to say that &#150; that
          she&#146;s lying when she says that there was no consent. That is more
          likely the way that she felt but the impression that she can
          actually give to Mr. I. can be quite a bit different. In other
          words, two people having different &#150; very different perceptions &#133;
          Mr. I. having the perception that there was definitely consent
          and certainly the &#150; the victim feeling that there was absolutely
          no consent.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Finally, Dr. Chiarot testified that a person who has
experienced a traumatic event might have difficulty recalling
details of the event.  Thus, if the victim was overwhelmed by her
feelings at the time of the incident, her perception of the event
could later be altered both with respect to her recollection of
what happened with her father and what actually happened with the
appellant.
[11] Under cross-examination, Dr. Chiarot agreed:
      that an incest survivor could be a victim of a sexual
     assault;
      that an incest survivor&#146;s ability to experience sexual
     reality varies and must be evaluated on an individual basis;
      that shock could be a form of dissociation;
      that a person undergoing a traumatic event, for example a
     sexual assault, might fixate on something to help them cope with
     what was going on;
      that his evidence about incest survivors was based on his
     clinical experience, and the literature, and it might not apply
     to incest survivors who have not sought help if such a population
     exists; and
    that he would be in a better position to offer an opinion in
this case if he had interviewed the complainant.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In re-examination, Dr. Chiarot explained that, as a defence
witness, he would not expect access to the complainant.  He also
explained that, despite the lack of an interview with the
complainant, he did feel able to render an opinion on the
possibility of a dissociative state.
[13] In charging the jury, the trial judge read the definition of
&#147;consent&#148; contained in s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code.  He then
reviewed situations where no consent is obtained by reading to
the jury ss. 273.1(2) (b), (d) and (e). The only section he
elaborated on was s. 273.1(2)(b) where he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               For example, if the complainant was so drunk that she was
          not capable of giving consent to the act, then that clearly would
          not be consent in law, because she was incapable of giving
          consent. Another example that I see in the evidence before you,
          and this is an issue for you and I am just trying to assist you,
          it is your determination: A person, a complainant, in a
          dissociative state would not be capable of giving consent because
          the mind is not capable of going with the act. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge properly instructed the jury that, if they
found that the complainant had not consented, they would then
have to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent.  In this regard, the trial judge read to the jury ss.
265(4) and 273.2 of the Criminal Code.  He then reviewed the
evidence the defence was relying upon with respect to the defence
of honest but mistaken belief.  In doing so however, he made no
mention of the complainant&#146;s testimony that, at one point during
intercourse, the appellant had stopped moving and asked her, &#147;Do
you want to do this?&#148;  He also failed to mention the appellant&#146;s
testimony that, when the complainant&#146;s face was blank, he stopped
having intercourse with her and asked her if she was all right,
and she responded by moving her vagina back into contact with his
penis.
[15] The trial judge did refer to the evidence of Dr. Chiarot,
but failed to mention Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence that the appellant&#146;s
description of the complainant moving her vagina toward him after
his inquiry was consistent with a dissociative state in which she
began to act as a compliant child.  The trial judge concluded his
discussion of this evidence by saying:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It appears to me that according to the evidence of Dr.
          Chiarot, a person suffering a dissociative state would be unable
          to consent to sexual activity. That is the way that I interpreted
          his evidence. However, you provide your own interpretation to the
          evidence. You are the triers of fact in this case, not me.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The jury retired at 12:41 p.m. to consider their verdict and
at 4:52 p.m. returned and posed the following questions:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  Would the judge please once again explain the legal
          definition of consent to us; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  May we please get the transcript of
          the trial or have the question and answers
          from the victim surrounding the initial
          embrace in the kitchen on Dec 1/92 prior to
          going into the bedroom from both the Crown
          and Defence.</pre>
    <pre>[17] With respect to the first question, the trial judge
recharged the jury by again referring to the definition of
&#147;consent&#148; contained in s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code and the
situations where no consent is obtained as outlined in s.
273.1(2). Once again, the only section he elaborated on was s.
273.1(2)(b), saying:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; and you will recall my reference to a person who is too
          drunk to be able to consent, and I also indicated that in my
          opinion, as I interpreted Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence, a person in a
          dissociative state would also be unable to consent.  But, as I
          indicated that is a question for the jury to wrestle with.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[18] With respect to the second question, the evidence requested
by the jury was played back to them by the court reporter.
[19] At 11:15 a.m. on January 20, 1995, the trial judge delivered
an exhortation to the jury and they resumed their deliberations
at 11:19 a.m.  At 12:41 p.m. the jury asked a further question
again related to consent:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Can the judge please once again explain consent under the
          law. There is a great deal of concern between ourselves in the
          absence of a definite yes. If the accused makes an assumption
          that everything was O.K. based on his understanding through the
          actions of the victim gave him consent. This question is raised
          as a result of the charge read by the judge when he referred to
          an &#147;honest mistake&#148; (someone taking a jacket and not doing
          anything wrong). We need to understand this.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge then extensively recharged the jury with
respect to both consent and the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent.  His review of the evidence was essentially
identical to that in his original charge.  In concluding, the
trial judge again said with respect to the evidence of Dr.
Chiarot:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It appears to me that according to the evidence of Dr.
          Chiarot, a person suffering a dissociative state would be unable
          to consent to sexual activity. That is the way that I interpreted
          his evidence. However, you provide your own interpretation of the
          evidence. You are the triers of fact in this case, not me.</pre>
    <pre>[21] The defence again objected to the charge and asked the trial
judge to review Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence and relate it both to the
issue of consent as well as the issue of honest but mistaken
believe in consent.  In the absence of consent from the Crown,
the trial judge declined to do so and at 2:23 p.m., the jury
returned the verdict of guilty.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[22] The trial judge misstated Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence.  Dr.
Chiarot did not say that if the complainant was in a dissociative
state, she would be incapable of consenting to the act of sexual
intercourse or, to use the words of the trial judge, &#147;she would
be unable to consent&#148;.  That the trial judge had some difficulty
in understanding what Dr. Chiarot was saying is quite
understandable.  We have some difficulty in articulating his
opinion even after the benefit of an extended argument.  This
type of evidence is not to be encouraged.
[23] Although the evidence was confusing, we are persuaded that
Dr. Chiarot was stating that an incest survivor such as the
complainant in this case could have suffered a &#147;flashback&#148; during
intercourse in which she went back in time to her memories when,
as a child, she was being sexually abused by her father.  While
she had initially consented to an act of intercourse with the
appellant, the consensual act was reduced to a submissive act
when she perceived her partner to be her father and herself as a
child.  Accordingly, there was a dramatic change in her mental
state that persisted after the sexual act had been completed.
Then, in her own mind, she had not consented to the act of
intercourse with the appellant just as she had not consented to
the earlier acts of intercourse with her father to whom she had
simply submitted.
[24] As we understand the submissions of the appellant&#146;s counsel,
this evidence of Dr. Chiarot was directed to explaining the
starkly different conduct of the complainant after the act of
intercourse.  According to the expert testimony, she could well
have freely consented to the act before and at its inception, but
in her own mind, the whole concept of the sexual activity was
radically altered by the flashback which took her in her mind
back to the distasteful activities with her father.  This is why
she could in all honesty, says Dr. Chiarot, believe that she had
never consented to the act in the first place.
[25] Unfortunately, the trial judge took Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence a
step further and instructed the jury that if they accepted the
evidence that the complainant was in a dissociative state, then
as a matter of law they must find that she did not consent to the
sexual activity. While the Crown supported this position on
appeal, counsel candidly conceded that this suggestion emanated
from the trial judge and the trial Crown was unaware that the
trial judge proposed to instruct the jury in this manner. The
effect of the direction was to turn the defence in upon itself.
What was put forward as a defence was converted into a critical
point in favour of the prosecution. Either she did not consent or
her consent was obtained when she was in a dissociative state and
incapable in law of consenting.
[26] A further and equally important consideration was that,
having charged the jury that the complainant could not consent as
a matter of law because she was in a dissociative state, the
trial judge was obliged to further instruct them that they must
then be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
was unaware that she was in a dissociative state before it could
reject the defence of honest but mistaken belief that the
complainant had consented.
[27] The trial judge&#146;s direction and redirection to the jury as
to the effect of the evidence of Dr. Chiarot was in error and
clearly confused them. It must have contributed to their verdict
of guilty. Accordingly, there must be a new trial. We would make
the following comments for the benefit of the trial judge
presiding at the new trial. Dr. Chiarot&#146;s evidence was not
properly scrutinized at a voir dire to determine whether it met
the requirements set out in R. v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d)
401 (S.C.C.). Further, neither the parties nor the trial judge
had the benefit of this court&#146;s decision in R. v. McIntosh
(1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.). Assuming the defence
tenders similar evidence at the new trial, the admissibility of
that evidence should be considered in light of those cases. While
aspects of Dr. Chiarot&#146;s testimony are proper subjects for expert
testimony, the factual basis for that testimony was somewhat
frail. Further, the evidence should be adduced in a manner that
will be of some use to the triers of fact. There is a heavy onus
upon counsel leading this type of evidence to elicit the factual
foundation for the opinion and relate the opinion to the issues
in the case in a manner that is understandable. Otherwise, the
evidence may not meet the necessity and reliability requirements
as explained in Mohan and McIntosh.
[28] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is
quashed and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
