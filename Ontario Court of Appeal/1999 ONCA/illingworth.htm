    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            THE ESTATE OF THOMAS FREDERICK ILLINGWORTH
               (Plaintiff/Appellant) v. HUMBER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
               (Defendant/Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, LABROSSE and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Jennifer August and Patricia Bregman
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Eric R. Hoaken
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 2, 1999
</pre>
    <pre> On appeal from the judgment of Philp J. dated January 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>THE FALSE IMPRISONMENT CLAIM</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We specifically refrain from deciding whether the attending
physician&#146;s failure to comply with s. 38(1) of the Mental Health
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7 (&#147;the Act&#148;) rendered the patient&#146;s
subsequent detention unlawful.  Assuming that it did, in our
view, Philp J. was correct in holding that the Hospital could not
be held vicariously liable for the consequences flowing from that
breach because the attending physician, upon whom the duty
rested, was acting as an independent contractor and not an
employee of the Hospital.
[2]  Apart from the issue of vicarious liability, assuming
without deciding that the Hospital could be fixed with liability
if it had actual or constructive knowledge of the attending
physician&#146;s oversight and failed to take steps to rectify it, we
are not persuaded on this record that there is a basis for
attributing such knowledge to the Hospital.
[3]  In the final analysis, from the Hospital&#146;s perspective, at
all material times the patient was lawfully detained pursuant to
a Form 3 certificate of involuntary admission, the validity of
which the appellant does not contest.  Accordingly, we see no
basis in fact or law for finding the Hospital liable for false
imprisonment.</pre>
    <pre>THE BATTERY CLAIM</pre>
    <pre>[4]  With respect to the claim for battery, the record discloses
no contemporaneous evidence from which it can be inferred, let
alone found as a fact, that at 10:15 a.m. on the morning of June
1, 1995, when the patient was returned to the Hospital by the
police, he was acting in a manner that warranted his being
handcuffed to prevent him from causing serious bodily harm to
himself or others.  Indeed, the only evidence on the subject,
which appears in a brief reference in a nurse&#146;s note in the
Hospital record, is that the patient was quiet and co-operative.
Notably, none of the admitting nurses testified and there is no
record, as required by s. 53 of the Act, describing the behaviour
of the patient that required that he be restrained.
[5]  The respondent submits that in deciding whether the
statutory requirements for restraint set forth in s. 1 of the Act
have been met, the admitting staff was entitled to consider all
of the surrounding circumstances, including the background and
history of the patient and the nature of his disorder.  While we
agree with that submission, we are of the view that in this case,
the historical evidence, standing alone, was insufficient to meet
the statutory requirements for restraint.
[6]  Counsel for the respondent concedes that the Hospital bore
the onus of justifying the use of handcuffs to restrain the
patient upon his arrival at the hospital at 10:15 a.m..  In our
view, on this record, that onus has not been met.  Accordingly,
the claim for battery is allowed.
[7]  On these facts, the appellant submits and we agree that
damages should be nominal and we fix them at $100.
[8]  In the result, the appeal is allowed in part and the order
below is varied to give effect to these reasons.  The appellant
is entitled to its costs of the appeal which we fix in the amount
of $500.00.</pre></td>
