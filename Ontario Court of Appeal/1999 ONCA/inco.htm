    <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Wilson J. dated September 20, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]    In my view, and with the consent of Inco Limited, this  is
an  appropriate  case in which to grant to  the  Crown  leave  to
appeal pursuant to s. 131 of the Provincial Offences Act, as  the
proposed  appeal  is  upon a question  of  law  and  it  is  both
essential  in  the public interest and for the due administration
of justice, that leave be granted.
[2]  Although the appeal judge allowed Inco Limited&#146;s appeal and
set aside the convictions, he also directed that there be a new
trial.  Inco Limited had advanced two grounds of appeal.  The
first ground was that the trial justice of the peace had erred in
dismissing a motion seeking an order to stay or quash the charges
against Inco Limited based on sections 6 to 10 of the Charter.
The second ground was that the trial justice of the peace had
erred in applying the legal test regarding the proof of offences
contrary to s. 30(1)(2) of the Ontario Water Resources Act.  In
allowing the appeal, the appeal judge gave effect to the second
ground.  Consequently, he felt that it was unnecessary to deal
with the first ground.
[3]  Inco Limited now seeks leave to appeal from the failure of
the appeal judge to decide the first ground of appeal.  It
contends that it was entitled to succeed in its appeal on both
grounds and that if leave to appeal is not granted the
opportunity to raise this ground before this court on the Crown&#146;s
appeal will be unavailable.  Thus, it submits that leave to
appeal should be granted to prevent a potential miscarriage of
justice. In my view, this contention is well taken because if
this court allows the Crown&#146;s appeal and restores the
convictions, Inco Limited will have been deprived of the
opportunity of an appellate court&#146;s opinion in respect to its
Charter defence which had been rejected at trial.
[4]  As in R. v. Valente (1982), 144 D.L.R. (3rd) 111, a decision
of this court, the decision of the appeal judge giving rise to
this application for leave poses awkward procedural problems.
However, I am satisfied that they are resolved by the reasons of
Blair J.A. in Valente, which stand for the proposition that when
a provincial appeal judge makes a decision not to deal with an
issue this qualifies as a decision, and therefore, is a judgment
within the meaning of s. 131(1) of the Provincial Offences Act,
in respect to which leave to appeal may be granted.
[5]  If the court declines to grant leave to appeal in what is,
functionally, a cross-appeal, an unsatisfactory result may follow
from the Crown&#146;s appeal.  On the one hand, if the appeal succeeds
and the convictions are restored, Inco Limited will have been
deprived of an appellate review of the ruling made by the trial
justice of the peace rejecting its Charter defence.  On the other
hand, if the Crown&#146;s appeal fails and there is a new trial, the
Charter defence will, no doubt, be raised again by Inco Limited.
The trial court will have to rule upon the defence without the
benefit of a ruling from this court. In such circumstances, there
would be a serious likelihood of another appeal.  This suggests
that leave to appeal should be granted to enable the Court of
Appeal to be able to adjudicate upon all the relevant issues and
avoid a potential miscarriage of justice, or another series of
appeals.
[6]   In  my view, Inco Limited&#146;s application for leave to appeal
involves  a question of law.  As well, the test in s.  131(2)  is
satisfied  as  the  due administration of justice  requires  that
leave to appeal be granted to Inco Limited.
[7]  In the circumstances, there will be no costs of either
application.
                                             &#147;S. Borins J.A.&#148;</pre></td>
