    <pre>HEARD:         May 27, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from the orders of J.J. Fleury J. dated  January  22,
1998 and July 30, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal and cross-appeal raise issues relating to three
orders of Fleury J. made in a mortgage enforcement proceeding.
[2]  On January 22, 1998, Fleury J. found that the appellant,
first mortgagee, had not properly served its notice of power of
sale on the respondent, second mortgagee. As a result, Fleury J.
ordered that the appellant serve the respondent through his
solicitor and directed that the respondent have a period of 30
days to exercise his right to pay off the balance owing on the
first mortgage. He reserved the issue of costs.
[3]  The appellant served its notice on the respondent in
compliance with the order. The parties then entered into an
agreement under which the appellant assigned its mortgage to the
respondent. In return, the respondent redeemed the mortgage by
paying $188,000 to the appellant. He agreed to deposit $20,000 in
trust to be applied towards any further amounts found to be owing
to the appellant under its mortgage. In this regard there were a
number of items in dispute including payments made by the
appellant for insurance premiums and hydro in relation to the
mortgaged property.
[4]  On May 7, 1998, Fleury J. directed that the $20,000 be paid
into court pending disposition of the issues in dispute.
[5]  On July 24, 1998, Fleury J. heard a motion to dispose of the
issues that remained outstanding. On July 30, 1998, he issued
reasons which decided some but not all of the issues that had
been raised before him. Unfortunately neither of the parties took
out a formal order with respect to his disposition of the issues
raised on that motion.
[6]  In his reasons, Fleury J. dealt with three separate matters.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)       He ordered that the appellant was entitled to the full
          amount of interest payable under the terms of the first mortgage
          (18% after default) for the period until the payment of $188,000
          on the assignment of the mortgage to the respondent;
(b)       He provided directions to assist the parties with a
resolution of the issues relating to the appellant&#146;s claim for
reimbursement for payments it had made for insurance and hydro.
He asked the parties to attempt to resolve their differences and
directed that, failing resolution, the parties could speak to
him.
(c)       Finally, he ordered that there be no costs to the
appellant in relation to the motion of January 22, 1998 reasoning
that it was the appellant&#146;s ineffective attempt to serve the
notice of power of sale that necessitated that motion.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  On this appeal the appellant seeks the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)       an order quashing the order of Fleury J. made on
          January 22, 1998
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)            an order that the full amount owing to the
               appellant under the mortgage be paid from the $20,000 being held
               in court; this to include the disputed amounts for insurance and
               hydro payments made by the appellant; and
(c)       an order awarding the appellant solicitor and client
costs on the motion of January 22, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>     Order of January 22, 1998</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant argues that Fleury J. erred in finding that
the service of the appellant&#146;s notice of power of sale that
preceded the motion was ineffective. The January 22, 1998 order
was an interlocutory order. An appeal of this order does not lie
to this court.
[9]  In any event, the appellant did not appeal this order at the
time it was made. He complied with it. The appellant has now
assigned the mortgage to the respondents. This appeal is moot and
is therefore dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     Further Payments to the Appellant</pre>
    <pre>[10] In his reasons of July 30, 1998, Fleury J. neither ordered
nor refused to order the payment of the amounts claimed by the
appellant. He gave directions with a view to assisting the
parties to discuss and resolve the issues in dispute. If those
directions constitute an order, it would be an interlocutory, not
a final order, and the appeal would not lie to this court. There
has been no order with respect to the payment of money and there
is no order upon which an appeal to this court could be founded.
In any event, it now appears that the parties are in agreement
that these issues should be referred to the assessment officer in
Welland. We think that is a reasonable approach.</pre>
    <pre>  Costs of January 22, 1998 Motion</pre>
    <pre>[11] As a result of the above, the appellant&#146;s appeal is reduced
to an attempt to appeal the order refusing costs for the January
22, 1998 motion. For this, the appellant requires leave of this
court:  Courts of Justice Act, s. 133(b). Although the appellant
has not sought leave, we are prepared to proceed with this issue
as if it had done so.
[12] Leave to appeal a costs order, standing alone, is granted
only sparingly. Having regard to the amount of the costs
involved, the nature of the motion and the equities between the
parties, we dismiss the application for leave to appeal the costs
order.</pre>
    <pre>     CROSS-APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[13] The respondent cross-appeals, asking that Fleury J.&#146;s order
of July 30, 1998 be varied to deny the appellant interest for the
four month period preceding the assignment of the mortgage or in
the alternative reducing the rate of interest payable for that
period from 18% to 12%.
[14] We agree with the reasons of Fleury J. and see no merit in
the respondent's argument. The cross-appeal is therefore
dismissed.
[15] There will be no order for costs of the appeal or the cross-
appeal.</pre>
