    <pre>
On appeal from the judgment of Festeryga J. dated March 19, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We called on the respondent only with respect to two issues:
damages and the application of s. 31(3) of the Landlord and
Tenant Act.
[2]  The appellants&#146; argument was that the trial judge was only
to deal with liability and, on the agreement of the parties,
leave the calculation of damages to be dealt with on a reference.
While the matter is not completely clear, we are satisfied that
the trial judge properly concluded that he had enough evidence to
calculate the damages.  When he indicated to the parties at the
end of the trial that this was his intention, neither counsel
objected.  The calculation he ultimately made, based on the
invoice price of the manufacturers less 15% for depreciation,
was, in the circumstances, an appropriate method of calculation.
It is worth noting that this calculation, in any event, resulted
in an assessment at a figure that was less than the value of the
goods estimated when the landlord sold them to Stationery in
Motion Inc.
[3]   The appellants also argued that the goods on the premises
were not exempt from distress because the tenant was an agent for
the owners of the goods within the meaning of s. 31(3) of the
Landlord and Tenant Act.  We do not agree.  Aside from our
concern that this issue was not argued at trial and was found by
the trial judge to have been conceded by the appellants, we are
not satisfied that the section bears the interpretation suggested
by the appellants.  Under s. 31(3), a tenant&#146;s goods are not
exempt from distress if the store is managed or controlled by an
agent for the owner of the goods.  It does not follow as a matter
of law, without more, that a consignee is an agent within the
meaning of s. 31(3), nor is there any evidentary foundation in
this record before us on which to conclude that the tenant was
such an agent.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
                                                                 </pre>
