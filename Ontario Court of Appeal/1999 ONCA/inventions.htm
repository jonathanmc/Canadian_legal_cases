    <pre>RE:            INVENTIONS,  RESEARCH  &amp;  DEVELOPMENT  (Plaintiff/
               Appellant)  v.  CANADIAN  GAS  RESEARCH  INSTITUTE

    <pre>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, MOLDAVER and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Dr. F.K. Besik, in person</pre>
    <pre>               Valentine Lovekin, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Langdon J. dated October 8, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On Canadian Gas&#146; motion for summary judgment to dismiss
IRD&#146;s action, Langdon J. ordered that IRD&#146;s action be limited to
a claim for payment of its final invoice to Canadian Gas in the
amount of $14,225. In all other respects, he allowed the motion
and dismissed IRD&#146;s action.

[2]  Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, we see no
error in Langdon J.&#146;s reasons or his conclusion. In particular,
we agree with the motions judge that IRD failed to raise a
triable issue in respect of the claims asserted in paragraphs
1(c) to (f) of its amended claim, those being: wrongful
termination of IRD&#146;s services; legal expenses associated with the
lawsuit; special damages for loss of royalties and special
damages for loss of income from consulting services.

[3]  In this respect, we note that in allowing IRD to amend its
original claim, Master Peppiatt satisfied himself that it was
IRD&#146;s position that the May 3, 1994 agreement, as amended by the
October 6, 1994 draft amendments represented the entire contract
between the parties and that IRD was not alleging any oral or
other agreements. That being so, taking the case for IRD at its
highest, there is nothing in the original agreement or the draft
amendments that would even remotely support the claims asserted
by IRD in paragraphs 1(c) to (f) of its amended claim.

[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
