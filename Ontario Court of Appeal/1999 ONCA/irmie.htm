      <pre>RE:            WILLIAM GEORGE IMRIE (Applicant/Appellant) v.
               SARAH IMRIE (Respondent)</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, CHARRON and BORINS JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       Sam Garcea
               for the appellant</pre>
      <pre>               George E. Johnson
               for the respondent</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         October 18, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Madam Justice Genesee
dated April 6,1999.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  We will assume that the motion judge properly held that the
increase in the appellant’s income from the time of the initial
order was sufficient to constitute a change in the appellant’s
“means” within the meaning of s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.
[2]  We are, however, satisfied that the motion judge erred in
principle in failing to give appropriate weight to all of the
circumstances identified in s. 17(7) of the Act in deciding
whether any variation should be made.  We are specifically
concerned that she did not give adequate consideration to the
factor identified in s. 17(7)(b).  In our view, the motion judge
failed to give adequate weight to the fact that the appellant was
bearing the full financial burden of providing for three teenage
daughters.  That burden had remained at least as onerous as it
was at the time of the initial order.  Any increase in his salary
was not sufficient to warrant a variation in the initial support
order made in these circumstances.
[3]  The appeal is allowed and the order varying the order of
Justice Stayshyn is set aside.  Given the uncertainty in the
language of the initial order, the motion was properly brought by
the respondent.  There will be no costs either here or on the
hearing of the application.</pre></td>
