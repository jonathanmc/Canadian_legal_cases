    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Sutherland J. dated October 28,1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Because of its urgency, we gave our decision in this appeal,
as  well  as in the companion appeal, A.M. v. Dr. Benes  et  al.,
immediately  after oral argument, with reasons to follow.   These
are our reasons.
[2]  The appellant L.L. is the mother of the incapable person
T.C. and acts as T.C.&#146;s substitute decision maker.  L.L. appeals
the order of Sutherland J., which dismissed an appeal from the
decision of the Consent and Capacity Board.  The Board found that
medication prescribed by Dr. I.T. was in T.C.&#146;s best interests
and that, in refusing her consent to this medication, L.L. had
not complied with the principles governing substitute decision
making under the Health Care Consent Act, 1996, S.O. 1996.
[3]  In the companion appeal, A.M. v. Dr. Benes et al., we
concluded that s.37 of the Health Care Consent Act, was
constitutional. In view of that conclusion, it is unnecessary to
deal with the constitutional issues raised by the appellant in
this appeal.
[4]  The remaining issues before us are the appropriate standard
of review on appeal from the decision of the Consent and Capacity
Board and the application of that standard to the findings of the
Board.  The appellant submits that the standard is correctness;
the respondent maintains that the standard is reasonableness.  On
either standard, the appellant submits that the two key findings
of the Board should be set aside: first, that T.C. had not
expressed a relevant prior capable wish; and second, that the
treatment proposed by Dr. I.T. was in T.C.&#146;s best interests.
[5]  We have concluded that the appropriate standard for
reviewing the findings of the Consent and Capacity Board that are
in issue on this appeal is reasonableness.  We also hold the
findings of the Board that T.C. had not given an applicable prior
capable wish and that L.L. had not complied with her statutory
duty to be reasonably supported by the evidence.  We would not
interfere with the Board&#146;s decision.</pre>
    <pre>Background Facts</pre>
    <pre>[6]   T.C. is an incapable person under the Act.  He was admitted
to the Queen Street Mental Health Centre on June 3, 1996 by order
of  the  Ontario Criminal Code Review Board.  He had been charged
with  sexual  assault and was found to be unfit to  stand  trial.
T.C.  is schizophrenic and has been admitted to the Queen  Street
Mental Health Centre on at least six prior occasions.  Since  the
first  onset of T.C.&#146;s illness in 1983, his mother, the appellant
L.L.,  has cared for her son except when he has been admitted  to
psychiatric facilities or stayed in boarding homes.  L.L.  became
T.C.&#146;s  substitute decision maker (&#147;SDM&#148;) under s.20 of  the  Act
because  she  is  the  highest  ranking  family  member  who   is
qualified, willing and able to make decisions for her son.
[7]  In the past, L.L. had consented to neuroleptic and anti-side
effect medication prescribed for her son to treat his
schizophrenia.  On his latest admission to the Queen Street
Mental Health Centre, Dr. I.T., T.C.&#146;s physician, again proposed
this medication for T.C.  Acting as T.C.&#146;s SDM, L.L. at first
consented to this medication but suddenly withdrew her consent on
June 20, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>The Proceedings Before the Board</pre>
    <pre>[8]   In  February  1997, Dr. I.T. applied  to  the  Consent  and
Capacity  Board under s.37(1) of the Act, for a review of  L.L.&#146;s
refusal to consent to the prescribed medication.  One week later,
on  February  25,  1997,  a  panel of  three  persons  heard  the
application.   T.C.  was  not present  at  the  hearing  but  was
represented by counsel.
[9]  L.L. was present at the hearing but was not represented by
counsel.  Her evidence was that she thought that the medication
was toxic and harming her son.  She also testified that in about
1990, her son asked her not to consent to this form of treatment
on his behalf any longer.  The Board also heard from Dr. I.T.,
from a nurse who had looked after T.C. and from a social worker
who had met with L.L.
[10] The Board gave its decision the following day, February 26,
1997.  After considering the evidence, the Board concluded that
T.C. was extremely ill and was deteriorating with the passage of
time.  The Board also found that the patient had not given a
prior capable wish that he did not want treatment, that the
prescribed medication was in T.C.&#146;s best interests and that, in
refusing consent to treatment, L.L. had not complied with the
principles for substitute decision making under s.21 of the Act.
The Board was satisfied that the side effects of the medication
were outweighed by the benefits of the treatment.  L.L. had
therefore &#147;clearly ignored a major component of the factors that
she must consider when making her decision, and had not made a
decision about consent in the best interests of her son.&#148;
[11] The Board directed L.L. to consent to the proposed treatment
by 5:00 p.m. on February 28, 1997, two days after its decision,
failing which she would be deemed not to meet the requirements
for substitute decision making set out in s.20(2) of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>The Appeal Before Sutherland J.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  On appeal, Sutherland J. agreed with the Board&#146;s conclusion
that  L.L.  had  not  complied with s. 21 in assessing  the  best
interests  of  her son, and with the Board&#146;s application  of  the
best  interests test in determining that T.C. should receive  the
proposed medication.
[13] He also agreed with the Board&#146;s finding that there was no
evidence of a prior capable wish.  In reviewing the Board&#146;s
discussion of whether T.C. had expressed an applicable prior
capable wish, Sutherland J. commented:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A decision made at first instance on the basis of
          credibility is often thought of as appeal-proof &#150; hence the
          temptation.  However, given the broad powers of this court under
          s. 80 of the Act that is not the effect of such a finding on this
          appeal.  I shall review the evidence that was before the Board
          with respect to, or relating to, prior capable wishes, and shall
          also consider in that regard the new evidence admitted on the
          appeal.  In so doing I shall consider the evidence itself and
          whether the Board&#146;s finding in that regard stands up on the basis
          of the evidence that was before the Board.  I shall also consider
          the impact of the new evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               I would, even although the Act affords a
          broad  right  of  appeal,  but  for  the  new
          evidence  and roles of counsel on the  appeal
          have allowed the appeal in part, I would have
          sent  the issue of prior capable wishes  back
          to  the  Board  for a hearing on  that  issue
          where  the SDM had the benefit of a knowledge
          of  her duties and rights under the Act,  the
          criteria  to  be  applied  by  the  Board  in
          reviewing her decision and the powers of  the
          Board  to,  in effect, override her decision.
          As  stated, I would not have returned to  the
          question  of  the  patient&#146;s best  interests,
          because I am of the same opinion as the Board
          as to his best interests.
          </pre>
    <pre>                &#133;  the basis of the record at the Board
          hearing  and,  especially, the  new  evidence
          given  on  this appeal where there was  every
          opportunity  for  knowledgeable  counsel   to
          canvass the situation thoroughly, I am of the
          opinion  that  there were not  prior  capable
          wishes applicable in the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>First Issue: The Appropriate Standard of Review of the Board&#146;s Findings</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits the test should be correctness for two
reasons:  first, because there is a wide ranging right of  appeal
under  s.  80 of the Act; and second, because the Board does  not
have  specialized expertise.  As a result, the appellant  submits
that no deference should be given to the decisions of the Board.
[15] Under Section 80(1) of the Act, a party may appeal a
decision of the Board on a question of law or fact or both.
Section 80(10) of the Act gives the court on appeal broad powers:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (10) On the appeal, the court may,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)   exercise  all the powers  of  the
          Board;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)  substitute its opinion for that of
          a   health  practitioner,  an  evaluator,   a
          substitute decision-maker or the Board;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  refer the matter back to the Board,
          with directions, for rehearing in whole or in
          part.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Although the court on appeal has broad powers of review, the
statute  has ensured that the Board, contrary to the position  of
the  appellant,  is a specialized expert tribunal.   The  Board&#146;s
expertise is reflected in its composition, which is provided  for
in s.71 of the Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               s. 71(3)  The chair may specify qualifications, for the
          purpose of clause 73(2) (d), that must be met by members of the
          Board before they may be assigned to sit alone to deal with
          particular applications.
          </pre>
    <pre>                73.(1)     The chair shall  assign  the
          members  of  the  Board to sit  alone  or  in
          panels of three or five members to deal  with
          particular applications.
          </pre>
    <pre>                (2)   A  member  of the  Board  may  be
          assigned  to  sit  alone  to  deal  with   an
          application only if,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)   throughout  the  two-year  period
          immediately preceding the assignment,  he  or
          she  has been a member of the Board or of the
          review board established by section 37 of the
          Mental Health Act, as it read before the  day
          subsection   20  (23)  of  the  Consent   and
          Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992 came
          into force;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   he or she is a member of the  Law
          Society of Upper Canada and has been a member
          of the Law Society of Upper Canada throughout
          the ten-year period immediately preceding the
          assignment;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  in the case of an application for a
          review of a finding of incapacity, he or  she
          has  experience that, in the opinion  of  the
          chair,  is relevant to adjudicating capacity;
          and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (d)   he or she meets all of the  other
          qualifications specified by the  chair  under
          subsection 71(3).</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  Board  in the present case sat as a  panel  of  three.
Indeed,  it  was  composed  of a lawyer,  a  psychiatrist  and  a
community representative, and thus had a good balance of relevant
expertise.  But even where the Board sits as a panel of one, that
one  member must be an experienced lawyer with expertise in  both
adjudication   and   in   mental   health   proceedings.    These
qualifications are essential for administering the best interests
test, which is at the heart of the Board&#146;s jurisdiction.
[18] The best interests of an incapable person are to be decided
in accordance with the factors set out in s. 21(2) of the Act.
This subsection states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               s. 21(2)  In deciding what the incapable person&#146;s best
          interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent on his or
          her behalf shall take into consideration,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)   the  values and beliefs  that  the
               person knows the incapable person held when
               capable and believes he or she would still
               act on if capable;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)    any  wishes  expressed   by   the
               incapable  person with  respect  to  the
               treatment  that are not required  to  be
               followed under paragraph 1 of subsection
               (1); and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (c) the following factors:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Whether the treatment is likely to,
          </pre>
    <pre>                i.    improve  the  incapable  person&#146;s
          condition or well-being,
          </pre>
    <pre>               ii.  prevent the incapable person&#146;s
          condition or well-being from deteriorating,
          or
          </pre>
    <pre>                iii. reduce the extent to which, or the
          rate   at   which,  the  incapable   person&#146;s
          condition   or   well-being  is   likely   to
          deteriorate.
          </pre>
    <pre>                2.    Whether  the  incapable  person&#146;s
          condition or well-being is likely to improve,
          remain  the  same or deteriorate without  the
          treatment.
          </pre>
    <pre>                3.    Whether the benefit the incapable
          person   is  expected  to  obtain  from   the
          treatment outweighs the risk of harm  to  him
          or her.
          </pre>
    <pre>                4.   Whether a less restrictive or less
          intrusive treatment would be as beneficial as
          the treatment that is proposed.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The  Supreme Court has confirmed that a specialized  expert
tribunal   is  entitled  to  deference  on  issues  within   that
tribunal&#146;s  expertise,  even where a statutory  right  of  appeal
exists.   (Bell  Canada v. Canada (Canadian Radio-Television  and
Telecommunications Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1722;   Pezim  v.
British  Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers),  [1994]  2  S.C.R.
557;   Canada (Director of Investigation and Research Competition
Act) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748).
[20] In Southam, Iacobucci J. elaborated on the deference to be
accorded specialized tribunals on issues within their expertise,
even in the face of a statutory right of appeal.  He confirmed,
as he had stated in Pezim, that the appropriate standard of
review is reasonableness:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Expertise, which in this case overlaps with the purpose of
          the statute that the tribunal administers, is the most important
          of the factors that a court must consider in settling on a
          standard of review.  This Court has said as much several times
          before, though perhaps never so clearly as in the following
          passage, from United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of
          America, Local 579 v. Bradco Construction Ltd., [1993] 2 S.C.R.
          316, at p. 335:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    . . . the expertise of the tribunal is
               of the utmost importance in determining the
               intention of the legislator with respect to
               the degree of deference to be shown to a
               tribunal's decision in the absence of a full
               privative clause.  Even where the tribunal's
               enabling statute provides explicitly for
               appellate review, as was the case in Bell
               Canada . . ., it has been stressed that
               deference should be shown by the appellate
               tribunal to the opinions of the specialized
               lower tribunal on matters squarely within its
               jurisdiction.
               </pre>
    <pre>                    &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 In   my   view,  considering  all   of
          the    factors   I   have   canvassed,   what
          is    dictated    is    a    standard    more
          deferential     than     correctness      but
          less    deferential   than   &quot;not    patently
          unreasonable&quot;.      &#133;       Because       the
          expertise   of   the   Tribunal,   which   is
          the     most     important     consideration,
          suggests    deference,   a    posture    more
          deferential       than      exacting       is
          warranted.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  wish  to emphasize that the need  to
          find a  middle ground in cases like this  one
          is  almost  a  necessary consequence  of  our
          standard-of-review  jurisprudence.    Because
          appeal  lies  by  statutory  right  from  the
          Tribunal's  decisions on questions  of  mixed
          law  and  fact, the reviewing court need  not
          confine itself to the search for errors  that
          are  patently unreasonable.  The standard  of
          patent  unreasonableness  is  principally   a
          jurisdictional test and, as I have said,  the
          statutory   right   of   appeal   puts    the
          jurisdictional   question   to   rest.    See
          Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963
          v.  New  Brunswick  Liquor  Corp.,  [1979]  2
          S.C.R. 227, at p. 237. But on the other hand,
          appeal  from a decision of an expert tribunal
          is not exactly like appeal from a decision of
          a  trial  court.   Presumably  if  Parliament
          entrusts  a certain matter to a tribunal  and
          not (initially at least) to the courts, it is
          because  the  tribunal enjoys some  advantage
          that  judges  do not. For that reason  alone,
          review  of the decision of a tribunal  should
          often be on a standard more deferential  than
          correctness.   Accordingly, a third  standard
          is needed.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  conclude  that  the  third  standard
          should   be  whether  the  decision  of   the
          Tribunal is unreasonable.  This test is to be
          distinguished   from  the  most   deferential
          standard  of review, which requires courts to
          consider  whether  a tribunal's  decision  is
          patently   unreasonable.    An   unreasonable
          decision  is  one that, in the main,  is  not
          supported by any reasons that can stand up to
          a  somewhat probing examination. Accordingly,
          a   court  reviewing  a  conclusion  on   the
          reasonableness  standard  must  look  to  see
          whether  any reasons support it.  The defect,
          if  there is one, could presumably be in  the
          evidentiary  foundation  itself  or  in   the
          logical  process  by  which  conclusions  are
          sought  to  be drawn from it.  An example  of
          the  former  kind  of  defect  would  be   an
          assumption that had no basis in the evidence,
          or  that  was  contrary to  the  overwhelming
          weight  of the evidence.  An example  of  the
          latter   kind   of   defect   would   be    a
          contradiction in the premises or an   invalid
          inference.   [Emphasis added.] (at  pp.  773-

    <pre>(See  also  Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of  Citizenship  and
Immigration),  [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 and Maple Leaf Foods  Inc.  v.
Alejandro (1999), 120 O.A.C. 264 (C.A.).)</pre>
    <pre>[21] In our view, this reasonableness standard is the appropriate
standard  for reviewing the findings of the Consent and  Capacity
Board that are in issue on the appeal: whether T.C. had expressed
an applicable prior capable wish and, if not, whether T.C.&#146;s best
interests required the prescribed medication, and thus whether in
refusing  her  consent, L.L. did not comply  with  s.21(2).   The
reasonableness standard is appropriate for reviewing the  Board&#146;s
findings for the following reasons:
     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  Whether T.C. expressed an applicable prior capable wish is a
question  of fact.  The Board, which heard the evidence  on  this
question, is in the best position to assess credibility and  make
a  finding  on  whether there was a prior  capable  wish.   Thus,
deference is called for.
(b)  The best interests test in part requires a factual finding,
in part requires medical expertise because medical outcomes are
included in the test, and in part requires a weighing of relevant
factors.  All of these considerations argue for deference, and we
observe in particular that the SDM has no medical expertise, an
expertise that is needed to weigh the factors under s.21(2)(c).
Although an SDM may have greater knowledge of an incapable
person&#146;s values and beliefs under s.21(2)(a) of the Act, that
consideration alone does not undermine the need for deference to
the Board&#146;s determination of an incapable person&#146;s best
interests.
(c)  The importance of expeditious decision making under the Act
is another reason for according deference to the Board&#146;s
findings.  Delay resulting from an appeal is not ordinarily
likely to be in an incapable person&#146;s best interests.  Only where
a Board&#146;s finding can be shown to be unreasonable should it be
set aside on appeal.
(d)  Moreover, the Board itself must hear and decide applications
promptly.  Under s.75, the Board must begin a hearing within
seven days of receiving an application and must decide the
application by the day after the hearing ends.  If reasons are
requested, they must be provided within two business days.  In
the light of this short time frame, the Board is entitled to some
leeway, and indeed it is hard to think that the Legislature could
have intended otherwise.  A correctness standard would put an
unfair burden on the Board.  In our view, provided the Board&#146;s
findings are reasonable, an appellate court should not interfere.
We note that Gans J. in Jacques v. Conway, [1998] O.J. No. 3743
(Gen. Div.) also concluded that the Board&#146;s findings were
entitled to deference on appeal.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Second Issue: Are the Board&#146;s Findings Reasonable?</pre>
    <pre>[22]  On  the first question, whether TC had given an  applicable
prior capable wish, the Board found that he had not done so:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Based on the evidence presented to the Board, the Board was
          not satisfied that the patient ever gave a prior capable wish
          that he did not want treatment if he again became ill.  The only
          evidence in this regard, was provided by the patient&#146;s mother
          whom the Board did not find to be a credible witness.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  the Board&#146;s opinion, in any  event,
          the   fact   that  a  patient  stops   taking
          medication  once he or she has  improved,  is
          not  evidence  of  a  clear  statement  by  a
          patient that he or she would not wish to take
          medication, if he or she becomes ill  in  the
          future.</pre>
    <pre>This  finding is reasonably supported by the evidence.  Moreover,
on appeal, Sutherland J. upheld this finding, taking into account
the new evidence before him.</pre>
    <pre>[23] Having found no applicable prior capable wish, the Board was
required to consider T.C.&#146;s best interests.  The Board noted that
it  would  not lightly interfere with the SDM&#146;s refusal  to  give
consent:
          </pre>
    <pre>               As long as the proposed substitute decision maker is himself
          or herself capable, the Board should be hesitant to interfere
          with his or her decision as to whether or not he or she should
          refuse or consent to a proposed treatment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
However,  the  Board concluded that the medication prescribed  by
Dr. I.T. would very likely improve T.C.&#146;s condition and that,  in
ignoring  the  likely medical outcome of the proposed  treatment,
L.L.  had not complied with her statutory duty as SDM.  To  quote
the Board:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the Board&#146;s opinion, since the evidence clearly
          established that the treatment would likely improve the incapable
          person&#146;s condition or well-being, prevent the condition from
          deteriorating, reduce the extent or rate to which the condition
          or well-being is likely to deteriorate, that given the minimal
          side-effects in the past, the benefit of the treatment far
          outweighs the risks, and that the doctor proposes the least
          restrictive or intrusive treatment, the substitute decision maker
          has clearly ignored a major component of the factors that she
          must consider when making her decision.</pre>
    <pre>This finding is also reasonably supported by the evidence and,
therefore, we find no basis to interfere with it.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Accordingly, we agree with Sutherland J.&#146;s decision to defer
to  the  decision  of  the  Board that  T.C.  had  not  given  an
applicable prior capable wish and that L.L.&#146;s refusal to  consent
to treatment was not in T.C.&#146;s best interests.
[25] We feel obliged to comment on one aspect of Sutherland J.&#146;s
decision that we found unfair.  In his decision, he made
pejorative references to the conduct of Dr. I.T. suggesting, for
reasons not apparent from the record, that she ignored the
relevant provisions of the Act.  A review of the transcript
satisfies us that Dr. I.T. conducted herself properly and that
she complied with the statute.
[26] The appeal is dismissed, but, in the circumstances, without
costs.
