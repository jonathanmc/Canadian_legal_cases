    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Lindsay J. dated December 11,
1997 and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Lindsay J. dated
February 3, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant applies for leave to appeal and, if leave is
granted, appeals his summary conviction for assault causing
bodily harm.
[2]  The appellant submits that, after rejecting s.34(1) as a
defence, the trial judge erred in law by failing to consider
whether s.34(2) was a defence available to the appellant.  The
appellant further says that the trial judge&#146;s misapprehension
that only s.34(1) was applicable resulted in a failure to
appreciate the evidence.  He did not ask himself the relevant
question in relation to the facts, namely whether the appellant
believed on reasonable grounds that his actions were necessary to
save himself from death or grievous bodily harm.
[3]  The trial judge did not make specific reference to ss.34(1)
or 34(2) in his reasons.  He did refer to the evidence of the
appellant which would have given rise to a s.34(2) defence. He
was alive to the appellant&#146;s evidence that would support a
defence under s.34(2) and rejected it. The trial judge accepted
the evidence of the Crown witnesses and, in particular, that of
McBride Sr., which he quoted in his reasons for judgment.  That
evidence clearly indicated that the appellant acted out of rage
in kicking the helpless victim once he was down on the ground.
Quite apart from the trial judge&#146;s rejection of the appellant&#146;s
evidence,  the objective component for a consideration of the
s.34(2) defence does not exist in these circumstances.  As a
result, the trial judge did not err in law. The appeal as to
conviction is dismissed.
[4]  The assault on the victim caused permanent and lasting
injury, including brain damage. The trial judge sentenced the
appellant to a term of imprisonment of 12 months. The appellant
submits that the trial judge should have considered imposing a
conditional sentence.  The appellant also submits that the trial
judge did not consider the manner in which the altercation arose.
Having regard to these factors, the appellant submits that an
intermittent sentence of 90 days should have been imposed.
[5]  We do not think that the trial judge erred in declining the
request for a conditional sentence. Having regard to all of the
circumstances, including the very serious nature of the injuries
which the victim suffered, we cannot say that the sentence
imposed by the trial judge was not within the appropriate range.
The holding in Sanatkar (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 325 (Ont. C.A.) to
the effect that when the Crown elects to proceed summarily,
regard must be had to the maximum sentence that can be imposed
for a summary offence, and the sentence in the particular case
scaled down accordingly, needs to be revisited in light of the
expanded jurisdiction of the provincial court to impose sentences
up to eighteen months instead of six months.  The trial judge did
not commit any error in principle in sentencing the appellant.
Leave to appeal sentence is refused.</pre>
