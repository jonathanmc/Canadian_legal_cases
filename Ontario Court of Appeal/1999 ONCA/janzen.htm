    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Introduction
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  This appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of Lally J.
dated August 3, 1995 arise as a result of the death of Henry
Janzen, the pilot and sole occupant of a Cessna 150
aircraft owned by the Rideau Gliding Club, which crashed on June
18, 1988 shortly after take-off from Gananoque Airport.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  It is agreed that the cause of the accident was the breaking
of the elevator control cable as a result of contact between it
and the battery lead which caused the control cable to wear
through the insulation of the battery lead. The contact between
the elevator control cable and the copper wire core of the
battery lead caused electrical 'arcing' that melted the strands
of the elevator control cable, causing it to break. Elevator
control cables are regarded as critical to a pilot's ability to
control an airplane.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The trial judge's finding of liability against the appellant
Frontenac Aviation was based on his finding that an automotive
battery lead, rather than an aircraft battery lead, had been
installed in the aircraft prior to November 1987 when the battery
lead and the elevator control cable were inspected by the
appellant's maintenance engineers. The parties agree that this
automotive lead was improperly installed in the aircraft. The
main issue at trial and in this court turns on when the battery
lead was installed. The trial judge found the appellant's
engineers negligent for failing to replace the automotive battery
lead with a certified aircraft part, or to have secured the lead
so that there would be no possibility that it would come into
contact with the elevator control cable. Frontenac Aviation
appeals from the finding that it was negligent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The liability of Frontenac Aviation was reduced by 60% on
the basis of the trial judge's finding that Pierrette Janzen's
husband, the late Henry Janzen, was negligent in failing to
notice the damaged battery lead and its proximity to the elevator
control cable when he removed the battery from the aircraft
shortly before the fatal crash. Mrs. Janzen appeals the finding
that her husband was contributorily negligent.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In addition, Mrs. Janzen has cross-appealed from the
dismissal of her claim against the Rideau Gliding Club which was
based on the allegation that it is vicariously liable for the
negligence of Frontenac Aviation, and from the Bullock order
awarded to the plaintiff against Frontenac Aviation in respect to
one-half the costs payable to the Rideau Gliding Club by Mrs.
Janzen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Was there evidence upon which the trial judge could make a
finding that the automotive battery lead was installed in the
aircraft when it was inspected by Frontenac Aviation in November,
1987, and that a reasonable inspection would have discovered the
problem and led to the replacement of the battery lead or &quot;at the
very least secured the lead so that there would be no possibility
that it would come into contact with the cable&quot;?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Did the trial judge err in finding contributory negligence
on the part of the late Henry Janzen?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  If this court upholds the finding of negligence against the
deceased pilot Henry Janzen, should the apportionment of
negligence be varied?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Is the Rideau Gliding Club vicariously liable for the
negligence of Frontenac Aviation?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In the event that the plaintiff's cross-appeal against the
Rideau Gliding Club fails, should the Bullock order be varied so
as to order Frontenac to indemnify the plaintiff for all costs
payable by the plaintiff to the Club?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Cause of Accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The federal Transportation Safety Board found that the cause
of the in-flight failure of the elevator control cable was that:
(a)  the battery lead sagged and came into contact with the
     elevator control cable;
(b)  the back and forth movement of the elevator control cable
     during the operation of the aircraft caused the elevator
     control cable to chafe through the battery lead insulation;
     and
(c)  the metal to metal contact between the elevator control
     cable and the core of the battery lead produced an
     electrical arc, hot enough to melt and break the elevator
     control cable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Inspection by Frontenac Aviation</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] It is agreed that two licensed aircraft maintenance
engineers, Laverne Ross and Keith Comyn, performed &quot;a condition
and conformity inspection&quot; and a &quot;100 hour inspection&quot; of the
Club's aircraft in November 1987, on behalf of Frontenac
Aviation. A 100 hour inspection of an aircraft is a complete
inspection of the airframe and engine of an aircraft, in
accordance with the manufacturer's manuals, for the purposes of
renewing the aircraft's certificate of airworthiness and to
ensure that the aircraft is in a fit and safe condition for
flight.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The evidence also indicated that the appropriate maintenance
engineers' 100 hour inspection would ensure that the elevator
control cables are free and clear from any other structure,
equipment or component. Furthermore, the inspection should also
include a visual inspection of the battery lead both to ensure
that it cannot come into contact with the elevator control cables
and to check its condition for any deterioration, because of its
electrical potential.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The witness Comyn testified that during the 100 hour
inspection he would have disconnected the battery lead and
serviced the battery as part of the inspection. Both he and the
witness Ross also testified that the automotive battery lead
found in the aircraft by the Transportation Safety Board
investigation following the accident was not in the aircraft when
they performed the inspection in November of 1987.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] However, the witness Enns, one of the Safety Board
investigators, testified that he spoke to both Comyn and Ross
after the accident and neither could remember specifically
inspecting the battery area in respect to the contact systems. A
witness Jenkins, who was an aviation insurance adjuster,
testified that he was told by Comyn that the latter had no
recollection of the specific work done on this 100 hour
inspection. Furthermore, at trial, the witness Comyn admitted on
cross-examination that he had no &quot;specific memory&quot; of the battery
lead that was in the aircraft when he inspected it in November
1987. A review of the evidence of the witness Ross also indicates
that he actually had no specific recollection of the positioning
of the battery lead in relation to the elevator control cable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Evidence of installation of battery lead in 1983</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The plaintiff tendered evidence that the only record prior
to the accident of an installation, or replacement of a battery
lead, was an invoice dated March 24, 1983. In response, the
appellant called a witness who testified that the battery lead
found in the aircraft by the government inspectors was an
automotive part manufactured by the Whitaker Cable Company of
Canada some time after 1984.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Evidence of Max Vermij</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] The trial judge accepted the evidence of the expert Max
Vermij that the elevator control cable had come into contact with
the battery lead intermittently over a period of years, until the
rubber insulation was finally worn through, resulting in the
electrical arcing which melted and broke the elevator control
cable. Vermij emphasized that the overall appearance of the
damage to the battery lead and its insulation &quot;took years to
develop&quot;. He denied that his opinion depended upon the battery
lead having been installed in March of 1983, but stated that a
lengthy time frame before the accident was consistent with his
theory. Vermij further testified that the damage to the battery
lead that he observed could not have occurred if the battery lead
had been installed shortly before the accident of June 18, 1988.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Findings of Trial Judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The trial judge clearly recognized the fundamental issue of
determining whether the automotive battery lead had been
installed in the aircraft before the inspection by Frontenac
Aviation in November of 1987. Although the evidence tendered in
relation to the automotive battery lead being manufactured after
1984 does not appear to be conclusive, the trial judge
nevertheless found in his judgment that the battery lead was made
by Whitaker Automotive after 1983.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] However, regardless of the actual date of the installation
of the battery lead, the trial judge accepted the expert Vermij's
evidence that the battery lead had been in the aircraft &quot;some
years before the accident&quot;. The trial judge further found on the
&quot;balance of probabilities&quot; that the battery lead was in the
aircraft prior to Frontenac Aviation's 100 hour inspection in
November 1987. The essence of the trial judge's finding with
respect to the appellant's negligence is as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Given Mr. Comyn's observations, he and/or Mr.
          Ross should have inspected the battery box,
          the positive lead and the elevator cable much
          more carefully than they did. I am convinced
          that if they had done so, they would have
          seen the problem and either replaced Exhibit
          #2 with a certified airplane part or at the
          very least secured the lead so that there
          would be no possibility that it would come in
          contact with the cable.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I find on the balance of probabilities that
          the lead, Exhibit 2, was in [the aircraft]
          when Frontenac completed its 100-hour
          inspection in November, 1987, and its failure
          to rectify the problem in respect to Exhibit
          2 was negligence that caused or contributed
          to this accident.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] In my view there was evidence for such a finding and it
cannot be said that there was a palpable and overriding error in
the conclusion reached by the trial judge. The appeal as to the
finding of negligence against the appellant Frontenac Aviation
must therefore be dismissed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Contributory Negligence of Henry Janzen</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The trial judge found the late Henry Janzen contributorily
negligent to the extent of 60% for failing to notice a &quot;week or
so before the accident the condition of the battery lead and the
condition of the elevator cable&quot; as &quot;he was back in the aft
fuselage pulling out the battery. He was an experienced pilot and
the person who maintained the plane. He should have discovered
the problem and had Frontenac rectify it.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The evidence before the trial judge was that the deceased
removed the battery but left the lead in the fuselage. He was
working in a dark cramped area and it was submitted that he
probably would not have noticed the damage to the lead as it was
black and the damage was on its underside. Furthermore, the
battery access panel permitted access only to the top of the
battery and did not permit visibility of the battery lead. There
was no evidence that the deceased had ever replaced or installed
a battery lead in any aircraft.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] It was further submitted on behalf of the cross-appellant
that the deceased had no duty to check the condition on the
battery lead when he removed the battery from the aircraft.
Furthermore, the deceased was entitled to rely on prior
inspections of all aircraft components, including the battery
lead.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The issue of contributory negligence depends upon whether
the deceased owed a duty of care in the circumstances in relation
to inspecting the battery lead. The Supreme Court of Canada has
stated that &quot;the question of whether a duty of care arises will
depend upon the circumstances of each particular case, not on
predetermined categories and blanket rules as to who is, and who
is not, under a duty to exercise reasonable care.&quot;  (London Drugs
Ltd. v. Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299,
per Iacobucci J. at 408.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] The trial judge did not expressly consider whether the
deceased Janzen did owe a duty of care to inspect the battery
lead but instead appears to have assumed that such a duty
existed. In my view, Janzen did not have a duty to inspect the
lead. In the circumstances of this case it was an error on the
part of the trial judge to have found negligence related to a
duty of care on the part of the deceased to inspect the damaged
battery lead, given the cramped and poorly lit location of the
battery and the fact that there was no evidence that he had ever
installed or replaced a battery lead in any aircraft. It should
be emphasized that the deceased only removed the battery from the
plane and not the damaged battery lead. Even though the deceased
was an experienced pilot, he was entitled to rely on the
expertise of the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers who
performed the inspection in November of 1987. The finding of
contributory negligence against the deceased is therefore set
aside.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Cross-Appeal against the Rideau Gliding Club</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] It is submitted by the appellant by cross-appeal that there
was a duty on the part of the Club under the Aeronautics Act to
maintain the aircraft in airworthy condition and, furthermore,
the Club had a non-delegable duty, which made it vicariously
liable for the negligence of the independent contractor Frontenac
Aviation. In support of its submissions the appellant by cross-
appeal relied on the cases of St. John (City) v. Donald, [1926]
S.C.R. 371; and Schubert v. Sterling Trust Corp., [1943] O.R. 438
(H.C.J.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] In the St. John case the defendant city employed an
independent contractor to deepen a stream within the city. An
explosion occurred in a shack that the contractor built to store
its tools and equipment, including dynamite. The plaintiff sued
for damage to its nearby house. A jury found the explosion was
caused by the contractor's negligence in failing to store the
dynamite in a separate, secure location.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] On appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada extended liability to
the city. The Court held that where work is necessarily attended
with risk, the person causing it to be done has the duty of
seeing that effective precautions are taken, and that person
cannot escape from the responsibility by delegating it to a
contractor. By ordering work that involved the storage of
explosives near a road and neighbouring houses, the city had a
duty to take precautions to provide safe storage, which it
breached by not taking active steps to ensure the storage was
proper.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] On the question of vicarious liability (of the city), Anglin
C.J. stated, at 383:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [The employer's] vicarious responsibility
          arises, however, where the danger of
          injurious consequences to others from the
          work ordered to be done is so inherent in it
          that to any reasonably well-informed person
          who reflects upon its nature the likelihood
          of such consequences ensuing, unless
          precautions are taken to avoid them, should
          be obvious, so that were the employer doing
          the work himself his duty to take such
          precautions would be indisputable. That duty
          imposed by law he cannot delegate to another,
          be he agent, servant or contractor, so as to
          escape liability for the consequence of
          failure to discharge it. That, I take it, is
          a principle applicable in such a situation
          whatever be the nature otherwise or the locus
          of the work out of which it arises.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] In Schubert, the defendant trust company, as owner of an
apartment building, hired an extermination company to fumigate
one of the apartments. The exterminator sprayed two apartments,
rather than the one contracted for, but the defendant company did
not object and paid for the work done in both apartments. The
exterminator used cyanogen (cyanide gas). At 3 p.m. on the day in
which the fumigation occurred, the couple living in an adjacent
apartment to one that was sprayed (and across the hall from the
other unit) were found dead in their apartment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The defendant exterminator was clearly negligent, but the
more difficult question was the liability of the trust company.
Hogg J. found it liable for the work of the exterminator, which
was determined to be an independent contractor. The trial judge
went on to find that the question whether the exterminator was to
be regarded as an independent contractor was deemed not to be
material to the issue of vicarious liability. He stated, at 443:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [W]here the work to be done is inherently
          dangerous the employer cannot delegate to
          another, whether servant or contractor, the
          duty to take precautions, and thus escape
          liability for the failure to discharge said
          duty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">On the same page, he quoted from the reasons of Meredith C.J.O.
in McLean v. Crown Tailoring Co. (1913), 29 O.L.R. 455 at 474,
citing 21 Halsbury's Laws of England, 1st ed., as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          An employer cannot divest himself of
          liability in an action for negligence by
          reason of having employed an independent
          contractor, where the work contracted to be
          done is necessarily dangerous, or is from its
          nature likely to cause danger to others
          unless precautions are taken to prevent such
          danger.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] It is my view that the employment of Frontenac Aviation by
the Rideau Gliding Club to perform a &quot;condition and conformity
inspection&quot; and a &quot;100 hour inspection&quot; of the Club's aircraft in
November 1987 does not fall into the category of work or activity
that is inherently or necessarily dangerous. While the
consequences of a negligent inspection can be catastrophic for
the users of the aircraft, the inspection itself did not
represent activity that was inherently dangerous as was the work
performed in the St. John (City) and Schubert cases.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The cross-appeal against the Rideau Gliding Club is
therefore dismissed with costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Cross-Appeal on the Issue of Costs</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] The trial judge held that the plaintiff cross-appellant was
entitled to a Bullock Order against Frontenac Aviation in respect
to one-half of the costs that were to be paid by the plaintiff
cross-appellant to the Rideau Gliding Club with respect to the
dismissal of the action against that defendant. In making such an
Order, the trial  judge recognized that the appellant Frontenac
had &quot;actively pursued negligence&quot; against the Club and had never
suggested to the plaintiff cross-appellant that the Club be let
out of the action. I agree with the plaintiff cross-appellant
that the position adopted by Frontenac effectively kept the Club
in the action until the completion of the trial. It is therefore
my view that the trial judge made an error in principle in
limiting the Bullock Order and that the Order should therefore be
varied so as to order Frontenac to indemnify the plaintiff cross-
appellant for all costs payable by her to the Club.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In the result, the appeal of Frontenac Aviation is dismissed
with costs. The appeal of Mrs. Janzen from the finding that her
husband was contributorily negligent and with respect to the
Bullock order is allowed with costs payable by Frontenac
Aviation. The appeal of Mrs. Janzen from the dismissal of her
claim against the Rideau Gliding Club is dismissed with costs.
