    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Justice
(Divisional Court) (O'Leary, Corbett and Marchand JJ.) dated
April 16, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is brought by the appellant from the decision of
the Divisional Court dismissing his application for judicial
review of a decision of the Ontario Human Rights Commission
(&#147;Commission&#148;).  The Commission had advised the appellant that
the evidence supporting his complaint did not warrant the
appointment of a Board of Inquiry pursuant to the Human Rights
Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H.19 (&#147;Code&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>History of the proceedings as disclosed in the appellant&#146;s factum</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant is a professor in the Department of Economics
at York University. He has been a professor in that Department
since 1969 and was promoted to associate professor with tenure in
1972. The appellant is a Muslim Arab from Iraq. He states that he
has very definite views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He
also states that his views are public, documented and well known
to members in his Department and elsewhere, both within and
outside the University. The appellant&#146;s political opinions about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are summarized in his letter to
the editor published in the Globe and Mail on June 22, 1981. In
that letter he wrote that:

               Israel has only two policy options: either to make peace
          with the Palestinians, or to remain in a permanent state of war
          with the Arabs.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Although this point of view has been the basis for the on-
going reconciliation attempts in the Middle East, the appellant
maintains that such a view, particularly when expressed by
someone of his background, was considered controversial in the
political context of the 1970s and 1980s. As a result of
expressing his opinions about the political stance of the State
of Israel, the appellant maintains that members of the York
University Department of Economics labelled him as anti-Semitic
and anti-Israeli.
[4]  At York University, a professor&#146;s application for promotion
is considered by four different committees, each of which makes a
recommendation as to whether the application should be accepted,
delayed or denied. In order, the application is considered by:

               a.   the professor&#146;s Department;
               b.   the Faculty Committee on Tenure and Promotion;
               c.   the Senate Committee on Tenure and Promotion; and
               d.   the University President whose decision finally 
                    determines the outcome of the process.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In November 1980, the appellant was approached by the then
Chair of the Department of Economics to apply for promotion to
full professor. The Department of Economics prepared the
documents for the appellant&#146;s application and, on January 31,
1983, the Department recommended his promotion to the Faculty of
Arts Committee on Tenure and Promotion.
[6]  On June 9, 1983, and again on June 4, 1984, the Faculty of
Arts Committee on Tenure and Promotion voted for delay in order
to seek more specific reference letters. In accordance with the
Faculty Committee&#146;s recommendations, additional letters of
reference from both external and internal referees were added to
the appellant&#146;s file and, on July 31, 1984, the Department of
Economics passed a unanimous resolution indicating that his file
was complete. His file was again forwarded to the Faculty of Arts
Committee on Tenure and Promotions.
[7]  In August 1984, contrary to the University&#146;s procedural
rules, the Faculty of Arts Committee on Tenure and Promotion
received and considered two unsolicited letters from the
respondents Elie Appelbaum and Roger Latham, both of whom are
professors in the York Department of Economics and both of whom
expressed grave reservations about the appellant&#146;s
accomplishments.
[8]  It is the appellant&#146;s position that the unsolicited letters
were motivated by the writers&#146; opposition to his political
opinions. The appellant asserts that he and Professor Appelbaum,
who is an Israeli, had discussed Middle East politics and held
opposing political opinions. As a result, the appellant was
labelled as anti-Semitic. In addition, a witness interviewed by
the Commission&#146;s investigator indicated that the respondent
Latham had stated that he wrote his letter to make the respondent
Appelbaum&#146;s letter appear motivated by professional concerns
rather than by disagreement with the appellant&#146;s views on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
[9]  The two unsolicited letters were the only unfavourable
letters on the appellant&#146;s file. On August 31, 1984, the Faculty
of Arts Committee on Tenure and Promotion reconsidered the
appellant&#146;s file, taking into account the two unsolicited letters
and voted for delay.
[10] In September 1984, the appellant&#146;s file was forwarded to the
Senate Committee on Tenure and Promotions. The appellant wrote to
the Senate Committee to request that it remove the unsolicited
letters from his file as their inclusion violated the Senate
Procedures on Tenure and Promotion. On approximately November 21,
1984, following a lengthy discussion on the matter, the Senate
Committee agreed to withdraw the two unsolicited letters.
[11] In the course of its subsequent deliberations, and in
violation of the Senate Procedures on Tenure and Promotion, the
Senate Committee on Tenure and Promotions allowed the respondent
John C. Evans, Chair of the Department of Economics, to make in
camera representations regarding the appellant&#146;s application
without disclosing to the appellant the contents of the
representations or providing him with an opportunity to respond.
[12] On December 6, 1984, the Senate Committee on Tenure and
Promotion voted for delay in the appellant&#146;s application. On
November 19, 1985, the respondent Harry Arthurs, then York
University President, informed the appellant that he had accepted
the Senate Committee on Tenure and Promotion&#146;s recommendation for
delay.
[13] On July 13, 1989, the appellant filed a complaint with the
Commission alleging that in denying him a promotion, the
respondents had discriminated against him on the basis of race,
religion and political opinion.
[14] Between December 1989 and May 1993, the Commission
investigated the appellant&#146;s complaint. Under cover of letter
dated June 8, 1994 the Commission released the Case Summary of
its investigation which included the following findings:

               a.        &#147;[A]lthough political opinions and beliefs appear
               to be out of the Commission&#146;s jurisdiction, the Officer addressed
               the issue during the investigation of the complaint, because of
               the uniqueness of the situation in that there is a perception on
               the part of the complainant and others that to be &#145;anti-Israeli&#146;
               (politics) is synonymous with being &#145;anti-semitic&#146; [sic] (creed).
               Furthermore, as alleged by the complainant, his political beliefs
               together with other facts, including race, ethnic origin and
               religion became an issue which affected his application for
               promotion.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               b.   &#147;The evidence from witnesses
               indicates that they were aware of the
               complainant&#146;s political views but they were
               less familiar with his religious views. Three
               witnesses who were aware of his views
               responded by saying that the complainant was
               &#145;anti-Israeli&#146;, not &#145;anti-Semitic&#146;. Another
               witness claimed that a number of his
               colleagues felt that the complainant was
               &#145;anti-Jewish&#146; and another felt that anti-
               Jewish comments would not be popular in the
               Department.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               c.   Professors Appelbaum and Latham
               each denied knowledge that the other had
               submitted an unsolicited letter to Prof.
               Jazairi&#146;s file. This was &#147;in conflict
               with information provided by one witness
               who claimed that Prof. Latham told him
               that although he had nothing against
               Prof. Jazairi, he wrote the letter to
               support Prof. Appelbaum.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               d.   Prof. Latham stated that when he
               wrote his unsolicited letter he knew
               nothing about Prof. Jazairi&#146;s political
               opinions. &#147;He claims that the first time
               he became aware of the complainant&#146;s
               views on Palestine was when he read the
               complainant&#146;s letter in The Globe and
               Mail. &#133; It should be noted that the
               statement of Prof. Latham is conflicting
               inasmuch as the complainant&#146;s letter to
               the Globe and Mail was published in 1981
               and his unsolicited letter was written
               in 1984.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               e.   &#147;The witnesses&#146; consensus was that
               although [the] unsolicited letters were
               removed from the file it was believed
               that the damage was done. One witness
               who had been affiliated with
               Universities for over 30 years said this
               was the first time that he was aware of
               unsolicited letters being added to the
               file of a candidate whom the Department
               had recommended for promotion.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               f.   &#147;The evidence as a whole indicates
               that the complainant&#146;s differential
               treatment in the process for promotion
               to full professor consisted in the
               addition of the unsolicited letters by
               two members of his Department. The
               evidence indicates that the letters were
               considered by the Faculty Committee
               during the reconsideration of the file
               notwithstanding that this was in
               contravention of the Senate rules.
               Although the Senate Committee stated
               that the unsolicited letters would be
               removed from the file, and would not be
               included when the substantive questions
               were discussed, it appears that the
               Senate Committee had been aware of the
               controversy engendered by these letters.
          </pre>
    <pre>               g.   The evidence as a whole indicates
               that the complainant&#146;s application for
               promotion did not receive a fair and
               timely evaluation; however
               irregularities in the process do not
               appear to be related to a prohibited
               ground of discrimination or the
               complainant&#146;s association with persons
               identified by a prohibited ground of
               discrimination.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[15] On or about August 30, 1994, the Commission issued its
decision not to request the appointment of a Board of Inquiry to
hear the appellant&#146;s complaint. The full text of that decision is
as follows:

            The Commission has decided not to request the appointment of a
          Board of Inquiry pursuant to Section 36(2) of the Code, for the
          following reasons:

               1.   The evidence indicates that the
               complainant&#146;s application for promotion to
               Full Professor did not receive a fair and
               timely evaluation. However, the
               irregularities in the process did not appear
               to be related to any prohibited ground of
               discrimination.
               2.   The evidence indicates that the
               complainant may have been differently
               treated, however there is insufficient
               evidence to indicate that the
               differential treatment was as a result
               of his creed rather than his political
               remarks.

          For the above reasons, the Commission is of
          the view that the evidence in this matter
          does not warrant the appointment of a board
          of inquiry.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[16] On September 14, 1994, the appellant filed an application
pursuant to s.37 of the Code requesting the Commission to
reconsider his complaint. That application specifically requested
that the Commission consider whether &#147;political opinion or
belief&#148; per se constitutes a &#147;creed&#148; within the meaning of the
Code and, if not, whether the Code contravened s. 15(1) of the
Charter. On May 2, 1995, the Commission released its decision on
the reconsideration and again declined to request the appointment
of a Board of Inquiry.
[17] On September 19, 1995, the Commission revealed that the
Commissioners had not been provided with written submissions on
behalf of the appellant, which had been submitted in February
1995. The Commission therefore treated the May 1995 decision as a
nullity and the appellant&#146;s request for reconsideration was
considered anew.
[18] On November 29, 1995, the Commission released its
reconsideration decision and upheld its original decision not to
request the appointment of a Board of Inquiry.  The full text of
that decision provides as follows:

               Pursuant to s. 37 of the Code, the Commission has decided to
          uphold its original decision not to deal with this complaint for
          the following reasons

               1.   The Commission remains of the view
               that political belief is not included in the
               meaning of the word &#147;creed&#148;, and remains of
               the view that whatever differential treatment
               the complainant may have received from the
               respondent was not based on creed or any
               other prohibited ground of discrimination.
               2.   Accordingly, the Commission
               considers that there is insufficient
               evidence to warrant a reversal of its
               original decision.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant applied to the Divisional Court for judicial
review.  In  dismissing the application, the Divisional Court
concluded:

               (i)  The prohibition against discrimination on the
               basis of &#147;creed&#148; as it appears in the Code, does not 
	       include &#147;political opinion&#148;, and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii) In any event, &#147;creed&#148;, within the
               meaning of the Code, did not include
               mere &#147;political opinion&#148; as opposed to a
               &#147;cohesive belief system or structure&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iii) The omission of &#147;political
               opinion&#148; as a prohibited ground of
               discrimination from the Code did result
               in a &#147;distinction&#148; pursuant to s.15(1)
               of the Charter, but
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iv) The omission of  &#147;political
               opinion&#148; from s. 5 of the Code did not
               fail to provide an avenue of redress for
               prejudiced treatment of a specific
               group.  Accordingly, there was no
               violation of s.15(1) of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[20] When this appellant first sought leave to appeal to this
court, he did so on two issues: (1) does the word &#147;creed&#148; in s.
5(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code encompass &#147;political
opinion&#148;; and (2) if not, does the Code&#146;s omission of &#147;political
opinion&#148; from the prohibited grounds of discrimination violate s.
15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (&#147;Charter&#148;)?
[21]      On July 14, 1997, this court granted leave to appeal on
the first issue only.  On April 2, 1998 the Supreme Court of
Canada released its decision in the case of Vriend v. Alberta,
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 493.  In that case the Supreme Court concluded
that the non-inclusion of sexual orientation in the Alberta human
rights legislation infringed the right to equality under s.15 of
the Charter.  The Court also concluded that sexual orientation
should be read into that legislation.  Following a renewal of the
original application for leave, on June 17, 1998 this court
granted leave to appeal on the second issue.  Accordingly, the
issues now before this court are:

               1.  Does the prohibition against 
	  discrimination on the basis of &#147;creed&#148; 
	  contained in s.5(1) of the Code include 
	  discrimination on the basis of &#147;political
	  opinion?
               2.  If s.5(1) of the Code does not
          prohibit discrimination on the basis of
          &#147;political opinion&#148;, does this violate
          s.15(1) of the Charter and, if so, is such
          discrimination justified under s. 1 of the
          Charter?</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[22] I have replicated, almost verbatim, the history of these
proceedings as set out in the appellant&#146;s factum and without
reference to the position of the individual respondents.
Accordingly, I am considering this matter in a light most
favourable to the appellant.  Having done so, I conclude that
there is no evidence that any oblique motive that either of the
respondents Appelbaum and Latham might have had in writing the
two letters in question was ever brought to the attention of
those persons who were involved, at any level, in the decision-
making process.  Additionally, and to the limited extent that it
is relevant to a judicial review of the conduct of the decision
makers, I also conclude that there is no factual basis to support
the assertion that the conduct of the two respondents amounts to
discrimination in any sense that is prohibited under the rubric
of creed or indeed any other category of censorious conduct.
[23] As I understand it, the appellant, who describes himself as
a Muslim Arab, does not argue that he was unfairly labelled as
anti-Semitic, or at least anti-Israeli, because of his views on
the then current conflict in the middle east between the State of
Israel and its Arab neighbours.  To the contrary, counsel for the
appellant on the appeal steadfastly resisted any suggestion that
the motivation of the two letter writers was a response to the
writers&#146; perceptions as to the appellant&#146;s anti-Semitism or
racism.  He persisted in staking out the high ground that the
prohibited ground of discrimination was strictly political.  He
maintained that the respondent Appelbaum had written his letter
because he disagreed with the political thinking of the
appellant, and that the respondent Latham had written his letter
in support to make it appear that they both had professional
concerns and were not motivated by disagreement with the
appellant&#146;s political views.
[24] It is also noteworthy that during the course of the argument
before this court, while there was much said about whether the
two respondents were motivated as alleged, there was no
suggestion on the part of appellant&#146;s counsel that the mere fact
of holding differing political views from those of the appellant
was impermissible or reflected badly on the respondents or the
appellant.  It was said only that whatever the political views of
the two respondents on the particular issue, they should not have
played a part in the appellant&#146;s application for a full
professorship.
[25] A problem with the record in this case is that there did not
appear to be any basis to believe that the decision-makers in
this review process knew of the motivation of the respondents&#146;
Appelbaum and Latham.  There is nothing in the letters themselves
to indicate that the writers knew of, much less disagreed with,
the political views of the appellant.  The appellant seems to
think that his views were controversial and commanded some public
attention.  If this were the fact, and the findings of the
Commission seem to support that it was, at least within the
university community, the letters were irrelevant.  They did
nothing to inform or inflame whatever opinions individual
decision-makers might have had with respect to the appellant.
[26] The first response of appellant&#146;s counsel to this concern
was that it is not our function to determine whether the
appellant suffered from these perceived prejudices; this is a
matter for the Commission.  However, the Commission had an open
file on this complaint for more than six years and apparently
questioned numerous witnesses.  There is nothing to indicate that
if the matter was to be re-opened that the Commission could come
up with a more damaging finding than that &#147;the Senate committee
had been aware of the controversy engendered by these letters&#148;.
Given the fact that the appellant made a successful application
to the Senate to have the letters withdrawn, this finding is
hardly surprising.  At the end of the day, counsel for the
appellant was reduced to the complaint that the motivation for
the letter writing was relevant because it resulted in the only
negative letters in the appellant&#146;s file.  It is suggested that
had the respondents not been improperly motivated, the letters
would not have been sent, and therefore it is not necessary for
the appellant to show that the decision-makers were aware of,
much less influenced by, the conflicting political views of the
appellant and the respondent Appelbaum.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1:  Does the word &#147;creed&#148; in the Code include
discrimination on the basis of &#147;political opinion&#148;?</pre>
    <pre>[27] The Divisional Court found that it did not.  Corbett J. for
the court stated at p. 19:

                Even if it can be said that political opinion may
          constitute creed, there is no evidence that the applicant&#146;s views
          amount to a creed.   I am not prepared to find that the
          applicant&#146;s political views, no doubt shared by others in
          society, amount to a creed merely because the applicant is from
          Iraq.  On the facts in this case, the applicant&#146;s submission that
          political and religious commitments may be so aligned as to
          constitute &#147;creed&#148; is not established.  Whether a political
          perspective, such as communism, that is made up of a recognizable
          cohesive belief system or structure may constitute a &#147;creed&#148; is
          not at issue and is not being determined.
          </pre>
    <pre>              In my opinion, mere political opinion is
          not within the meaning of &#147;creed&#148; in s.1 of
          the Code. [Italics in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[28] I agree with this statement.  I think it a mistake to deal
with hypothetical scenarios.  Clearly, the personal opinion of
the appellant on this single issue of the relationship between
the Palestinians and Israel does not amount to a creed.  Whether
or not some other system of &#147;political opinion&#148; could amount to a
&#147;creed&#148; is not before the court.  It is a mistake to deal with
such important issues in the abstract.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2.  Does the failure of the Code to include political
opinion as a prohibited ground of discrimination violate s.15(1)
of the Charter, and if so, is such discrimination justified under
s.1 of the Charter?</pre>
    <pre>[29] Once again, I think that this issue must be analysed in the
context of the specific complaint of the appellant rather then on
some broad philosophical basis. Part of that context is that the
freedom to express a political opinion is already a fundamental
right under the Charter.  Section 2(b) provides inter alia for
&#147;freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression ...&#148;.  In
this regard, the Attorney General has also raised some serious
practical considerations arising out of the need to examine
whether the Human Rights Commission has sufficient staff and
resources to administer and enforce an expanded Code.</pre>
    <pre>[30] As I have already noted, the complaints before us were much
diminished in importance as the case proceeded through the
Commission and the courts. There is no longer any suggestion that
the appellant was stigmatised before his peers as an anti-Semite,
a racist, a bigot or by any other epithet.  In the last analysis,
the proposition put to us was that the fact of an objection to
the credentials of the appellant, when motivated by disagreement
with his political views, deprived the appellant of the right to
equal treatment without discrimination under s.5 of the Code. Put
another way, the fact that the respondent Applebaum disagreed
with the appellant&#146;s political views disqualified him from
criticising the appellant&#146;s credentials regardless of the merits
of the criticism.  It is difficult to accept that this case is an
argument for the remedy requested under s.15(1) of the Charter,
namely the declaration that &#147;political opinion&#148; is an analogous
ground of discrimination to those enumerated in s.5(1) of the
Code.
[31] Section 15(1) of the Charter has been the subject of two
recent cases in the Supreme Court of Canada.  In Law v. Canada
(Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] S.C.J. No. 12,
delivered March 25, 1999, Iacobucci J. for the Court reviewed the
case law relating to s.15(1) of the Charter and summarised and
commented upon the basic principles to be considered.  He said at
paragraph 88:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The approach adopted and regularly applied by
          this Court to the interpretation of s.15(1)
          focuses upon three central issues:</pre>
    <pre>
               (A)  whether a law imposes differential treatment between the
                  claimant and others, in purpose or effect;
               (B)  whether one or more enumerated or analogous grounds of
                  discrimination are the basis for the differential treatment; and
               (C)  whether the law in question has a purpose or effect that is
                  discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee.</pre>
    <pre>[32] This case does not require a complete s.15 analysis.  Nor is
it necessary to address broader issues of discrimination on the
basis of political opinion divorced from the facts of this case.
Accordingly, I think that if we concentrate on (C) above that it
will be sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal.  Under
(C), we are invited by Iacobucci J. to make the following broad
inquiry:

            C.  Does the differential treatment discriminate, by imposing a
          burden upon or withholding a benefit from the claimant in a
          manner which reflects the stereotypical application of presumed
          group or personal characteristics, or which otherwise has the
          effect of perpetrating or promoting the view that the individual
          is less capable or worthy of recognition or value as a human
          being or as a member of Canadian society, equally deserving of
          concern, respect and consideration.</pre>
    <pre>[33] Earlier in his reasons, Iacobucci J. had written of the
nature of the interest involved in this analysis.  He said at
para.74:
            [74]    A further contextual factor which may be relevant in
          appropriate cases in determining whether the claimant&#146;s dignity
          has been violated will be the nature and scope of the interest
          affected by the legislation.  This point was well explained by
          L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. in Egan, supra, at paras. 63-64.  As she noted,
          at para. 63, &#147;[i]f all other things are equal, the more severe
          and localized the &#133; consequences on the affected group, the more
          likely that the distinction responsible for these consequences is
          discriminatory within the meaning of s.15 of the Charter&#148;.
          L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. explained, at para. 64, that the discriminatory
          calibre of differential treatment cannot be fully appreciated
          without evaluating not only the economic but also the
          constitutional and societal significance attributed to the
          interest or interests adversely affected by the legislation in
          question.  Moreover, it is relevant to consider whether the
          distinction restricts access to a fundamental social institution,
          or affects &#147;a basic aspect of full membership in Canadian
          society&#148;, or &#147;constitute[s] a complete non-recognition of a
          particular group&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[34] Law v. Canada was a case in which the complainant argued
that she was denied the survivor benefits available to older
widows under the Canada Pension Plan and accordingly was the
subject of discrimination on the enumerated ground of age. In
applying his own analysis to the facts of the case, Iacobucci J.
said at paragraph 108:

            [108]    In these circumstances, recalling the purposes of
          s.15(1), I am at a loss to locate any violation of human dignity.
          The impugned distinctions in the present case do not stigmatize
          young persons, nor can they be said to perpetuate the view that
          surviving spouses under age 45 are less deserving of concern,
          respect or consideration than any others.  Nor do they withhold a
          government benefit on the basis of stereotypical assumptions
          about the demographic group of which the appellant happens to be
          a member.  I must conclude that, when considered in the social,
          political, and legal context of the claim, the age distinctions
          in ss.44(1)(d) and 58 of the CPP are not discriminatory.</pre>
    <pre>[35] While Law v. Canada dealt with a claim of discrimination
under an enumerated head, Iacobucci made clear that his analysis
of s.15 included analogous grounds of discrimination. Even more
recently, the Supreme Court of Canada delivered M. v. H., [1999]
S.C.J. No. 23, on May 20, 1999.  Here the Court applied s.15(1)
in the context of considering whether sexual orientation was an
analogous ground of discrimination to the enumerated ground of
sex.  In following the reasoning of Law, supra, Cory J. stated at
paragraphs 72 &#150; 75:

            [72]    A fourth contextual factor specifically adverted to by
          Iacobucci J. in Law, at para. 74, was the nature of the interest
          affected by the impugned legislation.  Drawing upon the reasons
          of L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. in Egan, supra, Iacobucci J. stated that the
          discriminatory calibre of differential treatment cannot be fully
          appreciated without considering whether the distinction in
          question restricts access to a fundamental social institution, or
          affects a basic aspect of full membership in Canadian society, or
          constitutes a complete non-recognition of a particular group.  In
          the present case, the interest protected by s.29 of the FLA is
          fundamental, namely the ability to meet basic financial needs
          following the breakdown of a relationship characterized by
          intimacy and economic dependence.  Members of same-sex couples
          are entirely ignored by the statute, notwithstanding the
          undeniable importance to them of the benefits accorded by the
          statute.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The societal significance of the benefit
          conferred by the statute cannot be
          overemphasized.  The exclusion of same-sex
          partners from the benefits of s.29 of the FLA
          promotes the view that M., and individuals in
          same-sex relationships generally, are less
          worthy of recognition and protection.  It
          implies that they are judged to be incapable
          of forming intimate relationships of economic
          interdependence as compared to opposite-sex
          couples, without regard to their actual
          circumstances.  As the intervener EGALE
          submitted, such exclusion perpetuates the
          disadvantages suffered by individuals in same-
          sex relationships and contributes to the
          erasure of their existence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Therefore I conclude that an examination of
          the four factors outlined above, in the
          context of the present appeal, indicate that
          the human dignity of individuals in same-sex
          relationships is violated by the impugned
          legislation.  In light of this, I conclude
          that the definition of spouse in s.29 of the
          FLA violates s.15(1).</pre>
    <pre>[36] In my view, the human dignity of the appellant in this case
was never engaged, much less violated.  There is nothing on the
record to suggest that his political beliefs disentitled him to
consideration for advancement in the Department of Economics,
that he was somehow less worthy for having those beliefs or that
he was a member of a group deserving of protection.
[37] As I read the reasons of Corbett J. in the Divisional Court,
she takes a similar view, that the facts of this case do not
warrant a declaration that the omission of &#147;political opinion&#148;
for s.5 of the Code contravenes s.15 of the Charter.  While her
analysis predates the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Law and M. v. H., supra, her findings are fully consistent with
their reasoning.  If anything, the summary of Iacobucci J. in Law
is supportive of the judgment in appeal.
[38] Accordingly, I can find no basis for interfering with the
judgment in appeal.  I would dismiss the appeal. I would
entertain written submissions from the respondents in appeal as
to costs.
[39] I cannot leave this case without stating that even if I was
of the view that there were errors in the judgment below with
respect to the alleged breach of the equality provisions
contained in s.15 of the Charter, I would not grant the appellant
the remedy of judicial review that he is seeking. I do not think
that this is the case to deal boldly with the addition of a new
ground of discrimination analogous to those enumerated in s.5(1)
of the Code.
[40] The court has always had the discretion to refuse to grant
prerogative writs such as certiorari and the Judicial Review
Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.J.1 preserves this discretion.
Sections 2(5) and (6) state:

               2(5)  Where, in any of the proceedings enumerated in
          subsection (1), the court had before the 17th day of April, 1972
          a discretion to refuse to grant relief on any grounds, the court
          has a like discretion on like grounds to refuse to grant any
          relief on an application for judicial review.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2(6)  Subsection (5) does not apply to
          the discretion of the court before the 17th
          day of April, 1972 to refuse to grant relief
          in any of the proceedings enumerated in
          subsection (1) on the ground that the relief
          should have been sought in other proceedings
          enumerated in subsection (1).</pre>
    <pre>[41] In  Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band (1995), 122
D.L.R. (4th) 129 (S.C.C.), Lamer C.J. said at p. 143:

            The respondents had the right to seek judicial review before
          the Federal Court, Trial Division.  That does not mean, however,
          that they have a right to require the court to undertake judicial
          review.  There is a long-standing general principle that the
          relief which a court may grant by way of judicial review is, in
          essence, discretionary.  This principle flows from the fact that
          the prerogative writs are extraordinary remedies.</pre>
    <pre>[42] In Blake, Administrative Law in Canada, 2d ed. (1997), the
author states at p.187:

            On judicial review there is no right to a remedy even if all
          the necessary criteria are met.  A court may choose not to grant
          a remedy to an applicant who is otherwise entitled.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  The reasons listed by the author for refusing to grant
certiorari include that the application is premature, an
alternate remedy is available, the errors were minor and the
remedy would have no practical effect.
[44] The reasons I would advance for not granting judicial review
in this case are closely related to the ground that the remedy
would have no practical effect.   On the facts of this case,
there is no reason to believe that the appellant would be
ultimately successful even if the Commission had jurisdiction
over political opinions. Further, the record in this case does
not provide a sufficient factual basis to permit the court to
extend the Code in a manner &#147;which flows with sufficient
precision from the requirements of the Constitution&#148;:  see
