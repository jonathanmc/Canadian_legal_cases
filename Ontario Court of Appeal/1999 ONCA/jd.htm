    <pre>HEARD:         July 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from  the order of disposition of  His  Honour  Judge
Cooper dated January 29, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this
case, we think that the Youth Court judge erred in principle in
requiring the appellant to serve a disposition of 8 months secure
custody to be followed by 2 years probation.
[2]  The appellant is a young offender who has no criminal or
youth court record.  It is accepted that he acted out of
character at the time of a somewhat vicious assault and the Youth
Court judge found that specific deterrence was not an operative
factor.
[3]  In the circumstances, we are all of the view that the Youth
Court judge placed too great an emphasis on the general
deterrence.  Although this was a serious assault which began with
what appears to be a consensual fight and, although we agree with
the Youth Court judge that a custodial sentence was required, we
do not think that a disposition of 8 months secure custody
represents a fit disposition.  In reaching this conclusion, we
have taken into account, among other things, the fresh evidence
as it relates to the appellant&#146;s somewhat immediate educational
prospects.
[4]  The majority of the court is of the view that the
disposition should be reduced to 2 months to be followed by 2
years probation on the terms set out by the Youth Court judge.
Weiler J.A., having regard to the severity of the assault and its
continuation once the victim was helpless, would allow the appeal
and reduce the sentence to 6 months.  She would set aside the
probation order.
[5]  In the result, leave is granted, the appeal is allowed, the
disposition is varied to 2 months secure custody to be followed
by 2 years probation on the terms set by the Youth Court judge.</pre></td>
