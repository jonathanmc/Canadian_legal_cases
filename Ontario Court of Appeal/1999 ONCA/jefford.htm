    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. ARTHUR JEFFORD (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ROSENBERG, MOLDAVER and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       John McInnes,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Riun Shandler,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 1, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Thompson J. with a jury, on February
26, 1997 and sentencing on April 17, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  With respect to the alleged violation of s. 13 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, defence counsel
expressly agreed that the appellant could be cross-examined on
the prior testimony. The trial judge was careful to limit the use
of any unadopted prior testimony to matters of credibility only.
We need not decide what use, if any, can be made of adopted prior
testimony as the matters that were adopted were insignificant in
the circumstances of this case and could not have prejudiced the
appellant.

[2]  We see no merit in any of the other grounds of appeal and,
accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.

[3]  As to sentence, while the sentence was at the highest end of
the range we have not been persuaded that there are any grounds
upon which we can interfere and accordingly, while leave to
appeal sentence is granted, the appeal from sentence is
dismissed.</pre></td>
