COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            JEWELCORP INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
               (Appellant/Plaintiff) &#150; and &#150; GAN GENERAL
               INSURANCE COMPANY (Respondent/ Defendant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, AUSTIN and BORINS JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Maurice Vaturi, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Ralph D&#146;Angelo, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 22, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of McCombs J. dated September 28, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  In the circumstances of this case, the motions judge, acting
as he was under rule 51.06(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
should not have held that the appellant was disentitled to relief
from forfeiture.
[2]  It is not at all clear on this record that the failure of
the appellant&#146;s driver to secure the lock, chain and padlock in
the interior of the trunk of the car amounted to non-compliance
with the terms of the policy as opposed to imperfect compliance.
The motions judge made no finding on this critical point which is
significant having regard to s.129 of the Insurance Act and the
relevant case law.
[3]  Additionally, the motions judge held that the conduct of the
driver in failing to activate all the locking devices was
unreasonable. In our view, this finding as to unreasonableness
was one that can only be made at trial.  This is a significant
error as demonstrated by the concession of the respondent on
appeal that the motions judge and this court were obliged to
proceed on the basis that the driver was to be believed and that
his explanation for failing to secure the lock is bona fide.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment below is
set aside.  The appellant is entitled to its costs here and
below.
