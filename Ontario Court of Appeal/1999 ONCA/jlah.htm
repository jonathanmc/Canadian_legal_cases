    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. J. L. A. H., a Young Offender (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, FINLAYSON and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Eric D. McCooeye,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Tina Yuen,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         August 19 and 20, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by His Honour Judge W. G. Mahaffy,
on June 11, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Of the several grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in
his factum, we need only deal with the three dealt with in oral
argument.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge found as a fact that while the officers
believed the appellant might somehow be involved in the arson,
they did not have reasonable grounds to believe he had committed
the offence.  Accordingly, the trial judge held that the added
protections in s. 56(2) of the Young Offenders Act R.S.C. 1985,
c. Y-1 did not apply.  This finding is reasonably supported by
the evidence and we see no basis for interfering with it.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We see no error by the trial judge in his appreciation of
the evidence concerning motive on the part of Mr. McNamara M. and
Mrs. ProulxP..  Both issues were appropriately addressed by the
trial judge in his reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge was conscious of the frailties in Richard R.
RaymoR.'s evidence, including all the prior inconsistent
statements, which were placed before him.  Again, we see no
reversible error in the treatment of that evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre></td>
