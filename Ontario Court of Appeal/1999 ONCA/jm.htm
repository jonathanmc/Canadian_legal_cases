    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The panel heard this matter on May 5, 1999.  During the
course of the argument, a question arose as to whether this
matter was properly before us.
[2]  The appellant was convicted by Caney J. in the Ontario Court
(Provincial Division) of assault and assault causing bodily harm.
He received a disposition of 12 months probation and 100 hours of
community service.  He then appealed to the Summary Conviction
Appeal Court and Tobias J. dismissed his appeal.  He now applies
for leave to appeal to this court and, in the event that leave is
granted, he appeals conviction and sentence.
[3]  During the course of the argument in this court, a question
arose as to whether the court had jurisdiction.  It appeared
that, on an examination of the record, the Crown may have
proceeded by indictment, in which case the appeal would have been
directly to this court as of right.  The court reserved its
decision in order to give counsel an opportunity to investigate
the matter further.  We have now been advised by counsel for the
appellant that this matter should have proceeded as an indictable
appeal.  The Crown joins with him in inviting the court to quash
the appeal.
[4]  No decision has been made on the merits of this appeal.  For
jurisdictional reasons, the appeal is quashed.</pre>
