    <pre>On appeal from the order of Cosgrove J. dated January 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Crown appeals from the order of Cosgrove J. wherein he
quashed an order of the youth court judge refusing to record the
accused&#146;s election to be tried by a youth court judge on two
charges of murder.  The issue arose because two young offenders
were jointly charged with two counts of second degree murder and
one elected to be tried by superior court judge and jury while
the respondent elected trial by youth court judge. Cosgrove J.
held that the youth court judge lacked jurisdiction to refuse to
record the  election.
[2]  We agree with his conclusion that the Young Offenders Act,
in its current form, does not provide for any discretion in the
youth court judge to refuse to record an election of the accused
under s. 19(4) as to his mode of trial for murder.  The accused&#146;s
right to be tried by a youth court judge has not been abrogated
by the additional right to elect trial by jury.  The election is
that of the accused youth.  In our view, s. 567 of the Criminal
Code is inconsistent with the Young Offenders Act in that regard
and therefore is not made applicable by s. 51 of the Act.1
[3]  The Crown&#146;s concern in this matter is that the conflicting
elections lead to the effective severance of co-accused.  That
issue seems to be addressed by the proposed new legislation
where, in the case of conflicting elections by co-accused over 14
years old charged with murder, the youth court judge may override
the election of trial by youth court judge.
[4]  Furthermore, as was pointed out by counsel, the issue of
severance already exists where an adult and a youth are charged
in connection with the same incident, but must be tried
separately, one in youth court and the other in adult court.  In
fact, the court was advised that an adult has been charged in
connection with these murders and is already being tried
separately from the two young offenders.  Therefore, the issue of
severance is one that already exists as a result of the separate
regime for young offenders.  It is not new with the advent of the
right of a young offender to elect trial by judge and jury on a
charge of murder pursuant to s. 19(4) of the Young Offenders Act.
The existence of the severance issue does not compel an
interpretation of the Act which would involve reading in a power
in the youth court judge which is not provided.
[5]  Cosgrove J. noted that Part XIX of the Criminal Code (trial
without a jury) has no application to the offence of murder.
While this is true in the majority of cases, there may be
situations where some sections in Part XIX may have application
for offences under s. 469, including murder, specifically, where
there has been an election for trial by judge alone with the
consent of the Crown under s. 473 of the Code.  In our view, this
observation does not affect the relevant analysis nor the result.
[6]  The appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre>

_______________________________
1 We note that Bill C-68, the Youth Criminal Justice Act (which
would repeal and replace the Young Offenders Act) specifically
deals with the issue before this court.  Section 67(2) of Bill C-
68 accords to the youth court judge in the event of co-accused
over 14 years old at the time of commission of the offence, who
elect different modes of trial for certain offences, including
murder, the authority to decline to record an election of trial
by youth court judge.  Furthermore, under s. 67(3), the Attorney
General may override the election of an accused youth to be tried
by a youth court judge for such offences.  Bill C-68 received 1st
reading in Parliament on March 11, 1999 and is presently
undergoing 2nd reading.</pre></td>
