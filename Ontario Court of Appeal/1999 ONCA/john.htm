COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. BRADLEY
               THEODORE JOHN (Appellant)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        OSBORNE, ABELLA and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Lorne Sabsay
               For the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Lisa Futerman
               For the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         January 19, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for</pre>
    <pre>the offence of conspiracy to smuggle contraband liquor and</pre>
    <pre>cigarettes into Canada. He appeals against that sentence and</pre>
    <pre>seeks to convert it to a conditional sentence.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge found that the appellant’s role in the</pre>
    <pre>conspiracy was a relatively minor one for which he gained little</pre>
    <pre>profit. He also found that as a first offender with an</pre>
    <pre>unblemished background and history, the appellant posed no danger</pre>
    <pre>to the safety of the community and that individual deterrence was</pre>
    <pre>not required.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Having regard to the magnitude of the smuggling operation</pre>
    <pre>and its impact on the community at large, the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>concluded, correctly in our view, that the principle of general</pre>
    <pre>deterrence took precedence over the other recognized principles</pre>
    <pre>of sentencing and that despite the appellant’s exemplary</pre>
    <pre>background and degree of complicity, a custodial sentence was</pre>
    <pre>called for.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge then considered and rejected the appellant’s</pre>
    <pre>request for a conditional sentence. Relying on this court’s</pre>
    <pre>decision in R. v. Pierce (1977), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 23, he found</pre>
    <pre>that even though the appellant posed no risk to the community, a</pre>
    <pre>conditional sentence was not appropriate because “[this] would</pre>
    <pre>deliver entirely the wrong message and would undermine the</pre>
    <pre>necessary objective of general deterrence.”

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Unfortunately, at the time of sentencing, the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>did not have the benefit of this court’s subsequent decision in</pre>
    <pre>R. v. Wismayer (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 18 in which Rosenberg</pre>
    <pre>J.A., on behalf of the court, engaged in a detailed analysis of</pre>
    <pre>the principle of general deterrence and its application to the</pre>
    <pre>conditional sentencing regime.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Apposite to this case, at p. 38, Rosenberg J.A. rejected the</pre>
    <pre>notion that conditional sentences should never or even rarely be</pre>
    <pre>available in cases of large scale well-planned frauds committed</pre>
    <pre>by persons in positions of trust. Rather, in his opinion each</pre>
    <pre>case fell to be determined on its own merits. At p. 39, Rosenberg</pre>
    <pre>J.A. referred specifically to R. v. Pierce as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               I do not read R. v. Pierce as laying
          down an inflexible rule that a conditional
          sentence should never or rarely be imposed in
          fraud cases involving a breach of trust or
          that the community can only be safeguarded in
          such cases by incarcerating the offender. In
          my view, general deterrence is neither
          inconsistent with a conditional sentence
          order nor is it a basis for reserving the
          conditional sentence for rare or exceptional
          cases. To the contrary, the objective of
          general deterrence can be achieved through
          the conditional sentence of imprisonment.
          
</pre>
    <pre>          

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In light of Wismayer, we are of the view that in refusing to</pre>
    <pre>impose a conditional sentence, the trial judge erred in principle</pre>
    <pre>by placing undue emphasis on the principle of general deterrence.</pre>
    <pre>Had Wismayer been available to him, we believe that the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge would have taken a more benign approach to the issue of</pre>
    <pre>whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, a</pre>
    <pre>conditional sentence would adequately achieve the objectives of</pre>
    <pre>general deterrence.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In view of this error in principle, deference need not be</pre>
    <pre>shown to the sentence imposed and we are free to substitute a fit</pre>
    <pre>sentence.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In all of the circumstances, we are satisfied that this is</pre>
    <pre>an appropriate case for a conditional sentence. The appellant was</pre>
    <pre>a first offender with an unblemished background and history. His</pre>
    <pre>role in the conspiracy was a relatively minor one and he gained</pre>
    <pre>little profit from it. He chose to become involved at a time when</pre>
    <pre>he was out of work and unable to support his family. Following</pre>
    <pre>his apprehension, he obtained gainful employment and he is</pre>
    <pre>described as a valued, trustworthy and conscientious employee.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant is a devoted husband and caring father. As</pre>
    <pre>well, he has, for many years, actively engaged in charitable and</pre>
    <pre>volunteer work on behalf of his native community. He is genuinely</pre>
    <pre>remorseful and, as the record reveals, he would have entered a</pre>
    <pre>plea of guilty at an early opportunity had the Crown been willing</pre>
    <pre>to withdraw the charges against his spouse and not proceed</pre>
    <pre>against him on the breach of trust charge. Significantly, both of</pre>
    <pre>these matters resulted in directed verdicts at trial.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] In short, apart from his involvement in the conspiracy, the</pre>
    <pre>appellant is an otherwise decent, law-abiding, productive citizen</pre>
    <pre>who poses no risk to the community.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] For these reasons, we are satisfied that the appellant is</pre>
    <pre>entitled to a conditional sentence. Accordingly, leave to appeal</pre>
    <pre>sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is</pre>
    <pre>varied to an 18-month conditional sentence upon terms and</pre>
    <pre>conditions agreed upon by the parties and approved by the court.</pre></td>
