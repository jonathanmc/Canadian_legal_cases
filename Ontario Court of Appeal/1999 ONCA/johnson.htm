</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice H. R. Locke, sitting
with a jury, on April 23, 1998 and the sentence imposed on May 6,
1998</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of robbery, following a trial by
judge and jury.  Identity was the sole issue at trial.
[2]  One witness was unable to identify the appellant, either in
the photo line-up or at trial.  The other three witnesses, with
varying degrees of certainty, picked the appellant's photo out of
the photo line-up and identified the appellant at trial.  The
defence called no evidence.
[3]  The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
adequately instruct the jury on the specific weaknesses in the
witnesses' identification evidence.  The trial judge adequately
instructed the jury generally as to the inherent frailties in
identification evidence and the need to approach such evidence
with great caution and care.  However, the trial judge did not
highlight for the jury the specific weaknesses in the
identification evidence.
[4]  However, this was a short trial in which there was only one
issue.  The address of defence counsel, which focused on the
inconsistencies and weaknesses of the identification evidence,
was given on the same day as the charge to the jury.
[5]  Moreover, in his charge, the trial judge reviewed the
position of both Crown and defence counsel, specifically
referring to some of the alleged weaknesses in the identification
evidence.  A further review by the trial judge was not necessary.
[6]  The appellant also submits that the trial judge did not
fairly put the position of the defence to the jury.  Although the
initial comments by the trial judge on the theory of the defence
were confusing, we are satisfied that overall the trial judge
adequately reviewed the position of the defence on the single
issue in the case and on the evidence relevant at trial.
[7]  Finally, the appellant submits that the verdict was
unreasonable.  We disagree.  In our view, there was sufficient
identification evidence to permit the jury to find that the
appellant was the shorter man involved in the robbery.  That
finding was reasonable on the basis of the evidence.
[8]  The appeal is dismissed.
