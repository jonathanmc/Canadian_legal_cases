COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and MARCEL
               JOLY (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        MORDEN, DOHERTY and ABELLA JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       David Tanovich, for the appellant
               Michael Bernstein, for the respondent
                            </pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 21, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on November 15, 1994,
imposed by Soubliere J. sitting with a jury and from the
sentence imposed by Soubliere J. on December 5, 1994.
</pre>
    <pre>                  ENDORSEMENT
                            </pre>
    <pre>[1]  Three grounds of appeal from the appellant&#146;s
conviction of second degree murder were argued before
us:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  the trial judge erred in not leaving
     manslaughter for the consideration of the jury;
     </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  the trial judge erred in not excluding
     evidence obtained by the police from the
                    appellant&#146;s
     apartment; and</pre>
    <pre>          (3)  the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury
     was inadequate and unfair respecting the
     defence position.
     </pre>
    <pre>[2]  In addition, the appellant appeals from the
trial judge&#146;s order of a non-eligibility for parole
period of 20 years on his sentence of imprisonment
for life.
[3]  We did not call upon counsel for the
respondent to respond to any of the grounds of
appeal from conviction, but we did receive
submissions from him respecting the sentence
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     THE APPEAL FROM CONVICTION</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The decision not to leave manslaughter for the
consideration of the jury</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The bases upon which the appellant submitted that the
included offence of manslaughter should have been
left with the jury are intoxication and rage. We are
not persuaded that the trial judge erred in not
leaving manslaughter with the jury on either of these
bases or on the basis of their cumulative effect. [5]
On the record before the trial judge, there was no
evidence of anything more than that the appellant had
ingested some alcohol at or around the time of the
offence. While there was evidence on the effect of
that consumption some four hours before the killing,
there was precious little evidence on the effect, if
any, at the time of the killing. The trial judge was
not wrong in not leaving intoxication with the jury,
especially where, when the matter was specifically
addressed before the charge, defence counsel made no
submissions that it should be left. Further, he
raised no complaint after the charge. The appellant
did not testify.
[6]  We accept, of course, that the trial judge is
required to charge a jury on all defences supported
by the evidence whether or not this is requested by
counsel. However, before a trial judge is required to
charge a jury on a defence, there must be sufficient
evidence to allow a reasonable jury properly
instructed to acquit. The trial judge&#146;s view of the
evidential record, taken together with counsel&#146;s
position before him with respect to it, justified his
conclusion that the requisite standard had not been
met.
[7]  The appellant referred to the evidence of the
911 call of Elia Saade as being cogent evidence of
intoxication. It was not evidence of the truth of its
contents before the court and no attempt was made at
the trial to have the witness adopt its truth.
[8]  With respect to the appellant&#146;s anger, there was
evidence that he had been angry five hours before the
offence, that he was heard to swear once near the
time of the offence, and that some slash marks had
been made in a door in his apartment There was no
evidence on who made these marks or when they were
made although one officer said they appeared to be
&#147;recent&#148;. This was insufficient evidence to give an
air of reality to the contention that the alternative
verdict of manslaughter was available, especially in
light of the position of the defence that the
prosecution had the wrong man.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   The decision not to exclude evidence obtained
by the police
          from the appellant&#146;s apartment</pre>
    <pre>[9]  On this appeal, the appellant has challenged four
events as showing violations of s. 8 of the Charter:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  the police knock on the door of the
     appellant&#146;s apartment;
     </pre>
    <pre>      (2)  the subsequent entry into the apartment;
                            </pre>
    <pre>          (3)  the appellant&#146;s arrest; and</pre>
    <pre>    (4)  the walk through the apartment and the brief
 examination of material in a tub immediately after the
     arrest.</pre>
    <pre>[10] We observe that neither of events (1) or (2) were
raised as issues by the appellant before the trial judge.
The first issue
which the trial judge did address in his reasons on
the voir dire was the lawfulness of the appellant&#146;s
arrest &#150; i.e., whether or not Officer Hayes had
reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him.
[11] We do not think that it is properly open to the
appellant to treat as issues before this court
matters which were not raised at trial. The appellant
submits that there was evidence adduced on the voir
dire which would enable these issues to be now
addressed. With respect, if these matters had been
raised as issues at the trial, it may well have been
that the Crown could have adduced ample evidence
which would have completely answered them. The
appellant was required to establish the breaches of
s. 8. His counsel expressly identified the nature of
the breaches alleged. They were directed to specific
events and shaped the conduct of the subsequent voir
dire. In our view, it would be inappropriate, in
these circumstances, to consider arguments which were
not advanced at trial.
[12] We would add that, on the record, we would not
be prepared to find that the police violated s. 8
when they knocked on the door or when they initially
entered the apartment and made their observations
from the foyer inside the door. The evidence flowing
from these events was not tainted and, accordingly,
the
subsequent arrest of the appellant was based on
untainted reasonable and probable grounds. It
followed that the search incidental to the arrest was
lawful as was the issuance of the search warrant.
[13] Although there may have been a technical breach
in the execution of the search warrant, the appellant
places no reliance on it and, in any event, the
evidence obtained in the course of this search is
properly admissible under s. 24(2) of the Charter, as
the trial judge held.</pre>
    <pre>     3.   The adequacy and fairness of the trial
     judge&#146;s charge respecting the defence
     </pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submitted, in particular, that the
trial judge should not have referred to the &#147;other
suspect&#148; evidence (the &#147;other suspect&#148; being Diane
Poulin) as being &#147;problematic&#148; and &#147;tenuous&#148; and that
he should have instructed the jury respecting the
reliability of the evidence of Diane Joly and
Constable Burns.
[15] We are satisfied that the trial judge did not
err in either of these respects. In his instructions
he reviewed the available evidence implicating Diane
Poulin and he made it clear to the jury that the
defence position was that Diane Poulin was the more
likely attacker. The trial judge was entitled to
comment on the evidence as he did and he made it
clear to the jury that they were the sole judges of
the facts.
[16] Similarly, the trial judge pointed out to the
jury the defence position that the evidence of Diane
Joly was &#147;unlikely&#148; and &#147;unreliable&#148;. Further, the
trial judge did not err in failing to address
specifically the reliability of Constable Burns&#146;
evidence. Defence counsel made it clear to the jury
that the knives found in the apartment all bore the
inscription &#147;Taiwan&#148; on the back and that the knife
recovered from the scene of the homicide did not. No
objection was taken to the trial judge&#146;s treatment of
the evidence of Diane Joly or Sergeant Burns.</pre>
    <pre>     THE SENTENCE APPEAL
[17] The jury made the following recommendation with
respect to the appellant&#146;s parole ineligibility
period: 10 jurors recommended the minimum 10 years
for parole; 1 juror made no recommendation; and 1
juror recommended 24 years.
[18] The trial judge held that an increase in parole
ineligibility was warranted by reason of the
appellant&#146;s criminal record and in particular his
1980 conviction for rape.
[19] It appears to us that the twenty-year period of
parole ineligibility is outside the range of periods
of parole ineligibility ordered in similar cases. We
agree with the appellant&#146;s submission that the trial
judge erred in principle in giving undue emphasis to
the appellant&#146;s criminal record, especially his
conviction for sexual assault in 1980. This requires
our intervention.
[20] This was a brutal murder and the appellant&#146;s
criminal record is serious and shows a disturbing
level of violence, although he had no convictions in
the four years prior to this offence. In our opinion,
a fit period of ineligibility would be 15 years.</pre>
    <pre>     DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave
to appeal sentence is granted, and the appeal is
allowed to the extent of varying the period of non-
eligibility for parole to 15 years.
