    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  application to reopen  an  inmate  in-writing
appeal.   On  January 22, 1997, the applicant  was  convicted  of
perjury.   He  filed  an  inmate notice of  appeal  against  that
conviction  and indicated that he wished his appeal to  be  dealt
with  &#147;in  writing&#148;.  At the request of the court, the Crown  was
asked  to  make written submissions with respect to  the  appeal.
Those  submissions  were filed with the court  and  sent  to  the
applicant,  inviting  him  to make further  written  submissions.
When  no further submissions were received, the appeal was  dealt
with in writing and dismissed by a panel of the court.
[2]  Due to an oversight, it was not brought to the attention of
the panel considering the in-writing appeal that Mr. Goddard had
been in touch with staff in the Court of Appeal office.  Mr.
Goddard is the Director of the Queen&#146;s Correctional Law Project.
The Project had agreed to assist the applicant with his written
submissions and had been assured that the applicant&#146;s appeal
would not be processed until those submissions had been received
by the Court.  When Mr. Goddard learned that the applicant&#146;s
appeal had been dismissed, he promptly completed the submissions,
forwarded them to the Court, and drew the Court&#146;s attention to
the oversight.  He now applies on behalf of the applicant to re-
open the appeal.  Mr. Trotter, on behalf of the respondent,
submits that this court has no power to re-open the appeal and
that in any event the matter is academic since even if the
applicant&#146;s written submissions had been considered by the court
they would not have changed the result.
[3]  This appeal must be re-opened in the interests of justice.
In our view, the holding in R. v. H. (E.F.), R. v. Rhingo (1997),
115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.) has no application.  In that case,
Charron J.A. held that the well-recognized inherent or ancillary
jurisdiction of a court, including an appellate court, to control
its own process does not extend to re-opening an appeal that has
been heard on its merits.  As she said at p. 101:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The power to reopen proceedings in the exercise of the
          court's ancillary or inherent jurisdiction to control its own
          process cannot, in my view, extend to cases where the appeal has
          been heard on the merits. Once the appeal has been heard on its
          merits and finally disposed of by the issuance of an order, the
          statutory right of appeal has been exhausted. Any subsequent
          reopening of the same proceeding would involve the creation of
          further substantive or procedural rights, which only Parliament
          can enact.
          </pre>
    <pre>                There  are sound policy reasons for  so
          limiting  the  power  to reopen  appeals.  An
          unlimited  discretion to reopen appeals  that
          have  been heard on their merits is not  only
          unjustifiable as an ancillary  power  of  the
          court,  but would do significant harm to  the
          criminal  justice  system.  Finality  is   an
          important  goal  of  the  criminal   process.
          Statutory   rights   of  appeal   provide   a
          carefully  crafted exception to  the  general
          rule  that  trial  decisions  are  final.  By
          providing broad rights of appellate review in
          criminal matters, Parliament recognizes  that
          fairness  and justice interests require  that
          the  accused  have  a  full  opportunity   to
          challenge  a  conviction  even  though   that
          opportunity  will prolong the  process.  Once
          those   broad  appellate  rights  have   been
          exercised  and  the  merits  of  the   appeal
          decided,  then absent an appeal to  a  higher
          court,    finality   concerns   must   become
          paramount.  Those  affected  by  the  process
          should  be  entitled to rely on the appellate
          decision  and conduct themselves accordingly.
          The  appellate process cannot become or  even
          appear  to  become a never closing  revolving
          door  through which appellants  come  and  go
          whenever  they propose to argue a new  ground
          of appeal.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Due  to  the oversight, this appeal was not  heard  on  the
merits  as the court did not receive the applicant&#146;s submissions.
This  is  not  a  case  where an appellant  seeks  to  raise  new
substantive arguments.  Rather, this applicant seeks  to  present
his substantive arguments for the first time.  He did not, in the
words  of Charron J.A., have a full opportunity to challenge  his
conviction.
[5]  In our view, it is no answer that those submissions might
not have changed the result.  The applicant was entitled to
procedural fairness in the processing of his in-writing appeal.
Due to the oversight, that did not occur.  We recognize that
merely because there has been this kind of an oversight, the
appellant will not always be entitled to have the appeal re-
opened.  However, in this case, Mr. Goddard moved promptly on
behalf of the applicant when he learned of the error and, in the
circumstances, this is a proper case to exercise our discretion
in favour of re-opening.
[6]  Accordingly, the application is allowed and the appeal
restored to the list of pending appeals.  This application was
heard in Kingston and Mr. Jonas was present for the hearing.  He
stated that he wished to be present when the appeal is heard on
the merits.  Accordingly, this appeal is converted to an in-
person appeal and adjourned to November 24, 1999 for hearing.
The written submissions of the appellant and the respondent are
to be placed before the panel hearing the appeal.
