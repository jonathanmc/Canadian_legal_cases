    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking and conspiracy to import cocaine for which
he received concurrent sentences of five years’ imprisonment. He
appeals from conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>     CONVICTION</pre>
    <pre>          The Section 10(b) Issue</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This issue concerns the admissibility of two statements (the
third and fourth statements) made by the appellant to the police
after he had been informed of his right to counsel and had spoken
to duty counsel.

[3]  The appellant submits that because the police did not afford
him complete privacy in his conversation with duty counsel, the
requirements of s. 10(b) were not met and the police should have
refrained from questioning him further until he had either spoken
to counsel in private or waived his s. 10(b) rights.

[4]  The trial judge disagreed. In his view, the impugned
statements were voluntary and they were “made after meaningful
compliance with [the appellant’s] request to speak to counsel.”
Accordingly, he found that the lack of privacy did not give rise
to a breach of the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights.

[5]  With respect, we do not share the trial judge’s conclusion
in this regard. In oral argument, counsel for the respondent
fairly conceded that the lack of privacy did result in a
violation of the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights and that the
admissibility of the impugned statements fell to be determined
under s. 24(2) of the Charter. We agree.

[6]  In the unique circumstances of this case, we are satisfied
that the use of the statements did not render the appellant’s
trial unfair. Unlike the situation in certain cases to which we
were referred, in this case there is no evidence from which it
can reasonably be inferred that the appellant would have acted
differently had he been permitted to speak to duty counsel in
private. To the contrary, there is positive evidence supporting
the opposite inference.

[7]  It is not disputed that the appellant spoke to duty counsel
before making the third and fourth statements. At no time before,
during or after the conversation did he express any concern to
the police about a lack of privacy. Nor, it would seem, did he
raise the matter with duty counsel. The appellant did not testify
on the voir dire. Accordingly, there is nothing to indicate that
he felt the least bit constrained in his conversation with duty
counsel, nor is there anything to suggest that he did not receive
full and meaningful legal advice.

[8]  In these circumstances, we are of the view that the Crown
has met its onus of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities,
that the appellant would not have acted differently had he been
able to speak to duty counsel in private. Accordingly, the
admission of the statements did not render his trial unfair.

[9]  With respect to the seriousness of the breach, in our view,
the breach was not serious. For reasons already mentioned, the
breach had no apparent impact on the appellant’s ability to
obtain meaningful legal advice. Moreover, the police were acting
in good faith. For security reasons, they could not permit the
appellant to place the call in private. Nonetheless, they
considered it important that he be given the opportunity to speak
to duty counsel and they took steps to accomplish this. During
the call itself, the surveillance officer kept his distance and
although he could overhear the appellant, he paid no attention to
what the appellant was saying and did not listen to the
conversation.

[10] Had the appellant raised the slightest concern about privacy
to the police, this case would have taken on a different aura. As
it is, he did not and the police had no reason to believe that he
felt constrained by their presence or that his ability to obtain
meaningful legal advice was in any way compromised.

[11] Turning to the final factor under s. 24(2), namely, the
effect of exclusion on the administration of justice, the charges
against the appellant were very serious and the admissions made
by him, particularly those in the police cruiser, were of
considerable importance to the prosecution. They served to rebut
the appellant’s evidence at trial that he was an unwitting
recipient of the UPS package and that he had no knowledge of its
contents. Accordingly, we believe that the exclusion of the
statements would do more harm to the repute of the administration
of justice than would their admission.

[12] It follows that the statements were properly received into
evidence. In coming to this conclusion, we have not ignored the
initial s. 10(b) violations which led to the exclusion of the
first and second statements made by the appellant to the police.
In our view, the intervening call to duty counsel eliminated any
residual taint that might otherwise have spilled over and
contaminated the statements  in question.</pre>
    <pre>          The Section 8 Issue</pre>
    <pre>[13] This issue concerns the admissibility of the cocaine which
the police located in the appellant’s bedroom. The appellant
submits that the police violated his privacy rights under s. 8 of
the Charter when they entered his apartment and searched his
bedroom without a warrant. He further submits that the breaches
were serious and flagrant and should have resulted in the
exclusion of the cocaine from evidence under s. 24(2).

[14] The trial judge refused to give effect to these arguments.
In his view, the police did not violate the appellant’s s. 8
rights when they entered his apartment because, at the time of
entry, exigent circumstances existed and a search warrant for the
apartment had already been issued. Accordingly, even though the
police did not have physical possession of the warrant, it could
not be said that they engaged in a warrantless entry or search of
his premises. To the contrary, both the entry and search of the
bedroom were, in his opinion, lawful.

[15] The trial judge went on to consider the question of
admissibility under s. 24(2) on the assumption that the
appellant’s s. 8 rights had been violated. In this respect, he
found that the admission of the cocaine would not render the
appellant’s trial unfair because it was non-conscriptive evidence
and its discovery was inevitable. With respect to the gravity of
the violation, even though the trial judge considered a
warrantless entry to be serious, he was satisfied that the police
were acting in good faith and in his opinion they “behaved
properly throughout.”  In this regard, the trial judge placed
considerable emphasis on the fact that the entry occurred after
the search warrant had been issued and in circumstances of
extreme urgency. Finally, given the serious nature of the charges
and the fact that the cocaine was essential to the prosecution’s
case, the trial judge found that its exclusion “would do
significant damage to the image of the administration of
justice.”

[16] Accordingly, the trial judge was of the view that even if
the police did breach the appellant’s s. 8 rights, the cocaine
was properly admissible under s. 24(2).

[17] To resolve this aspect of the appeal, we find it unnecessary
to decide whether the trial judge was correct in concluding that
there was no violation of the appellant’s s. 8 rights. Instead,
we prefer to consider the question of admissibility under
s. 24(2) on the assumption that the appellant’s s. 8 rights were
infringed.

[18] In this respect, the first and third of the Collins’ factors
present no problem. We agree entirely with the trial judge’s
analysis of them. The only issue of concern is the gravity of the
assumed breaches.

[19] The record indicates that once the police gained entry into
the appellant’s premises, the appellant was detained and he was
asked to disclose the whereabouts of the package containing the
cocaine before being given his s. 10(b) rights. The appellant
responded by saying that he had not received any such package but
after being told that he had been observed with it, he advised
the police that it was in a drawer in the closet of the master
bedroom. The police then went to the bedroom closet where they
discovered the package, in plain view, in an open dresser drawer.
The package was initialled but not seized until the search
warrant arrived shortly thereafter.

[20] From this, the appellant submits that prior to the arrival
of the warrant, the police violated his s. 8 rights on two
occasions, first when they entered his apartment without a
warrant and thereafter, when they conducted a warrantless search
of his bedroom. He further submits that these breaches were
aggravated by the s. 10(b) breach which resulted in the appellant
disclosing the whereabouts of the cocaine. In the submission of
the appellant, the breaches were serious and flagrant and they
disclosed a pattern of impermissible conduct on the part of the
police which called for the exclusion of the cocaine under s.
24(2).

[21] With respect, we disagree with the appellant’s analysis.

[22] Commencing with the s. 10(b) violation, the trial judge
excluded the appellant’s statement in which he disclosed the
whereabouts of the cocaine. In our view, this was the appropriate
remedy and no additional sanction was called for.

[23] With respect to the s. 8 violation occasioned by the
warrantless entry into the appellant’s apartment, there can be no
doubt that due to unforeseen circumstances the police were
required to act quickly to secure the premises and preserve vital
evidence. At the time of entry, the police had reasonable grounds
to believe that a serious crime had been committed and that
crucial evidence would be found in the appellant’s apartment.
Indeed, they had already obtained a search warrant for the
appellant’s apartment and, but for the onset of unexpected
circumstances, they would have awaited its arrival before
entering the premises.

[24] All of this attests to the utmost good faith on the part of
the police and, in our view, this is one of those rare instances
where the police were fully justified in entering the appellant’s
premises without a warrant for the purpose of securing it and
preserving vital evidence.

[25] The second s. 8 breach occasioned by the search of the
appellant’s bedroom was, in our view, inconsequential in the
overall scheme of things. The police were obviously concerned
about securing the package which contained the cocaine and it was
important to them to know what the appellant had done with it.
Even if they had not learned of its whereabouts from the
appellant, they would inevitably have discovered the package in
the course of securing the apartment. As part of that exercise,
the police were entitled to enter the appellant’s bedroom,
including the closet area, to determine if others were present.
This, in turn, would have led to the discovery of the package
containing the cocaine, being as it was in plain view in an open
dresser drawer.

[26] It follows, in our opinion, that the second of the two s. 8
breaches was minor in nature and it did not justify the exclusion
of the cocaine from evidence, either standing alone or in
conjunction with the other breaches.

[27] Accordingly, we have not been persuaded that the trial judge
erred in ruling that the evidence of the cocaine was properly
admissible under s. 24(2).

[28] In the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[29] The appellant was convicted of two serious drug offences. He
was found in possession of a substantial quantity of high grade
cocaine and his motivation was commercial gain. In all of the
circumstances, a substantial penitentiary sentence was called for
and, in our view, the period of five years’ imprisonment imposed
by the trial judge was entirely fit.

[30] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
