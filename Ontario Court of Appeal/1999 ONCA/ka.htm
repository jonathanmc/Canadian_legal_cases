    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice Robert M. Thompson
on April 9, 1997, and the sentence imposed on June 30, 1997</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence for
various sexual offences committed against three complainants
during two separate time periods.  One set of allegations
involves T.H. and relates to events between 1976 and 1982.
T.H.&#146;s sister, M.H., gave similar fact evidence in relation to
those events.  The other set of allegations relates to two
complainants, C.F. and J.W., and relates to events between 1992
and 1994.  The appellant was convicted by Thompson J. of sexual
assault of C.F. and J.W. and indecent assault of T.H.1  Thompson
J. sentenced the appellant to forty months' imprisonment
concurrent on each count.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
          </pre>
    <pre>          The complainant T.H. (1975 &#150; 1983)
          
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The earliest set of charges concerns T.H.  She was 26 years
of age when she testified to events that occurred when she was
between 7 and 12 years of age.  She was born in 1970.  The
appellant was a half-brother to T.H.&#146;s mother and T.H. therefore
considered the appellant to be her uncle.  T.H. and her older
sister M.H. were frequent visitors at the appellant&#146;s home from
1975 to 1983.  According to T.H., M.H., and their mother, this
contact ceased abruptly in the summer of 1983 when, in the
presence of T.H., M.H. complained to her mother about
inappropriate behaviour by the appellant when she had slept over
at the appellant&#146;s home.  T.H. also said that the appellant made
her feel uncomfortable.  She did not disclose that the appellant
had touched her in a sexual way.  No complaint was made to the
authorities then.
[3]  In 1992, when she was living in British Columbia, T.H.
complained to the police about child sexual abuse perpetrated
upon her by the appellant and two others.  At the time, she was
undergoing counselling.  She did not want to lay charges against
the appellant.  In 1995, she was approached by the police after
the allegations by the other two complainants came to light.  The
police asked her if she would be a witness for a case involving
two other girls who were making allegations against the appellant
that were similar to hers.  T.H. agreed and the charges were
laid.
[4]  T.H. testified that when she was 7 or 8 years of age and
visiting the appellant&#146;s home, he would play a &#147;Dracula&#148; game
with her and her sister.  The game involved the appellant licking
and biting the necks of the two young girls.  This &#147;game&#148;
continued until the complainant was 12 or 13 years old.  The
complaint of sexual assault related to an event when the
complainant was sleeping over at the appellant&#146;s house.  She
testified that she went downstairs and found the appellant
watching television with the lights out.  She lay beside the
appellant at his invitation.  The appellant then put his hand
underneath the back of her pajama top, rubbed her back and put
his hand to the front of her top and rubbed her stomach and
breasts.  He then put his hand down her pants and touched her
vaginal area.  She could not recall whether the appellant said
anything at the time, nor how long the incident lasted.
[5]  The complainant&#146;s older sister testified to a similar event
when she slept over at the appellant&#146;s house.  She testified that
while she was in the basement of the appellant&#146;s home with him,
he pulled her on top of him, placing her back against him.  She
knew the touching was inappropriate and she was scared.  The
appellant let her go and she ran out of the house.  She returned
later and went to bed.  The appellant drove her home the next
morning and, as indicated above, she told her mother that the
appellant had touched her inappropriately, and that she did not
want to go to the appellant&#146;s home any more.
[6]  The complainant gave evidence of one further event that
happened when she slept over in the spare room.  She awoke to
find the appellant lifting her out of the bed.  He told her he
was taking her to his room.  She said that she did not want to
go, but he took her anyway.  He placed her in his bed and she
moved to the edge of the bed.  She could not remember whether the
appellant left her alone then.
[7]  The complainant&#146;s mother testified that the appellant and
his wife would frequently baby-sit the complainant and her
sister, especially after she and her husband separated.  The
girls often slept over at the appellant&#146;s house in Burlington,
when she was working nights.  She also testified that if the
appellant&#146;s wife was working, the appellant would baby-sit the
children by himself.  All of the sleepovers occurred when the
appellant and his wife were living in the Burlington house.  The
appellant and his wife testified that the girls never slept over
while they had a house, although both recalled the girls sleeping
over while they lived in an apartment.  The appellant gave
somewhat conflicting evidence about his contact with the
complainant and her sister.  At one point, he testified that he
and his wife frequently saw the complainant, her sister and their
mother after the mother&#146;s separation.  Later in his evidence he
testified that the contact was limited after 1979, when they
purchased the house in Burlington.
[8]  There was a discrepancy in the complainant&#146;s evidence as to
the timing of the sexual assault.  She initially testified that
it occurred when she was 7 or 8 years of age.  When she was
confronted with the fact that the appellant and his wife did not
move to the Burlington house until 1979, the complainant
testified that she must have been 8 or 9 when the assault
occurred.
[9]  The appellant testified that he would tickle the complainant
and kiss her in an &#147;uncle-niece&#148; appropriate way.  He denied
touching her in a sexual way.
[10] After M.H.&#146;s disclosure, the complainant had one more
contact with the appellant and his wife.  She and a friend went
on a trip that had already been arranged to Crystal Beach.  There
was no further contact between the families.  The complainant&#146;s
mother testified that she was surprised that she never heard from
the appellant and his wife again and that they did not attempt to
make contact with her.  The appellant testified that he did make
several unsuccessful attempts to contact the complainant&#146;s
mother.</pre>
    <pre>
               The complainant J.W. (1992)
          
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The complainant J.W. was born on February 9, 1987 and was 10
years of age at the time of the trial.  One of the issues raised
on the appeal is whether she should have been permitted to
testify on a promise to tell the truth.  I will deal with that
issue when I refer to the proceedings respecting her competence.
[12] J.W. was a friend of the appellant&#146;s son and her parents
were friends with the appellant and his wife.  She testified that
the appellant would baby-sit her and her brother and sister at
the appellant&#146;s home.  On one occasion, she was alone with the
appellant on his bed watching a movie when the appellant put his
hand under her clothing and began to rub her vaginal area.  The
appellant asked her if he should rub &#147;faster or slower&#148; and she
said &#147;faster&#148;.  The appellant began to rub faster.  The
complainant believed that this incident occurred before Christmas
while she was in Kindergarten (December 1992).  After the
incident, she went downstairs to play with the other children.
At the time of the incident, her mother and the appellant&#146;s wife
were at the store.
[13] J.W.&#146;s mother testified that in the spring of 1994, she
asked the complainant if anything ever happened between her and
the appellant.  The complainant said that the appellant had
touched her but she would not give any more details and when Mrs.
W. pressed her, the complainant said that she was only kidding.
On numerous occasions thereafter, she tried to find out from J.W.
if something had happened but she insisted that nothing had
happened.
[14] In 1995, the complainant was approached at her school by a
social worker with the Children&#146;s Aid Society.  J.W.&#146;s name had
been given to Children&#146;s Aid by the third complainant C.F.  The
social worker asked the complainant if she knew the difference
between a good and bad touch and whether she had ever had a bad
touch.  The complainant said that the appellant had given her a
bad touch.  However, she refused to say where she had been
touched because she was embarrassed.
[15] The social worker contacted J.W.&#146;s mother and told her about
the disclosure.  Mrs. W. asked the complainant about what
happened and the complainant said that the appellant had touched
her outside of her clothes.  A few days later, the complainant
said that she wanted to talk more about the incident and she
disclosed that the appellant really touched her inside her pants
and asked her if she wanted him to go fast or slow.  She also
said that when she told the appellant to stop, he did so.
[16] There was some discrepancy about the timing of the events.
The complainant placed the incident at a time when her younger
sister was also at the appellant&#146;s home and had already started
walking.  Other evidence, however, suggested that the younger
sister would have been too young to have been walking at the time
the incident occurred.
[17] The appellant denied the complainant&#146;s allegations.  The
complainant was frequently at the appellant&#146;s home because she
was a friend of his son.  He testified that although the
complainant may have been watching television in his bedroom, she
would have been with one of his sons.</pre>
    <pre>
               The complainant C.F. (1993 to 1994)
          
</pre>
    <pre>[18] C.F. was born in February 1987 and was 9 years of age at the
time of the trial.  She was a friend of the appellant&#146;s son.
They were in the same class in kindergarten and Grade 1.  She was
frequently at the appellant&#146;s home to play with his son.  The
appellant also had contact with her because he was a volunteer in
the classroom.  The incidents involving C.F. allegedly occurred
in 1993 to 1994.  At the time, the appellant was self-employed
and working from his home.  His business was not doing very well
and so he was frequently at home.  His wife was a nurse and
working at a local hospital.  Thus, the appellant was often alone
with his sons and their friends during this time.
[19] A great deal of evidence concerned the appellant giving
special attention to C.F., including giving her little gifts.  He
would give her these gifts at school or in the basement of his
home.  He also said things that made her feel special.  The
complainant&#146;s mother confirmed that C.F. would often come home
with little gifts from the appellant.  The appellant and his wife
confirmed that they often bought little gifts for the children.
However, they only acknowledged purchasing one small bracelet
especially for the complainant.  They testified that the
children, including C.F., would help themselves to these
trinkets, which were kept in drawers in the dining room and the
bedroom.  The appellant denied that he treated C.F. much
differently from any of the other children who were frequently at
his home.
[20] C.F. testified that the appellant sexually assaulted her
approximately twenty times.  The incidents occurred when she came
over to play with the appellant&#146;s son and while the appellant&#146;s
wife was at work.  Her most detailed description was of an
incident that occurred when she was in the appellant&#146;s bedroom
watching a video called &#147;Rescuers Down Under&#148;.  When the other
children had left the room to get cookies, the appellant told the
complainant to lie down on the bed on her back.  The appellant,
while fully clothed, rubbed his private part against her vaginal
area.  She was wearing a bathing suit.  After about five minutes,
the appellant had the complainant roll over into a crawling
position.  The appellant then rubbed against her bottom.  The
appellant also reached underneath her bathing suit with his hand
and rubbed her vaginal area.  When they heard the other children
returning, the appellant stopped.
[21] The appellant testified that the VCR in his bedroom was a
Beta machine and the &#147;Rescuers Down Under&#148; was in VHS format and
could only be shown on the VCR in the basement.  In reply, the
Crown called the father of the complainant J.W.  He testified
that the appellant had transferred one or two tapes for him from
the Beta to the VHS format.  Neither of these tapes was produced
at the trial.  The appellant agreed that he had several
children&#146;s movies in the Beta format.  He also agreed that he had
attempted to transfer videos from one format to the other but he
insisted that he had been unsuccessful.  The appellant&#146;s wife
confirmed the appellant&#146;s evidence in this respect.
[22] C.F. testified that all of the other incidents occurred in
the basement.  The appellant would have her stay behind while the
other children went outside to play.  On other occasions, the
children would be present but playing with toys on the other side
of the room.  These other incidents consisted of touching the
buttocks or vaginal area underneath her clothing and at times she
could feel his finger go insider her.  On one occasion, the
appellant took her hand and put it on his crotch on top of his
clothes.
[23] Contact with the appellant ceased the summer before C.F.
entered Grade two.  The appellant took the complainant and some
other children to Bronte Park.  During the excursion, C.F. fell
and scraped her leg.  The appellant picked her up to carry her
but she insisted on being put down.  When she arrived home, she
began to cry.  Her mother tried to find out what had happened,
but was unsuccessful.  However, Mrs. F. decided that her daughter
should not go to the appellant&#146;s home again.
[24] In April 1995, about a year after contact was broken off,
the complainant was walking with her mother when she noticed a
van.  The complainant said that the van reminded her of the
appellant&#146;s van and she began to cry.  Mrs. F. asked what was
bothering her and she said that the appellant had touched her
privates.  Mrs. F. contacted a social worker who called the
police.  Over the next few weeks, C.F. made further disclosure to
her mother and made three video taped statements to the police.
There were some inconsistencies in the various statements,
especially as to the number of incidents.
[25] C.F. also told her classmate, the complainant J.W., that she
was &#147;abused&#148; by the appellant.  J.W. said &#147;me too.&#148;  C.F.
testified that she did not tell J.W. any of the details of the
abuse and did not discuss J.W.&#146;s allegations with her.
[26] The appellant denied the allegations by C.F.  He did testify
that she was frequently at the home and that on many occasions,
he would pick her up in his van and bring her to the house to
play with his children.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal from
conviction:

               1.        The trial judge erred in permitting J.W. to give
               sworn testimony.
               </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The verdicts were unreasonable.
               </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The trial judge reversed the burden
               of proof by requiring the appellant to
               provide explanations for the conduct of
               others.
               </pre>
    <pre>               4.   The trial judge failed to properly
               apply the burden of proof to issues of
               credibility.
               </pre>
    <pre>               5.   The trial judge erred in rejecting
               the evidence of the appellant&#146;s wife.
               
</pre>
    <pre>[28] The appellant also appeals from the sentence.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
               The conviction appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Allowing J.W. to testify under a  promise to tell
               the truth
          
</pre>
    <pre>[29] Before the complainant J.W. testified, the trial judge
conducted the inquiry required under s. 16 of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.  He determined that the complainant
could testify upon promising to tell the truth.  It does not
appear that the Crown suggested that she could testify under
oath.  It was clear from the answers given by the complainant in
the course of the inquiry that she understood the difference
between the truth and a lie.  For example, when asked the
difference between the truth and a lie, the complainant said,
&#147;The truth is when you tell what happened and a lie is when you
make it up.&#148;  However, the appellant argues that the following
portions of the inquiry demonstrate that the complainant did not
understand the importance of telling the truth, especially in
court.
               THE COURT:   Okay. And is it wrong to tell a lie?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE WITNESS: Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:   Why is it wrong to tell a lie?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE WITNESS: I don&#146;t  know.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  You don&#146;t know?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS:          No.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:  Okay.  And do you
          know why somebody should tell [the] truth?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS:          Because
          the judge knows what happened.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:  So the judge knows
          what&#146;s happened.  Can you tell me if it&#146;s
          more important to tell the truth sometimes
          than it is at other times?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS: No.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:  Okay.  Is it all right to tell a 
				   lie sometimes?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS: No.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:   Never[?]
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS: Well, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:   It is, okay?  When is it okay to 
				    tell a lie?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS: I don&#146;t know.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:  You don't know. You
          don't know how important it is to tell the
          truth.  If you were mad at somebody all
          right, and you wanted to get back at them,
          would you tell a lie to get them in trouble?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS:   No.          
</pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:     No. Why won&#146;t you do that?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS:   Because I&#146;d get in trouble.
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE COURT:     You&#146;d get in trouble from whom?
          </pre>
    <pre>                       THE WITNESS:  My mom and dad.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[30] After some submissions from counsel, the trial judge asked
the complainant some further questions:

               THE COURT:     And I have to make some decisions in this
          case all right?  Based on what witnesses tell me.  Do you
          understand that?  Okay.  Do you understand this is a trial, all
          right?  A man is on trial, do you understand that?  Okay.  Now,
          do you understand it&#146;s very important that you only tell me the
          truth so that I can make a fair decision and a proper decision?
          You have to answer?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE WITNESS:   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:     You understand that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE WITNESS:   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:     And do you understand
          it&#146;s very important you only tell me the
          truth?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE WITNESS:   Yes.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[31] The accepted test in this province for determining whether a
witness is competent to testify under a promise to tell the truth
was set out by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Farley (1995), 23 O.R. (3d)
445 (C.A.).  He held that the test set out by Robins J.A. in R.
v. Khan (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197  at 206 (Ont. C.A.) in respect
of the predecessor legislation applied to the present s. 16(3).
Robins J.A. had held as follows:

                    To satisfy the less stringent standards applicable to
          unsworn evidence, the child need only understand the duty to
          speak the truth in terms of ordinary everyday social conduct.
          This can be demonstrated through a simple line of questioning
          directed to whether the child understands the difference between
          the truth and a lie, knows that it is wrong to lie, understands
          the necessity to tell the truth, and promises to do so.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[32] Doherty J.A. added the following, at p. 52:

                    In my opinion, the standard enunciated in Khan, supra,
          at p. 206 should be applied in the present s. 16(3). A proposed
          witness who can communicate the evidence should be allowed to
          testify under s. 16(3) only if he or she &quot;understand[s] the duty
          to speak the truth in terms of everyday social conduct&quot;. In the
          context of a witness called to describe a prior event, an
          understanding of the duty to speak the truth entails an
          appreciation by the witness that he or she must answer all
          questions in accordance with the witness's recollection of what
          actually happened.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[33] In my view, the answers given by J.W. demonstrate that she
had the requisite capacity to testify under a promise to tell the
truth.  Notwithstanding the portion of the examination that I
have emphasized above, the entire inquiry showed that the
complainant understood that she must answer all questions in
accordance with her own recollection of what actually happened.
She also knew that it was wrong to lie, even if she did not have
any understanding that a lie in court had a special significance.
As Robins J.A. held in Khan the complainant understood &#147;the duty
to speak the truth in terms of ordinary everyday social conduct.&#148;
[34] Counsel for the appellant referred us to the decision of
Goldie J.A. in R. v. G. (C.W.) (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 240  at 246
(B.C.C.A.) as setting out a higher standard:

               The trial judge must be satisfied by some acknowledgment
          which can be characterized as a promise that the proposed witness
          understands the difference between truth and falsehood and is
          committed to the former on this occasion. The promise is to get
          at the conscience (for want of a better word) of such a witness
          in a manner intelligible to him or her.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    This purpose exists notwithstanding
          the immunity from prosecution for perjury
          which exists up to the age of 12. Here, there
          was no completed attempt made to get a hold
          on the conscience of this child in the manner
          Parliament has set out.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[35] The facts in G. (C.W.) are far removed from this case.  In
G. (C.W.), the inquiry concerned a four year old child who never
answered the judge&#146;s inquiry as to whether she would tell the
truth nor what it means to tell &#147;lies or to fib&#148;.  The reference
to the conscience of the child must, in my view, mean nothing
more than a requirement that the child understand what it means
to promise to tell the truth.  It is not sufficient, in other
words, to establish that the child understands the difference
between a truth and a lie.  The child must also understand what
it means to promise to tell the truth.  This is the effect of the
concurring reasons for judgment of McLachlin J. in R. v. Rockey,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 829.  After discussing the requirement under s.
16(3) that the child be able to communicate the evidence, at pp.
845-46, McLachlin J. turned to the question of the requirement
that the child promise to tell the truth:

               However, even if this requirement were met, the case for
          Ryan testifying would founder on the requirement of s. 16(3), the
          ability to promise to tell the truth. Dr. Sas's evidence was
          unequivocal: Ryan did not understand what it meant to promise to
          tell the truth. I agree with Doherty J.A. in dissent that it is
          not necessary that the witness be able to define the word
          &quot;promise&quot; in some technical sense; what is required is that the
          witness understand the obligation to tell the truth in giving his
          or her evidence. I respectfully part company from Doherty J.A.'s
          conclusion, however, that it cannot be said that &quot;a reasonable
          trial judge would necessarily have found Ryan to be incompetent
          to give evidence&quot; (p. 667 O.R.). On this point, I share the view
          of the majority of the Court of Appeal. Ryan, as noted above, did
          not understand the concepts of truth or lying. Nor could he
          articulate a promise. &quot;A promise is a promise is a promise, and
          he could not bring into it the context that is entailed in a
          promise.&quot; The only inference that can be drawn from this evidence
          is that while Ryan understood the difference between what is &quot;so&quot;
          and &quot;not so&quot;, he had no conception of any moral obligation to say
          what is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;so&quot; in giving evidence or otherwise. In these
          circumstances, no judge could reasonably have concluded that Ryan
          was able to promise to tell the truth.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[36] Doherty J.A. expressed this requirement in the excerpt from
Farley set out above, that the child must understand that &#147;the
duty to speak the truth entails an appreciation by the witness
that he or she must answer all questions in accordance with the
witness's recollection of what actually happened.&#148;  Finch J.A.
expressed this requirement in similar terms in another decision
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, R. v. Ferguson (1996),
112 C.C.C. (3d) 342 at 363:

                    It is therefore clear that a child witness who does not
          understand the nature of an oath or solemn affirmation may be
          permitted to testify under s. 16(3) only if she promises to tell
          the truth and, in doing so, understands the difference between
          truth and falsehood, and understands the duty to tell the truth
          as to what she saw or recalls.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[37] While the complainant was not asked directly if she
understood what a promise was, the inquiry established that she
understood the duty to tell the truth as to what she saw and what
happened to her.  Even if she did not understand the consequences
of telling a lie, she did understand the requirement to tell the
truth.
</pre>
    <pre>               2.   The verdicts were unreasonable
          
</pre>
    <pre>[38] The appellant submits that the verdicts were unreasonable
and cannot be supported by the evidence.  There were some
inconsistencies in the accounts given by all three complainants.
Those inconsistencies, such as the number of assaults in the case
of the complainant C.F., and the timing of the acts in the case
of T.H. were, in the circumstances of this case, relatively minor
and resolved to the satisfaction of the trial judge.  The
appellant also submits that the evidence of T.H. was unreliable
because she was testifying about memories recovered after
counselling.  I do not agree with this characterization of T.H.&#146;s
testimony.  When her testimony is read in context it is apparent
that she always had the memories of abuse.  Her contemporaneous
complaint to her sister and mother supports this view of the
evidence.  The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and
concluded that the complainant had not been &#147;assisted&#148; in her
memories by &#147;outside influences&#148; and that she had not confused
the abuse from the other men with the acts of the appellant.
These findings were open on this record.
[39] Most of the complaints about the reasonableness of the
verdicts turn on the weight to be attached to the contradictory
evidence adduced by the defence in the evidence of the appellant
and his wife.  However, the trial judge was not obliged to accept
the defence evidence.  In my view, unless it can be said that the
trial judge misapprehended the burden of proof or in some other
way failed to properly deal with the evidence, these verdicts are
not subject to attack.  It is therefore necessary to deal with
those submissions by the appellant.
</pre>
    <pre>               3.   The trial judge reversed the burden of proof by
                    requiring the appellant to provide explanations for
                    the conduct of others
          
</pre>
    <pre>[40] On at least two different occasions in the course of his
reasons, the trial judge referred to the failure of the appellant
to provide a satisfactory explanation for a cessation of contact
between the appellant&#146;s family and the complainant&#146;s family.
Thus, in relation to T.H., the trial judge said the following:

               This witness&#146; evidence coupled with that of her sister and
          later that of her mother leads me to the conclusion that all
          contact between this family and that of the accused and his wife,
          ceased at the very beginning of the two girls&#146; teenage years.  I
          find beyond a reasonable doubt that the cessation of the
          relationship between the two families was because of the unease
          the two young ladies felt while in the presence of the accused.
          I might observe at this point that the reasons, given by the
          accused and his wife, for the parting of these two families did
          not have a ring of truth.  I find their explanation to be
          reaching at best.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[41] In relation to C.F., the trial judge said the following:

               While the accused need not prove anything, the burden always
          being with the Crown, the lack of explanation of these
          occurrences or lack of occurrences weighs against the credibility
          of the accused.  Simply put, it does not make sense that a
          frequent visitor to the home just stops going there, nor does it
          make sense that the accused, who had been calling frequently to
          enquire as to whether [C.F.] could come to his home to play with
          his son just stops, without any reason.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[42] If the proper interpretation of these reasons is that the
appellant was required to explain the conduct of other persons,
such as the parents of C.F. and T.H., this was an error.  Such an
approach, in this case, would undermine the presumption of
innocence.  However, it was open to the trial judge to draw
inferences from the appellant&#146;s own conduct.  In the case of
T.H., the appellant described a course of conduct after contact
ceased between the two families that the trial judge found did
not have the ring of truth.  It is unnecessary to set out that
evidence here.  Suffice it to say that it was open to the trial
judge to reach that conclusion.
[43] The comment with respect to contact with C.F.&#146;s family is
more problematic since the appellant was never asked why he
stopped calling to see if C.F. wished to come to his home.
However, in my view, this comment by the trial judge does not
undermine his finding that the Crown&#146;s case was made out by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.  There was no dispute that the
appellant abruptly stopped attempting to contact C.F. and when
the whole of the trial judge&#146;s reasons are considered, it is my
view that he did not attach undue importance to this fact.
</pre>
    <pre>               4.   The trial judge failed to properly apply the burden of
                    proof to issues of credibility
          
</pre>
    <pre>[44] It was not necessary for the trial judge to repeat the
formula from R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 concerning the
application of the reasonable doubt standard to issues of
credibility.  On several occasions in the course of his reasons,
the trial judge referred to the burden of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  He gave reasons for accepting the testimony of
the complainants and for rejecting the testimony of the
appellant.  Notwithstanding the submissions of counsel for the
appellant, I have not been persuaded that the trial judge fell
into the error of determining credibility based solely on the
demeanour of the various witnesses.  To the contrary, the trial
judge looked at all of the evidence.  He analyzed the
inconsistencies and contradictions and the reasons offered to
explain them.  He also looked at the evidence that tended to
confirm the testimony of the complainants.  In my view, the trial
judge properly applied the burden of proof to issues of
credibility.</pre>
    <pre>
               5.   The trial judge erred in rejecting the evidence of the
                    appellant&#146;s wife
          
</pre>
    <pre>[45] The submission that the trial judge erred in rejecting the
evidence of the appellant&#146;s wife is based on the following
comment in his reasons:</pre>
    <pre>
                    Mrs. A.  testified in defence of her husband.  I felt
          sorry for Mrs. A.  She is basically a decent, hard-working
          individual who has been confronted with the fact that her husband
          has been accused of sexually abusing little girls.  Out of
          loyalty to her husband, and perhaps because she was unable to
          believe that her husband was capable of such acts, she has
          defended her husband.  I cannot fault Mrs. A. for her loyalty.
          That loyalty has been misplaced.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    It was apparent to me that Mrs. A.
          has put considerable effort into her
          husband&#146;s defence.  She was the one to
          chronicle the T-ball games, tournaments and
          holidays.  She chronicled her work schedule,
          etc.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Mrs. A. could not believe that her
          husband had committed the complained-of acts.
          She did her best to minimize each factual
          allegation.  However, where her evidence is
          in conflict with other witnesses, I prefer
          the evidence of those other witnesses.  While
          she may well not have been consciously lying,
          her evidence was very much influenced by her
          desire to defend her husband.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[46] In R. v. B. (L.) (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 796 (C.A.), this court
held that it is an error for a trial judge to disbelieve the
evidence of an accused because he has a motive for not telling
the truth, namely that he does not wish to be convicted.  At
p. 798, Arbour J.A. pointed out that such reasoning is based on
the impermissible assumption that the accused will lie to secure
his acquittal.  Such an assumption &#147;flies in the face of the
presumption of innocence and creates an almost insurmountable
disadvantage for the accused.&#148;  Counsel for the appellant
submitted that the trial judge did much the same thing here in
respect of the evidence of the appellant&#146;s wife, discounting it
solely because of her interest in the appellant not being
convicted.  I do not agree.  In B. (L.), Arbour J.A. also held
that as a matter of common sense a trier of fact is entitled to
take into account a witness&#146;s interest in the outcome of the
trial as one factor that may affect the assessment of the
credibility.  Mrs. A.&#146;s obvious loyalty to the appellant was one
factor to consider.  It was not determinative and the trial judge
did not find that it was.  What he did find was that perhaps
unconsciously she shaded her evidence out of loyalty to her
husband.  To the extent that such matters can be determined by
the printed words of the transcript, I cannot find that this was
an unfair characterization of the witness&#146;s evidence.  I have not
been persuaded that the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the
relationship between the witness and the appellant.  Moreover, as
the trial judge properly pointed out, on the critical issues Mrs.
A. could give little assistance since she was admittedly
frequently out of the home and these incidents allegedly occurred
when the complainants were alone with the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>
               The sentence appeal
          
</pre>
    <pre>[47] The trial judge imposed a sentence of forty months'
imprisonment on each count concurrent.  With respect to the
complainants T.H. and J.W., such a sentence was grossly
excessive.  However, this court must consider the total sentence
imposed.  The allegations relating to C.F. were considerably more
serious and I cannot find that the trial judge erred in holding
that the totality of the conduct involving the three complainants
warranted a penitentiary sentence.
[48] However, in my view, the trial judge erred in principle in
treating the appellant&#146;s continued protestations of innocence as
an aggravating factor.  The trial judge said the following in his
reasons for sentence:

               The accused proclaimed his innocence at trial and continues
          to do so to this date.  His proclamations of innocence are
          supported by his wife and a number of others who are quite
          vociferous in their condemnation of his being found guilty.  The
          accused, his wife, and their supporters, are entitled to their
          right of denial, however, such a denial in light of the
          overwhelming evidence to the contrary, shows little insight on
          the part of the accused to the pain and suffering he visited on
          these innocent children.  He appears to have little comprehension
          as to the effects his self-gratifying activities have had on his
          victims or that his actions will continue to affect the
          development of these individuals throughout their lives.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[49] The appellant was not entitled to any reduction in his
sentence because of demonstration of any remorse.  But, an
increased sentence is not justified because the accused has
pleaded not guilty, put in motion a full trial, and maintained
his innocence:  R. v. Kozy (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 545 at 550
(C.A.).  Unfortunately, the trial judge&#146;s comments are open to
this interpretation.
[50] In my view, a fit sentence in this case is one totaling
thirty months' imprisonment, calculated as follows:

               Indecent assault of T.H., six months' imprisonment;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Sexual assault of J.W., six months'
          imprisonment consecutive; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               Sexual assault of C.F., eighteen
          months' imprisonment consecutive.2
          
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[51] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.  I
would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal from
sentence, and reduce the sentence to a total of thirty months'
imprisonment as follows:  count #3, six months' imprisonment;
count #1, six months' imprisonment consecutive; and count #4,
eighteen months' imprisonment consecutive.

</pre>
    <pre>RELEASED: July 12, 1999
_______________________________
1    The appellant was found guilty of all six counts charged,
but provisional stays of proceedings were entered on the counts
of sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching in
relation to the complainants J.W. and C.F.
2    It may be that the acts involving C.F. would on their own
warrant a somewhat higher sentence, if they stood alone.
However, some consideration must be given to totality:  Criminal
Code, s. 718.2(c).</pre></td>
