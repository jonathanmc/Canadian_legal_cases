    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Howden J. issued
pursuant to the verdict of a General Division jury in which the
respondent was awarded $35,000 general damages, $30,000 special
damages, $30,000 aggravated damages and $55,000 punitive damages
for physical assault and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  The appellant also appeals from the supplementary
judgment of Howden J. in which the respondent was awarded,
concurrently with the jury&#146;s award, the same amounts for damages
under all four headings for breach of fiduciary duty.  The
appellant also seeks leave to appeal and appeals the award of
costs.</pre>
    <pre>     Overview</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent, Gabriella Kadar commenced this action
against her father, the appellant, alleging that he had sexually
and physically assaulted and emotionally abused her beginning in
her childhood and ending in 1987 when she was thirty years of
age.  She also alleged that the appellant had breached his
fiduciary duty to her as a parent.  She claimed general, special,
aggravated and punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The issues of sexual assault, physical assault and
intentional infliction of emotional distress were tried before
the jury. In its answers to questions that made up its verdict,
the jury found that the appellant father had physically assaulted
his daughter but had not sexually assaulted her.  It also found
that the appellant had intentionally inflicted emotional distress
on her and awarded general, special, aggravated and punitive
damages as indicated above.
[4]  The claim for breach of fiduciary duty was tried by the
trial judge since it was a claim for equitable relief.  After
receiving written submissions, the trial judge, citing M. (K.) v.
M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 and J. (L.A.) v. J. (H.) (1993), 13
O.R. (3d) 306 (Gen. Div.), disposed of this issue in a brief
endorsement.  He said:
                    In this case, the jury heard all of the evidence in its
          consideration of the claims in tort which are relevant to this
          claim.  I see no reason to assess the damages differently from
          the jury.  I award for breach of fiduciary duty general damages
          of $35,000, special damages of $30,000, aggravated damages of
          $30,000 and punitive damages of $55,000.  This award is
          concurrent with the award by the jury, to avoid double recovery.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.    Did the trial judge err in failing to dismiss the action
          for physical assault and intentional infliction of emotional
          distress as barred by virtue of the Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990,
          c.L.15, ss. 45(1)(g) and (j)?
2.    Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury?
3.    Was the jury&#146;s verdict perverse and contrary to the
evidence in holding that the appellant physically assaulted the
respondent but did not sexually assault her?
4.    Was the damage award grossly excessive in light of the
finding as to liability?
5.    Did the trial judge err in his award of damages for breach
of fiduciary duty?
6.    Did the trial judge err in his award as to costs?</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The overriding complaint of the appellant with respect to
the conduct of the trial is that the case for the respondent on
the pleadings was based on persistent sexual assaults over an
extended period of time. Once the jury rejected this primary
complaint, he submits that the balance of the verdict was either
perverse or should have been re-examined by the trial judge to
determine if the physical assaults were out of time.  For her
part, the respondent maintains that the appellant&#146;s counsel at
trial (not counsel on appeal) agreed with or at least acquiesced
in the decisions made by the trial judge.  Certainly, he did not
object to any of the matters that have taken on great
significance in this court.
[6]  I have considerable sympathy with the complaint of the
respondent.  However, for the purposes of this appeal, I am
prepared to accept the submissions of the appellant that the
focus of the case for the respondent daughter, as pleaded and as
presented at trial, was on her allegations of persistent sexual
touching and assault by the appellant culminating in an
allegation of sexual intercourse after the appellant had drugged
her.  Accordingly, once the jury had rejected these allegations,
the case for the respondent was diminished in severity to a
finding in her favour on her allegations of persistent physical
assaults of a quasi-disciplinary nature, particularly when she
was a young child.
[7]  The appellant submits that the significance of these two
findings is that the jury isolated the tort of assault from the
incest inherent in the sexual abuse. The decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in M. v M., supra, regarding discoverability in
incest cases, would therefore be distinguishable if not
inapplicable.  Accordingly, he submits, the trial judge had a
responsibility to re-examine the limitation defence pleaded by
the appellant because in his submission the physical assaults
took place when the respondent was very young and had terminated
at least by the time she was in her late teens. However, this is
not factually accurate.  The record is replete with evidence of
physical, verbal and emotional abuse inflicted by the appellant
on the respondent, quite apart from the alleged sexual abuse. The
respondent had alleged that her father had physically and
sexually assaulted her throughout her childhood without
differentiating between the two classes of abuse.  The physical
assaults often involved slapping and punches to the head which
were administered on a continuous basis between the ages of two
and a half to three until the respondent was about ten.
Thereafter the assaults were less frequent but some were of
greater severity. On one occasion, the appellant knocked her down
and kicked her in the ribs.  On another occasion he took a belt
to her. This physical abuse was employed, apparently, as a form
of punishment or expression of disapproval. The respondent also
alleged a history of sexual abuse.  She stated that the appellant
placed her head in his lap, rubbed his penis against her thighs,
inappropriately touched her vagina, and digitally penetrated her
vagina.  This was in addition to the allegations, referred to
above, wherein she also testified that once, when she was 18
years old, he drugged her and then had sexual intercourse with
her.
[8]  As a matter of law, physical assaults constituting a tort
are subject to a limitation of four years under the provisions of
s.45(1)(j) of the Limitations Act. However, in this case, as in
similar child abuse cases, the issue of discoverability was
inextricably bound to the sexual abuse.  The respondent addressed
the discoverability issue by calling as a witness Dr. Elaine
Borins, a practising psychiatrist with a distinguished curriculum
vitae.  Dr. Borins had treated the respondent as a patient and
was able to assist her to identify, for the first time, the
connection between her feelings of inadequacy, depression, anger
and worthlessness on the one hand and the overall abusive conduct
of her father on the other.  Dr. Borins furnished two reports
regarding the respondent and her treatment. Although the focus of
the reports was the effect of the alleged sexual abuse, the
physical assaults were also mentioned.  Dr. Borins did not
differentiate between the effects of the sexual and the physical
assaults in her analysis of her patient&#146;s problems or the effect
the childhood abuse had on her.
[9]  As I read the judgment of La Forest J. speaking for the
majority in M. v M., supra, the distinction between incestuous
conduct and persistent physical abuse directed to a child of the
marriage does not appear to be significant for limitation
purposes.  He says that incest is both a tortious assault and a
breach of fiduciary duty.  It &#147;does not constitute a distinct
tort, separate and apart from the intentional tort of assault and
battery . . .&#148; (p.24).  However, also at p.24, he makes clear:
               The tort claim, although subject to limitations legislation,
          does not accrue until the plaintiff is reasonably capable of
          discovering the wrongful nature of the defendant&#146;s acts and the
          nexus between those acts and her injuries.   In this case, that
          discovery took place only when the appellant entered therapy, and
          the lawsuit was commenced promptly thereafter.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The &#147;tort claim&#148; in M. v. M. was incest and, according to La
Forest J., a crude legal description of it is assault and
battery.  He states that the discoverability rule as developed by
the Supreme Court should be applied and the limitation period
should begin to run only when the injured party has a substantial
awareness of the harm and its likely cause. In these
circumstances, the nature of the childhood abuse would appear to
be irrelevant if there is evidence, as there is in this case,
that the victim&#146;s awareness of her problems and its cause was
only discoverable after therapy.
[11] In any event, whatever merit the appellant&#146;s argument might
have in the abstract as to a severable limitation period for the
physical assaults as opposed to the sexual ones, the appellant&#146;s
counsel at trial did not appear to recognize the significance of
the jury verdict. He had based his defence on the theory that the
assaults were primarily sexual and when he raised the limitation
issue with the trial judge he appeared to accept that the matter
was controlled by M. v. M.  However, despite the fact that he had
agreed that separate questions should be put to the jury on
whether the appellant had committed the sexual assaults and the
physical assaults, he did not ask the trial judge to ask the jury
the further question as to when the respondent was reasonably
capable of discovering the wrongful nature of either class of
assaults.  When the jury returned its verdict, the appellant&#146;s
counsel failed to ask the trial judge to make a ruling as to
whether the limitation period would apply to the physical
assaults since the sexual assaults had not been found to have
occurred.
[12] In the result, we have no finding of fact by either the jury
or the trial judge as to whether there was a point at which it
could be said that the respondent was reasonably capable of
discovering the wrongful nature of the appellant&#146;s acts and the
nexus between those acts and her injuries. In these
circumstances, the trial judge can not be faulted for not raising
these matters on his own initiative.
[13] The same criticism can be made of the complaint that the
trial judge, in asserting his own jurisdiction over the equitable
issue of breach of fiduciary duty, failed to make a separate
finding on the limitation  issue.  As I read the written
submissions of the appellant&#146;s counsel at trial, he did not
challenge the characterisation by the respondent&#146;s counsel that
the same acts of the appellant that were found by the jury to be
assaults, also constituted breaches of fiduciary duty.  Indeed,
the language used is open to the construction that he agreed with
the submissions of the respondent&#146;s counsel and simply suggested
to the trial judge that he follow the judgment of D. Rutherford
J. in J. (L.A.) v. J. (H.), supra, a case the trial judge
referred to in his reasons.
[14] Accordingly, I am not prepared to give effect to the
appellant&#146;s complaint with respect to issue no.1.
[15] With respect to issue no. 2 relating to objections in this
court to the charge to the jury, no objection was made at trial.
The complaints now made with respect to the use the jury could
make of character evidence, the evidence of certain witnesses
other than the appellant, instructions as to the requirements of
intentional infliction of mental distress and guidance with
respect to the requirements of a finding of punitive and
aggravated damages are all matters of non-direction.  It is
accepted that in civil cases, failure to object in these
circumstances is usually fatal:  see Tsalamatas v. Wawanesa
Mutual Insurance Co. et al. (1982), 31 C.P.C. 257 (Ont. C.A.).
[16] I think that it would be useful to repeat an instruction on
the issue of failing to object to a charge to the jury, whether
it be non-direction or misdirection, given by this court in
Arland and Arland v. Taylor, [1955] O.R. 131 (C.A.).  There,
Laidlaw J.A. for the court stated at p.137:
                    While the failure of counsel at trial to make an
          objection to a charge to the jury does not in every case preclude
          counsel on appeal from raising the objection, it should be made
          plain once again that the omission of counsel at trial to make an
          objection to the charge must not be regarded lightly, but, on the
          contrary, in such a case when counsel seeks to raise the
          objection as a ground of appeal, a new trial cannot be granted as
          a matter of right, but only as a matter of discretion.  A new
          trial should not be granted unless the Court is fully satisfied
          that it is necessary in the interests of justice.</pre>
    <pre>[17] And again at p.140:
                    I extract from the cases to which I have referred these
          general propositions:
               (1)  A new trial is contrary to the
          interest of the public and should not be
          ordered unless the interests of justice
          plainly require that to be done.
               (2)  An appellant cannot ask for a new
          trial as a matter of right on a ground of
          misdirection or other error in the course of
          the trial when no objection was made in
          respect of the matter at trial.
               (3)  A new trial cannot be granted
          because of misdirection or other error in the
          course of the trial &#147;unless some substantial
          wrong or miscarriage has been thereby
          occasioned&#148;.
               (4)  A party should not be granted a new
          trial on the ground of non-direction in the
          judge&#146;s charge to the jury where, having
          opportunity to do so, he did not ask the
          judge to give the direction the omission of
          which he complains of.</pre>
    <pre>[18] More recently, these four propositions were quoted with
approval by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Christie v.
Westcom Radio Group Ltd. (1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 546, leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1991), 79 D.L.R.
(4th) vi.
[19] I agree with the appellant that the trial judge should not
have instructed the jury, where adequate notice had not been
given as to the calling of a particular witness, that this was a
matter the jury could consider in deciding what weight to give to
the witness&#146; evidence.  If counsel fails to abide by an
undertaking as to the calling of witnesses or fails to observe
the rules of court in this respect, the trial judge can do
various things.  He can refuse to permit the witness to be
called, he can grant an adjournment to permit opposing counsel to
prepare to cross-examine the witness or he can award cost
sanctions.  The burden of counsel&#146;s misconduct, if that is what
it is, should not be charged to the witness.  However, in this
case the instruction did not result in a &#147;substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice&#148; sufficient to warrant a new trial: see
Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 134(6).
[20] As to issue 3, the verdict was not perverse.  Two separate
questions were put to the jury and it is most strange to suggest
that the jury was obliged to give the same answer to both
questions.
[21] Issues 4, 5 and 6 can be disposed of shortly. I am not
persuaded that the damages awarded were so excessive as to
warrant interference by this court.  The award of costs was in
the discretion of the trial judge and we do not propose to
interfere with it.
[22] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
