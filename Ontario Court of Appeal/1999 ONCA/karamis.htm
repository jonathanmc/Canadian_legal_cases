    <pre>[1]  To set aside an order made by the Review Board the Criminal
Code requires that we find the decision appealed from to be
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, or that it is based
on an error of law or constitutes a miscarriage of justice. We
can find none of these in this case. The decision is squarely
based on the evidence that was before the Board. All of that
evidence supported the decision which we find to be a reasonable
one. The reasons for decision reveal no error of law. Nor does
the decision constitute a miscarriage of justice.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed.</pre></td>
