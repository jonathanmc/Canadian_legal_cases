    <pre>[1]  This appeal is from a summary judgment declaring that the
marriage contract between the parties was valid and binding. It
was incumbent upon the appellant to put her best foot forward in
response to the respondent’s motion for summary judgment. Two
issues were raised in support of her contention that the marriage
contract was not valid: a) the exercise of undue influence, and
b) the lack of proper financial disclosure.

[2]  In our view, it was open to the motions judge on the basis
of this record to conclude that the appellant had no reasonable
chance of success and that, consequently, there was no need for a
trial on the question of  the validity of the marriage contract.
There were no contentious material facts to be determined.

[3]  The evidence advanced in support of the claim of undue
duress, when viewed in the context of the whole evidence on the
motion, would not suffice to make out the claim at trial.
Further, there was no evidence of lack of disclosure that could
justify an order setting aside the marriage contract.

[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed on consent at
$2,000.</pre></td>
