    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice A. D. K. Mackenzie
dated May 5, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from an order granting judgment
pursuant to the terms of a settlement reached in her action
against the respondent The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company.
[2]  The appellant argues that the motions judge erred in
refusing her counsel&#146;s request to be removed from the record and
in proceeding with the motion for judgment without giving her an
opportunity to obtain independent counsel. While it may have been
preferable for the appellant to have been represented by other
counsel on the motion for judgment, the appellant has not
persuaded us on this record that the motions judge erred in the
exercise of his discretion.  There is no evidence, or indeed
suggestion, that the appellant has been prejudiced by the fact
that Mr. Deopaul continued to represent her on the motion.
[3]  Based on this record, we are further of the view that the
motions judge was correct in concluding that the test set out in
Scherer v. Paletta, [1966] 2 O.R. 524 (C.A.) had been made out
and, consequently, in granting judgment pursuant to the
settlement achieved by the parties through their respective
counsel. We see no merit in the appellant&#146;s position that no
settlement could be reached until execution of the written
Release, or in her objections to the form of the Release.
[4]  A question was raised at the hearing with respect to Mr.
Gundu&#146;s involvement in this appeal. We therefore note for the
purpose of clarification that, although counsel for the appellant
made reference in his factum to the subsequent dismissal of the
action against the individual defendant, Gian Singh Gundu, and
included some argument with respect to that claim, it is clear
that this appeal relates solely to the action against the
respondent insurance company. There is no appeal from the
dismissal of the action against Mr. Gundu before this court.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
