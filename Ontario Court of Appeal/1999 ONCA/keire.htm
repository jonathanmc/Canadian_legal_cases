</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment and orders of Cavarzan dated May 5 1992,
and January 19 and June 23, 1995 made at Hamilton.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
[1]   These  are  three appeals from the judgment and  orders  of
Cavarzan J. dated respectively May 5, 1992, January 19, 1995  and
June 23, 1995, and, in effect, from other dispositions leading to
these  orders. All deal with one aspect or another of proceedings
related  to  the dissolution of a partnership of three  dentists.
These reasons will treat them as one appeal.
[2]  There were originally four partners in this dental practice.
In 1987 Dr. Gureckas tendered his share to the remaining partners
for $15,000 plus an indemnity of liabilities. The appellant
refused to sign the purchase agreement and, without informing the
appellant, the respondents completed the purchase in their names
and on the same terms.
[3]  The appellant says that this sale was illegal, being without
his consent, and that Gureckas’ share should, in effect, be
ignored in the division of the assets of the partnership to the
end that the appellant be considered a 1/3 partner, rather than a
1/4 partner.
[4]  Article VI, section 6.4 of the partnership agreement reads:
          </pre>
      <pre>               No partner shall, without the written consent of the other
          Partners ….sell his share in the Partnership or in its capital,
          assets or property or any part thereof, or enter into any
          agreement as a result of which any person shall become interested
          with him in the Partnership …”</pre>
      <pre>[5]   The trial judge read this as embodying s. 24 para. 7 of the
Partnership  Act,  reading: “No person may  be  introduced  as  a
partner without the consent of all existing partners.”
[6]  We do not agree. The plain reading of the provision in the
agreement is that all sales must be on consent of all partners.
[7]  Having so concluded, we do not agree with the appellant that
this voids the sale and gives the appellant an effective interest
in that share. Dr. Gureckas is not a party to these proceedings
and it is not open to the court to set aside the transaction. The
appellant’s resort must be to damages, but he suffered none. He
was offered a portion of the share and cannot now say he lost an
opportunity. His position was otherwise unaffected.
[8]  We, therefore, give no effect to this ground of appeal.
[9]   Section 42 of the Partnership Act provides that  where  the
surviving  partner carries on the business after dissolution  the
outgoing  partners  (the  respondents)  are  entitled,  at  their
option, to a share of the profits attributable to the use of  the
outgoing partners’ share of the assets or to interest at the rate
of 5%.
[10] The appellant objects to the trial judge applying this
section so as to simply set the date for taking accounts as of
the end of the fiscal year just prior to the trial date. It is
true that the trial judge did not make an assessment tied
strictly to the use of capital but it might be inferred from his
reasons that he considered the business as a whole to be
generally supported by its capital and, since it continued
uninterrupted until trial,  that a prorating of profits to that
time was appropriate. The partners each had very substantial
capital accounts, on the evidence of the accountant Rosen, and
the appellant invited the trial judge’s approach to the issue. In
his reasons the trial judge says:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Mr. Marshall submitted that the Court has the discretion in
          such circumstances to either award to the plaintiffs a portion of
          the profits or to award them interest only on the amount of their
          share of liquidation of the partnership assets. Mr. Marshall
          urged the latter.</pre>
      <pre>[11]  Further, the appellant did not provide the trial  judge  or
this court with any basis for an alternative approach identifying
profits  not  attributable  to  the  use  of  capital.  This   is
understandable,  given the fact that, until the argument  of  the
appeal, the appellant’s position was that the respondents had  no
capital in the partnership.
[12] The appellant contests the inclusion in the accounts of a
credit to the respondents for foregone interest on withheld
profits, such interest to run to the date of payment. The trial
judge had evidence before him supporting that claim and he
avoided duplication of recovery by not awarding prejudgment or
post-judgment interest. We see no basis for interference on that
ground.
[13] The costs issues raised by the appellant are without merit.
The orders were discretionary and we see no error in principle.
[14] The three appeals are therefore dismissed with costs.
