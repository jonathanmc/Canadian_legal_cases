    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on July 15, 1997 by His Honour
Judge W. R. Wolski and from the sentence imposed by His Honour
Judge Wolski on August 20, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals her conviction for perjury.  Counsel
for the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to
consider whether the appellant intended to mislead the court when
she falsely testified, as a proposed surety at a bail hearing,
that she had no criminal record.  In particular, counsel for the
appellant argues that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to
consider whether the appellant may have been merely reckless in
the giving of her testimony.
[2]  We do not agree.  The defence raised at trial was that the
appellant honestly believed that she did not have a criminal
record.  It was never argued that she may have been merely
reckless in the giving of her testimony.  Further, the evidence
cannot reasonably support such an argument.  In these
circumstances, it was not incumbent upon the trial judge to
consider this issue in his reasons.
[3]  It is clear from the trial judge's reasons for judgment that
he adverted to all the necessary elements of the offence and,
after rejecting the appellant's defence, he made a finding that
all elements had been made out.  In our view, the verdict is
entirely supported by the evidence.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed.
