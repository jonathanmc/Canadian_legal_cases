    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. BERNARD KELLY (Appellant)</pre>

               for the appellant</pre>

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   There  was evidence upon which the trial judge  could  find
that  the  appellant  was  properly identified.   In  particular,
Constable  Theriault testified that he recognized  the  appellant
and    indeed    the   appellant   admitted    that    he    knew
Constable Theriault from his presence in the neighbourhood.

[2]  We are also satisfied that the trial judge properly applied
the burden of proof.

[3]  Finally, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not place
undue emphasis on the appellant's criminal record or his
evidence, led in examination-in-chief, that he was a crack addict
and trafficked in crack.  It is well established that this type
of bad character evidence is capable of being relevant to
credibility: see R. v. Stratton (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 449 (Ont.
C.A.) at 467; R. v. Chambers (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.)
at 336-37; and R. v. G. (S.G.) (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 193
(S.C.C.) at 218.

[4]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre></td>
