    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mossop J. dated October 25, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Gregory Kennedy, an 18 year old student, left school on his
motorcycle at lunch hour to buy some gum. He drove too fast out
of the school parking lot along the driveway out to the road. He
lost control of his motorcycle, hit the curb and went flying off.
When he landed, his head hit a bollard situated on school
property on the grass beside the sidewalk by the driveway.
Although he was wearing a helmet, his impact with the bollard
caused catastrophic injuries, including complete immobility and
inability to communicate or to recall past events.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  At trial the judge found that the accident (as opposed to
the damage) was caused solely by Mr. Kennedy&#146;s negligence. While
that finding is not disputed on appeal, what is in issue is
whether the Board&#146;s action in not removing the bollards was an
actionable breach of duty to the appellant, as it contributed
significantly to the damage he suffered in the accident. It is
undisputed that had Mr. Kennedy hit the ground instead of the
bollard, his injuries would have been much less severe because
the catastrophic consequences of the accident were caused by his
head hitting the bollard. The trial judge found that the Board&#146;s
retention of the bollards by the roadway did not constitute a
breach of duty by the Board of Education to users of the roadway
including Mr. Kennedy.  Although the trial judge found no
liability on the respondent, he assessed the damages suffered by
Gregory Kennedy as well as those of the other appellants, his
parents and sisters, under the Family Law Act.
[3]  The issues on appeal are whether the trial judge erred 1) in
not finding that the  Board&#146;s failure to remove the bollards in
the spring of 1986 when it removed the chains between them
constituted a negligent breach of the Board&#146;s obligations to Mr.
Kennedy under the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.322
(now R.S.O. 1990, c.O.2) and the Education Act, R.S.O. 1980,
c.129 (now R.S.O. 1990, c.E.2); and 2) in holding that the
decision not to remove the bollards was a policy decision for
which a government authority cannot be liable.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Gregory Kennedy was born January 28, 1968 and was 18 and
three quarters years old on the date of the accident, October 6,
1986. He was a grade 13 student at Glenview Park Secondary School
in Cambridge, Ontario. He  had obtained his driver&#146;s license when
he was 16 and had been driving a motorcycle to school for
approximately nine months by the date of the accident.
[5]  The school property including the parking lot, the driveway
from the parking lot and the grounds adjacent to the school were
owned by the respondent, Waterloo County Board of Education. In
or around 1977 the Board erected a barrier on the grass around
the school sports field adjacent to the sidewalk. The barrier
bounded the roadway from the front of the school and the student
parking lot and out to the public street. The barrier consisted
of a row of  22 bollards 15 feet apart and connected by chains.
The bollards were made of steel encased in cement, each over
three feet high as well as four feet below ground with a
circumference of six to eight inches. Each was capable of
stopping a moving vehicle.
[6]  The reason for erecting this barrier was because there had
been complaints from neighbours and school staff that vehicles
were driving from the driveway onto the school property including
the track. If the police or anyone came, the vehicles would
proceed out the back to other streets. Mr. Hearn was the
superintendent of physical resources for the Board in 1986 and at
the date of the trial. He testified that in the spring of 1986 he
received a report that a student was swinging on a chain at an
elementary school, fell off and damaged her leg. He also had read
in the newspaper about an incident in a park in Brampton where a
person struck a chain that was blocking a pathway and that a
lawsuit was possible.
[7]  As a result, when he heard about the girl who damaged her
leg on the chain at one of the Board&#146;s schools, he immediately
gave instructions that all chains in the system be removed and
that was done. The bollards, however, were not removed.
[8]  Several eye witnesses testified on their observations of the
accident and the road conditions at the time. Unfortunately,
because of the injuries he suffered, Gregory Kennedy was not able
to give any testimony at the trial. It was clear from the
evidence that was given that Gregory left the parking lot on his
motorcycle, that he was travelling very fast, that he lost
control of the bike on the curve of the road, that the bike hit
the curb, that as a result his body left the bike and when he
landed, he hit his helmeted head  on one of the bollards. There
was also evidence about the state of the road conditions and
whether there was anything on the road which would have caused
the appellant to lose control of the bike.
[9]  As a result of the accident, the appellant suffered almost
total permanent disability including widespread brain injury,
severe cognitive impairment, inability to swallow, inability to
walk, eat or feed himself, inability to talk, and paralysis on
both sides of his body involving the face. He also suffers pain
but cannot communicate where it occurs. Although the trial judge
did not advert to this evidence in his reasons, the evidence was
that the reason the injuries were so severe was because the
appellant&#146;s head hit the bollard, and that had it hit some other
type of barrier such as a chain link fence, his injuries would
have been minor at most.
[10] The trial judge concluded that there were three issues to be
determined in order to decide whether there was any liability of
the respondent. He articulated them in this way:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Firstly, was the plaintiff Greg Kennedy negligent in the
          operation of his motorcycle on October 6, 1986 when the accident
          occurred? Secondly, was there anything related to the road
          conditions under the control of the defendant which caused or
          contributed to the accident? Thirdly, was the retention of the
          bollards adjacent to the roadway a breach of duty by the
          defendant to users of the roadway?
     
</pre>
    <pre>[11] In response to the first two issues, the trial judge
concluded that the cause of the accident (that is the appellant
losing control of his bike and flying off) was the appellant&#146;s
failure in his duty to take reasonable care in the operation of
his motorcycle and not any failure of the respondent in respect
of the conditions of the road. These findings are not challenged
on this appeal.
[12] The trial judge made no finding as to the cause of the
appellant&#146;s injuries as opposed to the cause of the accident
which resulted in the injuries. However, it is implicit in the
third question posed by the trial judge that the impact with the
bollards contributed to the injuries, thereby making the reason
for their presence relevant on the issue of liability.
Furthermore, it was conceded on the appeal that the fact that the
impact with the bollard caused the significant injuries was a non-
contentious issue at trial, and became irrelevant once there was
a finding, in response to the third question, that the respondent
did not breach any duty of care by failing to remove the
bollards.
</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES ON APPEAL
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The central issue on the appeal is whether the trial judge
erred by not finding that the school board&#146;s failure to remove
the bollards when it removed the chains between them was a breach
of its duty to the appellant under the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act,
(s. 3(1)) to take such care as in all the circumstances of the
case was reasonable to see that he was reasonably safe while on
the school premises.
[14] The trial judge came to his conclusion on two bases:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)       He found that the decision by Mr. Hearn not to
               remove the bollards was a policy decision &#147;involving
               considerations of policy, consideration of financial resources
               and restraints and was a decision involving social and economic
               factors&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)   He further found that the decision
               not  to remove the bollards was a proper
               one  and  that &#147;there was no  reasonable
               apprehension of any danger to  users  of
               the   roadway   if  they  followed   the
               contours of the roadway as emphasized by
               the contours of the bollards.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[15] Because the trial judge found no liability on the Board, he
did not address the issue of apportionment of liability between
the appellants and the respondent.
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>a)   Policy v. Operational Decision</pre>
    <pre>[16] In the trilogy of cases beginning with Just v. British
Columbia (1989), 64 D.L.R. (4th) 689, followed by Brown v.
British Columbia (1994), 112 D.L.R. (4th) 1 and Swinamer v. Nova
Scotia (1994), 112 D.L.R (4th) 18, the Supreme Court of Canada
has articulated the basis upon which government bodies can be
liable for negligent conduct.  The earlier decision of the
Supreme Court in Kamloops (City) v. Nielson (1984), 10 D.L.R.
(4th) 641, which followed the House of Lords decision in Anns v.
Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728, made it clear
that a government authority could be held liable for a negligent
act or negligent failure to act in breach of duty to a particular
person to whom it owed a duty of care. However, it was also
recognized that governments do not have unlimited resources.
They are therefore obliged to make policy decisions about how to
allocate those resources, and those decisions may result in less
than complete protection to each person to whom they may
otherwise owe a duty of care in a particular situation.
[17] In Just, the court held that where a government authority
owes a duty of care because of a relationship of sufficient
proximity with the plaintiff, the government authority may be
exempted from that duty of care and from any liability from what
would have been a breach of that duty in two circumstances: The
first is where it has made a true policy decision as to how and
to what extent it will devote resources to fulfilling that duty,
as opposed to an operational decision implementing the policy
decision: &#147;True policy decisions should be exempt from tortious
claims so that governments are not  restricted in making
decisions based upon social, political or economic factors.
However, the implementation of those decisions may well be
subject to claims in tort.&#148; (p. 705).  The second circumstance is
where there is an express statutory exemption.
[18] Cory J. for the majority summarized the applicable
principles in the following way at pp.708-9:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It may be convenient at this stage to summarize what I
          consider to be the principles applicable and the manner of
          proceeding in cases of this kind.  As a general rule, the
          traditional tort law duty of care will apply to a government
          agency in the same way that it will apply to an individual.  In
          determining whether a duty of care exists, the first question to
          be resolved is whether the parties are in a relationship of
          sufficient proximity to warrant the imposition of such a duty.
          In the case of a government agency, exemption from this
          imposition of duty may occur as a result of an explicit statutory
          exemption.  Alternatively, the exemption may arise as a result of
          the nature of the decision made by the government agency.  That
          is, a government agency will be exempt from the imposition of a
          duty of care in situations which arise from its pure policy
          decisions.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In determining what constitutes such  a
          policy  decision, it should be borne in  mind
          that  such  decisions are generally  made  by
          persons of a high level of authority  in  the
          agency,  but  may also properly  be  made  by
          persons  of a lower level of authority.   The
          characterization of such a decision rests  on
          the  nature  of the decision and not  on  the
          identity  of the actors.  As a general  rule,
          decisions concerning budgetary allotments for
          departments  or government agencies  will  be
          classified as policy decisions.  Further,  it
          must  be  recalled that a policy decision  is
          open to challenge on the basis that it is not
          made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.
          If after due consideration it is found that a
          duty of care is owed by the government agency
          and  no exemption by way of statute or policy
          decision-making   is  found   to   exist,   a
          traditional  torts analysis  ensues  and  the
          issue  of  standard of care required  of  the
          government agency must next be considered.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The manner and quality of an inspection
          system  is  clearly part of  the  operational
          aspect  of a governmental activity and  falls
          to  be  assessed in the consideration of  the
          standard  of care issue.  At this stage,  the
          requisite  standard of care to be applied  to
          the particular operation must be assessed  in
          light  of  all  the surrounding circumstances
          including,  for example, budgetary restraints
          and  the  availability of qualified personnel
          and equipment.</pre>
    <pre>[19] One issue which was not specifically addressed in the three
cases is whether the policy/operational analysis can have any
application where the duty of care on the government agency does
not arise as a result of a relationship of proximity, but where
it is imposed by statute. In such a case, can there be room for a
policy decision to be made which would in any way exempt the
government agency from its statutory duty? In effect, the
legislature has already made its policy decision by mandating the
statutory duty.
[20] This was pointed out by Sopinka J. in his dissenting
judgment in Just. He stated at p. 690 that the issue in that case
was &#147;the liability for negligence of a public body in the absence
of a breach of a statutory duty of care&#148;. (Emphasis added.) He
said that the analysis of the House of Lords in Anns applied
strictly where a statute confers a power on a government agency,
as opposed to a duty, and that it was only in those situations
that the law had been altered by that case. He concluded at p.
693: &#147;If a statutory duty to the plaintiff is breached, the
private duty based on the neighbourhood principle is
unnecessary.&#148;  Although this conclusion may appear to be self-
evident, the majority decision makes no direct reference to the
distinction.
[21] However, both in Just and in Swinamer, Cory J., speaking for
the majority, uses language which could be said to suggest that
he was interpreting the relevant statutory provisions as imposing
a statutory obligation on the Ministry of Highways to repair the
highways.  In my view, a fair reading of that language
demonstrates a different purpose for his references.
[22] In his analysis in Just, Cory J. first found that the
province owed a duty of care of reasonable maintenance to users
of its highways based on its invitation to the public to use
those highways - that is, a common law duty of care.  He then
went on to examine the provisions of the Highway Act, R.S.B.C.
1979, c. 167, the Ministry of Transportation and Highways Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 280 and the Crown Proceeding Act, R.S.B.C.
1979, c. 86. The first two Acts allow the Minister to maintain a
highway and give the Minister the management of highway
maintenance and repair. The third Act limits the Crown&#146;s
liability as a highway authority to that of a municipality. He
then concluded that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               On their face these statutory provisions do not appear to
          absolve the respondent from its duty of care to maintain the
          highways reasonably.  Rather, by inference they appear to place
          an obligation on the province to maintain its highways at least
          to the same extent that a municipality is obligated to repair its
          roads.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The reference to the statutory provisions placing an
&#147;obligation&#148; on the province to maintain the highways arises in
the course of analyzing the relevant statutes to determine
whether they contain a specific exemption from liability or duty.
The court found, to the contrary, that the statutory language
supported the duty of care based on the common law proximity test
already applied. In so concluding however, the court  does not,
in my view, purport to identify a specific duty imposed by the
statute to maintain the highways to a specific standard. Such a
duty would, by itself, impose a public law duty of care on the
Minister.
[24] Support for this view may be found in the later decision in
Swinamer v. Nova Scotia where the Nova Scotia statutory language
of ss. 4 and 5 of the Public Highways Act R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 371,
granting authority to the Minister over highway construction and
maintenance, is similar to that in British Columbia, except that
the final clause of s. 5 adds that: &#147;&#133; nothing in this Act
compels or obliges the Minister to construct or maintain any
highway or to expend money on any highway&#148;. Again speaking for
the majority, Cory J. first observed at p. 26 that the two
sections &#147;indicate that there is a duty to maintain.&#148; However, on
p. 27 he went on to conclude:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I would agree that the presence of a discretion such as that
          provided in s. 5 might in some circumstances support an argument
          that there is no statutory duty to maintain. However, in my view,
          the absence of a provision providing a specific statutory
          obligation to maintain is not sufficient to exempt the Crown from
          the general common law duty of care owed to users of the highway.
          The duty to maintain arises out of the relationship that exists
          between the Department of Transportation and the users of the
          highways.  If the department is to be exempted from liability for
          negligent conduct in the course of its duty to maintain the
          highway, the wording of the statutory exemption should be clear
          and precise.  Section 5 does not, in my view, exempt the
          Department of Transportation from liability arising from
          negligent conduct in highway maintenance. 1</pre>
    <pre>[25] This analysis by Cory J. demonstrates his meaning. The duty
of care arises at common law. The statutory language granting the
power to build and maintain highways supports the finding of a
duty, while the language of discretion or no obligation to
maintain is not specific enough to provide a statutory exemption
from that duty.
[26] In my view, therefore, there is nothing in the majority
decisions which derogates from Sopinka J.&#146;s statement in his
opening sentence in Just, that that case did not involve a
statutory duty but only a statutory power. Therefore, the
policy/operational dichotomy and the exempting effect of a policy
decision, are not applicable where a duty of care is imposed by
statute rather than arising at common law.
[27] The applicable statute in this case is the Occupiers&#146;
Liability Act, which imposes a statutory duty and civil liability
for breach of that duty. This is significant in the context of
the two types of statute which impose a duty. In one, the statute
provides either a criminal penalty for non-compliance or no
specific consequence. In The Queen v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool
(1983), 143 D.L.R. (3d) 9, the Supreme Court of Canada held that
in a case where a statute does not provide for civil liability
for its breach, and such a breach gives rise to damage, then the
breach will be treated as evidence of negligence, but the statute
does not create a separate cause of action for statutory breach.
This was recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Ryan v. City of Victoria (1999), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 513 at p. 526.
[28] The Occupiers&#146; Liability Act is the second type of statute
which imposes a duty. It provides for civil liability for its
breach. Section 2 of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act  states that
the Act replaces the common law obligations of an occupier of
premises to persons who enter on the premises and the liability
in respect of those obligations. Section 3(1) prescribes the
statutory duty:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as in
          all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that
          persons entering on the premises, and the property brought on the
          premises by those persons are reasonably safe while on the
          premises.
</pre>
    <pre>[29] There is no issue in this case that the statute is binding
on the respondent. The statute places a positive duty on all
occupiers of premises as set out in s.3(1) and provides civil
liability for breach of that duty. Therefore, the only issue can
be whether the respondent breached the duty of care it owed to
the appellant under s. 3(1).
[30] Section 3(1) not only imposes a duty of care, it also
prescribes the standard of care. In deciding whether the
respondent breached the prescribed standard, the court is to
consider &#147;all the circumstances of the case&#148;. In the case of a
government authority such circumstances could include its
financial resources, as with a policy decision. It is also to
apply a standard of reasonableness both as to the degree of care
to be taken and the degree of safety to be provided. However, it
was not open to the Board for financial or other reasons, to make
a &#147;policy decision&#148; to absolve itself from or reduce its
statutory obligation.
[31] In this case, therefore, the trial judge erred in applying
the policy/operational analysis where the Occupiers&#146; Liability
Act prescribes the statutory duty and the standard of care and
provides civil liability for breach of that duty. The Board could
not make a policy decision which would either oblige or allow it
to avoid compliance with its statutory obligation. Therefore, if
the decision not to remove the bollards when the chains were
removed was a breach of the statutory duty on the Board pursuant
to its obligations under the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act,  it is no
defence to say that the Board made a policy decision to exempt
itself from that duty.
[32] However, in any event, if it were relevant to determine
whether that decision was a true policy decision, in my view the
trial judge erred in failing to consider the bona fides of the
decision of Mr. Hearn. At no point in his evidence did Mr. Hearn
suggest that he considered the potential risks of leaving the
bollards in place against the cost of removing them, which was
disclosed in his cross-examination to be minimal. If Mr. Hearn
made a conscious decision to leave the bollards in place, there
is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he bona fide
considered all of the relevant factors before making that
decision. I note that there is no document evidencing any such
decision having been made at the time. Therefore, the trial judge
both failed to consider the bona fides of that decision in the
context of the duty of the Board under the Occupiers&#146; Liability
Act and misapprehended the evidence, in that there was no
weighing by the respondent of the necessary and relevant factors
to be considered regarding the status of the bollards when the
decision was made to remove the chains. Therefore the finding
that the decision was a policy decision &#147;based on considerations
of policy, financial resources and constraints and social and
economic factors&#148; is unsupported by the evidence and cannot

    <pre>b)   Did the Respondent Breach the Statutory Duty under the
     Occupiers&#146; Liability Act by Failing to Remove the Bollards?</pre>
    <pre>[33]    It has been clear since the decision of the Supreme Court
of Canada in Waldick v. Malcolm (1991), 83 D.L.R. (4th) 114 that
s. 3(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act places an affirmative
duty on occupiers to take reasonable care for the safety of those
whom they permit onto their premises. Furthermore, as Iacobucci
J. said at p. 124:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The statutory duty on occupiers&#133;is to take reasonable care
          in the circumstances to make the premises safe. That duty does
          not change but the factors which are relevant to an assessment of
          what constitutes reasonable care will necessarily be very
          specific to each fact situation &#150; thus the proviso &#145;such care as
          in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable&#146;.</pre>
    <pre>[34] In Veinot v. Kerr-Addison Mines Ltd., [1975] 2 S.C.R. 311 at
317, Dickson J., speaking for the majority, quoted with approval
several factors listed by Lord Denning on the issue of whether an
occupier has taken reasonable care:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The following excerpt from Lord Denning&#146;s judgment [Pannett
          v. McGuinness &amp; Co. Ltd., [1972] 3 W.L.R. 387] aptly expresses in
          my opinion the more salient points a judge should have in mind
          when considering intrusions upon land:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  long and short of it is  that
               you  have to take into account  all  the
               circumstances of the case and  see  then
               whether the occupier ought to have done more
               than he did.  (1)  You must apply your common
               sense.   You must take into account  the
               gravity  and likelihood of the  probable
               injury.  Ultra-hazardous activities require a
               man to be ultra-cautious in carrying them
               out.  The more dangerous the activity, the
               more he should take steps to see that no one
               is injured by it.  (2)  You must take into
               account also the character of the intrusion
               by the trespasser.  A wandering child or a
               straying adult stands in a different position
               from a poacher or a burglar.  You may expect
               a child when you may not expect a burglar.
               (3)  You must also have regard to the nature
               of the place where the trespass occurs.  An
               electrified railway line or a warehouse being
               demolished may require more precautions to be
               taken than a private house.  (4)  You must
               also take into account the knowledge which
               the defendant has, or ought to have, of the
               likelihood of trespassers being present.  The
               more likely they are, the more precautions
               may have to be taken.



</pre>
    <pre>i)   The Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[35] Several witnesses, called by both sides, in the course of
their evidence on the state of the roadway, expressed a view on
the issue of  whether the bollards posed any danger. Some of
these witnesses were called as experts, while others were people
who had some involvement with the school or with the decision
with respect to removal of the chains and not the bollards in the
spring of 1986 or with investigating the accident.
[36] The appellants&#146; first expert was David Sanderson, former
director of public works for the City of Cambridge. The trial
judge noted that he was qualified as an expert on municipal
facilities who visited the site of the accident shortly before
the trial. On the issue of the bollards Mr. Sanderson was
examined as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.        Sir, I understand also when you were looking at
               both of these pictures, 14-4 and 14-12, you also looked at some
               steel pipes?&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   They&#146;re steel corrugated iron pipes
               that  had been filled with concrete that
               seem  to  me to be there for  no  useful
               purpose.  They must have been there  for
               a  reason, but they certain didn&#146;t serve
               anything  to make safe vehicle  traffic,
               or   even   safe   pedestrian   traffic.
               They&#146;re  on  the  wrong  side   of   the
               sidewalk.  When I was up there on Monday
               night, they&#146;re all out except five  that
               are on the bend, further down the road.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    But  in 1986 it appears that  they
               were there?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And from those pictures, do you see
               any chains between them?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    In  your experience, what we  went
               through in the C.V., had you seen  these
               types  of  posts before used as  warning
               devices?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.    Not  for the purpose that  they&#146;re
               there.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Do you know the purpose they  were
               there?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I have no idea.</pre>
    <pre>[37] The appellants also called Duane O&#146;Connor as an expert
engineer on the issue of roadways, who also had experience
working for the Hamilton Board of Education. He said that
bollards without chains are ineffective as a barrier, and in fact
became a hazard. Without chains in order to prevent vehicles from
going onto the playing field the bollards should have been spaced
no more than 6 feet apart and not 15 feet. He said that the most
common barrier to keep people off school property is chain link
fencing, which is also effective as a visual cue and to keep
vehicles off the school property as well. In cross-examination,
Mr. O&#146;Connor acknowledged that the bollards painted yellow would
act as a visual cue of a curve in the road. He also acknowledged
that they only pose a danger for vehicles which do not remain on
the travelled portion of the roadway. He agreed that in designing
roadways, it was a reasonable expectation that vehicles would
stay on the travelled portion of the road. He also agreed that a
tree, a hydro pole and a hydrant could create a similar danger on
impact as the bollards. On re-examination he said that a fire
hydrant and hydro pole by a school have utility for the school,
but he believed that a bollard without a chain was not used
properly.
[38]  Anthony Butler was also called as a witness by the
appellants. He was a very experienced  architect who had devoted
a large part of his practice to the design and supervision of the
construction and renovation of schools and other educational
facilities. He had personally designed and supervised the
construction or renovation of 30 educational facilities including
the buildings, the grounds, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks
and landscaping. He was qualified as an expert on the design,
construction, renovation and maintenance of  education centres
and schools.
[39] Mr. Butler testified that when designing a school or a
school renovation the matter of paramount importance to him is
student safety. He testified in examination in chief as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.        When you&#146;re planning and designing a school site,
               a school premises either in the first instance, or by renovation,
               what&#146;s the one matter of paramount importance or concern to you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.     The  safety  of  students.   It&#146;s
               incumbent upon the designer of a  school
               to  ensure  that the site  design  takes
               into  account  any activity  that  might
               occur  on  the  site.   Obviously,  it&#146;s
               impossible   to  predict  every-anything
               that  a  student might get up to because
               children  are  pretty creative  in  that
               respect.   But  it&#146;s not  sufficient  to
               simply  follow guidelines  or  standards
               which in themselves are minimums.   It&#146;s
               necessary  to go beyond that and  to  be
               prudent  in  not  creating  a  situation
               which  might  become  a  hazard  in  the
               future.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    What  about the areas of  activity
               for  students  as opposed to  driveways,
               parking  lots  for vehicular  travel  or
               usage?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.    There has to be a clear separation
               obviously.   In elementary schools,  the
               teachers&#146;  parking lot, which is  always
               on   the  site  and  in  many  cases  is
               adjacent  to a play area which  is  also
               paved,  has to be fenced off to separate
               it.   When  you  get  to  the  secondary
               school level, the potential dangers  are
               greater  because some of  the  students,
               the older students are allowed to drive-
               able  to  drive  and so the  driving  of
               vehicles  by students is a consideration
               as  well.  So the design of the site has
               to    take   into   account   preventing
               occurrences  which might injure  people,
               or  prevent  people from getting  on  to
               parts  of the property that they  should
               not be on in a vehicle.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    In  the  past, have you  and  your
               colleagues  been involved in  a  project
               similar to that which you saw either  by
               personal    attendance   or    in    the
               photographs to Glenview Park?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.  As a matter of fact, our high
               school  in Hamilton, we designed  called
               St.  Thomas  More has a  fairly  similar
               situation, namely a football field  with
               a running track around it and a driveway
               adjacent.  In that case - and there&#146;s  a
               change  of  level  between  the  playing
               field and the driveway.  So all of those
               conditions exist at Glenview  Park.   At
               St.   Thomas  More,  we  separated   the
               driveway  from the playing  field  by  a
               chain link fence which is I think in  my
               notes  I said 1.9 metres which is  about
               six  feet  high to prevent  people  from
               succumbing to the temptation, you  might
               say,  to  drive  a  vehicle  on  to  the
               running   track,  which  is   a   lovely
               inviting  surface to run  a  four  wheel
               drive  around, or something  like  that.
               By  putting a fence between the driveway
               and  the  playing field, we put  -  made
               that  impossible.  The fence has a  maze
               type    of    entrance   which    allows
               pedestrians   to   pass   through,   but
               prohibits even a motorbike or a  bicycle
               from being taken through it.  So that as
               far  as  is  possible, any  one  who  is
               tempted  to  try it would be  unable  to
               take a wheeled vehicle of any sort on to
               the running track.  The change of level,
               of course, is pertinent to Glenview Park
               because   there&#146;s  also  the   potential
               hazard of - that if somebody gets out of
               control   when  they&#146;re  driving   their
               vehicle, they might inadvertently go off
               the  road  and on to the playing  field,
               and  the  chain link fence,  of  course,
               effectively prevents that as well.</pre>
    <pre>[40] Mr. Butler also testified that the most effective barrier to
stop out of control vehicles from entering onto a playing field
is a formed metal guardrail for high speed traffic, but for a
school property, a chain link fence is quite effective as it acts
as a visual barrier but also has resilience to absorb the impact
and direct the vehicle back to the roadway.
[41] He expressed the opinion that bollards with chains linking
them was not an appropriate nor effective installation to
separate a roadway from a field. He referred to its use as
symbolic only, ineffective as a barrier with the chains if hit by
a vehicle, and useless as a barrier once the chains are removed.
He said a bollard would be used in static situations to protect a
gas meter on a corner or to prevent a car from parking near an
emergency exit.
[42] In cross-examination Mr. Butler was challenged as to the
danger from the bollards as opposed to the fire hydrant, the
hydro pole, the flag pole and the tree all on the school board
property adjacent to the roadway. He responded that the bollards
were functionless after the chains were removed and one of them
caused the injury in this case. He also believed that had Mr.
Kennedy hit a guard rail at the angle he hit the bollard, he
would have been deflected and his injury would have been less
serious than from hitting the bollard.
[43] In the course of his extensive review of the evidence, the
trial judge made no reference at all to the evidence of Mr.
Butler.
[44] Dr. Peter Knight, also called by the appellants, had
extensive qualifications as a trauma surgeon and as an expert in
vehicle crash injuries and their cause. He testified that Mr.
Kennedy&#146;s head hit the bollard coming to a dead stop because the
bollard was immovable, resulting in the devastating injury to his
head. Although Mr. Kennedy&#146;s head stopped, his body continued
around and suffered very little injury, only a bruise on his hip
where he landed on the pavement. He gave the opinion that had the
bollard not been there, Mr. Kennedy would have kept going and
landed on the grass. He was unlikely to have sustained any
significant injury. Had he hit the middle of a chain link fence,
he likely would have sustained minimal injury. Had he hit a pole
of a chain link fence, the damage would still have been
significantly less than from hitting a bollard. In cross-
examination, Dr. Knight agreed that hitting a tree, a hydro pole
or a fire hydrant would cause the same injury to the head as
hitting the bollard, because they are also immovable objects, but
that hitting a highway steel guardrail would not necessarily have
the same effect because the body would be redirected as with the
chain link fence, and not come to a dead stop like the head
hitting the bollard. Dr. Knight&#146;s evidence was also not referred
to by the trial judge in his review of the evidence.
[45] Dr. Gregory McNeice is a physician and an engineer and was
called by the appellants to give expert evidence on impact trauma
or biomechanics. The trial judge recognized his qualifications in
various fields of science as &#147;overwhelming&#148;. The trial judge
noted the witness&#146;s evidence about Mr. Kennedy&#146;s injuries and
also that Mr. Kennedy was travelling at a velocity of 30 to 33
km/hour after he left the motorcycle. Dr. McNeice also confirmed
that had the bollard not been there,  Mr. Kennedy would have
impacted with the grass and would probably not have suffered any
serious injury.
[46] The respondent first called Staff Sergeant Roy Hibbard, the
police officer called to the scene of the accident. The trial
judge referred to his testimony with respect to the state of the
road on October 6, 1986. In cross-examination the officer gave
the opinion that the bollards would not prevent a vehicle from
passing onto the field and performed no safety function as they
stood. He had not seen a row of bollards around the driveway of
any other school.
[47] The respondent called two expert witnesses on the issue of
the bollards. Dr. Geoffrey Brown is an architect with extensive
experience in school design and construction including the
walkways, driveways, playing fields and all parts of the
facilities. He was asked to make a report on the bollards. In his
opinion, the bollards with the chains removed were not a hazard.
They were well clear of the roadway &#147;and under normal
circumstances would be, in our view, acceptable for the purposes
that they were intended, to discourage vehicles from entering
onto the playing field area.&#148; He went on to say that there are
other immovable objects frequently found adjacent to roadways.
In cross-examination, Dr. Brown, who had had 30 years in
practice, said that he had never seen nor used a row of bollards
and chains along a 300 foot driveway, nor had he seen bollards
without the chains except in a situation where a small number of
bollards were used to protect the side of a building, but not to
deter traffic from entering onto a playing field. He agreed in
examination in chief that safety is of prime importance in
designing school facilities but pointed out that there are also
many other factors which are considered in design including
budget and aesthetics. In  cross-examination he agreed that with
respect to driveway design and maintenance in a secondary school
where students are driving, the safety of those students is of
paramount importance.
[48] Andrew McConnell was an engineer who had worked for his
entire career with the Ministry of Transportation or its
predecessors. He was qualified as an expert in highway design,
planning and safety. However, he had no experience  with the
construction of school driveways other than joining them to the
adjacent highway. He described the bollards as being 7 inches in
diameter, 3 feet high, located 10 inches behind the sidewalk and
1.25 meters from the travelled portion of the road. He said that
the bollards painted yellow would deliver a message to vehicles
of the curve of the road and that vehicles should not be there.
He said other devices used for that purpose are the curbs, signs,
noise barriers and illumination poles. He said that the bollards
presented  no danger to ordinary users of the roadway because
they were not on the roadway. &#147;They were off the roadway, and if
one uses the roadway for its intended purpose, the bollards just
don&#146;t come into play.&#148;
[49] Mr. Michael Hearn had been employed by the respondent since
1967. At the date of the accident and at trial he was the
superintendent of physical resources for the Waterloo County
Board of Education. At that time there were 105 schools under the
Board&#146;s jurisdiction, 15 of which were secondary schools. Mr.
Hearn was responsible for planning, budgeting, hiring, placement,
professional development and utilization of staff and other
resources, plus day to day functions including plant maintenance
and construction, plant custodial services, occupational health
and safety, and environment.
[50] There was no written procedure for reporting maintenance
needs, but the principals and supervisors had the responsibility
to report any needs. Mr. Hearn&#146;s group would then determine
priorities and whether the requested maintenance would proceed.
[51] Mr. Hearn had nothing to do with the placing of the bollards
and chains in 1977.  At that time his position was Administrator
of Materials. However, he testified based on his investigation,
that the reason they were erected was because the Board had
received a considerable number of complaints from the neighbours
and school staff that vehicles were going from the driveway onto
the Board property, using the track facilities, and using the
property as a shortcut to other streets.
[52] He testified that the purposes of the bollards and chains
were to highlight where cars were not to go,  to protect the
grounds from wear and tear from vehicles, and as they were
painted yellow, to indicate the curve of the roadway. He
estimated that in 1986 there were 10 schools in the district with
bollards or bollards and chains.
[53] In the spring of 1986 it was reported to Mr. Hearn that a
student had been  swinging on a chain at an elementary school in
Cambridge, had fallen off and had damaged her leg. He had also
read in the paper of an incident in Brampton where a person
struck a chain that was blocking a pathway and that a lawsuit
might have followed. Upon hearing about the child who injured a
leg, he immediately instructed Mr. Hammer, the Board&#146;s
maintenance foreman, to remove all the chains in the system. The
decision was his alone. He did not, however, instruct Mr. Hammer
to remove the bollards at any of the schools because they were
serving the purpose of  acting as a caution to people not to
proceed onto Board property.  Because the Board has very limited
financial capacity, if the bollards  were serving a purpose, they
were left in place. Even after the accident, he said, the
bollards were not removed as they were still serving a legitimate
purpose, and the budget priority was that in providing the
students with a safe and healthy work environment, the buildings
would come first and the grounds second in priority.
[54] Mr. Hearn was asked directly in examination in chief whether
the Board gave any thought to replacing the bollards and chains
with any other device. He answered, no. Again, he said this was
because they had no funding for it as there were greater
priorities within the school and the system.
[55] Mr. Hearn also confirmed that the respondent Board owns the
school property including the driveway and parking lot, where
students were allowed to park cars and motorcycles.
[56] In cross-examination Mr. Hearn was asked if the purpose of
the bollards and chains was to keep vehicles off the grounds. He
answered that the purpose was to have a visible barrier to remind
people not to go onto the area, and that applied even to the
bollard right beside the school building where it was still
possible for a vehicle to proceed down onto the grounds. He said
that &#147;we&#146;ve had every kind of incident happen to us at every
school that you can imagine and I guess it was whoever installed
those at the time, and I&#146;m not sure who did it, felt that the
line should be complete&#148;.
[57] He was asked about the bollard next to the one adjacent to
the school building, and whether any cars went onto the grounds
at that point. He said it was possible that the traffic could
flow through at that point and that vehicles were definitely
going down  there late in the evening before the bollards and
chains were put up.
[58] He agreed that there is a frost fence all around the grounds
of the school except where the bollards are. He also agreed that
a frost fence can also serve as a visual cue not to go off the
roadway, as can signs, although Mr. Hearn said that from his
experience, people would not obey a sign.
[59] In 1986, the Board budget for plant operations was
approximately $34 million. The budget for capital expenditures
was over and above that amount. The driveway is approximately 300
feet long, and at the date of  trial, a frost fence cost $9 per
linear foot to construct. Therefore it would have cost
approximately $2700 at the date of trial, and less in 1986. Mr.
Hearn said, however, that they could not put up a frost fence
because their priority is for the interior of the buildings,
roofing and boilers. He said that they try to put some money into
paving and fencing from time to time &#147;but it&#146;s a very low
priority.&#148;
[60] Mr. Hearn agreed that within the context of his $34 million
budget, if they had the money and the bollards were determined to
constitute an unsafe situation, the estimated $15,000 would be
spent to remove them and to erect a frost fence.
[61] Mr. Hearn also agreed that once the chains came down, people
could drive down the hill onto the grounds. Because the bollards
were not a physical barrier, their only purpose was as a visual
deterrent not to go onto the property, race around or be a
nuisance to the neighbours.
[62] In 1990 or 1991 all but six of the bollards were removed to
make way for construction of a bus bay. They were not replaced.
[63] Mr. Hearn acknowledged that in making the decision to remove
the chains, he took into account the risk to students who would
be using the school roadway and would have differing levels of
driving experience. However, in respect of the bollards, he said
that they required certain things on school property to protect
the Board&#146;s interest, and they could not &#147;adapt to individual
cases where people are not going to use good judgment.&#148;  He also
acknowledged that no consideration was given to placing a
cushioning device around the bollards as is done for the football
goalposts during games. He said this was because they could not
be protected from vandalism.
[64] George Hammer was called by the appellants. He was the
foreman responsible for driveways, maintenance and grounds. He
had executed Mr. Hearn&#146;s instructions to take down the chains at
all schools in April, 1986. He was neither qualified as an
expert, nor was he a decision-maker. Although he agreed with
counsel in cross-examination that one reason the bollards were
left standing would be to act as a visual indication to vehicles
not to mount the curb and go onto the playing field, and in re-
examination he was asked and indicated other means of giving a
visual cue, this evidence was not noted nor commented upon by the
trial judge, and clearly not relied on in his conclusions about
the bollards.
[65] Two principals from the school were called. The appellants
called Nicholas Speropoulos, principal of Glenview Park Secondary
School from September 1974 to June 1986. He was the principal
both when the bollards and chains were erected and when the
chains were removed. He left in June 1986, and was no longer at
the school when the accident occurred in October. He testified
that he was not consulted about the installation of the bollards
and chains. His understanding was that the Board saw the school
property  as an asset to be protected and enhanced and that was
the purpose of the installation. He confirmed that he was aware
of no serious accidents involving the bollards or chains while he
was there.
[66] He also was not consulted about the removal of the chains.
His understanding at the time was that there was an incident
involving a youngster on a dirt bike who hit a chain and suffered
serious injury and who was successful in a lawsuit over the
incident. He believed that a decision was made at least at the
&#147;Board office level&#148; to remove the chains and therefore the
potential hazard. He gave his opinion as principal of the school
that without the chains the bollards marked the area between the
sidewalk and the roadway and the school, but they served no
practical function. He said with 20/20 hindsight, they were a
danger and a hazard.
[67] Mr. Speropoulos advised that when he was at the school there
was a designated parking area for the motorcycles, and that in
good weather, there were ten of them.
[68] In cross-examination he agreed that one purpose of the
bollards along the driveway would be, together with the curb,
both painted yellow, to warn motorists coming from the street
that this was now school property and not for road traffic. He
said that the fact of the appellant&#146;s accident has proved that
leaving the bollards in place was a danger, and that he would
have insisted they be taken down had he thought of it. He said
that motorcyclists were not given any special instructions by the
school about the operation of their motorcycles and that he would
not expect them to go onto the playing field.
[69] The respondent called Paul Atkinson who was principal of
Glenview beginning in September 1986, and who had also served as
vice-principal there for one year in 1980. He had no recollection
of the bollards from 1980 but was aware of the row of yellow
concrete posts (bollards) in September 1986. In the same area
were one or  two hydro poles, a flag pole, a fire hydrant and
some evergreen shrubs. He did not direct his mind to the presence
of the concrete posts without the chains. There was a designated
area for motorcycles to park where they could be observed from
the school office, as students tended to congregate around them.
There were speed limit signs posted for 15 km/hr in the parking
lot and the driveway. There were also both oral and written
instructions to the students about safe parking and driving of
vehicles on school property.
[70] Mr. Atkinson explained that after an accident on school
property, normally a vice-principal would collect information and
a risk management form would be filed with the Board. Mr.
Atkinson did not inspect the scene nor personally make any report
nor memorandum about the accident at the time, but he did after
the lawsuit was commenced. He said that there was no reason for
him to go to the scene to ensure that something similar would not
happen again because in his mind the probability of a similar
occurrence in the future was virtually negligible. He agreed that
the health and well-being of the students is a paramount
consideration but that there was no reason to remove the bollards
and the expenditure to do so was a consideration. He said that
although he agreed with the suggestion that Mr. Kennedy&#146;s
injuries would not have occurred as they did had the bollards not
been there, he pointed out that that reasoning did not mean that
the flag pole, the hydrant, telephone poles or parking meters
would be taken down.



</pre>
    <pre>ii)  Analysis by the Trial Judge</pre>
    <pre>[71] In his reasons the trial judge carried out an extensive
review of the evidence as it related to all of the issues, which
included reconstructing how the accident happened, the issue of
whether the road conditions caused the motorcycle to swerve and
Mr. Kennedy to lose control, as well as the history of the
bollards and the effect on Mr. Kennedy of hitting the bollard
with his helmeted head at great speed after being thrown from the
motorcycle. He then made his findings on liability by answering
the three questions which he found arose from the evidence.
[72] In answering the first question and assessing whether Mr.
Kennedy was negligent, the trial judge referred to the duty of a
principal under s. 236 of the Education Act, &#147;to give assiduous
attention to the health and comfort of pupils, to the
cleanliness, temperature and ventilation of the school, to the
care of all teaching materials and other school property and to
the condition and appearance of the school buildings and
grounds&#148;.  He held that that section had no application where an
18 year old student was driving a motorcycle on a driveway. There
was no void in supervision of the student which caused or
contributed to his injury. He concluded that &#147;the driver of the
motorcycle was the author of his own misfortune&#148;.
[73] The trial judge then went on to consider the second
question, whether the road conditions caused or contributed to
the accident. The trial judge referred to s. 3(1) of the
Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, and concluded that there was no defect
in the roadway in the area where Mr. Kennedy applied his brake,
that he was very familiar with the road and that he &#147;failed
entirely in his duty to take reasonable care in the operation of
his motorcycle&#148;.
[74] In dealing with the third question, whether the retention of
the bollards adjacent to the roadway was a breach of duty to its
users, the trial judge discussed whether the decision not to
remove the bollards was a policy or operational decision and
concluded that it was a policy decision. He then made a finding
that the decision was a proper one based on the two
considerations of budget restraints and because the bollards
served a purpose as a visual barrier for trespassers and a visual
cue for drivers as to the curve of the roadway. Finally he
concluded that &#147;there was no reasonable apprehension of any
danger to users of the highway if they followed the contours of
the roadway as emphasized by the contours of the bollards&#148;.
[75] In his analysis of the third question, the trial judge did
not refer to s. 3(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, and whether
the failure to remove the bollards was a breach of the Board&#146;s
duty as prescribed by that Act. The appellants submit that the
approach of the trial judge to this issue constituted an error of
law. They further submit that this is evidenced by the manner in
which the trial judge framed the issue of whether the bollards
constituted a danger, that is, by concluding that they were not a
danger to those who stayed on the road and who therefore did not
come into contact with the bollards. They submit that this
conclusion begs the question whether it was reasonably
foreseeable that teenage students in a high school setting could
have an accident where a vehicle or a person without a vehicle
could leave the road or sidewalk, strike a bollard and thereby
suffer very serious injury.
[76] I agree with the appellants that the trial judge erred in
law, first, by failing to consider and address the Board&#146;s duty
of care under s. 3(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act when
considering the third issue relating to the bollards, and,
second, by failing to consider whether the bollards could
constitute a danger in their position on school property where
vehicles, including motorcycles, were driven by students, and
where there was a history of vehicles driving off the road and
onto school property.
[77] Section 3(1) places a positive obligation on the Board as
occupier of the entire school premises to &#147;take such care as in
all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that
persons entering on the premises, and the property brought on the
premises by those persons are reasonably safe while on the
premises&#148;.  As noted above, although the trial judge made no
specific finding on this issue, the evidence was clear, and the
respondent does not dispute, that had the appellant not hit the
bollard, he would not have suffered such severe, catastrophic
injuries. Therefore the presence of the bollard that Mr. Kennedy
hit made the premises unsafe for him on the date of the accident.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)     Did the Respondent Breach its Duty of Care Under the
Statute?</pre>
    <pre>[78] The Board erected the bollards and chains in 1977. The court
was not asked to consider the propriety of that decision and
action by the Board, nor was it suggested that there was any
breach of duty by the Board in so doing at that time. The issue
in the action arose out of the fact that the Board, through its
authorized delegate or agent, Mr. Hearn, made a decision in the
spring of 1986 that the chains posed a hazard or a danger both to
people with vehicles as well as to people without vehicles and
therefore decided to remove that hazard by removing all of the
chains at every school within the Board. In my view it is a fair
reading of the evidence that no consideration was given at that
time to whether the bollards along the driveway of  the Glenview
Park Secondary School themselves posed any danger or hazard and,
therefore, should also have been removed. The trial judge fairly,
and I believe accurately, concluded with respect to the evidence
of both Mr. Hearn and  Mr. Speropoulos, the principal at the
time, that &#147;the potential for someone coming in serious physical
contact was not imagined&#148;. It was Mr. Speropoulos&#146; evidence that
had he realized the danger, he would have asked that the bollards
be removed. In his view, once the accident happened he believed
that the bollards were a danger. In contrast, after the accident,
Mr. Speropoulos&#146; successor, Mr. Atkinson, still believed that a
similar accident was unlikely to occur again and, therefore, the
bollards did not have to be removed even after the accident.
</pre>
    <pre>[79] The issue for the court to decide, in the context of all the
circumstances, is whether in order to make the school premises
reasonably safe for students, the Board should have removed the
bollards when it removed the chains in the spring of 1986.  In my
view the answer is yes.
</pre>
    <pre>[80] In this case, the first circumstance is that the premises in
question are a school and the occupier is the school Board. Under
s.236 of the Education Act  the principal, an employee of the
Board, has a duty to give assiduous attention to the health and
comfort of the pupils and to the condition of the school grounds.
Both principals who testified, as well as Mr. Hearn, acknowledged
that a paramount concern of the school Board is the safety of the
students, and it was acknowledged by the witnesses with expertise
and experience in school construction that safety for the
students is a major factor in school design and construction.
</pre>
    <pre>[81] At this location there was a known history of vehicles
driving onto the playground. In fact, Mr. Hearn testified that
they had had &#147;every kind of incident happen&#148; which was why he
believed in 1977 they put a complete line of bollards and chains
all the way from the street to the school building in order to
block access to the playing field to vehicles.
</pre>
    <pre>[82] Although there had been no accidents at Glenview involving
the bollards and chains, Mr. Hearn acted immediately when he
heard of two incidents where chains had caused injury at other
locations.  There was no suggestion that cost was a factor in his
decision. Once he discerned the danger in the chains, he gave
instructions to have them removed, thereby removing the danger on
the school premises. He acknowledged that had he felt that the
bollards were a danger and there was money, he would have spent
the money to have them removed and replaced. It was clear
however, that no thought was given to whether the bollards
themselves were a hazard because there had not been an accident
involving bollards.
</pre>
    <pre>[83] Once the chains were removed because of their potential to
cause injury both to people on vehicles and on foot, the Board
was alerted to the issue of whether its barrier posed a danger to
users of the property and in particular to the safety of
students. The question  whether to retain the bollards had to be
considered in the context of their efficacy versus whether they
posed a hazard. That was not done. No analysis was made as to
whether they did create an environment of danger to students
using vehicles on school property. What Mr. Hearn testified was
that they still served some purpose as a visual guide to the
contour of the road and as a warning not to go onto the school
field,  and that there was no budget to remove them.
</pre>
    <pre>[84] The bollards are rock hard and inflexible so that if struck
with any force they will cause injury, whereas the evidence was
that other fencing materials such as chain link fence or even
hedges are much safer because they allow deflection and are not
as rigid. Furthermore, once the chains were removed so that there
was no longer any physical barrier across the playing field, it
could be anticipated that the problem of vehicles attempting to
go onto the field might recur. In that event, it is not
sufficient to conclude that the bollards posed no danger because
they were not on the roadway, and that as long as vehicles stayed
on the road where they were supposed to be there was no danger.
</pre>
    <pre>[85] The following factors are relevant to the criteria for
reasonable care highlighted by Lord Denning and approved by
Dickson J. in Veinot, supra,: the gravity of the potential injury
from an accident involving contact with the bollards was high;
the roadway was curved; the property was a school used by teenage
students with limited driving experience which raised the
likelihood that they might be less cautious and capable than
adults; the history of the property before the barrier was
erected was of vehicles which would go off the road and onto the
playing field.
</pre>
    <pre>[86] Although these factors point to the danger of leaving the
bollards in place, the likelihood of an accident where a student
motorcyclist travelling on the road would go out of control, and
the driver get thrown off and hit a bollard was not contemplated
by the Board because it had not happened. Was it therefore
reasonable for the possibility of such an accident not to be
contemplated by the Board? In most cases the event which occurs
and causes the injury such as a slip and fall on ice: Waldick,
supra; Preston v. Canadian Legion, Kingsway Branch, No. 175
(1981), 123 D.L.R. (3d) 645 (Alta. C.A.), a student&#146;s fall
through a glass skylight accessible to students: Leblond v.
Ottawa Board of Education, [1984] O.J. No. 1150 (H.C.) (Q.L.), or
a fall off a bridge with  no railings: Chretien v. Jensen (1998),
116 B.C.A.C. 81, is reasonably foreseeable, and the issue is did
the occupier of the premises do enough in all the circumstances
to make the premises safe by taking steps to prevent the accident
itself.
[87] In this case, the risk of serious injury was reasonably
foreseeable if the bollards were not removed and if there was an
accident.  The issue is was an accident involving contact with
the bollards reasonably foreseeable, obliging the Board to take
the necessary steps to remove the danger of injury and thereby
make the premises reasonably safe in the event of such an
accident?
</pre>
    <pre>[88] One of the most important and timely circumstances in this
case was the Board&#146;s decision in the spring of 1986 (made by Mr.
Hearn) to remove the chains because he heard of two accidents
involving chains and he also heard about a possible lawsuit as a
result of one of them. Before that time there was no suggestion
that the chains were considered to be a danger or a hazard. Nor
was it clear on the evidence on what basis the chains, which were
also painted yellow to be visible,  were considered to be a
danger other than the fact that two incidents which were not
described in any detail, had been heard to have occurred.
Therefore, once the issue was raised of potential danger of
injury from the chains, in my view  it became unreasonable for
the Board not to consider the potential danger of the bollards in
all the circumstances, including the ones referred to above, and
including the fact that the bollards were now being left in place
with large gaps where the chains had been.
[89] Another relevant circumstance was the  financial and
budgetary constraints and priorities of the Board.  Because Mr.
Hearn acknowledged that had he considered the bollards dangerous
he would have spent the $15,000 to remove and replace them,
assuming the funds were available from within his $34 million
maintenance budget, it appears that that consideration would not
have tipped the balance against removing the bollards.
[90] Another circumstance was the fact that other potentially
dangerous obstacles were also in place along the roadway such as
a hydrant, a flagpole, a hydro pole and trees. The respondent
submits that because the evidence was that hitting any of these
obstacles could also cause catastrophic injuries, it would make
no sense to remove the bollards when they continued to serve some
function. However, it is no answer to say that because danger may
already exist, that makes it reasonable to  increase the danger,
particularly where there was a row of 22 bollards, not just an
occasional one.
[91] The respondent also submits that it would be anomalous for a
school board to be liable for injury from contact with bollards
beside the roadway when s. 33(3) of the Public Transportation and
Highway Improvement Act R.S.O. 1990, c.P.50 immunizes the Crown
from liability for damage caused by anything adjacent to a
highway. That section provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               No action shall be brought against the Crown for the
          recovery of damages caused by the presence or absence or
          insufficiency of any wall, fence, guide rail, railing or barrier
          adjacent to or in, along or upon the King&#146;s Highway or caused by
          or on account of any construction, obstruction or erection or any
          situation, arrangement or disposition of any earth, rock, tree or
          other material or thing adjacent to or in, along or upon the
          King&#146;s Highway that is not on the roadway.</pre>
    <pre>Section 284(3) of the Municipal Act R.S.O. 1990 c. M.45, as
amended, provides similar protection for municipal corporations.</pre>
    <pre>[92] In my view there is no anomaly. The Crown and municipal
corporations have been given a special statutory exemption where
otherwise they could have liability. The respondent has no such
exemption but is bound by its duty under the Occupiers&#146; Liability
Act.
[93] I have reviewed in some detail the evidence of both
architectural and engineering as well as educational expert
witnesses with respect to whether the bollards were a danger.
They had differing views, based on differing assumptions. However
all witnesses agreed that in a school setting, safety was of
primary importance. It was also clear on the evidence that there
was other fencing material which would not pose the danger of
injury that the bollards did.
[94] In my view in all the circumstances, the Board failed in its
duty to take reasonable care to make the school grounds
reasonably safe for students driving motorcycles by leaving the
bollards in place once the chains between them were removed in
the spring of 1986.</pre>
    <pre>(iv) Did the Appellant Voluntarily Assume the Risk?
</pre>
    <pre>[95] Section 4(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4(1) The duty of care provided for in subsection 3(1) does
          not apply in respect of risks willingly assumed by the person who
          enters on the premises, but in that case the occupier owes a duty
          to the person to not create a danger with the deliberate intent
          of doing harm or damage to the person or his property and to not
          act with reckless disregard of the presence of the person or his
          property.
</pre>
    <pre>[96] In Waldick v. Malcolm, supra, the Supreme Court clarified
the meaning and effect of this section as a statement of the
applicability of the volenti  doctrine so that mere knowledge of
the risk of injury on the part of the victim is not enough. The
plaintiff must have assumed the risk of injury &#147;without recourse
to any contribution or liability from or of any other party&#148;
(quoted by Iacobucci J. at p. 127 from Beatty v. Brad-Lea Meadows
Ltd. (1986), 39 A.C.W.S. (2d) 344 (Ont. H.C.J.)).  Iacobucci J.
then went on to hold at p.129:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the legislature&#146;s intention in enacting s.4(1)
          of the Act was to carve out a very narrow exception to the class
          of visitors to whom the occupier&#146;s statutory duty of care is
          owed.  This exception shares the same logical basis as the
          premise that underlies volenti, i.e., &#147;that no wrong is done to
          one who consents.  By agreeing to assume the risk the plaintiff
          absolves the defendant of all responsibility for it&#148;:  per Wilson
          J. in Crocker, supra, at p.331.  Rare may be the case where a
          visitor who enters on premises will fully know of and accept the
          risks resulting from the occupier&#146;s non-compliance with the
          statute.  To my mind, such an interpretation of s.4(1) accords
          best with general principles of statutory interpretation, is more
          fully consonant with the legislative aims of the Act, and is
          consistent with tort theory generally.
</pre>
    <pre>[97] Applying that analysis to the facts of the present case, we
have no evidence from Mr. Kennedy as to how the accident
occurred. We know that his speed was fast as he was leaving the
school property, and as it turned out, he was not able to
negotiate the curve of the roadway safely. However, in my view
that conduct on the part of the appellant is not enough  to make
this one of the rare cases where it can be said that he assumed
the risk of serious injury from hitting a bollard. This is a
situation where the principles of contributory negligence apply,
but not the rule of volenti.
</pre>
    <pre>v)   Contribution Under the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.315
     (now R.S.O. 1990 c. N.1)
</pre>
    <pre>[98] Because the trial judge found no liability on the part of
the respondent and negligence on the part of the appellant only,
the issue of contributory negligence and apportionment did not
arise at trial. The applicable sections were ss. 4  and 5 (now
ss. 3 and 4) of the Negligence Act which provide:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   In any action for damages that is founded upon the
          fault or negligence of the defendant if fault or negligence is
          found on the part of the plaintiff that contributed to the
          damages, the court shall apportion the damages in proportion to
          the degree of fault or negligence found against the parties
          respectively.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 5.    If  it  is  not  practicable  to
          determine the respective degree of  fault  or
          negligence  as  between  any  parties  to  an
          action,  such parties shall be deemed  to  be
          equally at fault or negligent.

</pre>
    <pre>[99] Counsel for the respondent, relying on the Supreme Court of
Canada decisions in Taylor v. Asody (1974), 49 D.L.R. (3d) 724
and Kolodychuk v. Squire (1972), 34 D.L.R. (3d) 265,  submitted
that a court of appeal ought not to interfere with a trial
judge&#146;s finding with respect to the relative degrees of fault of
an appellant and a respondent unless the trial judge
misapprehended the evidence or misapplied the law. However, in
this case where the trial judge erred in law by failing to
consider and apply s. 3(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act to the
issue in respect of the bollards, and as a result made no finding
of liability against the respondent, the rule affirmed in those
cases can have no application.
[100]     This court is therefore entitled to apply the sections
and to make the appropriate apportionment of liability as between
the appellants and the respondent, where, on appeal, a finding of
negligence or fault has been made. Although it is also open for
this court to send the matter back for a new trial, or to the
trial judge for apportionment, on the record before the court and
given the findings of the trial judge with respect to the
negligence of the appellant and his full responsibility for the
accident itself, this court is in as good a position as the trial
judge to apply the apportionment sections of the Negligence Act.
</pre>
    <pre>[101]     In my view the appropriate apportionment is 75%
responsibility for the appellant, Gregory Kennedy and 25% for the
respondent Board. The respondent contributed to the severity of
the injuries by failing to make the premises reasonably safe in
all the circumstances by leaving the bollards in place after
removing the chains between them.
</pre>
    <pre>SUMMARY
</pre>
    <pre>[102]     The trial judge erred in law in holding that the
respondent could make a policy decision which would have the
effect of allowing it to fail to comply with its statutory duty
under the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act. He further misapprehended the
evidence by failing to find that the decision to leave the
bollards in place was not made bona fide, because the respondent
did not consider and weigh the potential danger of leaving the
bollards in place but only  the benefits of leaving them and the
cost of removal in the context of other spending priorities of
the Board. Finally, the trial judge erred in law in failing to
consider and apply s. 3(1) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act to his
third issue of  whether the respondent breached its duty to the
appellant and others by retaining the bollards, and by framing
the issue only in terms of the safety of the bollards for those
who remained on the roadway and therefore did not come into
contact with the bollards.
[103]     In all the circumstances, the Board breached its
statutory duty to the appellant to make the school premises
reasonably safe by failing to remove the bollards in the spring
of 1986. Where the trial judge has not addressed the issue of
contributory negligence and apportionment of damages, it is open
to this court to do so. In this case, the appellant is found 75%
responsible for his damages, and the respondent 25% responsible.
[104]     I would  allow the appeal with costs, set aside the
judgment below and grant judgment with costs in favour of the
appellants in the amounts found by the trial judge, reduced by

_______________________________
1 In Lewis v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1145, when
discussing the same British Columbia Highways Act in the context
of whether the Ministry&#146;s duty to maintain is a non-delegable
duty, Cory J. makes clear the absolute nature of a statutory
duty. At p. 1158 he says:
     &#147;&#133;an absolute statutory duty requires the performance of a
     positive obligation that is imposed on a particular entity
     which will always remain responsible for the performance of
     that duty.
     </pre>
    <pre>     On the other hand, a common law duty does not usually demand
     compliance with a specific obligation. It is only when an
     act is undertaken by a party that a general duty arises to
     perform the act with reasonable care.&#148;</pre></td>
