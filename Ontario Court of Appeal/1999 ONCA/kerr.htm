    <pre>RE:            THOMAS W. KERR and BRUCE W. WILTON IN TRUST
               (Applicants/Appellants) v. THE CORPORATION OF THE
               CITY OF PETERBOROUGH and PETERBOROUGH DOWNTOWN
               BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT AREA (Respondents)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, ABELLA and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       John D. Nichols,
               for the appellants</pre>
    <pre>               A. Scott Michael and John W. Hart,
               for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 1, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Where, as here, the proposed by-law is enacted under
s. 220(26) of the Municipal Act, the new and the old area in the
designated business improvement area are included.  In our view,
the wording of s. 220(2) to (5) is clear and all persons in this
designated area are entitled to notice and to the other remedies
in those provisions.  Much clearer language than &quot;with necessary
modifications&quot; in s. 220(27) would be necessary to deprive
people, who may be affected by the by-law, of their right to
notice and to the other remedies in these subsections.

[2]  It follows that Murphy J. was correct in holding that the
petition contemplated by s. 220(3) must be signed by at least one-
third of the persons in the entire designated area, not simply
one-third of the persons in the expanded area.

[3]  To the extent that the obiter comments in para. 19 of the
decision of the Divisional Court in Centre City Capital Limited
v. The Corporation of the City of Mississauga (1996), 31 M.P.L.R.
(2d) 271 are inconsistent with this holding, para. 19 should not
be followed.

[4]  The parties have agreed that there should not be any costs
of this appeal in view of the novelty of the point.  Accordingly
the appeal is dismissed without costs.</pre></td>
