COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            KEYSTONE INDUSTRIES (1970) LTD. (Plaintiff/Appellant)
               &#150;and&#150; CRALEECO LIMITED, VALFASH LIMITED, CRAZY

               (Defendants/Respondents)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, CARTHY and DOHERTY JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Avrum D. Slodovnick, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Glenn R. Solomon and Mark S. Shapiro, for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 30, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Coo J. dated November 19, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We think this appeal fails.  The appellant&#146;s case turned on
whether or not it could establish fraud.  The trial judge found,
relying on the evidence of the defendant Haberman, that fraud had
not been made out.  This is clear from the reasons where the
trial judge addressed specifically each of the three statutory
causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff.

[2]  The trial judge also considered the issue of the personal
liability of Haberman and rejected the claim against him.  He
recognized that Haberman&#146;s evidence should be approached with
what he said was preliminary cynicism and, despite this, he found
him to be credible.  We think his approach was consistent with
the approach taken by Anderson J. in Re Fancy (1984), 51 C.B.R.
(N.S.).

[3]  The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs fixed in the
sum of $1,500.

[4]  The cross-appeal is abandoned and dismissed without costs.
