    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Hugh R. Locke J., with a jury,
dated April 9, 1997, and from the sentence imposed on May 9,
1997.</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was tried in the Ontario Court of Justice
(General Division) by the Honourable Mr. Justice Locke and a jury
at the City of Toronto and after a 7-day trial the appellant was
convicted of 17 sexual offence counts in relation to three
complainants.  The appellant was sentenced on May 9, 1997 to a
period of 15 months concurrent on each count.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s appeal is based on the following grounds:
               </pre>
    <pre>     (1) Failure of the trial judge to permit the appellant
         to challenge each prospective juror for cause;
     (2) Failure of the trial judge to admit into evidence all
	 hospital notes and records pertaining to the complainant H.M.;
     (3) Failure of the trial judge to comment on Crown Counsel&#146;s address;
     (4) Failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the theory
         of the case for the defence;
     (5) Unreasonable verdict.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant is seeking to introduce fresh evidence on the
appeal.
[4]  The appellant is also seeking leave to appeal the sentence
submitting that the sentence imposed be served in the community.
The respondent Crown is seeking leave to cross-appeal the
sentence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Challenge of Cause</pre>
    <pre>[5]  An application was made to challenge every prospective juror
on the basis of the nature of the charge.  The following
questions were proposed.</pre>
    <pre>
    Do you have strong feelings about the 
    issue of rape and violence on young children?

    If so, what are those feelings based on?


    Would these strong feelings concerning
    the rape and violence on young children
    prevent you from giving Mr. Find  a fair
    trial based solely on the evidence given
    during the trial of this case?
          
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  No evidentiary basis was relied on in support of the
application at trial.  Counsel simply submitted that, given the
age of the victims and the number of offences, there was a
potential for the existence of partiality.  The application was
denied.
[7]  On the appeal counsel for the appellant submits that an
&#147;evidentiary base&#148; was established by reason of the fact that one
prospective juror indicated that he would have a problem hearing
the case because he had two young children of his own and he
thought that his feelings about them would influence his attitude
towards the case.  The juror was challenged peremptorily.
[8]  In my view, the statement of the prospective juror did not
provide evidence of partiality, nor did it show a realistic
potential for partiality. The appellant could only succeed on
this ground if this court could take judicial notice of a
widespread bias in the community in relation to sexual offences
of this kind.  For the reasons in R. v. A.K. and N.K., released
concurrently with this decision, the majority of the court is of
the view that judicial notice cannot be taken of that fact.
Consequently, the trial judge exercised his discretion properly
in refusing to permit the proposed questions.
</pre>
    <pre>     
     Failure to admit into evidence all hospital notes andrecords
     pertaining to the complainant H.M.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Before the commencement of the trial, the Crown served the
defence with a notice of intent to produce certain medical notes
and records in evidence pursuant to s. 30 of the Canada Evidence
Act.  The documents related to the medical examination of the
complainant H.M. when the allegations were first investigated by
the police in March 1976.  Defence counsel sought to have these
notes and records admitted in evidence at trial. The trial judge
admitted only some of the documents in evidence, ruling that the
others were irrelevant to any of the issues and therefore
inadmissible.
[10] The appellant submits that all of the documents should have
been admitted in evidence.  In particular, he argues that the
notes from one Dr. Lloyd  ought to have been admitted because
they contained an important notation to the effect that the
complainant's hymen was intact upon examination.  The appellant
submits that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit all of
the notes and records for two reasons:

    1.  When cross-examined on the results of the medical
        examination, the complainant agreed with counsel's suggestion
        that the medical records would show that her hymen was broken
        because she had had intercourse over a hundred times.  This cross-
        examination was conducted prior to the trial judge's ruling on
        the admissibility of the records.  Counsel argues that given the
        answers of the witness, it became important that the jury see all
        of the notes including the notation by Dr. Lloyd.
    2.  The notes were admissible as business records under s. 30 of the
        Canada Evidence Act.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The notes that were ruled inadmissible consisted of
Dr. Lloyd's notes of a conversation that he had with the
complainant's father. The notes indicate that the father appeared
very upset and incoherent.  He was blaming the hospital for
&quot;covering up the rape of his daughter&quot; by refusing to testify on
her behalf.  Dr. Lloyd noted that he tried to &quot;straighten him
out&quot; on the facts, including &quot;the fact that he had not brought
his daughter in for more than a week after the alleged incident
and the difficulty in defining medical virginity in terms of an
intact hymen&quot;.
[12] In my view, the trial judge was correct in refusing to admit
that part of the records that defence counsel wanted to admit.
Those notes were clearly not business records within the meaning
of s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act.  As well, in my view, the
trial judge was correct in saying that the contents of the
particular page in question were irrelevant to the issues that
the jury had to decide.  It would not assist the jury at all to
know what Dr. Lloyd said to the complainant's father.
Furthermore, the notes were not at all clear on the issue of
whether there was an intact hymen at the time of the March 1976
examination.
[13] This ground of the appeal must therefore fail.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Admissibility of fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence from
Dr. Lloyd to clarify the medical records in question.  Dr. Lloyd,
who was not the examining physician, looked at the medical
records and was of the view that they indicated that the hymen
was intact.  In response to this fresh evidence, the Crown filed
fresh evidence of experts who were of the opinion that the state
of the hymen is not helpful in determining whether sexual
intercourse has occurred or not.  This point is essentially
conceded by Dr. Lloyd in his cross-examination. In my view, the
fresh evidence would not reasonably be expected to have affected
the jury&#146;s verdict.  The application to introduce fresh evidence
is dismissed.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Failure of the trial judge to remark on Crown counsel&#146;s
     address</pre>
    <pre>[15] In his address, defence counsel referred to the medical
records and stated that they established that the complainant&#146;s
hymen was intact. Crown counsel in her address invited the jury
to look at the medical records and stated that the defence's
conclusion that the hymen was intact was not supported by those
records.  Defence counsel contends that this was unfair because
that suggested that he was inventing this notion of &#147;intact
hymen&#148; while in actual fact it could be found in Dr. Lloyd's
notes that had not been admitted in evidence.
[16] Given my finding that the judge properly exercised his
discretion with respect to the admissibility of the notes and
records, the question becomes whether this comment by Crown
counsel was a fair comment on the evidence that was admitted.
[17] I am of the view that the comments by both counsel were fair
comments on the evidence that was before the jury and I do not
see any error in the trial judge not commenting on the Crown&#146;s
address as requested by counsel.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Failure to instruct the jury on the theory of defence</pre>
    <pre>[18] The charge in relation to the theory of the defence was not
extensive and while the trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence was
limited, it clearly stated the position of the defence.  The
issues for the jury to resolve were not complex and turned
entirely on their findings as to credibility.  The trial judge
carefully instructed the jury as to how they ought to approach
issues of credibility.
[19] It should also be noted that the defence counsel at trial
did not make any objections in relation to the adequacy of the
charge in relation to the theory of the defence.
[20] This ground of appeal must therefore also fail.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Unreasonable Verdict</pre>
    <pre>[21] Counsel for the appellant on this ground of the appeal is
relying primarily on evidence of the complainant D.C. with
respect to the fact that she had not been in the appellant&#146;s home
during the year of 1963 when it is alleged that the assault
occurred.  While the complainant D.C. was unsure about the
precise dates of the sexual assault, she was clear that the
assault took place in the summer when she was 10 or 11.  It is
therefore clear that when the evidence is viewed as a whole, her
evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the verdict in
relation to the time frame of the offences.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Appellant&#146;s appeal on sentence</pre>
    <pre>[22] Appellant&#146;s counsel was advised during the hearing that the
court was of the view, given the nature of the convictions in
this case,  that consideration of a conditional sentence was
entirely inappropriate.  Leave to appeal the sentence is denied.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Crown&#146;s appeal on sentence</pre>
    <pre>[23] In my view, the sentence imposed on the appellant was
manifestly unreasonable.  There were repeated acts of sexual
intercourse involving young complainants.  Some of the offences
were accompanied by threats and violence.  In relation to each of
the complainants the appellant developed a relationship of trust
which he cultivated and systematically abused.
[24] The court has repeatedly emphasized that sentences imposed
for this type of conduct must reflect the gravity of the offences
and give effect to the principles of general deterrence and
denunciation.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[25] The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal
the sentence is granted to the Crown, the appeal against sentence
is allowed and the sentence is increased to a penitentiary term
of four years to run concurrently on each count.</pre>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre>MOLDAVER J.A. (dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[26] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of the Chief
Justice.  With respect to the appeal against conviction, I agree
with his analysis and conclusions on all but the challenge for
cause issue.
[27] On that issue, for reasons given in R. v. A.K. and N.K.
(C21487 and C21488), released concurrently with these reasons, I
am of the view that the appellant should have been permitted to
challenge prospective jurors for cause based on the nature of the
crime.  He was deprived of that right and it cannot be said that
he received a fair trial by an impartial jury.
[28] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal against conviction and
direct a new trial.</pre>
