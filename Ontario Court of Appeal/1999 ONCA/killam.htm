    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by The Honourable Mr. Justice
Stanton Hogg dated June 3, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This was a serious crime.  The respondent and the victim
were part of a group of young adults who were partying at a beach
over the weekend.  The victim and her friends had rented a small
cabin.  They allowed the respondent to sleep in the cabin because
he was known to them and trusted by them.  On the second night
the respondent slept in the cabin, the victim awoke to find the
respondent having sexual intercourse with her.  She had, of
course, not consented and had done nothing to suggest to the
respondent that she was prepared to have sexual intercourse with
him.
[2]  The trial judge determined that a sentence of two years less
a day was appropriate.  He further held that a conditional
sentence was appropriate.  In addition to terms providing for non
contact with the complainant and community service, he ordered
that the respondent was not allowed to leave the residence for
the six months of the sentence except for specified reasons.
[3]  The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence.  This court
must decide whether the trial judge&#146;s imposition of a conditional
sentence reveals an error in principle or can be said to be
demonstrably unfit in that it falls outside the appropriate range
of sentencing for this offence and this offender.</pre>
    <pre>Was there an error in principle?</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge referred to the applicable principles of
sentencing in determining the appropriate length of the sentence.
Having determined that a sentence of two years less a day was
appropriate, the trial judge then indicated that he would impose
a conditional sentence.  He referred to the pre-sentence report
but did not articulate the principles which guided his
determination.  Crown counsel at trial had, however, made
arguments against a conditional sentence.  Those arguments
canvassed all the relevant principles and indeed were echoed by
Crown counsel in this court.
[5]  Although the trial judge did not refer to s. 742.1 of the
Criminal Code and did not articulate his reasons for concluding
that a conditional sentence was appropriate, I cannot assume that
his failure to do so amounts to an error in principle.  In my
view, this court must assume that the trial judge was alive to
the submissions of Crown counsel (he expressly indicated he was)
and appreciated the relevance of those submissions.  He chose,
however, not to accept them.  I can find no error in principle in
the trial judge&#146;s reasons and will not infer one from his failure
to more fully articulate the basis upon which he made his
decision to grant a conditional sentence.</pre>
    <pre>Was the sentence demonstrably unfit?</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In considering whether a conditional sentence is
appropriate.  Section 742.1 requires that one look both to the
danger that may exist to the safety of the community and to the
other fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing.  In a
case like this one, those fundamental principles must include
deterrence both specific and general and denunciation.
[7]  It must also be recognized that the conditional sentence
provided a new option in sentencing, the intention of which was
to reduce the number of persons who are incarcerated.  In R. v.
Gladue (1998), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 402, Cory J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>     &#133;The availability of a conditional sentence of imprisonment,
     in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which
     gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment
     should be resorted to only when no other sentencing option is
     reasonable in the circumstances.  The creation of the conditional
     sentence suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen the use of
     incarceration. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The respondent was 20 years old at the time of the offence.
He was sentenced some two years after the offence.  He has a
minor criminal record and was on probation when this offence was
committed, although he had apparently fully complied with the
order and had been relieved from his obligations under the terms
of the probation order by his probation officer.  The respondent
experienced some medical and emotional problems as a young
teenager.  Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen he used
drugs, did not attend school regularly and fell in with the wrong
crowd.  At the time this offence was committed, his parents felt
that he was beginning to turn his life around.  His change in
attitude and lifestyle followed the birth of his daughter.  He
continued to develop a positive lifestyle between the date of the
commission of this offence and sentencing.  At the time of
sentencing, the respondent was attending school, working part-
time, playing an active role in his daughter&#146;s life and providing
some financial support for her.
[9]  Despite his prior record and the absence of any remorse (the
respondent continued to insist that the sexual contact was
consensual), the pre-sentence report was favourable.  It
concluded with these words:
          </pre>
    <pre>     Should the court be considering community supervision in its
     disposition, although the defender denies the offence, given his
     past response to community supervision and the positive direction
     of his lifestyle he is considered a suitable candidate for
     further probation supervision.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The respondent was sentenced some five months ago.  With the
consent of the Crown we received fresh evidence concerning his
conduct since his sentencing.  It bears out the promise expressed
in the pre-sentence report.  He had continued his education and
in October 1999 accepted a very good full-time job.  He arranged
to complete his college courses at night school.  He continues to
see his daughter regularly and has significantly increased his
support payments since he started his new job.  There is no
indication that he has failed to comply with any of the terms of
his sentence.  He has completed a substantial amount of the
community service ordered by the trial judge.
[11] In the course of argument, it was suggested that the
respondent has a problem with alcohol.  I see nothing in the
record to support that contention.  It appears that he was
drinking on the night of the offence and that he routinely drinks
four or five beers on the weekend.  There was no suggestion that
alcohol played any role in this offence and his weekend drinking
habits do not suggest a problem with alcohol.
[12] There is no doubt that incarceration at this time would have
significant negative effects on the respondent&#146;s continued
progress and on the lives of those around the respondent,
particularly his young daughter.  In my view, there was ample
reason to conclude that a conditional sentence posed no danger to
the safety of the community.  Further, in my view, there was
ample reason to conclude that the principle of specific
deterrence did not demand incarceration.
[13] That leaves for consideration the principles of general
deterrence and denunciation.  I am particularly concerned about
denunciation.  As indicated in R. v. Wismayer (1997), 115 C.C.C.
(3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.), a conditional sentence, if properly
understood, can adequately address the needs of denunciation and
general deterrence even in cases where those principles are
paramount.  I think, however, it must be acknowledged that a
conditional sentence, even one like this one which imposes some
significant restrictions on the offender&#146;s liberty, does not,
generally speaking, have the same denunciatory effect as a period
of imprisonment.  Incarceration remains the most formidable
denunciatory weapon in the sentencing arsenal.
[14] I admit to considerable doubt as to whether a conditional
sentence could adequately reflect the gravity of this offence and
send the proper denunciatory message to the public.  I am,
however, satisfied that the case law commands that my doubt yield
to the deference that must be afforded to the decision made by
the trial judge.  As Lamer C.J.C. put it in R. v. M.(C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at 566:
          </pre>
    <pre>     The sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage
     over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the
     sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender.  A
     sentencing judge also possesses unique qualifications of
     experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of
     our criminal justice system.  Perhaps most importantly, the
     sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the
     community which has suffered the consequences of the offender&#146;s
     crime.  As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of
     the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be &#147;just and
     appropriate&#148; for the protection of that community.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The words of the Chief Justice have strong application here.
Given this direction from the Supreme Court of Canada, I cannot
say that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit.  I would
not interfere with the conditional sentence imposed by the trial
judge.
[16] I must stress, I am not suggesting that a conditional
sentence should become the norm in cases like this one.  Far from
it.  My reasons should be taken only as indicating that in the
circumstances of this case, a conditional sentence was not
outside the broad range of sentences available to the trial
judge.  I do not suggest that other sentences, particular a
significant term of imprisonment, would have been inappropriate.
Indeed, I might even go so far as to say a period of
incarceration would have been more appropriate.  That is,
however, a basis upon which I cannot vary a sentence under s. 687
of the Criminal Code.
[17] In his able submissions, Crown counsel pointed out that the
trial judge did not make an order under s. 109(2) of the Criminal
Code.  Counsel for the respondent conceded that such an order
should be made.  Consequently, the sentence should be varied by
adding a prohibition order in the terms of s. 109(2) of the
Criminal Code for a period of 10 years.  The respondent will also
be subject to the mandatory lifetime order as set out in
s.109(2)(b) of the Criminal Code.
[18] I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal, but only
to the extent of adding the prohibition orders referred to above.
