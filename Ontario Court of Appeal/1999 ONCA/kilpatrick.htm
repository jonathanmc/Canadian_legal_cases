    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Wilkins J. dated April 17, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In 1991 the plaintiff, William Kilpatrick, was hired as the
Executive   Director   of   the  Peterborough   Civic   Hospital.
Previously, Mr. Kilpatrick had been in the employ of the  Moncton
Hospital  in  New  Brunswick for 29 years.   In  1970  he  became
President of that hospital, and held that position at the time he
was   recruited   by  the  Peterborough  Civic   Hospital   (&#147;the
hospital&#148;).   The  plaintiff&#146;s employment with the  hospital  was
terminated  effective  April  21, 1997.   Shortly  thereafter  he
commenced an action against the hospital for damages for wrongful
dismissal.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On December 11, 1997, the plaintiff moved under Rule 20.01
for summary judgment &#147;granting the plaintiff 30 months salary and
benefits in lieu of notice&#148;.  The grounds for the motion were as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.        The only issue before the court is reasonable
               notice period to be provided by the defendant to plaintiff;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.    There is no genuine factual  issue
               for trial with respect to the claim;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   It would not otherwise be unjust to
               decide the issue by summary judgment.
</pre>
    <pre>It  would appear that it was common ground at the time the motion
was brought that the plaintiff had been dismissed without cause.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]   On  April 17, 1998, Wilkins J. decided the motion in favour
of  the  plaintiff.   At  the  outset of  extensive  reasons  for
judgment,  the  motions  judge stated:  &#147;The  only  issue  to  be
determined was the appropriate length of notice to which would be
applied monthly salary and benefits&#148;.  He found that &#147;the  proper
notice  period should have been 30 months&#148;.  This resulted  in  a
judgment  for  the plaintiff for damages of $232,010.42.   It  is
from this judgment that the hospital has appealed.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The record before Wilkins J. consisted of affidavits from
Mr. Kilpatrick, Mr. McMonagle, the person retained by the
hospital to recruit a new Executive Director, Mr. Murphy, the
Chair of the hospital when the plaintiff was hired, Mr. Ayotte,
the Chair of the hospital when the plaintiff was terminated,
documents referred to by the affiants, and the transcripts of the
cross-examinations of Mr. Kilpatrick and Mr. McMonagle.

[5]  A review of the reasons of the motions judge discloses a
number of factual findings which he made that informed his
ultimate finding that the proper notice period to which the
plaintiff was entitled was 30 months.  For the purpose of these
reasons, it is adequate to highlight only some of these findings.

[6]  Early in his reasons, the motions judge found on &#147;the
combined evidence in the affidavits&#148; and &#147;on a balance of
probabilities&#148;, that during the recruitment process both parties
had in mind the plaintiff&#146;s employment by the hospital until his
retirement at age 65.  He found that the hospital, through Mr.
McMonagle, had induced the plaintiff to leave a secure position
of 29 years with the Moncton Hospital by leaving him &#147;with a real
sense that the last 12 years of his working life would be at
least as secure in the new job as they were in the old one&#148;.  He
concluded that &#147;any reasonable person in Kilpatrick&#146;s position
would have seen himself as being wooed in a courtship by
McMonagle&#148;.  In regard to these findings, it is significant that
Mr. Kilpatrick did not seek the job of Executive Director of the
hospital.  Rather, he was recruited by Mr. McMonagle.

[7]  The motions judge instructed himself, applying Wallace v.
United Grain Growers Ltd. (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.),
that the weight to be given to an inducement to leave an
established position to assume a new one as a factor in
determining the proper notice period will vary with the
circumstances of each case.  The motions judge&#146;s review of the
evidence resulted in the judge placing significant weight on the
fact that the plaintiff was induced by the hospital to leave his
secure position in Moncton on the basis of his belief that he
would be secure in his new position for a period of 12 years,
until he reached retirement age.  Consequently, Wilkins J. placed
significant weight on the &#147;inducement factor&#148; in the result that
he reached.

[8]  As well, the motions judge placed substantial weight on the
conduct of the hospital in discharging the plaintiff without
cause or notice.  He characterized it as &#147;unreasoned and
cavalier&#148; and said that &#147;it ought not be countenanced by this
court&#148;.  Later he said:  &#147;To discharge a highly successful and
totally satisfactory Chief Executive Officer without the
expression of any explanation, excuse or cause, leaves it open to
the court to consider that the conduct of the defendant is
virtually tantamount to that of a capricious whim&#148;.

[9]  The focus of the hospital&#146;s appeal was an attack on the
findings of fact made by the motions judge, including inferences
which he drew from the evidence.  In particular, the hospital
took issue with the motions judge&#146;s findings with respect to
whether the hospital had induced the plaintiff to leave his
previous position, the nature of the inducement and the weight
given to the inducement.  Generally speaking, the position of the
hospital was that Wilkins J. made certain findings of fact, and
reached conclusions, that were not founded on the evidence.
Counsel for the hospital submitted that had Wilkins J. correctly
found the facts, and had given appropriate weight to them, he
would not have concluded that the proper notice period was 30
months.

[10] However, significantly absent in the hospital&#146;s appeal was
any suggestion that Wilkins J. had exceeded the proper role of a
motions judge in deciding a Rule 20 motion for summary judgment.
This omission was of great concern to the court and we invited
submissions from both counsel on this issue.  We were advised by
counsel that the parties consented to the issue of the proper
notice period going before the motions judge on a motion for
summary judgment as this was the most cost effective way of
deciding it.  We were told that to resolve the notice issue
before a trial judge would likely require 4 or 5 days.  It was
submitted that a motions judge would be in as good a position as
a trial judge to decide the proper notice to which the plaintiff
was entitled.

[11] Laudable as the motive of counsel was, it is my view that
the motions judge was put in a situation where it was inevitable
that he would exceed his proper role on a Rule 20 motion.  As my
analysis of his reasons has disclosed, he did so by evaluating
credibility, weighing evidence and drawing factual inferences.
In doing so, he acted as a trial judge and conducted &#147;a paper
trial&#148;.  He did what this court has criticized in a number of
decisions, the most recent being Transamerica Occidental Life
Insurance Company v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank, [1999] O.J. No.
1995.

[12] In Transamerica, Osborne J.A. set aside a motions judge&#146;s
summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s action, except for
one claim, on the ground that the findings of fact to be made
from the evidence should take place at trial and not on a paper
record.  In doing so, he reiterated the proper role of a motions
judge on a Rule 20 motion as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A motions judge, on a Rule 20 summary judgment motion,
          should not resolve issues of credibility, draw inferences from
          conflicting evidence, or from evidence that is not in conflict
          when more than one inference is reasonably available.  As Borins
          J. (ad hoc) for this court, succinctly put it in Aguonie v.
          Galion Solid Waste Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.).
          at p. 173:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Evaluating  credibility,  weighing
               evidence, and drawing factual inferences are
               all functions reserved for the trier of fact.
</pre>
    <pre>See, also, Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc.; Pacific
&amp; Western Trust Co. v. Carroll (1998), 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont.
C.A.).

[13]  In reviewing Mr. Kilpatrick&#146;s notice of motion, the reasons
of  the  motions  judge, and the submissions of counsel  on  this
appeal in respect to the conclusion reached by the motions judge,
two things are clear.  The first is that it is obvious that there
was  a  genuine  issue for trial, namely, the appropriate  notice
period  in  the  particular  circumstances  of  Mr.  Kilpatrick&#146;s
employment.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The second is that in deciding the issue, the motions judge
conducted a trial on the basis of a paper record.  The duration
of the proper notice period was an issue that was fact driven.
Central to its resolution was the need to determine whether the
hospital induced Mr. Kilpatrick to leave his secure position of
29 years, and, at age 53, take up a new position which required
him to relocate from Moncton to Peterborough, and whether the
inducement contained the assurance that the new position would
continue until he reached age 65, when he would be required to
retire.

[15] Nowhere in the reasons of the motions judge did he instruct
himself, as this court required in Aguonie at p. 173, that his
role in hearing a Rule 20 motion was &#147;narrowly limited to
assessing the threshold issue of whether a genuine issue exists
as to material facts requiring a trial&#148;.  It appears clear that
he considered himself to be a trial judge as in the course of his
reasons he commented that &#147;[l]ogic, common sense and life
experiences must be applied to evidence tendered before a trial
judge&#148;.

[16] Mr. Paliare submitted that Wilkins J., on the basis of the
record before him, was in as good a position to decide the notice
issue as a trial judge.  This may have been true if Rule 20, and
the cases which have interpreted it, enabled a motions judge to
do so.  Had this been a motion for summary judgment under Rule
76.06(14), which applies to an action where the plaintiff&#146;s claim
does not exceed $25,000, the approach taken by the motions judge
may not have been inappropriate.  See, also, Rule 76.06(16) which
contains the procedure for a summary trial where the claim does
not exceed $25,000, as well as the rules of several other
provinces to which I will refer.

[17] I am not unsympathetic to the desire of counsel to resolve
the notice issue without the delay and expense of a trial.
Unfortunately, as this requires the court to resolve factual
issues, Rule 20 is not the appropriate vehicle to employ.  The
reasonableness of notice in the context of a wrongful dismissal
action involves a finding of fact based on the circumstances of
each case.  This is evident from the necessity of applying the
principles articulated in Bardal v. The Globe &amp; Mail Ltd. (1960),
24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.J.), and other cases, to the
assessment of a dismissed employee&#146;s notice period:  Wallace, at
pp.29-30, per Iacobucci J.

[18] In my view, to extend Rule 20 to the circumstances of this
appeal on the ground that the motions judge was in as good a
position as a trial judge to resolve the notice issue would be to
read into the Rule a meaning unintended by the Civil Rules
Committee.  Other provinces have made provision for summary
disposition of an action, or an issue in an action, by procedures
which I would characterize as being between an Ontario type of a
motion for summary judgment and a plenary trial.  For example,
Rule 18A of the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules provides for
a summary trial, which is sometimes referred to as a &#147;mini-
trial&#148;.  See, e.g., Golden Gate Seafood (Vancouver) Co. Ltd. v.
Osborn &amp; Lange Inc. (1986), 1 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145 (C.A.).  A form
of summary trial is available under Rule 20A of the Manitoba
Court of Queen&#146;s Bench Rules in actions where the relief claimed
does not exceed $50,000.  Rule 17A of the Newfoundland Rules of
the Supreme Court also provides for a summary trial.

[19] Provisions exist in the Newfoundland rules, as well as the
Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules, which, were they contained in
Rule 20, would have enabled the parties to this appeal to achieve
the resolution of the notice issue without a trial.  In
Newfoundland, the relevant rule is Rule 17.02(g).  In Nova
Scotia, the rule reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               13.02     On the hearing of an application [for summary
          judgment] under rule 13.01, the court may on such terms as it
          thinks just,
          </pre>
    <pre>                                               &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (g) with the consent of all the parties,
          dispose of the proceeding finally in a
          summary manner, with or without pleadings or
          affidavits and without appeal;
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  As the motions judge took on the role of a trial judge and,
on  the  basis of a paper record, decided the issue of the proper
notice  which  the defendant was required to give the  plaintiff,
his judgment cannot stand.  In the circumstances, it would not be
appropriate  to  express any opinion on the  correctness  of  the
decision which he reached.</pre>
    <pre>[21] In the result, I would allow the appeal of the hospital and
set aside the judgment of Wilkins J. and direct that the action
proceed to trial on the issue of the proper notice period.  In
the circumstances of this appeal, there will be no costs of the
motion or the appeal.
