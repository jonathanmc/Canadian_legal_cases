    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            JOANN KINKARTZ (Appellant/Plaintiff, Wife) v.
               HUGH KINKARTZ (Respondent/Defendant, Husband)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, LABROSSE and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       JoAnn Kinkartz,
               the appellant, in person</pre>
    <pre>               Alan J. Davis and Sender B. Tator,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Madam Justice Janet Wilson dated
April 14, 1998, amended and clarified by Order dated June 29,
1998 and further amended by endorsement dated July 27, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The parties appeal and cross-appeal the order of Wilson  J.
(the  motions  judge) reducing monthly spousal and child  support
ordered  pursuant to a divorce judgment and reducing  arrears  of
support under that judgment.
[2]  The parties have filed facta in the appeal and cross-appeal
totalling 113 pages.  Both, in effect, seek a re-hearing of all
issues.
[3]  The motions judge was faced with a most difficult situation
due in part to the fact that the wife has been representing
herself and due in part to the fact that the husband, as found by
the motions judge, failed to give proper disclosure, was
untruthful, refused to comply with court orders and was
determined to avoid his obligations under the divorce judgment.
[4]  It is our view that the motions judge did the best that
could be expected in the circumstances and arrived at a fair
disposition.  There was a proper basis, on the evidence, to find
that there had been a material change of circumstances that
justified a reduction of the child and spousal support and the
arrears.  We specifically refrain from imposing a time limit on
the spousal support obligation.
[5]  The appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed subject to the
following variations:</pre>
    <pre>    (1)  Paragraph 13 of the Consolidated Order is varied to permit
         the wife to pursue payment from the husband of any arrears of
         child support for Yvonne and Jason; and
    (2)  the sum of $36,388.93, presently being held by Alan  J.
         Davis, the solicitor for the husband, is to be paid forthwith to
         the Family Responsibility Office.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  We make no order as to costs.
