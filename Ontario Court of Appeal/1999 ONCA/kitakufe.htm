COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            IN THE MATTER OF An Application for Judicial
               Review Pursuant to Section 25.2 of the
               Extradition Act, R.S.C. c. 3-23

    <pre>               JOHN KITAKUFE (Applicant) and MINISTER OF
               JUSTICE FOR CANADA (Respondent)
               </pre>

               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 26, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>  On appeal from the decision of the Minister of Justice
                         dated March 9, 1998.
                         </pre>
    <pre>                         
                    ENDORSEMENT
                              </pre>
    <pre>                              
[1]  The applicant submits that the Minister erred in law in
refusing to seek assurance from the United States that his
parole ineligibility will not be increased because he failed
to appear at his sentencing hearing. The applicant argues
that such increased parole ineligibility violates the rule
of specialty in Article 12 of the Extradition Treaty between
Canada and the United States and also violates the Charter.
We disagree.

[2]  The Minister correctly concluded that the decision of
the Parole Commission on  whether to increase the
applicant&#146;s parole ineligibility relates to the
administration of the applicant&#146;s sentence.  The applicant
will be sentenced for the fraud offences for which he is
ordered surrendered and not for the offence of failing to
appear with which he has not been charged. The decision of
the Parole Commission will  affect only the amount of court
ordered punishment that must be served in custody.  Any
increase in parole ineligibility of between six and twelve
months, which may be imposed by the Commission, will
therefore not violate Article 12 of the Treaty, nor will it
violate our Charter.  This is neither fundamentally
unacceptable to Canadian society, nor will it shock the
conscience of a Canadian court. Accordingly, the Minister
did not commit any reviewable error in refusing to seek the
assurance sought by the applicant.

[3]  We are also of the view that the Minister did
not err by failing to include in the order of
surrender that the applicant is not extradited for
the offence of failing to appear.  The Minister is
entitled to rely on the good faith of the requesting
state in sentencing the applicant only for the
offences in the surrender order.

[4]  Accordingly, the application for judicial
review is dismissed.</pre></td>
