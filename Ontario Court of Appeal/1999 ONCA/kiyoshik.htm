</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[1]  After approximately an hour of deliberations, the jury asked
the following question:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               &#147;Could we please review a copy of the transcript re:
          Melissa and Jamie&#146;s testimony.&#148;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[2]  Jamie was the complainant and Melissa was her friend who was
present for some of the encounter with the appellant.  Melissa
contradicted the complainant on certain important aspects of her
evidence.  The trial judge responded to the question as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">              </font><font size="3"> Well the answer to that question is that unfortunately we do
          not have a transcript.  We can make one available, but that would
          involve having the court reporter take the notes and reduce them
          to a transcript and that would take all afternoon for sure and I
          am not sure that it would be that much assistance to you.  If
          there is some specific problem that you are having with the
          evidence of either of the two, perhaps if you can narrow your
          concerns and focus on a question that we will try to answer.  But
          short of that if I were to give every juror a transcript of all
          of the evidence, it simply is not practical to do so.  So if you
          can consult amongst yourselves and see if there is a question you
          can frame which resolves your difficulty centering around that
          transcript or that evidence we will be pleased to try and answer
          your question for you.  [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[3]  The jury did not return with a more focused question and one
and a half hour later found the appellant guilty.
[4]  In R. v. S.(W.D.) (1994), 3 S.C.R. 521 at 528, Cory J.
emphasized the importance of the trial judge&#146;s response to
questions from the jury:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               </font><font size="3">A question presented by a jury gives the clearest possible
          indication of the particular problem that the jury is confronting
          and upon which it seeks further instructions. Even if the
          question relates to a matter that has been carefully reviewed in
          the main charge, it still must be answered in a complete and
          careful manner. It may be that after a period of deliberation,
          the original instructions, no matter how exemplary they were,
          have been forgotten or some confusion has arisen in the minds of
          the jurors. The jury must be given a full and proper response to
          their question. The jury is entitled to no less. It is the
          obligation of the trial judge assisted by counsel to make certain
          that the question is fully and properly answered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[5]  This obligation is as important when the jury requests
assistance on matters of evidence as in matters of law.  As
Martin J.A. said in R. v. Andrade (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont.
C.A.) at p. 70, &#147;It is well established that the jury is entitled
to have the court reporter read back to them the evidence of a
witness or witnesses on a particular subject and, indeed, to have
read to them the entire evidence of a witness or witnesses&#148;.
[6]  We are all of the view that the trial judge did not provide
the required assistance to the jury. It was not improper for the
trial judge to invite the jury to ask a more focused question, so
long as the jury would understand that they were not foreclosed
from repeating their initial request.  However, a reasonable
interpretation of the trial judge&#146;s answer to the question was
that the jury were not entitled to either a transcript or some
other suitable substitute such as a review of the trial judge&#146;s
notes or having the court reporter read back the evidence.
Rather, it was only if the jury had a specific question that
assistance could be provided to them.
[7]  Ms Bartlett-Hughes relies upon two decisions of the Supreme
Court of Canada:  R. v. Ostrowski, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 82 and R. v.
Keegstra (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 19 (S.C.C.) reversing (1994), 92
C.C.C. (3d) 505 (Alta. C.A.).  This case is not like R. v.
Ostrowski.  In that case, the trial judge was careful not to
close the door to the request for transcripts and he indicated
that if the jury needed further assistance after they had
commenced their deliberations he would read from his notes
pertaining to the witnesses or if necessary obtain the
transcripts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[8]  R. v. Keegstra is likewise of no assistance to the Crown.
In Keegstra, the jury requested the transcript of the evidence of
one Mr. David.  Mr. David had given evidence that was very
damaging to the defence case.  The transcript of his evidence was
actually available, but the accused objected to the jury
receiving the transcript and the trial judge therefore refused to
provide it.  Foisy J.A., whose dissenting reasons were
substantially agreed with by the Supreme Court of Canada, after
referring to Ostrowski, said the following at p. 559:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               </font><font size="3">It should be noted that Mr. David's evidence was
          particularly damaging to the appellant's defence. The appellant
          forcefully and correctly made the point to the trial judge that
          there was a danger to him in simply putting the 300 pages of
          transcript before the jury without more. In the circumstances,
          and in view of the appellant's valid objection, the course taken
          by the trial judge was not unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">and at p. 560:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">               In this case, the trial judge did not refuse to
          assist the jury. Quite to the contrary he invited the
          jurors to focus in on whatever particular problem or
          problems they were having and to return to him for
          assistance. This was a reasonable alternative to simply
          giving the jury 300 pages of transcript, particularly
          when jury deliberations had been in progress for only a
          short time and the appellant and Crown counsel objected
          to this option with some degree of validity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[9]  In view of the trial judge&#146;s error in this case in
responding to the jury&#146;s request for assistance the conviction
cannot stand.  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is
allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.</font></pre></td>
