    <pre>HEARD:         November 2, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the disposition of Justice S.M. Rogers dated May
7, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The disposition judge was quite properly concerned about the
serious nature of this offence which involved an assault upon a
complete stranger at 2:00 o&#146;clock in the morning.  The appellant
used a weapon, an asp.  The victim, who was unarmed, received a
2 inch cut to his head requiring 10 stitches.
[2]  The judge emphasized the need for specific deterrence and
considered that it could be best achieved by a short term of open
custody.  We see no error in principle nor do we think it can be
said that the disposition is manifestly unfit or outside the
appropriate range:  see R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 538
(C.A.).
[3]  We cannot leave this appeal without commenting on the
argument that if the custodial term is upheld, the appellant&#146;s
school term and hockey playing schedule will be disrupted.  We
point out that the disposition judge had these concerns in mind
when she delayed the disposition until the appellant&#146;s summer
holiday.   This appeal is what has created the problem that is
now raised.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
