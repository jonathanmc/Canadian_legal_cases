    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from the order of the Honourable Mr.
Justice Coo finding him to be in contempt of the order of Roberts
J., dated August 29, 1997, and ordering that a warrant of
committal issue and that the appellant be imprisoned in a
provincial correctional institution for 10 days.

[2]  The following three grounds of appeal are raised:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.     that Coo J. erred in finding that the appellant had failed
       to comply with the order of Roberts J.;
2.     that in finding the appellant liable for contempt, Coo J.
       failed to apply the criminal standard of proof; and
3.     that Roberts J.’s order, upon which Coo J. based his
       finding of contempt, was a nullity because it prescribed a pre-
       determined penalty of 10 days’ imprisonment in default of the
       appellant purging his contempt.</pre>
    <pre>     Background Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]  By judgment dated January 2, 1994, the appellant was found
liable to the respondent and ordered to pay the amount of
$423,213.72 plus interest and costs.

[4]  The respondent summoned the appellant to attend on May 1,
1996 for an examination in aid of execution. The appellant failed
to attend and the respondent moved before Master Peppiat and
obtained an order, dated January 27, 1997, requiring that the
appellant attend on February 3, 1997 to be examined.

[5]  The appellant did not attend on February 3rd as required. To
make matters worse, between that date and May 15, 1997, he failed
to attend on no less than five subsequent occasions. Accordingly,
on August 29, 1997, the respondent moved before the Honourable
Mr. Justice Roberts for an order declaring the appellant to be in
contempt of Master Peppiat’s order.

[6]  At the hearing before Roberts J., the parties were
represented by counsel and each side filed material. In the
result, Roberts J. found the appellant to be in contempt of
Master Peppiat’s order. Rather than ordering the appellant’s
immediate imprisonment, Roberts J. chose instead to give him one
final chance to purge his contempt. To that end, he ordered that
the appellant attend on October 9, 1997 to be examined in aid of
execution and that he bring all of his financial records, tax
returns or documents relating to his world-wide financial assets.
Failing such attendance, Roberts J. ordered that the appellant be
immediately imprisoned for a period of 10 days for his contempt.
No appeal was taken from this order.

[7]  On October 9, 1997, the appellant attended at the
examination as required. However, he brought no financial records
with him and he failed to answer relevant questions and behaved
himself in a manner which effectively rendered the examination
meaningless.

[8]  Consequently, the respondent moved before the Honourable Mr.
Justice Coo on February 25, 1998 for an order declaring the
appellant to be in contempt of Roberts J.’s order. In support of
the application, the respondent filed a motion record which
included an affidavit setting out the history of the matter and a
transcript of the appellant’s October 9th examination. The
appellant, though represented by counsel, placed no responding
material before the court.</pre>
    <pre>     Coo J.’s Order of February 25, 1998</pre>
    <pre>[9]  After receiving full submissions, Coo J. found the appellant
to be in contempt of Roberts J.’s order and he ordered that a
warrant of committal issue and that the appellant be imprisoned
for 10 days in accordance with the penalty provision of Roberts
J.’s order.

[10] In support of his conclusion that the appellant had failed
to comply with Roberts J.’s order, Coo J. noted that although the
appellant attended the examination, he did not produce any
financial records and in declining “to answer a series of
entirely legitimate questions”, his attendance was “useless from
the perspective of the judgment creditor and his counsel.”

[11] Coo J. refused to give effect to the only submission made on
behalf of the appellant, namely, that he be given a short period
of time to purge his contempt. In Coo J.’s opinion, having regard
to the history of the matter and the appellant’s failure to
provide any reasonable excuse for failing to produce financial
records and answer legitimate questions, no such indulgence was
warranted.</pre>
    <pre>     Coo J.’s Order of March 2, 1998</pre>
    <pre>[12] On March 2, 1998, the appellant moved before Coo J. seeking
to have him set aside his original order. In support of his
application, the appellant filed an affidavit in which he sought
to explain why he had not failed to comply with Roberts J.’s
order. He also raised, for the first time, the issue that Roberts
J.’s order was a nullity because it prescribed a fixed penalty of
10 days’ imprisonment in default of the appellant purging his
contempt.

[13] Coo J. dismissed the application. In his view, there was
nothing in the appellant’s affidavit which caused him to doubt
his original conclusion. As for the validity of Roberts J.’s
order, much as he did not subscribe to the practice of fixing a
penalty in advance, Coo J. was satisfied that such orders were
lawful and that he had no authority to interfere with Roberts
J.’s disposition. Notably, Coo J. made it clear that even if he
had come to a different conclusion on this issue, he would not
have interfered with the 10 day penalty imposed. In his view, it
was entirely fit.</pre>
    <pre>     Ground 1</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant submits that Coo J. erred in finding that he
failed to comply with Roberts J.’s order. We see no merit in this
ground of appeal.

[15] With respect to the appellant’s failure to produce financial
records, his claim that he had no such records is, in our view,
untenable. Apart from that, the appellant admits to maintaining a
joint bank account with his common law spouse. Despite repeated
requests by the respondent, to date, he has failed to produce the
relevant banking records. His excuse that the bank has not
responded to his requests for production is not borne out by any
evidence and, in our opinion, it is groundless.

[16] As for his submission that he responded properly to the
questions asked of him at the examination, having reviewed the
record, we share Coo J.’s opinion that the appellant’s attendance
was “useless from the perspective of the judgment creditor and
his counsel.”

[17] Far from co-operating and being responsive during the
examination, the appellant did everything in his power to
frustrate it and he succeeded in turning the exercise into one of
futility. In these circumstances, Coo J. was fully justified in
concluding that the obstructionist tactics employed by the
appellant amounted to a clear violation of the spirit and letter
of Roberts J.’s order and his finding of contempt is
unassailable.</pre>
    <pre>     Ground 2</pre>
    <pre>[18] With respect to the second ground of appeal, we are not
persuaded that the trial judge failed to apply the correct
standard of proof. Coo J. rejected the excuses put forward by the
appellant and he found, in no uncertain terms, that the appellant
failed to produce any financial records and that he declined to
answer a series of entirely legitimate questions. These findings
are fully supported by the record and they justify Coo J.’s
conclusion that the appellant was in “clear breach of and in
contempt of the order of Roberts J.”

[19] Coo J.’s failure to expressly state that he directed himself
in accordance with the criminal standard of proof does not
vitiate his finding of contempt so long as the evidence
establishes contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See Re Sheppard
and Sheppard (1976), 67 D.L.R. (3d) 592 (Ont. C.A.))  In our
view, when Coo J.’s reasons are read as a whole, it is apparent
that he was satisfied of the appellant’s contempt beyond any
reasonable doubt and that finding was amply borne out by the
evidence. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Ground 3</pre>
    <pre>[20] The final ground of appeal calls into question the validity
of the contempt order made by Roberts J. The appellant submits
that Roberts J.’s order was a nullity because it prescribed a
predetermined penalty of 10 days’ imprisonment in default of the
appellant purging his contempt. In our view, there are two
reasons why this argument must fail.

[21] First, we are satisfied that Roberts J. was entitled to make
the order he did under Rule 60.11(5)(b), which provides as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (5) In disposing of a motion under subrule (1), the judge
          may make such order as is just, and where a finding of contempt
          is made, the judge may order that the person in contempt,
          </pre>
    <pre>               …
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) be imprisoned if the person fails to
          comply with a term of the order;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[22] The appellant does not suggest that the sanction of
imprisonment for civil contempt is unlawful or that it offends
against his s. 7 Charter rights. Rather, he submits that
predetermined custodial sanctions, envisaged by Rule 60.11(5)(b),
violate his s. 7 Charter rights because he is deprived of the
opportunity of having a hearing and making representations as to
the suitability of the penalty.

[23] In our view, this argument is totally misconceived. What the
appellant fails to recognize is that the predetermined penalty is
the product of a hearing in which the party at risk is afforded
all the procedural protections which accord with the fundamental
principles of justice. (See McClure v. Blacktstein (1987), 17
C.P.C. (2d) 242 (Ont. H.C.) at p. 248)

[24] Once this is understood, it becomes apparent that the nature
of Roberts J.’s order did not work to the appellant’s
disadvantage but it accrued to his benefit. Having found the
appellant in contempt of Master Peppiat’s order, Roberts J. could
have ordered his immediate imprisonment. As it is, he chose not
to, preferring instead to give the appellant one more chance to
purge his contempt. There is nothing unconstitutional about Rule
60.11(5)(b) and Roberts J. was fully entitled to structure his
order as he did.

[25] The second reason for refusing to give effect to this
argument arises from the nature of the motion brought before Coo
J. The motion before Coo J. was not to enforce the penalty
provision of Roberts J.’s order. Rather, it was a free standing
motion under Rule 60.11(1) to have the appellant found in
contempt of Robert J.’s order. Unfortunately, neither the parties
nor Coo J. seemed to appreciate this.

[26] With respect to Coo J., in approaching the matter as he did,
he misinterpreted his function. As his reasons indicate, Coo J.
was under the mistaken belief that he was bound by the penalty
provision of Roberts J.’s order. That was not the case. To the
extent that he was satisfied of the appellant’s contempt in
respect of Roberts J.’s order, he was entitled to make any order
available under Rule 60.11(5) that he deemed appropriate.

[27] Had Coo J. followed the correct approach, he might well have
imposed an additional period of custody on the appellant over and
above the 10 days which Roberts J. had imposed upon him for his
contempt of Master Peppiat’s order. As it is, Coo J.’s mistake
enured to the benefit of the appellant and he ended up receiving
one punishment for two separate and distinct contempts.

[28] Under ordinary circumstances, we would remit the matter to
Coo J. for disposition. However, this relief was not requested by
the respondent and, as we have indicated, Coo J. felt that the
period of 10 days’ imprisonment was appropriate. It follows, in
our view, that the appeal should simply be dismissed.

[29] In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
