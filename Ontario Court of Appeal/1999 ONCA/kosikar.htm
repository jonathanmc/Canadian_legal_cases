</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice B. Durno dated
December 21, 1998 and from the order of the Ontario Review Board
dated June 10, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  January  15, 1998 the appellant sent a  letter  to  the
complainant  as  a result of which he was charged  with  criminal
harassment, contrary to s. 264 of the Criminal Code.
[2]  The Crown proceeded summarily and on April 20, 1998, the
appellant was found guilty. The court determined that he was not
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and
continued his detention at the Penatanguishene Mental Health
Centre. On June 10, 1998 the Ontario Review Board ordered that he
remain in detention there subject to conditions.
[3]  The appellant appealed the finding of guilt and on
December 21, 1998, Durno J. dismissed his appeal.
[4]  Before this court, the appellant seeks leave to appeal and,
if leave be granted, appeals from the order of Durno J. He also
appeals from the order of the Ontario Review Board.
[5]  The appellant raised a number of arguments, all but one
without merit. The court called on the Crown only on the issue of
whether a single incident (in this case the letter) can found a
conviction under s. 264, given the harassment component of the
offence.
[6]  For the reasons that follow I have concluded that, as a
matter of law, a single incident can do so. Therefore, while the
motion for leave is otherwise unsuccessful, leave is granted on
this issue but the appeal must be dismissed.
[7]  The appeal from the order of the Ontario Review Board also
fails as there was ample basis for the conclusion reached by the
Board and there was no error of law or miscarriage of justice in
its proceedings.
[8]  Turning to the &#147;single incident&#148; issue, the relevant facts
are as follows. The complainant, who was thirty-three years old
at the time of trial in 1998, first met the appellant,
Mr. Kosikar, sometime in 1983. He frequently came into the
restaurant where she was a waitress. He would try to sit in her
section and engage her in small talk. While he wanted to commence
a relationship with her, the complainant made it clear to him
that she was not interested and wanted him to leave her alone.
[9]  Despite this he persisted and began sending her letters and,
once he found out where she lived, leaving gifts at her
apartment. Once, she found him sleeping in the hall by her front
door. She changed jobs but that did not help. She moved to a
different community but he managed to locate her. The letters and
gifts kept coming with only short interruptions. Over time, the
letters began to carry the theme that God had promised her to
him, that she had no free will, and that her life had been
predestined to be with him.
[10] On October 27, 1992, she obtained a peace bond which he
honoured for its one-year period but as soon as that ended, he
recommenced the sending of letters. On September 26, 1994, he was
convicted of criminal harassment and received three years'
probation.
[11] During his term of probation and for several months
thereafter the complainant did not hear from him. Then, on
January 15, 1998, the letter arrived. It reiterated his love for
her. It rebuked her lifestyle and offered to save her for God.
Unlike the prior letters, it contained explicit and aggressive
sexual references. The letter left her very shaken.
[12] The appellant was charged pursuant to s. 264 of the Criminal
Code. The Crown's case was that although there had been no other
contact in the six months preceding the charge, the January 15
letter constituted threatening conduct for the purposes of
s. 264(2)(d) and that the other elements of the offence had, in
the circumstances, all been made out. The Crown relied on the
earlier relationship between the appellant and the complainant to
prove these elements, particularly that the complainant was
harassed on receipt of the letter.
[13] In relevant part, s. 264 reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Criminal harassment
          </pre>
    <pre>                     264(1)   No person shall,  without
          lawful  authority  and knowing  that  another
          person  is  harassed  or  recklessly  as   to
          whether the other person is harassed,  engage
          in conduct referred to in subsection (2) that
          causes  that other person reasonably, in  all
          the  circumstances, to fear for their  safety
          or the safety of anyone known to them.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>               Prohibited conduct
          </pre>
    <pre>                      (2)   The  conduct  mentioned  in
          subsection (1) consists of
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  repeatedly following from place  to
               place the other person or anyone known to
               them;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)    repeatedly  communicating   with,
               either directly or indirectly, the other
               person or anyone known to them;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  besetting or watching the dwelling-
               house,  or place where the other person,
               or anyone known to them, resides, works,
               carries on business or happens to be; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)   engaging  in  threatening  conduct
               directed  at  the other  person  or  any
               member of their family.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  There is no doubt, as found by the courts below,  that  the
letter  received on January 15 was threatening to the complainant
and  reasonably caused her to fear for her safety. Equally, there
is  no  doubt that the appellant was at the least reckless as  to
the complainant's reaction to it. These aspects of the matter are
not in issue on this appeal.
[15] On the issue that is contested, the &#147;single incident&#148; issue,
Durno J. found that the applicable subsection, s. 264(2)(d), does
not require a course of conduct to found a conviction. He
concluded that a single act, in this case the sending of the
letter, will suffice if the consequence is that the complainant
is being harassed.
[16] In reaching this conclusion, he agreed with prior decisions
to the same effect: R. v. Riossi (1997), 6 C.R. (5th) 123 (Ont.
Ct. Gen. Div.) and R. v. Belcher (1998), O.J. No. 137 (Ont. Ct.
Gen. Div.). He disagreed with a conflicting line of authority led
by R. v. Johnston (1995), O.J. No. 3118 (Ont. Ct. Prov. Div.)
where MacDonnell Prov. Div. J. concluded that a single act does
not qualify because both the gravamen of the offence, namely
harassment, and the statutory interpretation of s. 264(2)(d)
require a course of threatening conduct, not just one incident.
[17] I agree with the conclusion reached by Durno J.
[18] As Proulx J.A. said in R. v. Lamontagne (1998), 129 C.C.C.
(3d) 181 (Que. C.A.), s. 264(1) sets out the constituent elements
of the offence which must be proven whereas s. 264(2) describes
the four types of prohibited conduct to which subsection (1)
refers.
[19] I also agree with Proulx J.A.&#146;s adoption, from R. v. Sillipp
(1997), 11 C.R.R (5th) 71 (Alta. C.A.), of the following
description of the five essential elements of the offence:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1)        It must be established that the accused has
               engaged in the conduct set out in s. 264(2)(a), (b), (c), or (d)
               of the Criminal Code.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)    It  must be established  that  the
               complainant was harassed;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3)    It  must be established  that  the
               accused who engaged in such conduct knew
               that the complainant was harassed or was
               reckless or wilfully blind as to whether
               the complainant was harassed;
          </pre>
    <pre>               4)    It  must be established  that  the
               conduct  caused the complainant to  fear
               for  her safety or the safety of  anyone
               known to her; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               5)    It  must be established  that  the
               complainant's fear was, in  all  of  the
               circumstances, reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[20]  As a matter of statutory interpretation I do not think that
s.  264(2)(d) is limited to repeated threatening conduct  to  the
exclusion  of  a  single  threatening act.  Parliament  expressly
required  repeated  conduct in defining the  prohibited  acts  in
s.  264(2)(a)  and  (b). The absence of such a  qualification  in
s.  264(2)(d) strongly suggests to me a legislative intention not
to  confine that prohibition to repeated threatening conduct, but
to encompass a single threatening act as well.
[21] This conclusion is further supported by the wording of
s.264(2)(c) where the proscribed conduct at least of watching can
surely occur on a single occasion. Hence, there can be no
suggestion that in s.264(2) Parliament intended to proscribe only
repetitive conduct.
[22] Nor can it be said that the threatening conduct must itself
be harassment and therefore repetitious. Section 264 simply
requires that the threatening conduct cause the complainant to be
harassed. The threatening conduct can be constituted by a single
act provided it carries as a consequence that the complainant is
in a state of being harassed. Proulx J.A. put it this way in
Lamontagne, supra, at p. 188:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Because of the distinction which Parliament made
          between the prohibited conduct within the meaning of s-s. (2) and
          the harassment as the ultimate consequence of the conduct, one
          cannot just equate the two, which thereby creates the necessity,
          as I previously pointed out, to consider the definition of the
          state of being &quot;harassed&quot;, independently from the prohibited
          conduct which may cause this state and which is expressly
          provided for in s-s. (2).</pre>
    <pre>[23]  Proulx  J.A.  also provided valuable assistance  in  giving
meaning  to  this  element of the actus  reus,  namely  that  the
complainant  be in a state of being harassed as a consequence  of
the prohibited conduct. At p. 186, supra, he said this:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The second element of the actus reus, that is that the
          complainant was harassed, appears even more clear in the English
          version of the text which requires knowledge that the victim &quot;is
          harassed&quot;, whereas the French version refers to knowledge that
          the complainant &quot;feels harassed&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[24] He went on at p. 188, supra:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    &quot;Harassment&quot; was not defined by Parliament in s. 264.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  Ryback and Sillipp, supra, the
          courts  agree to give this word a  contextual
          interpretation. These cases point out that it
          is  not  sufficient that the  complainant  be
          &quot;vexed,  disquieted  or annoyed&quot;,  rather  it
          must  be  demonstrated  that  the  prohibited
          conduct    &quot;tormented,   troubled,    worried
          continually    or    chronically,    plagued,
          bedeviled and badgered&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Hence,  I  think this element of the offence  requires  the
Crown  to prove that as a consequence of the prohibited  act  the
complainant was in a state of being harassed or felt harassed  in
the sense of feeling &quot;tormented, troubled, worried continually or
chronically,  plagued, bedeviled and badgered&quot;. The statute  says
nothing  that  would  preclude  a  single  threatening  act  from
producing  this  consequence. In other words, while  being  in  a
harassed  state  involves  a sense of being  subject  to  ongoing
torment, a single incident in the right context can surely  cause
this feeling.
[26] In summary, therefore, I conclude that neither the
proscribed conduct in s. 264(2)(d), nor the consequence required
of the complainant prevent a single act from founding a
conviction. If the single incident is threatening conduct and if,
in the circumstances,  it causes the complainant to feel
harassed, then these two elements of the offence are made out.
That occurred in this case.
[27] This conclusion is enough to answer the question of law
raised on this appeal. However, the peculiar facts of this case
warrant one further comment. Here, the single incident
constituting the threatening conduct is the sending of the letter
in January 1998. The evidence of the prior contact between the
appellant and the complainant is used to prove that as a
consequence, the complainant felt harassed. That prior contact is
not an element of the offence. The fact that the complainant felt
harassed as a consequence of receiving the letter is. Hence, this
conviction is not a second conviction of the appellant for this
prior contact.
[28] Moreover, while in this case the prior contact is important
proof of the consequence caused to the complainant, it is
possible to imagine a case where the complainant's feeling
harassed would be proven not through the context of prior contact
but by evidence of a single incident that carried the real future
prospect of the continuing tormenting of the complainant. In
other words, prior contact may not be the only way of proving the
necessary consequence of a single act of threatening conduct.
[29] In the result, leave is granted on the question whether a
single incident can found a conviction given the harassment
component of the offence. I conclude that it can do so. The
appeal must therefore be dismissed.
