    <pre>On appeal from the Order of L.C. Kozak J. dated August 10, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, the appeal should be allowed but on terms. The
appellant wife was served substitutionally by service on her son
in accordance with an order providing for that service. The son
stated in his affidavit that he did not inform the appellant that
he had been served with the respondent&#146;s petition for divorce and
his net family property statement. Indeed, the son stated that he
did not recall having received that documentation. In the result,
the appellant did not respond to the respondent&#146;s petition for
divorce or file her own net family property statement. As a
consequence, the matter came before the trial judge as an
undefended proceeding. The appellant was informed of the trial
judgment within a short time after it was issued and promptly
moved to set aside that part of it that dealt with the
equalization payment.
[2]  The motions judge who heard the appellant&#146;s motion to set
aside the default judgment dismissed the appellant&#146;s motion in
part because he concluded that the material did not show &#147;an
arguable cause on the merits.&#148;
[3]  In the respondent&#146;s petition and in his net family property
the respondent described the whole of the property at 390 Algoma
Street, Thunder Bay as the matrimonial home which was owned by
the appellant. Substantially on this basis the trial judge
determined that the equalization payment to be paid by the
appellant to the respondent was $97,500.
[4]  On this appeal the appellant has pointed to evidence that
was before the trial judge and the motions judge that would
suggest that about 2/3 of 390 Algoma Street (a multiple dwelling)
was not a matrimonial home as that term is defined in the Family
Law Act. If that is correct (and we make no further comment on
that issue since 390 Algoma Street was an inherited property
which the appellant brought into the marriage) credit should have
been given in the determination of the appropriate equalization
payment representing the value of the non-matrimonial home part
of this property as of the date of the marriage.
[5]  We agree with Mr. Slan that this aspect of the appellant&#146;s
case was not put to the motions judge with much clarity.
Nonetheless, we think that the material before the motions judge
did reflect an issue that ought to be tried to avoid a
miscarriage of justice. Thus, we allow the appeal, set aside the
order of the motions judge and paragraph 1 of the trial judgment.
We think that in the circumstances the appellant should pay the
trial costs fixed in paragraph 3 of the trial judgment at
$1,000.00, no costs of the motion before Kozak J. and the costs
of this appeal which we fix at $1,500. Those costs totalling
$2,500 should be secured against the appellant&#146;s interest in 390
Algoma Street.
[6]  There should be a trial of an issue to determine the
appropriate equalization payment in the particular circumstances
of this case. On that issue the parties should file fresh net
family property statements within 30 days. The trial court will
determine what other management-related directions should be
given in respect of the trial on the equalization payment issue.
Since the issue to be tried is an issue in the divorce
preoceeding, the respondent (petitioner) should be the plaintiff
and the appellant the defendant. If she chooses to do so, the
appellant should be permitted to seek an equalization payment by
counter-claim in the issue to be tried.</pre></td>
