    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks an adjournment of the appeal so as to
allow it to bring a motion before the trial judge under Rule
59.06 to vary the judgment on the basis of facts discovered after
it was made. The appellant relies on information it has received
that the landlord sold the property without the need to have
certain leasehold improvements removed.  Counsel argues that this
evidence may affect the quantum of damages  awarded with respect
to the cost of removing leasehold improvements. The sole issue
pursued on the appeal (other than costs) is whether the trial
judge erred in finding that the tenant was obligated to remove
the leasehold improvements and trade fixtures upon the expiration
of the term of the lease.

[2]  The new evidence can have no bearing on the determination of
this issue. The request for adjournment is therefore denied
without prejudice to the appellant’s right to bring its proposed
motion under Rule 59.06. We make no comment on whether there are
any grounds to bring the proposed motion or on its merits, if
any.

[3]  We see no error in the trial judge’s interpretation of the
relevant provisions of the lease or in the exercise of her
discretion with respect to costs.

[4]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs on a solicitor
and client basis.</pre></td>
