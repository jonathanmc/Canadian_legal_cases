    <pre><font size="4">CARTHY J.A.:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[1]   The  issues  on  this  appeal  are  whether  the  jury  was
misdirected  in  the  charge as to alibi and  whether  the  split
verdicts   were   irreconcilable  and  the   verdict   of   guilt
unreasonable.

[2]  A shooting occurred on Saturday, June 17, 1995 in a food
court at Yonge and Bloor Streets, Toronto. A second shooting
occurred on June 18th at a nearby address on Sherbourne Street.
Two of the complainants in the first shooting were victims in the
second shooting. The bullets in each shooting came from the same
gun. The central issue for the jury to decide was whether the
appellant was involved in these occurrences. He presented alibi
evidence as to both.

[3]  After a trial before Ferguson J. and a jury, verdicts were
returned of not guilty of discharging a firearm with intent and
related offences alleged to have occurred on June 17th  and
guilty of attempted murder and related offences on June 18th. The
appellant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.

[4]  The essence of the appellant&#146;s position is that the trial
judge&#146;s charge left it open to the jury to use their disbelief of
the alibi evidence concerning June 18th  to convict the appellant
concerning that event and that this verdict is irreconcilable
with an acquittal as to the June 17th event, both being dependant
upon the identification evidence of the complainants and the
bullets in each shooting coming from the same gun. The Crown&#146;s
position is that there was no error in the charge and that the
jury simply accepted some, but not all, of the evidence from the
victims.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">The Facts</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     The June 17th Incident</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[5]   In the mid-afternoon of June 17th ,  the three complainants
were  in  a  food court in the Hudson&#146;s Bay Centre at  Bloor  and
Yonge  in  Toronto.  The complainants were  Arunagiri  Ponnuthari
(Arune),   Jeevanthirajah  Thiyagarajah  (Jeeva),  and   Jeevaraj
Somasundram (Sundram). These three friends, who lived  in  nearby
St.  James  Town apartments, all knew the appellant  and  Ashokan
Thiyagarajah (Ashokan), who also lived in St. James Town.

[6]  Arune and Sundram were at the counter ordering food when
they heard a gunshot and testified that they turned to see the
appellant pointing a gun at Jeeva, who was sitting at a table.
They said that the appellant was no more than 25 feet from them.
Jeeva testified that the appellant was 20 feet from him and
staring into his eyes when he shot. No one was hit by the bullet.
Two of the complainants testified that Ashokan was with the
appellant at the food court.

[7]  There were three independent witnesses to this event.
Rothman Mena was ten feet from the shooter and saw him just after
the gunfire and as he ran out the door. Mena later identified
Ashokan as the shooter in a photo line-up and did not recognize a
photo of the appellant. Nor did he see a second person leaving
the scene.

[8]  Troy Bacchus saw a person firing three shots and thereafter
fleeing the scene. He saw no one leave with him. He described the
shooter as 5&#146;8&#148; to 5&#146;10&#148; (the appellant is 5&#146;2&#148; and weighed 120
lbs.). He also identified Ashokan in a photo line-up and did not
recognize a photo of the appellant in another line-up.

[9]  Pratheep Rajendra saw two men running from the food court
and picked out Ashokan from a photo line-up. At trial he said the
appellant did not resemble the person running with Ashokan.

[10] The complainants delayed reporting the shooting to the
police, and there were inconsistencies between some of the
earlier reports and evidence given at trial. However, the thrust
of the defence position was that the complainants  had
intentionally framed the appellant, motivated, it was alleged, by
a rather tenuous connection between the complainants and a person
who had been charged with a stabbing following the report of the
stabbing by the appellant to the police. The appellant sought to
establish that the person charged was a member of a gang to which
the complainants belonged and that their evidence against the
appellant was some form of revenge.

[11] The appellant testified that on June 17th he had spent the
day with his family visiting an aunt in Don Mills. He was
supported by the evidence of his mother, father, brother and
aunt. No one testified to challenge this evidence.

[12] On the charges related to June 17, the appellant was
acquitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     The June 18th Incident</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[13]  At about 7:00 p.m., Arune and Jeeva were approaching a  van
they  had  rented   which  was  parked  outside  their  apartment
building on Sherbourne Street when, they testified, Ashokan,  the
appellant  and  a third man with a broken tooth came  running  at
them  shouting  threats of shooting them.  Arune  testified  that
Ashokan  and  the  appellant each had a gun and  that  the  third
person  had  an axe. Arune and Jeeva retreated behind  the  glass
lobby  doors  and Jeeva said that Ashokan started firing  through
the   glass,  wounding  Arune  in  the  abdomen.  Another  bullet
ricocheted off Jeeva&#146;s belt buckle.

[14] Vijay Iyathamay was a friend of Arune and was waiting in the
rented van about 20 feet from the shooting. He said he saw two
men at the entrance, one being Ashokan, who had a gun, and the
other man, who had an axe. He knew the appellant and did not see
him at the scene.

[15] Andrew Smeeton was a taxi driver who saw two men with guns
and one man with a hatchet walk in front of his car and, as they
got close to the lobby, bullets were shot through the glass. He
described all three men as about 5&#146;10&#148; and could not identify
photos of the appellant or Ashokan in a photo line-up.

[16] Bruno Borges, a twelve year old boy, heard the gunshots and
saw three men running, two with guns and one with something that
looked like a hammer which the man was trying to hide. The
&#147;hammer&#148; was later found and was, in fact, a hatchet.

[17] As stated earlier, the bullets fired on June 18th were
identified as fired by the same gun that was used in the food
court on June 17th.

[18] The appellant presented alibi evidence for June 18th. He
said that his cricket club coach phoned him in the morning and
asked him to attend a park at Caledonia and Lawrence Avenues for
a cricket match. The evidence was that the appellant, his
brother, and a friend drove to the park at 12:30 p.m. The
appellant testified that he did not get home until 10:00 p.m. Two
friends testified that they saw him at the park at 1:00 p.m. The
appellant&#146;s girlfriend stated that she saw him at the park when
she left at 7:00 p.m. (the time of the shooting). The appellant&#146;s
brother testified that they were both at the park all day,
leaving at 8:30 p.m.

[19] The appellant&#146;s testimony was that he did not play that day.
Rather, he rooted for his team and then served as umpire. His
friend, Navaneethan, said the appellant played all day and the
appellant&#146;s girlfriend said she watched him play for 1 ½ hours.
The appellant could not remember the names of the teams he
umpired for and said that he ended up at a restaurant where the
winning team and friends were celebrating. However, the coach
testified that he attended a reception for the winning team at a
hall and the appellant was not there.

[20] The Crown called no evidence concerning this alibi, but
there are clearly sufficient inconsistencies to make one pause
before relying upon it. The jury apparently did pause and
rejected the alibi in convicting the appellant. The question is
whether the jury moved directly from a rejection of the alibi to
a conviction on the basis, in whole or in part, of that
rejection. This leads directly to a consideration to the trial
judge&#146;s charge as to the proper use in deliberations of a
conclusion that an alibi is false.*</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">The Charge</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">
[21]  The  trial  judge&#146;s charge with respect  to  alibi  was  as
follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">             Dealing with each of the alibis separately. If you
   believe the alibi evidence, then you must acquit the accused. If
   you do not believe the alibi evidence but are left in a state of
   reasonable doubt about it, you must acquit the accused of the
   charge with respect to a date. Even if the alibi evidence does
   not in itself raise a reasonable doubt, you must determine based
   on all of the other evidence presented whether the Crown has
   proven the guilt of the accused and the various offences beyond a
   reasonable doubt. If you find as a fact that an alibi has been
   proven to be false, you may consider that evidence together with
   all of the other evidence in determining whether the Crown has
   proven the accused&#146;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">                      There  is,  of  course,  a  clear
          distinction  between  an  alibi   which   you
          disbelieve  and,  therefore,  reject  and  an
          alibi  which  is  proven  to  be  false.   In
          assessing  all of the  evidence with  respect
          to  alibi  you  are  entitled  to  take  into
          consideration in determining the validity  of
          the alibi whether the Crown has proven beyond
          a  reasonable doubt the alibi is false,  that
          the  alibi  is  attested  to  by  friends  or
          relatives  of the accused, having  regard  to
          the fact that you may in your view think that
          one or more of those individuals may have  an
          interest  in  the outcome of the  trial.  But
          always  remember,  as  you  must,  that   any
          witness,   even  though  the  witness   maybe
          partisan,  may also be telling the  truth  to
          the Court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[22]  This  court has consistently held that in  the  absence  of
evidence of concoction, (there is no suggestion by the Crown that
such  exists in this case), an alibi that is disbelieved  has  no
evidentiary  value. It should not be added to other  evidence  to
contribute to a finding of guilt. See R. v. Coutts and  Middleton
(1998),  126  C.C.C.  (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.) at  pp.550-52,  R.  v.
Witter (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 44 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 52-53, R. v.
Mahoney (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 388-89.  As
explained by Doherty J.A. in Coutts, this cannot be justified  by
pure logic because in many cases the inference of concoction, and
thus  consciousness of guilt, may flow naturally from  disbelief.
However,  the  safeguard is necessary to prevent  the  jury  from
short  circuiting the Crown&#146;s obligation to prove guilt beyond  a
reasonable doubt by moving directly from disbelief of an alibi to
a  finding  of  guilt. That danger could not be  more  strikingly
evident  than on these facts where the alibi is stronger  on  one
day  than on another, the witnesses, who know the appellant,  say
he  was a participant on both days, and the bullets on both  days
come from one gun.

[23] On the evidence at trial it is conceivable that the
witnesses to the alibi, including the appellant, were confused as
to the date. Perhaps the witnesses were recounting events of
three other cricket matches. The jury may have concluded that the
witnesses were simply mistaken in relating the events to June
18th . If so, no conclusion whatsoever should be drawn as to
where the appellant was at the time of the shooting. There is
simply no evidence as to that date. But, if there was evidence
from which to find that the witnesses, or some of them, had
conspired to concoct the alibi, an inference of guilt would be
available to consider with the other evidence in arriving at a
verdict. The trial judge&#146;s charge fell far short of assisting the
jury in understanding this essential difference. He said there
was a difference between an alibi that is disbelieved and one
that is false but did not explain the effect of that difference,
let alone the significance of a concoction.

[24] The Crown relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Michaud (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.),
where Sopinka J. concluded his brief oral reasons with the
comment:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">     We find no error in the charge in respect of this ground nor
   in the charge relating to the alibi evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[25]  This observation was obiter in the course of dismissing  an
appeal  from  the  New Brunswick Court of Appeal  R.  v.  Michaud
(1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 121 (N.B.C.A.), which had directed  a  new
trial  on multiple grounds including a finding that the following
direction of the trial judge was erroneous:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">      On the other hand, if you determine that the alibi is false,
   and it was put forward to deceive you, this allows you to draw
   the inference that Félix Michaud is guilty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[26]  We cannot know if the Supreme Court viewed this as a charge
related  to  concoction,  or  if the comment  was  per  incuriam.
Standing  as a passing obiter observation, it cannot be taken  as
overruling consistent appellate rulings to the contrary. Further,
leave  to  appeal was denied by the Supreme Court  in  Coutts  on
March 4th , 1999.

[27] It is my conclusion that the trial judge&#146;s charge as to
alibi was a serious misdirection to the jury, and if confirmation
be needed as to the reasoning process which the charge
encouraged, it can be found in the words of the trial judge
himself, following the verdict:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">        You know, so often a judge will say something about a
   verdict to a jury. Well, I say this, when I concluded all of my
   remarks and dealt with the evidence, I was convinced in my own
   mind that I thought you would have a great deal of difficulty
   with respect to the alibi evidence about Sunday. And I think that
   I can therefore understand your verdict and can say that I
   believe your verdict was in accordance with the evidence that was
   presented before the Court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">
[28]  In  other  words, if Sunday&#146;s alibi  was  rejected  it  was
expected that a conviction would follow.

[29] I have no hesitation in concluding that the charge on alibi
in the present case was wrong in law and may well have misled the
jury to a verdict that it might not otherwise have reached. Nor
can I find any other segment of the charge which allays this very
specific direction.

[30] A more difficult question is whether the verdict is
unreasonable, given the acquittals on the charges arising from
events on the previous day. The appellant argues that the
acquittals by the jury regarding the June 17th occurrence could
only flow from a disbelief of the evidence of  complainants. They
could not have been mistaken as to the identity of the appellant
because he was physically too close and they knew him. Therefore,
there was a conspiracy to frame him and it would be unreasonable
to believe those same witnesses as to the events of June 18th.
The Crown&#146;s position is that a jury is free to accept some
evidence of a witness and to reject other evidence, and that one
cannot conclude that the jury did not take a proper view of the
evidence relating to each day and then found a doubt as to the
evidence of the complainants relating to June 17th and no doubt
as to their evidence relating to June 18th. On this analysis by
the Crown there should be a new trial as to the events of June
18th, if there was error in the charge. The defence argument
would lead to an acquittal on the June 18th charges.

[31] After much deliberation, I have analyzed what likely
occurred in a different manner than either counsel. The trial
judge&#146;s charge was an invitation to judge these events on the
basis of the alibis and in my view it is most likely that the
jury did just that. The jury may well have taken the invitation
to look first at the alibis, concluded that one was true and the
other untrue or not reliable, and then moved directly to a
finding of not guilty as to the events of June 17th and guilty as
to the charges relating to June 18th. If so, they may never have
considered the credibility of the complainants on either occasion
and the apparent contradiction in accepting their evidence as to
one day and rejecting their evidence as to another day.

[32] If that be so, the acquittals, even if they had been
appealed, would stand because if the alibi for June 17th is
accepted the appellant must be found not guilty. The same
reasoning does not apply to the guilty verdict. If the alibi for
June 18th is questioned then it can play no part in the evidence
to be considered and the jury would have to consider the
credibility of the victims on that occasion together with their
evidence on the previous day. My concern with the invitation in
the erroneous charge is that they did not reach the issue of
credibility of the victims and, therefore, the guilt or innocence
of the appellant was never assessed on a proper basis.

[33] I am supported in these inferences by the manner in which
the defence argument was presented and the remarks of the trial
judge following the verdicts. The essence of the defence
submissions to the jury on the alibi issue was that the alibi
evidence was solid for June 17th and, while more questionable for
June 18th, that alibi evidence was at least sufficient to raise a
reasonable doubt. To that extent, a focus was placed upon the
reliability of the alibis. The trial judge&#146;s comments, quoted
earlier in these reasons, demonstrate that  he too felt that the
strength of the alibis was determinative.

[34] In some instances where verdicts appear irreconcilable, the
conclusion must be that the jury has compromised the verdicts or
has been confused by the evidence and, in the absence of
explanation, the guilty verdict must be set aside and an
acquittal entered. See R. v. D.T. (1998), O.J. No. 1583, a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, released April 16,
1998, and R. v. McShannock (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (Ont. C.A.).
The difference here is that we have an explanation, or at least
one inferred from the sequence of events at trial, as to the
manner in which the jury went astray.

[35] As I see it, the appearance of irreconcilability points not
to innocence of the June 18th charges, but rather to an
incomplete assessment of the evidence and the need for a new
trial.

[36] I would therefore set aside the convictions relating to June
18th 1995, and direct a new trial on each charge.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">FELDMAN J.A. (Dissenting In Part)
</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[37]  I  have  read the reasons of  my brother  Carthy  J.A.  and
agree  with  them on the issue of misdirection of the  jury  with
respect  to  the  use  the  jury could  properly  make  of  alibi
evidence.  However, in my view, the appropriate  remedy  in  this
case  is  that the convictions relating to June 18, 1995  be  set
aside and acquittals entered.

[38] The jury was told by the trial judge that their obligation
was to consider the evidence as a whole in respect of each
charge. Therefore in considering the appellant's alibi for June
17, the jury was obliged to view that evidence in the context of
all the other evidence including the evidence of all of the eye
witnesses to the shooting. Other than the evidence of the
victims, there was nothing connecting the accused with the
shooting. To the contrary, all of the independent witnesses saw
someone who was not the accused at the scene that day. There was
no evidence which supported the victims' identification of the
appellant. In my view there is no reason to presume that in
acquitting the accused, the jury did not follow the instructions
of the trial judge and assess the credibility of the victims in
the context of all of the evidence relating to the June 17
charges; nor that the jury may not have assessed the evidence
differently, including the alibi evidence, had there been
something more to connect the appellant with the shooting that
day.

[39] The Crown&#146;s only evidence for June 18 linking the appellant
to the scene was the evidence of the same complainants. There is
no other or independent evidence either of a physical nature or
of any witness to connect the appellant with the June 18
shooting. Again to the contrary, there is the evidence of three
independent witnesses, one of whom knew the appellant, who do not
support the evidence of the complainants that the appellant was
present and involved in the incident that day. In other words, it
is only evidence from the same victims who knew and recognized
the appellant, and whose evidence was not sufficient to satisfy
the jury beyond a reasonable doubt for the June 17 incident,
which is the only evidence available to satisfy them to the same
standard on the June 18 incident. This was not a case where there
was any suggestion of mistake by the complainants or of any
inability to see or recognize the assailants.

[40] In the case of  R.v. D.T. [1998] O.J. No. 1583, Charron J.A.
stated  at para. 5:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">         The law is clear that, before an appellate court will
   interfere with a verdict on the ground that it is inconsistent,
   the appellant bears the onus to show that no reasonable jury who
   had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at
   that conclusion: R.v. McLaughlin (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 562
   (O.C.A.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="4">[41]  In  my  view  the appellant has met that  onus.  I  am  not
prepared  to  speculate  that  the  jury  never  considered   the
credibility  of the victims on the June 17 charges,  contrary  to
the  instructions of the trial judge. Their verdict of  acquittal
stands  on those charges, and given the available Crown  evidence
on  the June 18 charges, a verdict of guilty on those charges  is
necessarily inconsistent and therefore unreasonable  on  all  the
evidence  before the jury. To summarize, where the  Crown&#146;s  only
evidence linking the appellant with each incident is the evidence
of  the  complainants  who  knew  the  appellant  and  positively
identified  him on both days, then if the June 17  charges  fall,
the June 18 charges must  also fall.

[42] I would therefore set aside the convictions and enter
verdicts of acquittal on the June 18 charges.
