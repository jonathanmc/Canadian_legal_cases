    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raised five grounds of appeal regarding his
conviction and sentence.
[2]  The first ground, did the trial judge err by failing to
explain to the jury that, to constitute the offence of sexual
assault causing bodily harm, the bodily harm must occur &#147;in
committing&#148; a sexual assault? In our opinion, there was no error
in the trial judge&#146;s instruction to the jury. We reject the
suggestion by the appellant that this instruction appeared to
preclude the possibility of the jury returning with a verdict of
guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The appellant&#146;s defence
was consent simpliciter.  There is no air of reality to the
suggestion that there could be a verdict of not guilty to sexual
assault causing bodily harm but guilty to assault causing bodily
harm. The instruction that the jury could find the appellant
guilty of assault alone is very generous to the appellant.  It
was not an error to fail to instruct them that a verdict of
guilty of assault causing bodily harm was available as well.
[3]  The second ground is with respect to the reply evidence.
While technically there may have been an element of case
splitting by the Crown, since the evidence of semen in the
victim&#146;s vagina could readily have been led in chief, the
prejudice, if any, suffered by the appellant is minimal and of
marginal significance.
[4]  Ground number 3 relates to the cross-examination on an
exculpatory statement given by the defendant which was not the
subject of a voir dire or introduced into evidence.  It is
conceded that there is no issue as to the voluntariness of the
statement in this case.  The cross-examination conducted by the
Crown was limited to omissions in the statement, that is to say
statements made by the appellant in his evidence-in-chief that
were not contained in the exculpatory statement.  While it is
argued here that the real prejudice to the appellant was that it
would have been fairer to him to have the full statements put
before the jury, no such request was made at trial.
[5]  Ground number 4 relates to the alleged violation of the
appellant&#146;s s.8 Charter rights.  There is clear authority in this
court that we will not permit counsel to raise Charter arguments
in this court for the first time.
[6]  The trial judge treated the absence of remorse on the part
of the appellant as an aggravating factor.  This is clearly an
error in principle.  Additionally, he failed to give adequate
consideration to the period of pre-trial confinement.  In our
view, an appropriate sentence for sexual assault causing bodily
harm would have been 3½ years.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed to
reduce the sentence for sexual assault causing bodily harm from
4½ years to 3½ years.</pre>
