    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$91,574.65.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]   The  jury  was clearly instructed in answer to  a  question</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">posed during the jury’s deliberations that in assessing the  loss</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  income claim, Canada Pension Plan disability benefits had  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  deducted  from any award made in the plaintiff’s favour.  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Divisional Court’s judgment in Cugliari v. White (1996), 31  O.R.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(3d)  42  (since  affirmed (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 641  (C.A.))  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">released  after the jury had given its verdict but  before  final</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judgment was entered. Cugliari holds that, contrary to the  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge’s  instruction to the jury, Canada Pension Plan  disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits  should  not be deducted as income replacement  benefits</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">pursuant  to the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-8, s. 267(1)(c)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from a damages award. After the jury had rendered its verdict but</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before   judgment  was  entered,  the  trial  judge   entertained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submissions  with  respect to the impact of Cugliari.  The  trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge decided that as the jury had been explicitly instructed  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">make  its  award on the basis that Canada Pension Plan disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits  were  to  be deducted, it was appropriate  to  add  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">present value of those benefits, namely $99,759.49, to the  award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  jury  had  made.  After taking into account  the  65%  fault</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factor,  he  found  that  the  plaintiff   was  entitled  to   an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">additional $64,843.67 for a total award of $156,418.32.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]   The  trial judge also found that the defendant was entitled</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  a  deduction of the value of the no-fault benefits  from  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award pursuant to the Insurance Act, s. 267. Those benefits  were</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  past loss of income and for future care costs to October  7,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">2003. The total value of these benefits was $143,908.41, of which</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$29,647.49  was  for  past income loss and  $114,261.00  was  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future care costs. As the jury had been instructed to deduct  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value  of the benefits paid for past income loss, the trial judge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">found that the defendant had already received the benefit of that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deduction.  In the action, the plaintiff had made  no  claim  for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">future  care  costs for the period to October  7,  2003  as  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period  was covered under the no-fault provisions of his  policy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The  trial judge found that the appropriate adjustment was to add</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  the award 65% of $114,261.00, or $74,273.00, the value of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">no-fault  benefits for that period, but then to deduct the  value</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the  no  fault benefits to which the plaintiff  is  entitled,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$114,261.  The  net effect of this adjustment was to  reduce  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award by 35% of the value of the future care costs.


[5]   In  the  end,  the  plaintiff received  a  total  award  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$116,430.32. The trial judge held that there should be  no  award</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of pre-judgment interest.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]   Finally, the trial judge imposed as a term of the  judgment</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the following:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">3.  THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that with respect to
            future  benefits to which the Plaintiff,
            John Kukkee, may become entitled and not
            already  accounted for in this Judgment,
            those amounts will be held in trust  for
            the  Defendants  by the Plaintiff,  John
            Kukkee,  until the Defendants have  been
            compensated  to the full extent  of  the
            Judgment.
       


</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]   Both  parties  made  a  number of concessions  during  oral</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">argument,  reducing the issues to be decided on this  appeal  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">cross-appeal.  The defendant concedes that as  a  result  of  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision of this Court in Bannon v. McNeely (1998), 38 O.R.  (3d)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">659,  released after the trial judgment in the case at  bar,  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value of 35% of the future care costs to the year 2003 should not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">have  been deducted from the award as the plaintiff made no claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for  those costs in the action. The defendant also concedes  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the plaintiff is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the general</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damage  award at the rate of 5% from the date of the accident  to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the date of trial. The defendant also now concedes that the trial</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">judge’s costs order is appropriate.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]   The defendant submits, however, that the trial judge  erred</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in  adding  back the value of the Canada Pension Plan  disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits.  Mr. Rogers argues that it is apparent from the  nature</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of  the round figure award of $25,000 for future income loss that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  jury did not approach the assessment of this head of damages</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as  a  matter  of  arithmetic. He submits that there  can  be  no</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assurance that the jury’s award for future income loss  took  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">value  of  the  Canada  Pension  Plan  disability  benefits  into</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">account.  We  do  not  accept  that  submission.  The  jury   was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">instructed  in  the clearest terms to deduct the value  of  these</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits  from  its  award.  In our view,  the  trial  judge  was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitled  to  assume  that the jury had  assessed  this  head  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">damages  in accordance with the clear direction he gave.  As  the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jury’s  assessment could properly be considered as the  value  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  future income loss net of the Canada Pension Plan disability</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits, the judgment as entered by the trial judge was entirely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistent with the answer given by the jury in its verdict.

[9]  On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr. Stevens concedes that if  he</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succeeds on the Canada Pension Plan point, the amount to be added</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">back should be adjusted in light of the jury’s nil assessment for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">past  loss  of  income. To the date of trial, the  plaintiff  had</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">received  $5,652.00 in Canada Pension disability benefits.  While</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the  jury may have taken this amount into account in arriving  at</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">its  zero  award  for past loss, that was far from  certain,  and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">accordingly, on the basis of the concession made, the award is to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be  reduced  by  $5,652.00. Similarly, Mr. Stevens conceded  that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">there should be a further deduction in the defendant’s favour  of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">$29,647.49,  the  amount of no-fault income replacement  accident</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">benefits received by the plaintiff up to date of trial.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10]  In view of these concessions and findings, the amount of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">award is to be varied on the following basis:</font></pre>
