    <pre>[1]  This was a straightforward case and the evidence was brief.
The trial judge’s charge accurately and fairly put the positions
of the Crown and the defence and referred to some of the relevant
evidence.  The trial judge’s failure to refer specifically to the
accused’s evidence that he was reaching into his pants attempting
to find his money when attacked by the taxi driver did not
constitute non-direction.  The jury had just heard this evidence
and no doubt had it in mind in considering their verdict.
[2]  There was no air of reality to the contention that the jury
could have concluded that the appellant was not guilty of robbery
but guilty of attempted theft.  There was, therefore, no need to
trouble the jury with an instruction on the included offence of
attempted theft.
[3]  The trial judge in his instructions clearly distinguished
between the different legal and factual elements of the charges
in the two counts of the indictment.  On the trial judge’s
instructions, which were appropriate to the facts of this case,
there is no inconsistency arising out of the jury’s conviction on
the robbery count and the acquittal on the charge of assault with
a weapon.
[4]  The appellant has a lengthy criminal record.  This was a
very serious offence and the Crown is quite right in pointing out
that robberies of taxi drivers have always attracted significant
sentences.  While, in our view, the sentence imposed of 5 years
was at the upper end of the range, we can find no error in
principle in the trial judge’s reasons and consequently will not
interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge.
[5]  The appeal from conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal
sentence is granted, but that appeal is dismissed.
