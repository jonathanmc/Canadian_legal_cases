    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the plaintiffs and a cross-appeal by
the defendant from an order striking out substantial portions of
the statement of claim in this action but permitting one other
portion to remain.
[2]  The facts, taken from the statement of claim, are as
follows.
[3]  In September, 1997, a bank draft for $100,000 was issued by
the Royal Bank of Canada in favour of Anthony Maniaci, in trust.
The funds for the draft were debited to one of the plaintiffs&#146;
Royal Bank accounts, and were intended as a deposit on a real
estate transaction.  The proceeds of the draft were, without the
plaintiffs&#146; knowledge or consent,  deposited into the account of
Oster Lane Corp., a customer of Bank of Montreal.  The plaintiffs
learned of the alleged misappropriation of the funds in late
October, 1997, and notified the Royal Bank.  They obtained a
statutory declaration from Anthony Maniaci deposing that the
endorsement on the bank draft was not in his handwriting and that
he did not authorize anyone to endorse it in his name.  They
delivered the statutory declaration to the Bank of Montreal, and
demanded the return of the $100,000.  The Bank of Montreal
refused.
[4]  In February, 1998, the Bank of Montreal issued a statement
of claim (the &#147;first action&#148;) against several defendants,
including Oster Lane Corp., alleging wrongful conversion of the
$100,000.  By notice of motion, served on the defendants in the
first action, the plaintiffs in the current action and the Royal
Bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal sought an interim
preservation order for payment of the $100,000 into its
solicitors&#146; trust account pending the determination of the first
action.  Filed in support of the motion was an affidavit of a
representative of the Bank of Montreal who adverted to &#147;the
fraudulent transaction&#148; and who deposed  that there appeared to
be suspicious circumstances surrounding the transaction. The
plaintiffs moved for leave to intervene in the interim
preservation motion.  Wolfgang Kyser swore an affidavit in
support of the motion for leave to intervene.  Cross-examinations
were held on the affidavits.
[5]  By notice of abandonment dated March 24th, 1998, the Bank of
Montreal abandoned its motion for an interim preservation order.
It subsequently returned the $100,000 to the Royal Bank, which
restored that sum to the plaintiffs&#146; accounts.
[6]  In June, 1998, the plaintiffs instituted this action (the
&#147;second action&#148;) against the Bank of Montreal.
[7]  The bank moved  to strike out the statement of claim and
dismiss the action.  Somers J., who heard the motion, struck out
those portions of the statement of claim that asserted a claim
for defamation (&#147;the defamation claim&#148;) and a claim for loss of
use of the $100,000 for the period during which that sum was in
the hands of the bank (&#147;the interest/negligence claim&#148;), but let
stand that portion of the statement of claim that sought costs
for the interim preservation motion that the bank had made and
abandoned  in the first action (&#147;the claim for costs of the
abandoned motion&#148;).
[8]  The plaintiffs appeal from that part of the order of Somers
J. that struck out the defamation claim and the
interest/negligence claim;  the bank cross-appeals from that part
of the order that let stand the claim for costs of the abandoned
motion.</pre>
    <pre>     The defamation claim</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The defamation claim was founded on statements appearing in
the affidavit of the bank&#146;s representative filed in support of
its motion for an interim preservation order.  Somers J. struck
this claim on the ground that statements made in the course of
judicial proceedings, including statements in an affidavit, are
protected by absolute privilege.</pre>
    <pre>[10] On the argument before us, Mr. Thom conceded the correctness
of Somers J.&#146;s disposition of the defamation claim.  We accept
Mr. Thom&#146;s concession, and need not consider that claim further.</pre>
    <pre>  The interest/negligence claim</pre>
    <pre>[11] Although the word &#147;negligence&#148; nowhere appears in the
statement of claim, Mr. Thom submitted that, liberally read, the
statement of claim seeks damages under that head for loss of
interest on the $100,000, loss of use and loss of opportunity to
invest that sum and for compensation for the significant time
spent by Wolfgang Kyser in responding to allegations made by the
bank.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Somers J. struck this claim on the basis that the bank was
under no obligation, either in contract or otherwise, to return
the money to the appellants.  His conclusion is supported by
authority that a negotiating bank owes no duty of care to a non-
customer who draws a cheque in the circumstances of such a case
as this: Groves-Raffin Construction Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, [1976] 2 W.W.R. 673 (B.C.C.A.), per Bull J.A.,
at p. 686 and per Robertson J.A., at p. 730.  We agree with the
conclusion of Somers J. with respect to this claim.</pre>
    <pre>  The claim for costs of the abandoned motion</pre>
    <pre>[13] Although Somers J. felt that the claim for costs of the
motion for an interim preservation order in the first action that
had been made but then abandoned by the bank &#147;would probably be
counted in the hundreds rather than in the thousands of dollars&#148;,
he felt that such a claim could properly be pursued in the second
action, and he let stand  the portion of the statement of claim
asserting that claim.  We think he erred in doing so.
[14] The Rules of Civil Procedure establish a code for the
entitlement to costs on an abandoned motion, for the assessment
of those costs, and for the enforcement of payment of those costs
once they are assessed.  Limited to the facts of the present
case, that code is as follows:
§    rule 37.09(1) provides that a party who makes a motion may
     abandon it by delivering a notice of abandonment;</pre>
    <pre>§    rule 37.09(3) provides that, where a motion is abandoned, a
     responding party on whom the notice of motion was served is
     entitled to the costs of the motion forthwith unless (as was not
     the case here) the court orders otherwise;</pre>
    <pre>§    rule 58.01 provides that, where a rule provides that a party
     is entitled to the costs of all or part of a proceeding between
     party and party and the costs have not been fixed, the costs are
     to be assessed in accordance with rules 58.02 to 58.12;</pre>
    <pre>§    rule 58.02(1) provides that costs shall be assessed by an
     assessment officer in the place where the proceeding was
     commenced or heard or in a county agreed on by the parties;</pre>
    <pre>§    rule 58.07 provides that the costs of a motion that is
     abandoned may be assessed on filing in the office of the
     assessment officer the notice of abandonment served; and</pre>
    <pre>§    rule 60.02(2) provides that where the costs are not paid
     within seven days after the certificate of assessment of costs is
     signed, the party may enforce payment of the costs by the means
     applicable to any order for the payment of money on filing an
     affidavit setting out the basis of entitlement to costs and
     attaching a copy of the certificate of assessment.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Apart entirely from this procedural code, we would have
thought it neither practical nor appropriate for a party to
institute a new and separate proceeding to recover the relatively
small sums typically involved upon an abandoned motion.  When we
have regard to the procedural code, we consider that it is
intended to be complete and self-contained, and we conclude that
a party may not institute a new and separate proceeding to claim
the costs of an earlier, abandoned proceeding or part of a
proceeding.  Accordingly, Somers J. should have struck out the
claim in the second action for recovery of the costs of the
abandoned motion in the first action.</pre>
    <pre>  Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[16] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed and the
cross-appeal is allowed.  The order of Somers J. is amended by
deleting paragraph 1 and substituting a paragraph striking out
the statement of claim in its entirety and dismissing the
appellants&#146; action with costs.  The respondent is entitled to its
costs of the appeal and of the cross-appeal, payable forthwith
after their assessment.</pre></td>
