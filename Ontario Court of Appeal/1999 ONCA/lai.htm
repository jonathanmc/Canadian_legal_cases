COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            PATTY SAU YEE LAI (Applicant (Respondent in

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant submits that the variation order made by  the
motions  judge should be set aside and in its place there  should
be  an  order for the trial of an issue on access and its  terms.
The  material shows that both parties consented to the  trial  of
such  an  issue.  However, the motions judge decided  the  matter
summarily, without hearing oral evidence from the appellant, even
though  very  serious allegations of abuse had been made  against
him.

[2]  We think that this procedure was unfair to the appellant.
We, therefore, are of the view that there should be the trial of
an issue on access. However, as all parties &#150; mother, father and
child &#150; now reside and will continue to reside in Hong Kong, the
trial should take place in that jurisdiction instead of Ontario.

[3]  We also recognize, however, that there was evidence before
the motions judge from the SCAN team and from the C.A.S. that
raised concerns whether the child had been sexually abused by the
appellant. In the light of this evidence, we think  it
appropriate to maintain the supervised access ordered by the
motions judge on an interim basis pending the trial of the issue
in Hong Kong.

[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of
O&#146;Connell J. is set aside. In its place there shall be an order
for the trial of an issue on access and the terms of access. This
trial shall take place in Hong Kong, on the application of either
party. Pending the trial of the issue, access to the child shall
be supervised in accordance with the order of O&#146;Connell J. There
will be no costs of the motion or of the appeal.</pre></td>
