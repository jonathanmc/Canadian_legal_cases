    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of Cusson J., sitting with a jury,
dated September 11, 1997 and on appeal from the sentence dated
December 10, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by Andre Lalande from his conviction by a
jury presided over by Cusson J. on six counts in an indictment
charging the commission of sexual offences, the victim of which
was a young woman who was his part-time employee.  Further, the
appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence of 30 months and, if
leave is granted, appeals against the sentence.
[2]  The appellant raised the following six grounds of appeal
from his conviction:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (1)  Errors in the jury charge on reasonable doubt.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (2)  Errors in the trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (3)  The manner in which the trial judge responded to the jury&#146;s
          request, in the course of its deliberations, to have the victim&#146;s
          evidence read back.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (4)  The Crown&#146;s cross-examination of the appellant and his
          closing address to the jury infringed the appellant&#146;s right to
          remain silent and were not the subject of an appropriate
          admonition by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (5)  Inappropriate comments in the Crown&#146;s closing address to the
          jury.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (6)  The trial judge&#146;s refusal to allow the appellant to sit
          beside his counsel throughout the trial, instead of in the
          prisoner&#146;s dock.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  As there was no merit in the first, second and fifth grounds
of appeal, we did not call on counsel for the Crown to respond to
them.  However, I would give effect to the third and fourth
grounds and order that there be a new trial.  Although the sixth
ground of appeal raises an important question, I am of the view
that standing alone, it would not require that there be a new
trial were I to be of the opinion that the trial judge erred in
exercising his discretion as to where the appellant should be
seated throughout his trial.
[4]  As there is to be a new trial, I will not review the facts.
It is unnecessary to do so for the purpose of considering the two
grounds on which the appellant has demonstrated reversible error.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>(i)  The &#147;read back&#148; of the victim&#146;s evidence</pre>
    <pre>[5]  This trial was held in a region of the province where the
testimony of witnesses is recorded by a tape recording device,
monitored by a person referred to in these proceedings as a
&#147;court reporter&#148;.  This is known as an open-microphone system.
When a jury, in the course of its deliberations, asks to hear the
testimony of a witness, the monitor is required to playback the
relevant portion, or portions, of the testimony using speakers
which have been installed in the courtroom.
[6]  The open-microphone system of recording evidence is to be
contrasted with the system that it replaced.  Formerly, a court
reporter using shorthand or stenotyping, or a similar method,
took down the testimony of the witnesses.  When a jury asked to
hear the testimony of a witness, the court reporter read the
relevant portion of his or her notes to the jury in open court in
the presence of the trial judge, the defendant and counsel.
[7]  In this appeal, after the jury had deliberated for about 3 ½
hours, it sent the following question to the trial judge:  &#147;Could
we get [the complainant&#146;s] testimony of September the 8th, 1997?&#148;
On that date, the complainant had testified for almost the entire
court day.  The trial judge met with counsel in his chambers to
discuss the jury&#146;s request.  The judge and counsel agreed that
the response to the question would be as he indicated in the
following passage from the transcript of the trial:
          </pre>
    <pre>               -- if I had a transcription, if I had a document that&#146;s
          transcribed I could just give you the document and that would be
          the end of it.  I don&#146;t have that.  The only thing I can offer
          you is that if there are some portions of the testimony of [the
          complainant] that you would like to hear, we&#146;ll have to play it
          back on the machine, on the recording machine.  That is done this
          way.  I would clear the courtroom, you would be here alone with
          the court reporter, you would indicate to her which portions of
          the testimony you wish to hear&#133;.  Tell here whereabouts you want
          to hear, what portions of her evidence you want to hear and she
          will play it back.  So you can &#150; if you wish to do that,
          certainly just let us know and we&#146;ll arrange to have the
          courtroom cleared and you can ask the court reporter, Mrs.
          Proulx, to play back those portions that you have.  I mean, if
          you wish you can sit and listen to whole thing if you want on
          tape but it will last the time that it lasts because as you know
          it&#146;s not &#150; it&#146;s not shortened in any way.  It&#146;s there &#150; all of it
          is there in its integrity [sic].  And we can&#146;t just give you a
          tape.  We only have one tape.  We can&#146;t just give you a tape
          because it has to be operated by the official court reporter so
          that we make sure we don&#146;t get any erasures or miss &#150; accidents
          with the tape itself.  So, that&#146;s the way we &#150; the only way I can
          handle your second question is to tell you that, that evidence
          can be heard or re-heard by you, portions of it or all of it,
          directly from the recording machine.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Consequently, what occurred was that the courtroom was
cleared of everybody except the monitor, Mrs. Proulx, and the
jurors.  Counsel for the parties agreed to admit as evidence on
the appeal Mrs. Proulx&#146;s recollection of what occurred.  She
recalled that from 4:00 p.m. to 4:19 p.m. she played for the jury
the portions of the complainant&#146;s testimony as requested by the
jury.  She was unable to recall the contents of those portions as
she kept no notes, but was certain that it was not the entire
testimony of the complainant.  She left the courtroom at 4:19
p.m.  Mrs. Proulx was of the view that her time alone with the
jury formed a portion of the jury&#146;s deliberations.
[9]  The jury resumed its deliberations at 4:19 p.m., after which
it returned to the courtroom at 4:49 p.m. and delivered its
verdict of guilty on each of the six counts.  As they jury
returned verdicts of guilty  very shortly after re-hearing
certain portions of the complainant&#146;s testimony, it is reasonable
to draw the inference that the testimony they heard had a
decisive impact on their verdict.
[10] It is common ground on the part of counsel, and I agree,
that as the response to questions, or requests, from a jury is
part of the trial, the response must occur in open court, in the
presence of the trial judge, the defendant and counsel.
[11] The manner adopted by the trial judge in response to the
jury&#146;s request to hear the complainant&#146;s evidence made it
impossible for him to perform the duty required of a trial judge
when a jury asks to re-hear the testimony of a witness.  This
court recently reiterated the trial judge&#146;s duty in R. v. D.(D.)
(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 506, where the trial judge permitted the
jury to hear only the complainant&#146;s examination-in-chief and
rejected the request of counsel that the cross-examination be
read back.  In ordering a new trial, the court stated at p.511:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is well recognised that there is a duty on a trial judge
          to ensure that any evidence read back to the jury as a result of
          a jury question should be read back together with any other
          portions of the evidence that qualify or contextualize it.  In
          Olbey v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (S.C.C.), McIntyre
          J., writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated
          at pp.272-3:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Counsel for the appellant contended
               that the trial Judge was in error in allowing
               only part of the evidence of Dwyer to be read
               back.  He contended that when part of  a
               witness&#146;s evidence is reread all the cross-
               examination or qualifying evidence should
               also be read so that the evidence will be put
               in its proper relation to the whole of the
               case and so that the evidence will not be
               isolated  and  given more  emphasis  and
               significance than it should have.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      I   am  in  agreement  with  this
               proposition, as was Martin J.A., in  the
               Court of Appeal [reported at (1977),  38
               C.C.C. (2d) 390].  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>                           &#147;I  accept,  of  course  the
                    proposition that where the jury requests
                    that the evidence of a witness be read
                    back, it is incumbent on the trial Judge
                    not to allow the jury to hear a part
                    only of the evidence of the witness
                    without also hearing those portions of
                    the evidence of the witness, whether
                    given in-chief or in cross-examination,
                    which weaken or qualify the part read,
                    even though the jury indicates that it
                    does not wish to hear any more of the
                    witness&#146;s evidence.  Otherwise, the jury
                    is  not hearing the evidence of the
                    witness, but only an incomplete, or even
                    an inaccurate account of his or her
                    testimony.&#148; [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>It is also to be noted that the segregation of the monitor and
the jury made it impossible for counsel, or the defendant, to
assist the trial judge in the performance of his duty.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Although counsel for the respondent agreed that what
occurred was clearly unsatisfactory, he submitted that this was
an appropriate appeal in which to apply the proviso in
s.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code.  It was counsel&#146;s position that on a
close analysis of what occurred, or may have occurred, during the
playback of the complainant&#146;s testimony, there was not, and could
not have been, any prejudice to the appellant.
[13] In my view, the respondent has not satisfied its onus of
establishing that the manner in which the complainant&#146;s testimony
was played back to the jury resulted in no prejudice to the
appellant.  I appreciate that there may be instances where the
absence of an accused from the playback of evidence for a jury,
or from part of his or her trial, may not result in prejudice to
him or her and enable the court to apply the proviso: R. v.
Hennin, [1993] O.J. No. 1420 (C.A.); R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43
C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.).  However, I am not satisfied that
this is such a case.  There was no record of what occurred during
the playback.  As a result, we do not know what testimony the
jury heard, and if there was testimony that they should have
heard that qualified or contextualized it.  The procedure adopted
by the trial judge in response to the jury&#146;s request to hear the
complainant&#146;s testimony had the potential to be highly
prejudicial to the appellant and, without a record of what took
place during the playback, I am of the opinion that effect must
be given to this ground of appeal.
[14] Counsel for the Crown advised the court that the procedure
adopted by Cusson J. to playback the testimony is commonly used
in those regions of the province where the open-microphone system
is used to record trial proceedings.  As I have indicated, the
procedure he followed was clearly unsatisfactory.  In the future,
to avoid the unfortunate consequences of what occurred in this
appeal, measures must be taken to ensure that tape recorded
testimony is replayed for a jury in open court, in the presence
of the defendant, the trial judge and counsel, and that a proper
record is made of what takes place throughout the playback
proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>(ii) The infringement of the appellant&#146;s right to silence</pre>
    <pre>[15] When the Crown Attorney cross-examined the appellant, he
questioned him with respect to his failure to previously explain
his conduct.  Although defence counsel did not object to this
question, she attempted to mitigate its effect in re-examination
by eliciting from the appellant that, on his arrest, his lawyer
instructed him not to say anything to the police.  In his closing
argument, the Crown Attorney revisited this issue and attempted
to justify the question on the ground that the appellant had said
he had been cooperative with the police.  He then told the jury:
&#147;You have to keep in mind that an accused person does not have to
explain &#150; does not have to provide a statement to the police.&#148;
However, the Crown Attorney did not tell the jury that it was not
to draw an adverse inference from the appellant&#146;s exercise of his
right to silence.  The trial judge did not deal with this issue
in his instructions to the jury.
[16] Counsel for the respondent, in my view, has quite properly
conceded that the question should not have been asked, and,
having been asked, required the trial judge to admonish the jury
in the clearest of terms that the fact that the accused had
remained silent did not lend itself to any adverse inference and
could not be used as an inference against him as a step on the
way to the proof of his guilt:  R. v. Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C.
(2d) 385 (Ont. C.A.).
[17] Without any direction from the trial judge to ignore these
questions and answers, it is impossible to say that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same.  Accordingly, I would give
effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)     The prisoner&#146;s dock</pre>
    <pre>[18] Although it is not strictly necessary to decide this
question in view of my conclusion in respect to the previous
grounds of appeal, counsel invited the court to comment upon the
trial judge&#146;s refusal of defence counsel&#146;s request that the
appellant, who was on bail, be permitted to sit beside her at the
counsel table, rather than in the prisoner&#146;s dock.  As I stated
earlier, even if I were to be of the view that in requiring the
appellant to sit in the prisoner&#146;s dock the trial judge abused
his discretion, this is not a basis on which a new trial should
be ordered.
[19] Where an accused person sits during his or her trial is
within the discretion of the presiding judge, to be determined in
the interests of a fair trial and courtroom security:  R. v.
Levogiannis (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.).  I am aware that
Commissioner Kaufman has made recommendations concerning where an
accused person may sit during his or her trial:  Report of the
Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin, 1998, Vol. 2,
1167-68.  Counsel for the respondent informed the court that in
light of Commissioner Kaufman&#146;s recommendations, the Ministry of
the Attorney General has adopted the policy with respect to
accused persons who are not in custody and who present no
security concerns, that while the ultimate decision rests with
the presiding judge, the Crown should normally consent to the
accused person being permitted to sit at the counsel table should
he or she request to do so.
[20] In light of the foregoing, there is no need to comment on
whether the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[21] In the result, the appeal from conviction is allowed, the
convictions are set aside and it is ordered that there be a new
trial.</pre>
