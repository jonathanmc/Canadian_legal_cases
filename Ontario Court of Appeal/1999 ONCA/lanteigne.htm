    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. DENIS
               LANTEIGNE (Appellant)</pre>

               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         July 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Justice Lofchik dated
January 16, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The sole issue at trial was identification - that is whether
the appellant was the person who, without the complainant&#146;s
consent, was in bed with her at the time and place referred to in
the indictment.  In his charge, the trial judge made it clear to
the jury how important the identification issue was.  In
addition, he directed the jury to be cautious about the
complainant&#146;s identification of the appellant and he directed the
jury on the critical difference between credibility and
reliability as it related to the complainant&#146;s identification
evidence.  In our view, when the charge is read as whole, as it
should be, the charge on identification was sufficient.
[2]  We are further of the view that the charge adequately
outlined the defence position on the issue of identification
which was, needless to say, central to the defence at trial.
[3]  The appellant also argues that the trial judge reversed the
burden of proof when he said in his charge:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Ultimately, you must decide whether the matters raised by
          Defence Counsel are sufficient to cast doubt on the
          identification evidence put forward by the Crown or whether such
          identification evidence is reliable enough to satisfy you beyond
          a reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who attacked
          T.M. in her apartment.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We are satisfied that when the charge is read as a whole,
the jury would have understood that the Crown bore the burden of
proof and that the Crown had to establish the appellant&#146;s guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt in order to discharge that burden.
That translates, in the circumstances of this case, to the Crown
being required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the
appellant who was in bed with the complainant.  We see no merit
in this ground of appeal.
[5]  We should add that defence counsel at trial did not object
to the charge on identification or with respect to the
sufficiency of the charge as it relates to the position taken by
the defence at trial.
[6]  In our opinion, the jury was adequately instructed to decide
the case only on the evidence at trial.  This ground of appeal
cannot succeed.
[7]  For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed.
[8]  With respect to sentence, it is our opinion that having in
mind the circumstances of the offence, the appellant&#146;s
significant criminal record and the duration of pre-trial
custody, the sentence imposed falls within a reasonable range of
fit sentences.   The trial judge did not err in principle in
imposing the sentence that he did.  Thus, leave is granted and
the appeal against the sentence is dismissed, as is the appeal
from conviction.</pre></td>
