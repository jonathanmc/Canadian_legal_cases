    <pre>[1]  Mr. White, who acted for the appellant at trial, appeared on
his behalf to make submissions with respect to this inmate
sentence appeal.  We wish to record our appreciation for Mr.
White&#146;s attendance and for those submissions.
[2]  Despite Mr. White&#146;s able submissions, we do not think this
is an appropriate case to pass upon the important policy issues
raised in para. 37 of the decision of Mr. Justice Hill in R. v.
Forsyth, [1995] O.J. No. 4173.  We think that those issues should
be dealt with in another case where there is a more complete
record and better information concerning the relationship between
the offence and the alleged addiction.
[3]  However, in our view, the trial judge did err in principle
in completely foreclosing any credit for attending at a
residential treatment centre prior to conviction.  The trial
judge seems to have done so solely on the basis that in offences
of this kind general deterrence is the paramount consideration to
the exclusion of rehabilitation.  While general deterrence is an
important consideration, the appellant&#146;s efforts at
rehabilitation, both before and after this offence was committed,
should have received greater recognition in the sentence.  The
appellant&#146;s attendance at residential treatment centres was an
important aspect of those efforts.  Accordingly, leave to appeal
sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, and the sentence
reduced to six years' imprisonment.
