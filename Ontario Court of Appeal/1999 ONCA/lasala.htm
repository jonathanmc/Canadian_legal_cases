    <pre>[1]  We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in any of
the respects argued by counsel with respect to conviction.
Identification was the only issue.  The evidence of the
complainant was clear in this regard.  No significant error was
committed in the photo line-up process.  The reasons of the trial
judge are more than adequate.
[2]  Counsel raised the question of deportation in the argument
respecting sentence.  Deportation is not relevant to our
consideration.
[3]  Crown counsel argued that the sentence was within the range
but at the high end of same.  He also conceded that the appellant
had made progress since his confinement.
[4]  We are not entirely satisfied that the trial judge gave full
consideration to the pre-trial time served of one year in
imposing the seven-year sentence.  In view of this, and the
progress referred to, a sentence of five years would now appear
to be more appropriate.
[5]  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.  Leave is granted
to appeal the sentence and the sentence is reduced to one of five
years.</pre>
