    <pre>On appeal from conviction and sentence by His Honour Judge
Hunter, Ontario Court (Provincial Division) dated April 28, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>MOLDAVER J.A:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted by His Honour Judge Hunter of
the Ontario Court (Provincial Division) on charges of producing
marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of
trafficking, contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
S.C. 1996, c. 19. He was also convicted of escaping lawful
custody and willfully obstructing a peace officer in the
execution of his duty contrary to the Criminal Code. In total he
received a sentence of three years&#146; imprisonment. The appellant
appeals from conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The principal issue in this appeal is whether the &#145;open
fields&#146; doctrine, now firmly embedded in the constitutional
landscape of the United States, can be transplanted into Canadian
soil without offending the provisions of s. 8 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms. Simply stated, the doctrine holds that the
protection of the Fourth Amendment of the United States
Constitution against unreasonable search and seizure does not
extend to unoccupied or undeveloped lands beyond those
immediately surrounding the home. For reasons which follow, I am
of the view that the doctrine cannot withstand s. 8 Charter
scrutiny and does not form part of the law of Canada.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  On October 14, 1997, Crime Stoppers received an anonymous
tip reporting that marijuana was being grown in a cornfield
located at fire code #501756, concession 10, Bentinck Township in
the County of Grey. Six days later, the tip was conveyed to
Detective-Sergeant Cardwell of the Ontario Provincial Police,
Mount Forest Division.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On October 21, 1997, Sergeant Cardwell directed Constable
Johnson to attend at the location to verify the tip. If the
information proved accurate, Constable Johnson was to report back
to his superiors and steps would be taken to remove and destroy
the marijuana. Sergeant Cardwell readily conceded that standing
alone, the anonymous tip did not provide the grounds needed to
obtain a search warrant. Moreover, being familiar with the
property in question, he knew that it was privately owned,
although by whom he could not say.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Arriving at what he believed to be the correct location,
Constable Johnson found himself confronted with a chained metal
gate barring entry to a dirt road leading into the property. With
no cornfield in sight, Constable Johnson climbed over the gate
onto the property and walked south along the dirt lane up a hill.
Halfway up the hill, he noticed a large number of screws embedded
in the road. As he proceeded over the crest of the hill he
observed, for the first time, a cornfield surrounded almost
entirely by a fence. Upon entering the field a distance of some
50 to 75 yards, he located approximately 100 marijuana plants
hidden amongst the corn.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Later that day, after being informed of Constable Johnson&#146;s
findings, Sergeant Cardwell decided to remove the marijuana from
the field and destroy it. Before doing so, he contacted the local
federal Crown and sought and received permission to proceed. As a
precautionary measure, in the event of a suspect being
apprehended at some future date, the local Crown directed the
police to photograph and take samples of the marijuana.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  According to Sergeant Cardwell, the practice of conducting
warrantless searches to verify anonymous tips like the one in
question was one which the police in Grey County had been
following for some considerable time. In his view, the procedure
was lawful because the initial search did not form part of a
criminal investigation. Rather, it was designed to determine
whether illicit crops were in fact being grown and if so to
eradicate them. Sergeant Cardwell was unaware of any statutory
provision authorizing this time-honoured procedure. When s. 29 of
the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was brought to his
attention in cross-examination, he conceded that he was
unfamiliar with the provision and although he thought it might
apply, he could not be certain.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The next day, Constables Parsons and Merrifield were
detailed to attend at the cornfield and eradicate the marijuana.
At about 1:00 p.m., they arrived at the dirt road leading into
the property, only to find it gated and locked. They then drove
west to another laneway, which though gated, was unlocked. After
opening the gate, they proceeded up the laneway in their cruiser
for a distance of about one-half to three-quarters of a mile.
Although the officers knew they had entered onto private
property, it was only later that they learned that it was
occupied by the appellant and his family.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Arriving at a bushy area where the road came to a dead end,
the officers got out of their vehicle and walked through the bush
until they reached a second unconnected laneway. After following
that laneway for about another one-half mile, they came upon the
cornfield that Constable Johnson had previously located. It was
surrounded by four foot high steel gate fencing in good
condition. In the field, they observed a man, who turned out to
be the appellant, carrying a green garbage bag.</pre>
    <pre>[10] After watching the appellant for about half an hour,
Constable Parsons climbed over the fence and as he approached the
appellant from behind, he noticed the appellant cutting a
marijuana plant. When he attempted to arrest the appellant, the
appellant fled. A brief foot chase ensued and the appellant was
arrested and charged with cultivation of marijuana.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Before being given his s. 10(b) rights to counsel, the
appellant was asked to identify himself and he falsely claimed to
be Mark Weber from Kitchener. It was not until some 20 minutes
later, after he had been escorted out of the field and returned
to the police cruiser, that the appellant was informed of his
right to counsel. He immediately responded by saying that he
wished to speak to a lawyer.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Upon his arrival at the Mount Forest O.P.P. detachment about
an hour and a half later, the appellant was given the opportunity
to contact counsel but he declined the offer. Eventually, he
asked to speak to duty counsel and he was permitted to do so in
private. To this point, he had maintained that his name was Mark
Weber.</pre>
    <pre>[13] In the meantime, at about 2:00 p.m. that day, shortly after
the appellant had been arrested, Sergeant Cardwell was notified
by telephone that a suspect was in custody. On his way to the
cornfield, his suspicions were aroused when he realized that the
property due east of it, which had been for sale some months
earlier, belonged to the appellant, someone known to him to be
involved in drug cultivation. His suspicions proved accurate when
later that evening, with the assistance of another police force,
it was learned that the man in custody was not Mark Weber but
John Lauda.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Sometime after 3:00 p.m., Sergeant Cardwell began to make
arrangements to obtain search warrants for the cornfield and the
adjacent residence and out-buildings occupied by the appellant.
He was unfamiliar with the telewarrant provisions in the Criminal
Code and, as it turns out, it was not until 1:00 a.m. the
following morning that the warrants finally became available. In
the meantime, acting under the belief that exigent circumstances
existed, sometime between 3:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., Sergeant
Cardwell gave the order to remove the marijuana from the field.
He based his belief on the fact that hunters had been sighted on
the property, the weather was turning bad and with nightfall
approaching, it would be difficult to secure the cornfield
overnight. The harvesting, which was completed by 7:30 p.m.,
netted some 700 plants valued at approximately $175,000.</pre>
    <pre>[15] At 1:50 a.m., after alerting the appellant&#146;s wife by
telephone that they were about to execute a search warrant, the
police entered and searched the appellant&#146;s home. In the
basement, behind a false wall, they located $24,950 in cash,
various firearms, and two and one-half pounds of marijuana. At
other locations throughout the home, the police found cannabis
resin, hashish oil, marijuana buds and seeds, and a marijuana
plant. In a nearby shed, they located a five gallon can
containing isopropyl alcohol, a substance used for making hashish
oil.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The cornfield where the marijuana was found was owned by
Charles McLean, the appellant&#146;s brother-in-law. The appellant
testified that he had leased the land from him in the spring of
1997 for $800. Knowing that he would be cultivating marijuana in
the cornfield, the appellant took precautions to preserve his
privacy. The field itself was not visible from the main road and
he believed that by interspersing the marijuana with the corn, it
would not be visible from the air. The leasehold property was
surrounded by fencing, as was the cornfield where the marijuana
was being grown. Entry to the property was barred by a locked
gate and no trespassing signs were clearly posted. The appellant
even went to the trouble of embedding screws in the lane to
prevent vehicular access to the cornfield. By and large, the
appellant took the same protective measures with respect to his
adjoining property.</pre>
    <pre>[17] In short, in his capacity as lawful owner and tenant, the
appellant manifested a clear intention to exclude the public from
both properties and he believed that reasonable members of
society would respect his privacy rights.</pre>
    <pre>APPELLANT&#146;S  POSITION AT TRIAL</pre>
    <pre>[18] It was the appellant&#146;s position that the marijuana seized
from the cornfield should be excluded from evidence because it
had been obtained in a manner that violated his privacy rights
under s. 8 of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[19] In support of his position, the appellant submitted that he
had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the leasehold
property, including the cornfield and the marijuana found in it.
The police, he claimed, had violated his privacy rights when
Constable Johnson, without reasonable grounds and without lawful
authority, knowingly trespassed onto private property and
conducted the initial warrantless search which revealed the
presence of marijuana. Thereafter, the police continued to
violate his rights when they returned to the property, without
lawful authority and without a warrant, to seize and destroy the
marijuana. According to the appellant, the police conduct,
culminating as it did in the warrantless seizure of the
marijuana, constituted a serious and flagrant violation of his
s. 8 Charter rights calling for the exclusion of the evidence
under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[20] With respect to the controlled substances seized at his
residence, the appellant raised several arguments concerning the
validity of the search warrant, the main one being that the
warrant was invalid because it had been issued on the strength of
illegally obtained information. According to the appellant, this
rendered the search unlawful and, as it was clearly linked to the
earlier violations, the admission of the evidence found through
the search could only serve to bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.</pre>
    <pre>[21] As for the charge of willfully attempting to obstruct a
police officer, the appellant claimed that upon his arrest, the
police failed to inform him of his s. 10(b) rights before asking
him to identify himself. That breach, he submitted, was serious
because it gave rise to conscriptive evidence that formed the
basis of the charge. As such, it went to the issue of trial
fairness and for that reason alone, the evidence should be
excluded under s. 24(2).</pre>
    <pre>[22] Finally, with respect to both Criminal Code offences, the
appellant submitted that the police were not engaged in the
lawful execution of their duty when they arrested him because
they were unlawfully trespassing on private property at the time.
Accordingly, he submitted that those charges should be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S RULINGS</pre>
    <pre>[23] In addressing the s. 8 arguments, the defining issue for the
trial judge was whether the appellant had demonstrated a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the leasehold property. In
his words:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects a
          person&#146;s reasonable expectation of privacy. The issue before the
          court is whether Mr. Lauda had a reasonable expectation of
          privacy in an open field which was enclosed with a standard farm
          fence, consisting of wire attached to posts at regular intervals,
          posted with &#147;No Trespassing&#148; signs and which adjoined his own
          real property.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge relied on the opinion of Roscoe J.A., for
the majority in R. v. Patriquen, [1995] 36 C.R. (4th) 363,
(N.S.C.A.),1 which held that the open fields doctrine enunciated
in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct. 1735 (1984) applies in
Canada. The trial judge concluded that s. 8 of the Charter had
not been violated because the appellant had no reasonable
expectation of privacy in the leasehold property. His reasons in
this regard are reproduced below:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I adopt the reasoning of the majority in R. v. Patriquen in
          concluding that Mr. Lauda did not have a reasonable expectation
          of privacy in the corn field where the marijuana was being grown
          and therefore there was no breach of his s. 8 rights. In rural
          settings, such as where the marijuana was being grown, it is
          unrealistic to assume that strands of wire and some &#147;No
          Trespassing&#148; signs can reasonably be expected to provide privacy.
          Hunters and hikers, skiers, snowmobilers, to list but a few, are
          notorious for their disregard of such signs. The very fact that
          at the time the decision was made to start pulling the marijuana
          there were hunters noted in the corner of the field supports this
          proposition.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Although the accused had taken steps to
          conceal the marijuana among the corn, and was
          of the opinion that it could not be seen from
          the air, there was no factual evidence to
          support this proposition, and I find it to be
          sheer speculation and wishful thinking on his
          part.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Neither was the area where the marijuana
          was being grown so close to Mr. Lauda&#146;s home
          on the adjoining property as to deter any
          would-be trespassers, thus raising his
          expectation of privacy. Further, the presence
          of a &#147;For Sale&#148; sign, noticed by Sergeant
          Cardwell during his visit to the area in
          August, would have been yet another
          invitation to would-be purchasers and others
          to enter onto the field to check it out.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Simply put, one cannot entertain the
          same reasonable expectation of privacy in an
          open field as one does in a private dwelling.
          One may take steps to reduce the likelihood
          of trespassers by fencing and posting
          notices, as did the accused, but the
          expectation of privacy is not the reasonable
          expectation that one would expect in the case
          of a dwelling house or other similar
          structure, as in the case of R. v. Kokesch.
          There the police had entered onto the
          accused&#146;s property and were peering into the
          windows of the house and were therefore
          within the curtilage of the house as opposed
          to an open field some distance away.</pre>
    <pre>[25] In view of his conclusion that the appellant had no
reasonable expectation of privacy in the leasehold property, the
trial judge found it unnecessary to consider whether the various
searches conducted by the police were reasonable or not. There
being no s. 8 breach referable to the cornfield, the trial judge
ruled that the marijuana seized from it was properly admissible.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Having made these findings, the trial judge had little
difficulty dispensing with the appellant&#146;s primary argument
regarding the validity of the search warrant issued in connection
with his residence. In short, he found the warrant to be valid in
all respects. The trial judge further held that the search of the
residence was conducted in accordance with the terms of the
warrant and he accordingly concluded that the evidence located on
the premises was admissible.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Turning to the charge of obstructing a peace officer, the
trial judge refused to give effect to the s. 10(b) argument
raised by the appellant. He was satisfied beyond any doubt that
even if the appellant had been given his rights to counsel at the
time of arrest, he would nonetheless have identified himself
falsely. He also considered the s. 10(b) breach to be trivial and
minor. Accordingly, the judge ruled the &#147;false identification&#148;
evidence admissible under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[28] Finally, the trial judge rejected the appellant&#146;s submission
that the police were not engaged in the lawful execution of their
duty when they arrested him. He stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dealing with the charge of escape custody, given the finding
          on the s. 8 issue, I am satisfied that the officers were acting
          in the lawful execution of their duty when they arrested the
          accused as he was harvesting the marijuana.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find as a fact that the officers had
          entered upon the property for a lawful
          purpose; that is, the eradication of the
          marijuana. The federal prosecutor had given
          his permission to carry out the procedures
          and although permission from the minister,
          pursuant to s. 29 of the CDSA, had yet to be
          obtained, such permission would undoubtedly
          have been forthcoming.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[29] In the result, the trial judge found the appellant guilty as
charged on all counts.</pre>

    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[30] The threshold question is whether Constable Johnson violated
the appellant&#146;s s. 8 Charter rights when, without a warrant or
probable cause, he entered onto the leasehold property. The
answer depends upon whether the appellant had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the leasehold property. If he did, it
cannot be said that the impugned search was conducted reasonably.
Indeed, the Crown did not suggest otherwise.</pre>
    <pre>[31] In oral argument, counsel for the respondent fairly and, in
my view, correctly conceded that s. 29 of the Controlled Drugs
and Substances Act, which enables the Minister of Health to order
the destruction of plants from which illicit drugs can be
produced, is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Whatever
other purpose it might serve, the provision certainly does not
cloak the police with the authority to trespass onto private
property and to engage in warrantless searches and seizures for
the purpose of locating and eradicating any illicit crops that
might be found. The Crown could point to no other statutory
provision or common law principle capable of legitimizing the
warrantless intrusions by the police onto the appellant&#146;s
leasehold property.</pre>
    <pre>[32] It follows that if the appellant did have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the leasehold property, Constable
Johnson&#146;s initial warrantless entry violated his s. 8 Charter
rights and triggered a host of further s. 8 violations. That
being so, the admissibility of all of the evidence seized,
including that found in the appellant&#146;s residence, would fall to
be determined under s. 24(2).</pre>
    <pre>[33] With this in mind, I return to the principal issue &#150; did the
appellant have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
leasehold property?  To answer that question, it is first
necessary to decide whether the open fields doctrine applies in
Canada.</pre>
    <pre>     The Open Fields Doctrine</pre>
    <pre>[34] First enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States
in Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57 (1924), and reaffirmed in
Oliver v. United States, supra, the open fields doctrine provides
that the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures
guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United States
Constitution does not extend to unoccupied lands, except those
immediately surrounding the home where the right to privacy may
reasonably be expected.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In practical terms, the doctrine carves out certain
&#145;constitutional free zones&#146;, such as privately-owned farmlands or
woodlots, within which the police are permitted to search out and
gather evidence unconstrained by the probable cause and warrant
requirements associated with the Fourth Amendment. For
constitutional purposes, it matters not that entry onto the lands
by the police constitutes an unlawful trespass, nor does it
matter what steps lawful owners or occupants may have taken to
protect their property against intrusions by the public.</pre>
    <pre>[36] In affirming the constitutional validity of the doctrine,
Powell J., for the majority in Oliver, observed that the
protective umbrella of the Fourth Amendment only extends to
persons with &#147;a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation
of privacy.&#148;  In his view, it was not enough for an individual
seeking to invoke Fourth Amendment protection to show a
subjective expectation of privacy. Rather, it was also essential
that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize
as reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[37] According to Powell J., unoccupied lands do not provide a
setting for those intimate activities that the Fourth Amendment
was designed to shelter from government interference or
surveillance. Nor, in his view, is there a societal interest in
protecting the kinds of activities, such as cultivation of crops,
normally associated with these lands. These factors, along with
his view that &#145;No Trespassing&#146; signs and the like do not
effectively deter members of the public from straying onto
unoccupied lands, led Powell J. to conclude that government
intrusion on them, without a warrant or probable cause, does not
violate the Fourth Amendment because such lands do not give rise
to an expectation of privacy which society is prepared to
recognize as reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>     Is the Doctrine Consistent with s. 8 of the Charter?</pre>
    <pre>[38] To date, R. v. Patriquen, supra, is the only appellate
authority in Canada directly on point.2  As indicated, by a two
to one majority, the court in Patriquen adopted the reasoning in
Oliver and concluded that the open fields doctrine does not
offend s. 8 of the Charter. With respect, for reasons which
follow, I do not share that view.</pre>
    <pre>[39] I begin the discussion with the general but important
observation that although American jurisprudence may serve as a
useful guide to the interpretation of the Charter, it is by no
means determinative. The fundamental structural differences
between the American and Canadian constitutions make it necessary
to proceed with caution when deciding whether doctrines such as
the one in question can safely be applied in Canada. This point
was forcefully made by Lamer J. (as he then was) in Reference Re
s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (British Columbia), [1985] 2
S.C.R. 486 where, at p. 489, he observed:
          </pre>
    <pre>               That Constitution [the United States Constitution], it must
          be remembered, has no section 52 nor has it the internal checks
          and balances of ss. 1 and 33. We would, in my view, do our own
          Constitution a disservice to simply allow the American debate to
          define the issue for us, all the while ignoring the truly
          fundamental structural differences between the two constitutions.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[40] Section 24(2) of the Charter can also be added to the list
of &#147;fundamental structural&#148; differences between the two
constitutions. That provision, without counterpart in the United
States, acts as a safety valve for admitting evidence otherwise
obtained in a manner offensive to the Charter; its important role
must always be kept in mind, especially when the applicability of
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is being considered.</pre>
    <pre>[41] As a general rule, any violation of the Fourth Amendment
results in automatic exclusion. It is thus little wonder that
unlike Canadian courts, American courts shy away from a case-by-
case approach to admissibility, preferring instead to adopt
bright line rules similar to the one under review.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The structural differences in question are but one reason
why we have not always followed in the constitutional footsteps
of our neighbours to the south. Another relates to the specific
wording used in analogous but by no means identical
constitutional provisions. The case at hand serves as a good
illustration.</pre>
    <pre>[43] Whereas s. 8 of the Charter is framed in broad language, the
protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment are limited to
&#147;persons, houses, papers and effects.&#148;  For present purposes, the
importance of this distinction lies in the fact that the open
fields doctrine is rooted in the narrow interpretation ascribed
to those words by the court in Hester v. United States, supra,
where, at pp. 58-59 Holmes J. observed:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment
          to the people in their &#147;persons, houses, papers and effects,&#148; is
          not extended to the open fields. The distinction between the
          latter and the house is as old as the common law.</pre>
    <pre>[44] The distinction between the house and open fields to which
Holmes J. referred is not central to the appeal and I do not
propose to dwell on it. Two observations, however, are in order.</pre>
    <pre>[45] First, the common law distinction between the house,
including the area immediately surrounding it (referred to as the
&#147;curtilage&#148;), and open fields must be placed in its proper
context. The distinction is rooted in the common law offence of
burglary, not the common law offence of trespass. Bearing in mind
that the punishment for burglary was hanging, the distinction was
an important one as it created a buffer between the offences of
trespass and burglary.3  However, it did not legitimize unwelcome
intrusions onto privately-owned open fields. To the contrary,
such intrusions continued to be governed by the law of trespass.</pre>
    <pre>[46] Second, although the Hester court&#146;s &#147;protected areas&#148;
approach to the Fourth Amendment went unchallenged for 40 odd
years, it was called into question in 1967 as a result of the
Supreme Court decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347
(1967). In Katz, at p. 352, Justice Stewart, for the majority,
rejected the notion that the &#147;constitutionally protected areas&#148;
concept could serve as &#147;a talismanic solution to every Fourth
Amendment problem.&#148;  Rather, in his opinion, the Fourth Amendment
was meant to protect &#147;people, not places&#148; and the proper question
to be asked in deciding whether a Fourth Amendment search had
occurred was whether the police conduct &#147;violated the privacy
upon which [the defendants] justifiably relied.&#148; (at p. 352)</pre>
    <pre>[47] Some heralded Katz as sounding the death knell of the open
fields doctrine.4  That, however, was not to be the case. The
majority of the Supreme Court in Oliver, supra, concluded that
the doctrine fully survived the Katz reformulation of the Fourth
Amendment interest. In doing so, they did not resile from the
reasoning in Hester. To the contrary, their express adoption of
the protected areas analysis in Hester formed one reason for
concluding that the open fields doctrine continued to pass
constitutional muster.</pre>
    <pre>[48] As I have already observed, the distinction drawn in Hester
is not central to this appeal. However, examining the basis for
the distinction as well as the consideration that the distinction
was called into question in Katz reinforces the need to proceed
with caution when deciding whether the majority opinion in Oliver
represents the law of Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[49] I now turn to consider whether the analysis of the majority
in Oliver can safely be adopted in Canada, without offending s. 8
of the Charter. At issue is the principle, enunciated by the
majority, that persons in lawful possession of unoccupied lands
cannot invoke the protection of the Fourth Amendment against
unauthorized government intrusions because such lands do not give
rise to an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to
recognize as reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[50] In coming to this conclusion, the majority expressly
rejected the notion that assertions of a reasonable expectation
of privacy should be determined on a case-by-case basis, having
regard to all of the circumstances. At p. 1743, Powell J.
explained why that approach was unacceptable:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Nor would a case-by-case approach provide a workable
          accommodation between the needs of law enforcement and interests
          protected by the Fourth Amendment. Under this approach, police
          officers would have to guess before every search whether
          landowners had erected fences sufficiently high, posted a
          sufficient number of warning signs, or located contraband in an
          area sufficiently secluded to establish a right of privacy. The
          lawfulness of the search would turn on &#147;&#146;[a] highly sophisticated
          set of rules, qualified by all sorts of ifs, ands, and buts and
          requiring the drawing of subtle nuances and hairline distinctions
          &#133;&#146;&#148;  This Court repeatedly has acknowledged the difficulties
          created for courts, police, and citizens by an ad hoc, case-by-
          case definition of Fourth Amendment standards to be applied in
          differing factual circumstances. The ad hoc approach not only
          makes it difficult for the policeman to discern the scope of his
          authority; it also creates a danger that constitutional rights
          will be arbitrarily and inequitably enforced. [Footnotes and
          citations omitted.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[51] Powell J.&#146;s rejection of the case-by-case approach provides
yet another illustration  of the need to proceed with caution
when considering Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In this
instance, the bright-line approach favoured by Powell J. does not
accord with our jurisprudence on the subject.</pre>
    <pre>[52] In R. v. Edwards (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 136 (S.C.C.), Cory
J., for the majority, outlined the principles to be applied in
deciding whether a particular accused had established a
reasonable expectation of privacy. At pp. 150-51, he made it
clear that an assertion that an expectation of privacy is
reasonable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, having
regard to all of the surrounding circumstances:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... A reasonable expectation of privacy is to be determined
          on the basis of the totality of the circumstances&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... The factors to be considered in
          assessing the totality of the circumstances
          may include, but are not restricted to, the
          following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i)  presence [of the accused] at the
          time of the search;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii)      possession or control of the
          property or place searched;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iii)     ownership of the property or
          place;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iv)      historical use of the property
          or item;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (v)  the ability to regulate access,
          including the right to admit or exclude
          others from the place;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (vi)      the existence of a subjective
          expectation of privacy; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (vii)     the objective reasonableness
          of the expectation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[53] To this point, I have not referred to the dissenting opinion
in Oliver, authored by Marshall J.  I do so now because like Cory
J., he was of the view that an assertion of a reasonable
expectation of privacy should be assessed on a case-by-case
basis.</pre>
    <pre>[54] According to Marshall J., the existence of a reasonable
expectation of privacy in unoccupied lands depends largely on the
steps taken by persons in lawful possession to protect their
property against unwelcome intrusions by the public. In this
respect, he drew a distinction at p. 1749 between certain spaces
like the home, which are presumed to be private, and other
spaces, such as open fields, which &#147;&#133; by positive law and social
convention, [are] presumed accessible to members of the public
unless the owner manifests his intention to exclude them.&#148;
[Emphasis in original.]  Marshall J. elaborated on the importance
of the occupier&#146;s conduct as follows, at pp. 1749-1750:
          </pre>
    <pre>               If a person has not marked the boundaries of his fields or
          woods in a way that informs passersby that they are not welcome,
          he cannot object if members of the public enter onto the
          property. There is no reason why he should have any greater
          rights as against government officials.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A very different case is presented
          when the owner of undeveloped land has taken
          precautions to exclude the public. As
          indicated above, a deliberate entry by a
          private citizen onto private property marked
          with &#147;No Trespassing&#148; signs will expose him
          to criminal liability. I see no reason why a
          government official should not be obliged to
          respect such unequivocal and universally
          understood manifestations of a landowner&#146;s
          desire for privacy. [Footnotes excluded.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[55] Marshall J. concluded at p. 1750 that in deciding whether
Fourth Amendment protection extends to unoccupied lands, the
following test should be applied:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Private land marked in a fashion sufficient to render entry
          thereon a criminal trespass under the law of the State in which
          the land lies is protected by the Fourth Amendment&#146;s proscription
          of unreasonable searches and seizures.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[56] In refusing to accept the majority opinion that ownership of
unoccupied lands does not give rise to an expectation of privacy
which society is prepared to recognize as reasonable, Marshall J.
considered two factors in addition to the conduct of persons in
lawful possession of such lands. The other two factors that he
considered were whether the expectation at issue is rooted in
entitlements defined by positive law and the nature of the uses
to which spaces of the sort in question can be put.</pre>
    <pre>[57] Marshall J. identified two aspects of positive law which, in
his view, belied the notion that expectations of privacy asserted
in respect of unoccupied lands are not of a sort that society is
prepared to recognize as reasonable:  first, the right of persons
in lawful possession to exclude members of the public from their
property and second, the laws against trespass designed to deter
unwelcome intrusions.</pre>
    <pre>[58] With respect to the uses to which undeveloped lands may be
put, Marshall J. took issue with the majority&#146;s statement that
&#147;open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate
activities that the [Fourth] Amendment is intended to shelter
from government interference or surveillance.&#148;  He observed at
pp. 1748-1749:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Privately owned woods and fields that are not exposed to
          public view regularly are employed in a variety of ways that
          society acknowledges deserve privacy. Many landowners like to
          take solitary walks on their property, confident that they will
          not be confronted in their rambles by strangers or policemen.
          Others conduct agricultural businesses on their property. Some
          landowners use their secluded spaces to meet lovers, others to
          gather together with fellow worshippers, still others to engage
          in sustained creative endeavor. Private land is sometimes used as
          a refuge for wildlife, where flora and fauna are protected from
          human intervention of any kind. Our respect for the freedom of
          landowners to use their posted &#147;open fields&#148; in ways such as
          these partially explains the seriousness with which the positive
          law regards deliberate invasions of such spaces and substantially
          reinforces the landowners&#146; contention that their expectations of
          privacy are &#147;reasonable.&#148;  [Footnotes and citations omitted.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[59] In determining whether the open fields doctrine is
consistent with the Charter, it is important to note that
although the majority decision in Oliver put the matter to rest
at the federal level, the doctrine remains a source of
controversy at the state level. Indeed, several state Supreme
Courts have found the doctrine to be unconstitutional,
essentially for the reasons of Marshall J. As a result, these
courts have refused to give effect to the doctrine in the
interpretation of privacy provisions, equivalent to the Fourth
Amendment, contained in their respective state Constitutions.5  I
do not intend to analyze the relevant cases in detail. The
following passages from the Vermont Supreme Court in State v.
Kirchoff reflect the thinking of several state courts on the
subject:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While generally there is not an expectation of privacy in
          unoccupied lands, such is not the case where the landowner has
          taken steps, such as fencing or posting, to indicate that privacy
          is exactly what is sought. The Oliver Court informs us that an
          individual&#146;s expectations of privacy in land &#150; regardless of
          steps taken to establish that expectation &#150; can never be
          legitimate. This per se approach cannot be squared with Article
          11 &#150; nor, we believe, can it be squared with the Fourth Amendment
          principles of Katz. (at p. 993)
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Supreme Court in Oliver appears to
          equate privacy with crime, stating that
          &#147;[t]he test of legitimacy is not whether the
          individual chooses to conceal assertedly
          &#145;private&#146; activity,&#148; and adding: &#147;Certainly
          the Framers did not intend that the Fourth
          Amendment should shelter criminal activity
          wherever persons with criminal intent choose
          to erect barriers and post &#145;No Trespassing&#146;
          signs.&#148; If one assumes at the outset that
          people will only seek privacy in the use of
          their land for criminal purposes, the
          conclusion that society will not recognize a
          claim to privacy in the land readily follows.
          But we cannot presume how an individual will
          employ private lands &#150; that is the nature of
          privacy. Constitutional guarantees inevitably
          protect some criminal activity in securing
          the rights of all of us. (at p. 993)
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where the indicia, such as fences,
          barriers or &#147;no trespassing&#148; signs reasonably
          indicate that strangers are not welcome on
          the land, the owner or occupant may
          reasonably expect privacy. &#147;Allowing the
          police to intrude into private land,
          regardless of the steps taken by its occupant
          to keep it private, would be a significant
          limitation on the occupant&#146;s freedom from
          governmental scrutiny.&#148; The inquiry is
          objective &#150; whether a reasonable person
          should know that the occupant has sought to
          exclude the public. (at p. 994)
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               We appreciate the concern that drug-
          related activities are a major social
          problem. We do not believe, however, that the
          solution is a declamation of martial law that
          reduces the warrant requirement to an easily
          discarded &#147;technicality.&#148;  The rule announced
          here does not significantly hamper the police
          from investigating suspected criminal
          activity. It does require police to obtain a
          warrant, based upon probable cause, before
          they enter land where it is apparent to a
          reasonable person that the owner or occupant
          intends to exclude the public. The rule
          brings the practice of law enforcement into
          compliance with our fundamental law, which
          empowers the judiciary to guard the rights of
          the people through the warrant process.

    <pre>     Conclusion on whether the Open Fields Doctrine is consistent
with s. 8</pre>
    <pre>[60] Having considered both sides of the argument, I am of the
view that the open fields doctrine cannot survive s. 8 Charter
scrutiny. To be specific, I am unprepared to interpret s. 8 of
the Charter in a manner which would, without exception, foreclose
property holders from asserting an expectation of privacy in
unoccupied lands on the basis that society does not recognize the
expectation as reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[61] In this respect, I am in essential agreement with the
analysis undertaken by Marshall J. in Oliver. In assessing
whether an asserted expectation of privacy is one which society
is prepared to recognize as reasonable, Marshall J. was of the
view that a variety of factors must be considered. In the case of
unoccupied lands, he concluded that three factors are important:
               1. entitlements defined by positive law;
               2. the nature of the uses to which the lands in
questions could be put; and
               3. the protective measures taken by persons
claiming a privacy interest.</pre>
    <pre>[62] I propose to briefly consider each of these factors in the
Canadian context.</pre>
    <pre>[63] Not unlike in the United States, persons in lawful
possession of unoccupied lands in Canada have the right to
exclude members of the public from their property. Trespass laws,
enacted provincially, provide clear evidence that society deems
this right and the expectation of privacy associated with it, to
be both reasonable and worthy of protection.</pre>
    <pre>[64] Significantly, the proscription against trespassing is not
limited to residential settings. Indeed, in Ontario, agricultural
lands are afforded special protection under s. 3(1) of the
Trespass to Property Act. Whereas in most instances, notice is
required to prohibit entry, s. 3(1) eliminates the need for
notice in respect of lands under cultivation, woodlots used
primarily for agricultural purposes and lands otherwise enclosed
in a manner indicating the owner&#146;s intention to keep persons off
the premises or to keep animals on the premises. In these
instances, entry is deemed to be prohibited without notice.</pre>
    <pre>[65] Apart from provincial laws, privacy rights in unoccupied
lands are also recognized federally. Section 41(1) of the
Criminal Code provides a useful example. Under that provision,
persons in peaceable possession of a dwelling house or real
property (which I take to include unoccupied lands) are entitled
to use reasonable force to prevent trespassing and to remove
trespassers from their property. Given that we, as a society, are
prepared to condone the use of force to remove trespassers from
unoccupied lands, it can scarcely be said that expectations of
privacy in such lands are unreasonable and therefore unworthy of
constitutional protection.</pre>
    <pre>[66] The common law also provides support for the view that an
expectation of privacy which society is prepared to recognize as
reasonable can arise in relation to unoccupied lands. Apart from
certain narrow exceptions, it is well-established that absent
permission, the rights of a property holder to be free of police
intrusion can be restricted only by powers granted in clear
statutory language. (See Colet v. The Queen (1981), 57 C.C.C.
(2d) 105 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Kokesh (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 207
(S.C.C.).)</pre>
    <pre>[67] Turning next to the nature of the uses to which unoccupied
lands can be put, I think it is self-evident that Canadians
engage in precisely the same activities as those mentioned by
Marshall J. There is no need to repeat them. Suffice it to say
that they are all legitimate activities and as a society, we
adhere to the belief that people should be free to enjoy their
privacy without fear of intrusion by members of the public or
government officials.</pre>
    <pre>[68] That said, I am not unmindful of the fact that for some,
unoccupied lands provide an ideal setting for criminal activity.
The case at hand is a good illustration. But in deciding whether
the values enshrined in s. 8 of the Charter are meant to apply to
unoccupied lands, it would be wrong to approach the issue from
the point of view that privacy will only be used to shelter
criminal behaviour. Rather, the starting point for purposes of
the s. 8 analysis should be that law-abiding citizens have a
strong interest in privacy that the Charter is meant to protect.
Inevitably, this approach will result in some criminal activity
going undetected, but that is a price society must pay to secure
the rights of all of us.</pre>
    <pre>[69] The final factor to consider in assessing whether an
expectation of privacy is one which society is prepared to
recognize as reasonable relates to the conduct of persons in
lawful possession of unoccupied lands.  Positive measures taken
by those in lawful possession to exclude the public are
significant for two reasons. First, such measures speak to the
occupant&#146;s subjective expectation of privacy. Second, most
members of society take heed when they are given notice of an
occupier&#146;s intention to exclude the public, which attests to
society&#146;s recognition of the expectation of privacy as
reasonable. This behaviour only stands to reason when one
considers that from an early age, we are taught to recognize and
respect the privacy rights of others.</pre>
    <pre>[70] No doubt, measures taken to exclude the public from
unoccupied lands do not always prove effective in deterring
trespassers. That said, I do not share the trial judge&#146;s view
that &#147;in rural settings &#133; it is unrealistic to assume that
strands of wire and some &#145;No Trespassing&#146; signs can reasonably be
expected to provide privacy.&#148;  With respect, I do not find the
assumption to be unrealistic.</pre>
    <pre>[71] Even if I am wrong in this view, in assessing whether an
expectation of privacy in unoccupied lands is reasonable, it
hardly seems appropriate to use the unlawful conduct of
trespassers as the yardstick against which reasonableness is to
be measured. That is a troubling premise and one which I am not
prepared to accept.</pre>
    <pre>[72] For these reasons, I am satisfied that an expectation of
privacy which society is prepared to recognize as reasonable can
exist in respect of unoccupied lands. Accordingly, the open
fields doctrine offends the provisions of s. 8 of the Charter and
does not form part of the law of Canada. It follows that the
trial judge erred in relying on the doctrine to find that the
appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
leasehold property.</pre>
    <pre>     Did the appellant have a reasonable expectation of privacy
     in the leasehold property on the facts of this case?</pre>
    <pre>[73] When the principles set forth in R. v. Edwards, supra, are
applied to the undisputed facts of this case, I am satisfied that
the appellant has met his onus of establishing a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the leasehold property.</pre>
    <pre>[74] The appellant was present in the cornfield when Constables
Parsons and Merrifield observed him. The marijuana in the field
belonged to the appellant. Although the leasehold property
belonged to the appellant&#146;s brother-in-law, it had been leased by
the appellant several months earlier and in his capacity as
lessee, he was lawfully entitled to occupy the property and
regulate access to it.</pre>
    <pre>[75] The appellant manifested a clear intention to exclude the
public from the leasehold property and he believed that his
privacy rights would be respected by reasonable members of the
public. The cornfield was not visible from the road or
neighbouring properties and there was no evidence that lawful
aerial surveillance6 would have detected the marijuana.
Accordingly, his expectation of privacy was objectively
reasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[76] In view of this conclusion, Constable Johnson&#146;s initial
warrantless entry onto the leasehold property constituted a
violation of the appellant&#146;s s. 8 rights. This initial entry led
to a series of further s. 8 violations: the warrantless entry by
Constable Parsons and Merrifield onto the appellant&#146;s leasehold
property, the warrantless seizure of the marijuana from the
cornfield, and the search of the appellant&#146;s home with a warrant
obtained on the basis of illegally obtained evidence, thus
rendering the search a warrantless one. That being so, the
admissibility of all of the drugs seized, including those found
in the appellant&#146;s residence, falls to be determined under s.
24(2) of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>SECTION 24(2) ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[77] The three factors to be considered in assessing the
admissibility of evidence under s. 24(2) are:  the effect of
admission on trial fairness; the seriousness of the violation;
and the effect of exclusion on the reputation of the
administration of justice.</pre>
    <pre>     i) Trial Fairness</pre>
    <pre>[78] On behalf of the appellant, Ms. Copeland conceded that the
marijuana seized from the cornfield and the appellant&#146;s residence
was non-conscriptive evidence and that its admission did not
raise trial fairness concerns. She took a different position,
however, with respect to the observations made by Constables
Parsons and Merrifield of the appellant in the cornfield, first
harvesting marijuana and then attempting to flee. In
Ms. Copeland&#146;s submission, these observations constituted
conscriptive evidence because the appellant was compelled, by the
use of his body, to incriminate himself at the behest of the
state.</pre>
    <pre>[79] I see no merit in this submission. The same argument was
considered and rejected by this court in R. v. Lauda (1998), 122
C.C.C. (3d) 74 at 87; aff&#146;d for other reasons at (1998), 40 O.R.
(3d) 159 (S.C.C.). Accordingly, the issue of trial fairness plays
no part in the s. 24(2) analysis.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ii)  Seriousness of the Violations</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  Constable Johnson&#146;s initial entry</pre>
    <pre>[80] As noted, Constable Johnson&#146;s warrantless entry and search
of the leasehold property constituted a violation of the
appellant&#146;s s. 8 rights, which, in turn, led to further
violations. In assessing the seriousness of the initial
violation, a number of factors must be considered, the first
being whether it can be said that Constable Johnson was acting in
good faith, when, without reasonable grounds and without lawful
authority, he knowingly trespassed onto private property and
conducted a warrantless search to verify an anonymous tip.</pre>
    <pre>[81] In cross-examination, Constable Johnson sought to justify
his conduct. He testified that based on his understanding of the
law, he did not need a search warrant or permission from the
property holder to enter the leasehold lands because at the time
of entry, he was engaged in an eradication program, not a
criminal investigation. The relevant portions of his cross-
examination read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. That tip provided no information about the reliability of
          the informant?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Not that I recall.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. So clearly there was not sufficient
          information to obtain a search warrant,
          correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Correct.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. You knew that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. And you are aware that warrantless
          searches are not permitted except in exigent
          circumstances, where it&#146;s impractical to
          obtain a warrant?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. I was told that we would treat it as
          part of the eradication program.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. Are you aware of this proposition I
          just put to you, that warrantless searches
          are not permitted except in exigent
          circumstances, where it&#146;s impractical to
          obtain a warrant?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. This, you thought, was going to be
          treated as eradication and therefore that
          rule didn&#146;t count, correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. In eradication we don&#146;t lay charges;
          we just remove it and burn it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. Were you told to collect samples?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. Were you told &#150; sorry, you formed the
          conclusion that because the material was to
          be burned that you did not need to worry
          about the requirement for a search warrant,
          is that your understanding?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. That&#146;s my understanding.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  You attended at the property, yes?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. You knew obviously from the lock that
          it was private property.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. You went on it anyway?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. I did.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. You made no attempt to check with the
          owner to find out who the owner was?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. No, I didn&#146;t.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. You knew you had no lawful authority
          for being on that property?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. I believe that I was in the lawful
          execution of my duties.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. Is there any instruction manual that
          tells you this, any authorization you have
          for this position?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. No.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[82] There is no reason to doubt Constable Johnson&#146;s honesty or
the sincerity of his beliefs. Indeed, his erroneous view that s.
8 of the Charter did not apply to &#147;eradication programs&#148; was one
shared by his superior officers. Whether the local federal Crown
also held that view is another matter.</pre>
    <pre>[83] In oral argument, counsel for the respondent emphasized that
Sergeant Cardwell contacted the local federal Crown before
proceeding to harvest the marijuana. He submitted that this
should carry considerable weight in assessing the good faith of
the police. Implicit in this submission is the suggestion that
the local Crown endorsed the investigative procedures undertaken
by the police to verify the anonymous tip. I have several
difficulties with this submission.</pre>
    <pre>[84] First, the record is clear that Sergeant Cardwell did not
communicate with the local Crown until after Constable Johnson
had attended at the property and reported back to him.
Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Crown lent his approval
to Constable Johnson&#146;s initial warrantless entry and search.</pre>
    <pre>[85] Second, as for the suggestion that the local Crown may have
approved the conduct of the police after the marijuana had been
discovered, this is simply not borne out by the record. The
relevant examination of Sergeant Cardwell reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. So you meet with Detective Constable Johnson. And I take
          it the arrangement at that point in time was that Johnson was to
          go out and do what?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. He was to check to see if the, first
          of all, the address was correct, the fire
          code, and also to check to see if there was
          anybody around that particular location and
          to see if there was marijuana plants growing,
          in fact growing there.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. Indeed, as far as you knew he did
          that and then reported back to you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. That is correct, sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. And a decision was made simply to
          pull the plants?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. That is correct. That was the sole
          reason I contacted the federal prosecutor,
          Doug Grace. We have a procedure now in place
          that any destruction of plants, what we call
          the emergent disposal of plants, it has to
          have the approval of the federal prosecutor,
          and the purpose of me calling was to let him
          know the circumstances involving it and
          requesting his permission, so that I could
          forward the forms and get destruction.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q. I take it you spoke with Mr. Grace
          and that information or approval was given,
          is that correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A. That is, that is correct, sir. He
          paged me back at 8:19 p.m. on Tuesday night,
          the 21st of October, 1997. We had a short
          conversation and he just asked me to do
          certain things and agreed with the disposal.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[86] Without knowing precisely what information Sergeant Cardwell
conveyed to the local Crown, this passage falls shorts of
establishing that the police were led to believe that s. 8 of the
Charter did not apply to eradication programs. To infer
otherwise, I would have to assume that the local Crown was
unfamiliar with the well-established common law principle,
referred to earlier at paragraph 66, that apart from certain
narrow exceptions, absent permission, the rights of a property
holder to be free of police intrusion can be restricted only by
powers granted in clear statutory language. I am not prepared to
make any such assumption. Indeed, for the purpose of assessing
the good faith of the police, I am satisfied that Constable
Johnson and his superiors had ample opportunity to familiarize
themselves with this principle and they should have acted in
accordance with it.</pre>
    <pre>[87] Manifestly, when Constable Johnson entered the leasehold
property, he did not have permission from the property holder and
his entry was not justified at common law. It follows, in my
view, that any doubt he may have had about his ability to
trespass onto private property in the absence of specific
statutory authority was unreasonable, and cannot, as a matter of
law, be relied upon as good faith for the purposes of s. 24(2).</pre>
    <pre>[88] Accordingly, I am not prepared to find that Constable
Johnson was acting in good faith when he conducted his initial
warrantless search. That said, I am equally unprepared to
characterize his conduct as deliberate, willful or flagrant. In
this respect, apart from his sincere belief that s. 8 of the
Charter did not apply because he was engaged in an eradication
program, not a criminal investigation, I take into account the
fact that prior to this case, the law in Ontario concerning the
constitutionality of the open fields doctrine was not settled.
Indeed, at the time of the instant investigation, the only
appellate authority on the subject was R. v. Patriquen, supra,
where the doctrine was found to be constitutional. Had the police
been aware of that decision, they might well have relied upon it
to justify their conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[89] In sum, even though I am satisfied that Constable Johnson
was not acting in bad faith when he entered onto the property
without a warrant, he cannot rely on good faith to mitigate the
seriousness of the initial Charter violation.</pre>
    <pre>[90] While the absence of good faith is an important factor in
assessing the seriousness of a Charter violation, it is by no
means the only factor, nor is it necessarily determinative. (See
for example Roscoe J.A.&#146;s analysis in R. v. Patriquen, supra, at
pp. 377-78, aff&#146;d at (1995), 43 C.R. (4th) 134 (S.C.C.).)  Other
factors which must be considered when assessing the seriousness
of a s. 8 violation include the nature of the intrusion and the
privacy interest at stake.</pre>
    <pre>[91] In this case, it is important to recognize that Constable
Johnson did not intrude upon the appellant&#146;s private dwelling.
Rather, he ventured into a field in search of marijuana. His
conduct involved a minimally intrusive type of search, which
serves to mitigate the seriousness of the violation. (See R. v.
Lauda, supra, at p. 88 (C.A.) and R. v. Patriquen, supra, at
p. 377.)</pre>
    <pre>[92] Te level of privacy attaching to the cornfield does not
approach that of a private dwelling. A field is obviously more
exposed to public intrusion than a home; steps taken by property
holders to exclude the public from open fields will not always
prove successful. Indeed, as the evidence in this case reveals,
Sergeant Cardwell observed hunters on the property before giving
the command to eradicate the marijuana.</pre>
    <pre>[93] It follows, in my view, that although the appellant was
entitled to assert a privacy interest in the leasehold property,
his expectation did not measure high on the privacy scale. This
too serves to mitigate the seriousness of the violation.</pre>
    <pre>[94] In the final analysis, when the various factors are
balanced, I am not prepared to find that Constable Johnson&#146;s
warrantless entry and search of the property constituted a
serious breach of the appellant&#146;s s. 8 rights.</pre>
    <pre>          b)   Constable Parsons&#146; and Merrifield&#146;s entry and search</pre>
    <pre>[95] For the same reasons that I found Constable Johnson&#146;s
initial entry onto the appellant&#146;s leasehold premises was not a
serious violation of s. 8, the warrantless entry and search by
Constables Merrifield and Parsons the following day was not
serious in the circumstances of this case. Specifically, the
state of judicial authority on open field searches, the minimally
intrusive nature of the search relative to the search of a
private dwelling and the lesser expectation of privacy that
exists in respect of an open field combine to support that
conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>          c)  Seizure of the marijuana from the cornfield</pre>
    <pre>[96] With respect to Sergeant Cardwell&#146;s decision to seize and
remove the marijuana from the cornfield before obtaining a search
warrant, the trial judge found that exigent circumstances existed
which justified the seizure. In my view, it was open to the trial
judge to make that finding and I see no basis for interfering
with it. The existence of exigent circumstances render the
Charter violation less serious in light of the facts of this
case:  see R. v. Silveira, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297.</pre>
    <pre>          d)  The search of the appellant&#146;s residence</pre>
    <pre>[97] I take a different view, however, with respect to the search
of the appellant&#146;s residence. It will be recalled that the police
obtained a warrant to search the residence. They did so, however,
on the strength of illegally obtained information. Accordingly,
the warrant was invalid and the search of the home must be
treated as a warrantless search.</pre>
    <pre>[98] Manifestly, the mitigating factors which attenuate the
seriousness of the violations in respect of the cornfield do not
apply to the appellant&#146;s residence, in which a much higher
expectation of privacy exists. It follows, in my view, that the
warrantless search of the appellant&#146;s home was extremely serious
and intrusive and it must be regarded as a flagrant violation of
the appellant&#146;s s. 8 rights.</pre>
    <pre>     iii)  Effect of exclusion on the reputation of the
administration of justice</pre>
    <pre>[99] Dealing first with the marijuana seized from the cornfield,
it is well-established that cultivation of marijuana is a serious
offence, particularly in cases such as this where the appellant
was engaged in a large scale commercial operation of significant
proportions. (See for example, R. v. Laurin (1997), 113 C.C.C.
(3d) 519 at 537 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Puskas (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d)
548 at 556 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Grant (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 173 at
202 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Plant (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 203 at 218
(S.C.C.).)  These authorities also make it clear that the more
serious the offence, the greater the likelihood that the
administration of justice will be brought into disrepute by the
exclusion of the evidence, especially where the evidence sought
to be excluded is crucial to a conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[100]     In the circumstances of this case, where the guilt of
the appellant for a serious offence is clearly established by
real evidence and where the exclusion of the marijuana seized
from the cornfield would result in his acquittal, I am of the
view that the exclusion of the evidence would have a greater
negative effect on the repute of justice than would its
admission.</pre>
    <pre>[101]     On balance, when the severity of the violation giving
rise to the discovery of the marijuana in the cornfield is
weighed against the effect of exclusion on the reputation of the
administration of justice, I am not persuaded that the appellant
has met his onus under s. 24(2). Accordingly, I am satisfied that
the marijuana seized from the cornfield was admissible.</pre>
    <pre>[102]     I take a different view, however, with respect to the
evidence found in the appellant&#146;s residence. In this respect,
bearing in mind the seriousness of the violation, I am satisfied
that the administration of justice would suffer greater disrepute
from the admission of this evidence than from its exclusion. The
warrantless search of the appellant&#146;s residence constituted a
flagrant violation of his s. 8 rights and the conduct of the
police must not be judicially condoned.</pre>
    <pre>[103]     Accordingly, I am satisfied that the controlled
substances seized from the appellant&#146;s residence should not have
been admitted into evidence.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION OF THE NARCOTIC OFFENCES</pre>
    <pre>[104]     Having determined that the marijuana seized from the
cornfield was properly admitted, I would dismiss the appeal from
conviction on the charge of unlawfully producing a controlled
substance.</pre>
    <pre>[105]     With respect to the offence of possession of a
controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, that charge
would appear to relate to the controlled substances located in
the appellant&#146;s residence. In view of my conclusion that the
marijuana seized from the residence is inadmissible, I would
allow the appeal on that charge, set aside the conviction and
enter a verdict of acquittal.</pre>
    <pre>THE CRIMINAL CODE OFFENCES</pre>
    <pre>[106]     The convictions for obstructing a peace officer in the
execution of his duty and escaping lawful custody can only be
sustained if Constable Parsons was engaged in the lawful
execution of his duty when he arrested the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[107]     The analysis that I have brought to bear on Constable
Parsons&#146; warrantless entry and search of the cornfield leads me
to conclude that at the time of arrest, he and his partner were
unlawfully trespassing on private property and their presence on
the property constituted a violation of the appellant&#146;s s. 8
rights. Under these circumstances, bearing in mind that the
appellant was lawfully in possession of the leasehold property,
it cannot be said that Constable Parsons was acting in the lawful
execution of his duty when he arrested the appellant. (See R. v.
Thomas (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 81 (Nfld. C.A.); aff&#146;d (1993), 78
C.C.C. (3d) 575 (S.C.C.).)  Accordingly, the convictions on the
Criminal Code offences cannot stand.</pre>
    <pre>[108]     In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide
whether the police obtained the &#147;false identification&#148; evidence
from the appellant in a manner which violated his s. 10(b)
rights.</pre>
    <pre>[109]     In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
convictions for obstructing a peace officer and escaping lawful
custody and enter verdicts of acquittal.</pre>
    <pre>SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[110]     The trial judge imposed a global sentence of three
years in the penitentiary. Specifically, he sentenced the
appellant to 18 months for producing a controlled substance; 16
months consecutive for possession of a controlled substance for
the purpose of trafficking and 1 month consecutive on each of the
Criminal Code offences.</pre>
    <pre>[111]     The sentence of 18 months on the cultivation charge was
eminently fit and I see no reason for interfering with it.
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from sentence on that
charge.</pre>
    <pre>[112]     As for the remaining sentences, having entered verdicts
of acquittal on the charges giving rise to them, they are no
longer an issue.</pre>
    <pre>[113]     In the result, the appeal from conviction and sentence
on the charge of producing a controlled substance is dismissed
and the convictions on the remaining charges are set aside and
verdicts of acquittal are entered.
