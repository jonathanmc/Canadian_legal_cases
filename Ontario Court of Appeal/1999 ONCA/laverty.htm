    <pre>HEARD:         September 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Lax J. dated July 6, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge did not have the benefit of the full
submissions that we heard.  During oral argument, it became clear
to us that a misunderstanding had arisen over comments made to
the appellant before the trial by respondent&#146;s counsel.  This
misunderstanding resulted in the appellant assuming that the
trial would not proceed.  The trial judge&#146;s decision to proceed,
therefore, was based on insufficient information and resulted in
the appellant being unable to present his counterclaim properly
since he did not have the benefit of counsel or the relevant
documents.
[2]  We do not, however, think that the appellant has been
prejudiced by the judgment granted against him in the main action
since no realistic defence was advanced to the respondent&#146;s
claim.
[3]  Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal from paragraph 1 of
Justice Lax&#146;s judgment and order that a new trial take place on
the counterclaim on an expedited basis.  The judgment will be
stayed pending the determination of the counterclaim.  The
respondent will have the right to file a writ of execution, but
not enforce it.
[4]  The costs order at trial will be reduced to $3,500 and
paragraph 2 of Justice Lax&#146;s judgment varied accordingly.
[5]  There will be no costs of this appeal.
