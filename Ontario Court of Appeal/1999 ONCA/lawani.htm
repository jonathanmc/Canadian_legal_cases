    <pre>HEARD:         June 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Otter on June 29, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of six counts of fraud under
$5,000. These were welfare frauds. The total amount involved was
about $21,000. The trial judge suspended the passing of sentence
and placed the appellant on probation for 18 months on each
count. The sentences were concurrent.
[2]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not
resorting to the conditional discharge  provisions of the
Criminal Code. In a concurrent submission, the appellant submits
that the trial judge did not take the appellant&#146;s immigration
status into appropriate account when he sentenced the appellant.
[3]  In our opinion, the trial judge considered all of the
appropriate factors, including the appellant&#146;s immigration
status, that is the prospect of him being deported as a result of
these criminal convictions.
[4]  In light of the seriousness of the offences and the
significance of general deterrence, we cannot conclude that the
trial judge erred in exercising his discretion on sentence as he
did. Thus, our intervention is not warranted. That said, we do
note that the appellant has made full restitution. This is a
factor which may be of considerable interest to the immigration
authorities.
[5]  Leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
