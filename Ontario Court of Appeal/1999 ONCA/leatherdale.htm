    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, a medical doctor, was charged with one count
of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault on a
complainant who was his patient at the time of the alleged
offences.  According to the evidence led at the preliminary
inquiry, the alleged indecent assault involved incidents of
kissing and fondling in 1979 and 1980, and the alleged sexual
assault involved an act of intercourse in 1980 and an attempted
kissing incident in 1993.
[2]  At his preliminary inquiry, the appellant was committed for
trial on the count of indecent assault and on the count of sexual
assault that arose from the attempted kissing in 1993.  He was
not committed for trial for any offence arising from the act of
sexual intercourse  in 1980.  With respect to that act, the Crown
acknowledged that the offence of sexual assault was not known to
law prior to 1983.  The preliminary inquiry judge considered, but
declined to order, the appellant to stand trial for the offence
of rape in relation to that act.
[3]  In reaching that conclusion, he directed his mind to the
issue of consent and said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Here the only evidence is from the complainant that even
          though she gave consent she didn&#146;t feel that it was a true
          consent.  It was never communicated to the defendant.  She never
          indicates that that was the situation.  It is only some time
          later that she asserts that it is because of the relationship
          that she truly had not consented.  But in my view, on the
          evidence, and I thought the complainant was extremely fair in
          that regard, she said simply that even objectively a reasonable
          person looking at the consent as given would conclude that there
          was agreement to the activity.  In my view, even though it might,
          I suppose stretching the point, be some little bit of evidence as
          it may relate to consent which may be considered by a jury, in my
          view it is so minuscule, I don&#146;t mean to downgrade the act
          complained of, I mean minuscule as it applies to the evidence, it
          is such that no jury properly instructed could render a verdict
          of guilty under these circumstances to a charge of sexual
          intercourse without the consent of the complainant.   (Emphasis
          added)</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The Crown applied for an order of certiorari or mandamus in
respect of the offence arising from the act of sexual
intercourse.  Leitch J. granted the application, and ordered that
the appellant be committed to stand trial for rape in respect of
that act.  After setting out the portion of the preliminary
inquiry judge&#146;s reasons italicized above, Leitch J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the provincial judge conducting the preliminary
          inquiry in coming to this conclusion conducted an assessment of
          the factor of the relationship between the parties, and in so
          doing, he weighed and interpreted the evidence and therefore,
          conducted an analysis which I am satisfied exceeded his
          jurisdiction.  Accordingly, having concluded that there was a
          jurisdictional error committed by the judge conducting the
          preliminary inquiry with respect to the incident of sexual
          intercourse, I am satisfied that the Crown&#146;s application should
          succeed.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant appeals from the decision of Leitch J.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In this court, the appellant submitted that Leitch J. erred
in concluding that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the preliminary inquiry judge had erred in weighing the
          evidence adduced against the appellant; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)  the preliminary inquiry judge  had
          not  erred  in  holding  that  the  power  or
          authority imbalance between the parties was a
          factor   to   be  considered  in  determining
          whether the complainant had consented to  the
          act of sexual intercourse.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In support of his first submission, the appellant argued
that the preliminary inquiry judge, rather than improperly
weighing the evidence, had simply sought to form an opinion
whether or not there was sufficient evidence upon which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could convict:  United States
of America v. Sheppard (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (S.C.C.) at
427.  We do not agree.  In our view, in performing the exercise
described in the italicized portion of his reasons above, the
preliminary inquiry judge was impermissibly engaging in an
assessment of the weight of the complainant&#146;s evidence, and
Leitch J. was correct in concluding that he had thereby exceeded
his jurisdiction: Re Skogman and the Queen (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d)
161 (S.C.C.) at 173-174.
[8]  In support of his second submission,  the appellant noted
that the Crown had acknowledged that the proper charge in respect
of the act of sexual intercourse in 1980 should have been rape,
not sexual assault.  He argued that the preliminary inquiry judge
had appropriately considered whether there was sufficient
evidence of lack of consent to warrant a committal on the charge
of rape, as that offence was understood in 1980, and had
appropriately determined that there was not such sufficient
evidence.  In particular, the appellant submitted that the
circumstances that may vitiate consent to an act of sexual
assault set out in ss. 265(3)(d) and 273.1(2)(c) of the Criminal
Code (which came into force subsequent to 1980) were not
recognized as vitiating consent to a charge of rape in 1980 and
that the preliminary inquiry judge was thus in error in reaching
the conclusion he did.
[9]  We do not accept this submission.  We note that there is
some authority for the view of the law as understood by the
preliminary inquiry judge and by Leitch J.: see R. v. Audet
(1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 493; R. v. Matheson
(1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 289, ¶56 ff.  In any event, we agree with
Leitch J. that the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry judge on
this issue was a question of law that did not go to jurisdiction
and was not reviewable on certiorari: Dubois v. The Queen (1986),
25 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (S.C.C.) at 224.
[10] While the foregoing is sufficient to dismiss this appeal, we
feel that we should comment upon an alternative submission made
by the Crown that, regardless of our disposition of this appeal,
it was and still is open to the Crown, pursuant to s. 574 of the
Code, to prefer an indictment against the appellant on a charge
of rape.  The appellant was never charged with, or discharged on,
that offence and, as noted, the preliminary inquiry judge refused
to commit him for trial for any offence in relation to the act of
sexual intercourse.  We are inclined to agree with the Crown
that, having regard to the language of ss. 574(1)(b) and 577(b)
of the Code, an indictment on the charge of rape could be
preferred against the appellant without the necessity of
obtaining the consent of the Attorney General.  However, in light
of our determination that the appeal from the order of Leitch J.
must be dismissed, it is not necessary for us to express any
concluded view on the Crown&#146;s alternative submission.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appeal is dismissed.
