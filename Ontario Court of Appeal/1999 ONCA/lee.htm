COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            THE CHRISTIE CORPORATION (Appellant/Plaintiff) v.

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The defendant moved under R.24.01(1)(c) to dismiss the
action for delay on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to
set the action down for trial within six months after the close
of pleadings.  The pleadings were closed on April 1, 1997, which
meant that the plaintiff was required to set the action down for
trial by October 1, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On January 23, 1998, when the defendant moved to dismiss the
action for delay, the delay in failing to set the action down for
trial was almost four months.  The motions judge granted the
order and dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s claim.

[3]  In doing so, he appears to have been influenced by the
period of time that had elapsed since the plaintiff commenced
this reasonably straightforward action on April 17, 1991 for
damages for breach of a contract of purchase and sale of a
condominium and prejudice alleged by the defendant based on the
state of his health.

[4]  In some cases, under Rule 24, it will be appropriate to
consider the time elapsed from the time an action was commenced
in considering the reasonableness of the delay relied on by the
defendant.   In the circumstances of this case, however, it is
our view that the motions judge erred in principle in placing
undue weight on this factor.

[5]  In this appeal, nothing really happened until February and
March, 1996, after the plaintiff had obtained a new lawyer, by
which time the defendant had not delivered a statement of
defence, and the plaintiff had not demanded that he do so.  The
plaintiff had taken no steps to obtain a default judgment.
However, subsequent to this time the parties&#146; counsel entered
into settlement negotiations which, by the end of the summer of
1996, proved to be unsuccessful.

[6]  In early January, 1997, the defendant obtained a new lawyer,
who, on January 29, 1997, gave his client&#146;s consent to the
amendment of the statement of claim to increase the amount of
damages claimed.  This finally produced a statement of defence
and counterclaim, resulting in the close of pleadings on April 1,
1997.  If it may be considered that there had been an
unreasonable delay up to this time, it was excused by the
defendant when he consented to the amendment of the statement of
claim.  In our view, in these circumstances, at the earliest, the
operative delay commenced on January 29, 1997.  It follows, that
the motions judge, in the exercise of his discretion, erred in
principle in considering that the operative delay began when the
action was commenced.

[7]  There are many cases which have discussed the factors to be
considered by the court on a Rule 24 motion.  It is unnecessary
to review the principles found in them, which have been
summarized in Belanger v. Southwestern Insulation Contractors
Ltd. (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 457 at 470-2 (Gen. Div.).  As the
starting point for the delay was April 1, 1997, and as the actual
delay was slightly less than four months, it is our view, on the
basis of the authorities, even if we were to take into account
what occurred before April 1, 1997, the delay was not
unreasonable and that the claim should not have been dismissed.
In this regard, it is significant that the evidence in respect to
the claim and the defence is largely documentary and not based on
the recollection of individuals.

[8]  In the circumstances, we do not have to consider the
appellant&#146;s motion for leave to introduce fresh evidence.  Nor do
we have to consider the appellant&#146;s position with respect to the
defendant&#146;s failure to deliver an affidavit of documents.

[9]  The appeal is allowed and the order of Grossi J. is set
aside on the following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.        The plaintiff must set the action down
               for trial by February 26, 1999.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   Examinations for discovery, if any,
               are to be completed by April 30, 1999.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The pre-trial conference is to be
               held by May 31, 1999, assuming this can
               be arranged with the court.
