    <pre>HEARD:         March 8 and 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raises three issues on this appeal.  First,
that the trial judge erred in his assessment of damages because
of his choice of depreciation rate.  In our view, there was a
satisfactory evidentiary basis for his finding in this regard.
There was no palpable error in his finding and we would dismiss
this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Second, the appellant argues that the finding of ostensible
authority ought not to stand.  Again, in our view there was ample
evidence to permit the finding that Case Credit cloaked the
dealership and its employee Mr. Prosser with ostensible authority
to act as its agent.  This ground of appeal must fail.

[3]  Third, the appellant argues that the claim-over by Case
Canada against the dealership and Mr. Gowland personally must
fail.  In our view, the claim-over against the dealership is
properly made.  Its relationship with Case Canada makes it
responsible to Case Canada for the erroneous representation of
Mr. Prosser.  However, in our view the trial judge erred in
allowing the claim-over against Mr. Gowland personally.  There is
no evidence that he made any misrepresentation to the plaintiff
nor is there the kind of finding in fraud or other improper
conduct that would allow the piercing of the corporate veil to
make Mr. Gowland personally responsible for the dealership's
obligation to Case Canada.

[4]  In this respect only the appeal is allowed.

[5]  The plaintiff respondent is entitled to his costs as against
the Gowland Corporation.  There will be no other order as to
costs.</pre></td>
