    <pre>On Appeal from Karam J. dated October 2, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff has appealed the judgment of Karam J.
dismissing his claim for damages for injuries he sustained in a
snowmobile accident.
[2]  The accident occurred when the plaintiff&#146;s snowmobile struck
a switch on an abandoned railbed owned by the Ontario Northland
Transportation Commission, throwing him from the snowmobile and
causing serious injuries.  The plaintiff&#146;s claim was based on the
duty of an occupier under the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.O.2, and, in the alternative, on a common law duty of
care which it was submitted the defendant owed the plaintiff.
[3]  The trial judge dismissed the claim on the basis that the
defendant was not an occupier of the railbed within the meaning
of the Act, and that it was not in breach of any common law duty
of care to the plaintiff.  In addition, although unnecessary for
the result he reached, he found that the accident was caused by
the plaintiff&#146;s &#147;negligence only, in failing to first determine
whether there was sufficient snow to use the railbed&#148;, with the
result that he &#147;was the author of his own misfortune&#148;.
[4]  Counsel for the appellant submitted that Karam J. erred in
respect to the grounds on which he dismissed the appellant&#146;s
claim.
[5]  In our view, the trial judge was correct in holding that
there was no occupier&#146;s duty of care owed to the plaintiff.
&#147;Occupier&#148; is defined in s.1 of the Act, and provides that a
person is an occupier if the person:</pre>
    <pre>    is in physical possession of the premises,</pre>
    <pre>    has responsibility for and control over the condition of the
  premises,</pre>
    <pre>    has responsibility for and control over the activities
  carried on on the premises, or</pre>
    <pre>    has control over persons allowed to enter the premises.</pre>
    <pre>For the purposes of this appeal, the railbed constitutes &#147;the
premises&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Karam J. found, correctly in our view, that there was no
evidence that established that the defendant met any of the four
branches of the definition of occupier.
[7]  In the alternative, it was the plaintiff&#146;s position that if
the defendant was not an occupier of the railbed within the
meaning of the Act, it owed him a common law duty of care to warn
him of the potential danger to snowmobilers driving on the
railbed created by the presence of the switch.
[8]  In our view, Karam J. correctly found, in the circumstances
of this appeal, that the defendant was under no duty to warn the
plaintiff of such a risk.  Moreover, the plaintiff was an
experienced snowmobiler.  As recognized by s.22 of the Motorized
Snow Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.44, snowmobiling is an
inherently dangerous sport.  The presence of the switch was
visible to other members of the plaintiff&#146;s group, almost all of
whom took precautions by driving around it.  This was a risk,
given the small amount of snow cover, that was self-evident.  As
this court has held, there is no duty to warn of dangers which
are self-evident:  Alchimowicz v. Schram, [1999] O.J. No. 115.
[9]  In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the
appellant&#146;s submission that Karam J. erred in finding that the
plaintiff was the author of his own misfortune.
[10] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
