    <pre>On appeal from the order of Madam Justice Himel dated
January 21, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The parties were divorced in 1994.  They settled
their support obligations by way of an agreement.
The agreement provided support for a fixed period of
time for the appellant. The agreement further
provided:</pre>
    <pre>               There shall be no variation of the quantum or
          duration and no change, however catastrophic in the
          [Appellant&#146;s] health or finances shall entitle the
          [Appellant] to move [before] the court for continued
          support or increased support.  Nor shall the
          [Respondent] be able to vary, even if there is a
          material downward change in her finances.
          </pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent made the required payments throughout the
term of the agreement.  When no further payments were
required under the agreement, the appellant applied
for a variation of the agreement and an order
requiring the respondent to continue making the
payments.
[3]  The respondent brought a motion to have the
appellant&#146;s counsel disqualified as she took the
position that the appellant&#146;s counsel would be a
witness on the trial in relation to the requested
variation.  The motion judge agreed and removed
counsel from the record.
[4]  The appellant does not take issue with the terms
of the agreement signed between himself and the
respondent.  He does not suggest that he did not
understand that agreement, and he does not suggest
that he had anything other than full and proper legal
advice.  He bases his claim for variation exclusively
on the common law power to vary an agreement where
there has been an unforeseeable radical change in
circumstances.  It is his position that his continued
inability to support himself after the payments
called for under the agreement had been made
constituted a radical change in circumstances.
[5]  The parties agree, and we will assume, that the
appellant&#146;s state of mind when he signed the
agreement and, in particular,
his view of his future prospects is relevant on the
variation application.  The appellant testified on
his discovery that he had no recollection of what he
foresaw with respect to his future prospects when he
signed the agreement.
[6]  The appellant does not rely on anything said to
him by his counsel to support this position that
there has been an unforeseeable radical change in
circumstances.  Nor has he put in issue the advice he
received from his counsel.  In our view, the
conversations between the appellant and his lawyer
for the purpose of giving and receiving legal advice
are privileged and do not lose that status simply
because they related to an issue, the appellant&#146;s
state of mind, which is relevant to the litigation.
[7]  Neither the fact that the lawyer may have
relevant evidence to give on the variation motion,
nor the fact that the appellant apparently has no
recall of what he contemplated his future
circumstances to be when he signed the agreement,
make his communications with his lawyer compellable
evidence.  The former, that is the relevance of the
evidence, ignores the privilege which operates to
exclude relevant evidence.  The latter, the
appellant&#146;s apparent inability to recall his state of
mind when he signed the agreement, does not
constitute an implied waiver of the client-solicitor
privilege.
[8]  The appeal must be allowed, the order made below
is set aside.  The appellant is entitled to his costs
here and in the court below.</pre></td>
