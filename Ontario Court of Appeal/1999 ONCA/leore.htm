COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            JOHN EDWARD LEORE, carrying on business as CANORE
               CONSTRUCTION (Appellant/Plaintiff) v. EDWARD J.
               RIDDOCH and SHERRY RIDDOCH
               (Respondents/Defendants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        Finlayson, Labrosse and Feldman JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       C. Rutter
               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               D. Peter Best
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 7, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was a builder and should have insisted for his
own protection, and that of his clients, that a written contract
be entered into between the parties.  Not only did he not do so,
he refused to execute a contract proffered by the respondents and
was not forthcoming about his reasons for refusing. He kept
inadequate records and did not obtain written instructions with
respect to extras.
[2]  The trial ended up as a contest of experts, each of whom
attempted to reconstruct what occurred during the building of the
residence.  The trial judge made certain findings of fact, made
an analysis of the reports of the experts and concluded that the
appellant had been overpaid. He gave judgment accordingly.  There
is no basis on which this court can, or should interfere.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.  The moneys paid into
court as security for costs are to be paid out with any
accumulated interest to the respondents&#146; solicitors.</pre>
