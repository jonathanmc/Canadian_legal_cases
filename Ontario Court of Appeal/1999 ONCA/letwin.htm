    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            MARIO LETWIN (Plaintiff (Appellant)) v. GORDON A.
               SNYDERS and 553562 ONTARIO LTD. carrying on
               business as BELL CARTAGE (Defendants
               (Respondents))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, ABELLA and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Peter Haney
               for the appellant</pre>

    <pre>               Orlin C. Wood
               for the respondent 553562 Ontario Ltd.</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 18, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Marshall dated June
19, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Counsel for the respondent Bell Cartage submitted before us
in oral argument that, properly interpreted, the exemption clause
meant that his client was liable to the extent of its road
insurance coverage.  We agree.
[2]  At trial, Bell Cartage testified that the limit of its road
insurance coverage was $5,000.00 and this amount was not then
challenged by the plaintiff.  Counsel for the appellant sought to
dispute the limit of the coverage for the first time on appeal.
In our view, that issue should have been raised at trial and we
see no basis for doubting Bell Cartage&#146;s sworn evidence on this
subject.
[3]  We allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of Marshall J.,
and substitute an order:  a) awarding the appellant $5,000.00
plus pre-judgment interest and costs to and including the trial,
payable by Bell Cartage,  b) dismissing the action against
Snyders with costs to and including the trial on a solicitor and
client basis payable by Bell Cartage.  We make no order as to
costs of the appeal for or against any party.
