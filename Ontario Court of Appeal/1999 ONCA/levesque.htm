    <pre>On appeal from the conviction dated July 2, 1998 and sentence
dated September 9, 1998 by Poupore J., sitting with a jury.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was found guilty by a jury of sexual assault
and sexual interference.  The trial judge stayed the offence of
sexual interference and registered a conviction on the charge of
sexual assault.  The appellant was sentenced to eight months&#146;
imprisonment plus two years&#146; probation.  He appeals from
conviction and sentence.
[2]  The primary ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred
in failing to properly instruct the jury on the position of the
defence and that he further erred in failing to alert the jury to
the particular parts of the evidence that were significant to the
defence position.
[3]  Although the time frame in the indictment covered a period
from June 1, 1995 to September 30, 1995, the charges arose out of
a single incident alleged to have occurred in August, 1995 on a
night when the appellant was working as a disc jockey at an adult
dance held at the local legion.
[4]  According to the complainant, who was then 12 years old, on
the night in question, she and her friend L.B. left the
appellant&#146;s house where they had been babysitting and went to a
nearby beach.  The complainant testified that sometime between
12:00 and 12:30 a.m., the appellant arrived at the beach and
after going for a swim with L.B., he sat down beside the
complainant on a bench located outside a nearby boathouse.  It
was there, according to the complainant, that the appellant took
her hand and positioned it first on his inner thigh and then on
his exposed penis.  The complainant made no complaint at the
time.  She got up from the bench, told her friend that it was
getting cold and the two left.
[5]  It was not until some 1 ½ years later that the police first
spoke to the complainant about the incident.  Notably, the police
only became involved after being approached by the appellant and
his wife who were concerned about rumours being spread that the
appellant had sexually molested the complainant.
[6]  The appellant&#146;s defence at trial was alibi.  He testified
that on the night in question, he arrived at the legion at around
7:00 or 8:00 p.m. with two co-workers and that he and his co-
workers did not leave the legion until 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. the
following morning.  The appellant&#146;s evidence was confirmed by his
two co-workers who remembered the evening well because they were
being trained by the appellant to operate his disc jockey
equipment.
[7]  In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that the
position of the defence was that the appellant did not sexually
molest the complainant.  He made no mention of the fact that the
appellant was relying upon the defence of alibi and, more
importantly, he did not review the evidence at all, let alone
relate the salient features of it to the defence position.
[8]  While the case was a comparatively simple one in which the
issues were sharply defined, we nonetheless think that it was
incumbent upon the trial judge to review the significant parts of
the evidence and relate that evidence to the issues.  See:  R. v.
Yadollahi (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 478 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v.
MacKinnon and Crooks (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 555 (Ont.
C.A.).
[9]  In coming to this conclusion, we note that the case against
the appellant was far from overwhelming.  There were a number of
deficiencies in the complainant&#146;s testimony and her evidence
stood alone against the appellant and his witnesses.  In these
circumstances, it cannot be said that the verdict would
inevitably have been the same had the trial judge properly
instructed the jury.
[10] The secondary ground of appeal relates to the Crown&#146;s
closing address to the jury.  In short, the appellant submits
that the closing address was inflammatory, contained inaccurate
statements about the evidence and invited the jury to speculate.
We do not find it necessary to review the various complaints in
detail.  Suffice it to say that we agree that Crown counsel&#146;s
address left much to be desired.  He engaged in excessive
rhetoric, frequently offered his opinion in an intemperate and
inflammatory manner and invited the jury to speculate about
various matters, the most egregious being his suggestion that the
appellant was having an affair with the complainant&#146;s friend L.B.
to explain in part why L.B. was not called as a Crown witness.
In view of our decision that there must a new trial, it is not
necessary to finally decide whether this ground of appeal
standing alone would warrant a new trial.
[11] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside and a new trial is ordered on both counts relating to the
complainant L.M.</pre></td>
