    <pre>On appeal from the judgment and the sreasons for judgment of

    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal from the
judgment of Klowak J. of July 31, 1998. We will deal with each of
these in turn.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s first challenge is to the basis upon which
the trial judge awarded damages for past and future loss of
income. In our view, there was a sufficient evidentiary
foundation for the trial judge to determine past and future
income loss on the basis of the plaintiff working 50 hours per
week. The same can be said of the use by the trial judge of a 25%
discount factor (but no more) to reflect inter alia the
plaintiff&#146;s health risks. On this score there was evidence to
permit the finding that the plaintiff could have continued
working at the TTC at some job, despite his heart attacks
suffered several years before trial.
[3]  While the trial judge does not address the issue of
mitigation expressly, her finding of the plaintiff&#146;s total and
continuing unemployability forecloses the appellant&#146;s argument
concerning failure to mitigate.
[4]  As to her finding of total disability, in our view this
finding was open to her on this record. There was evidence
sufficient to support it.
[5]  The appellant also challenges the award to Mary Lewis
pursuant to the Family Law Act. In our view, the impact on Ms.
Lewis of the injuries suffered by her husband was very
significant. The award is not so excessive as to warrant our
intervention.
[6]  The appellant also challenges the settlement made by the
plaintiff with the TTC. It argues that the settlement was
improvident, in failing to provide further disability benefits to
the plaintiff after trial. It further argues that the settlement
disentitles the plaintiff to recover any lost income post trial,
because that settlement required the plaintiff&#146;s resignation from
the TTC at that point.
[7]  In our view, the settlement cannot be said to be improvident
in either respect. The plaintiff&#146;s benefits had been terminated
and he had to sue to obtain this settlement which reinstituted
his disability benefits until trial. Moreover, the plaintiff
agreed to resign as a part of the overall compromise at a time
when he was totally disabled due to the accident and had little
prospect of returning to work. In the circumstances, therefore,
the settlement cannot be said to be improvident. Moreover, the
resignation which was part of the settlement really originated
with the accident. It did not originate with the settlement. It
cannot be the basis therefore for cutting off future income loss
due to the accident, since without the accident there would have
been no resignation. This ground of appeal fails.
[8]  Finally, the appellant argues that it should receive credit
under SEF No.44 for at least the $216,023.70 paid by the
Prudential Insurance Company to the plaintiff&#146;s mortgagee and to
the plaintiff. The plaintiff held a mortgage disability insurance
policy with Prudential on which Prudential refused to pay. The
plaintiff was required to sue on this policy and these payments
were made as a result. The final payment was made in final
settlement of this litigation.
[9]  The trial judge found that these payments could reasonably
reflect recovery by the plaintiff for losses consequential upon
Prudential failing to comply with its insurance contract, rather
than being simply the payment of disability benefits under that
policy. Hence the trial judge found that the appellant had not
discharged its onus to show that these payments should be
deducted pursuant to SEF No.44. We agree with this reasoning and
this ground of appeal must be dismissed.
[10] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
[11] As to the cross-appeal, we did not call on Mr. Percival.
Neither the deduction of 25% used by the trial judge for past and
future income loss nor her finding as to the plaintiff&#146;s
retirement age represent reversible error. Both were properly
founded in the evidence and do not result in a wholly erroneous
assessment of loss.
[12] The cross-appeal is dismissed, but in the circumstances
without costs.
