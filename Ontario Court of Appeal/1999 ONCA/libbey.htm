Overview</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  In January 1995, the respondent, Anne Hoy, an employment
standards officer, issued an order under s. 65(1)(c) of the
Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.14 (&quot;the Act&quot;)
compelling the appellant to pay unpaid vacation pay to its
employees in the amount of $1,304,255.41. That vacation pay
related to a time period when the employees were working for the
employer from whom the appellant purchased the business. The
appellant was also required to pay &quot;administrative costs&quot;
associated with Ms. Hoy's investigation in the amount of
$130,425.37. The appellant brought an application for judicial
review of the order claiming that the Ministry of Labour
(&quot;Ministry&quot;) and Ms. Hoy had abused their powers and acted in &quot;an
unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory manner.&quot; By order dated
October 30, 1995, the Divisional Court (Saunders J. dissenting)
dismissed that application.1 This court granted leave to appeal
from that order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Associate Chief Justice Morden made an order adding the
United Steelworkers of America as a party respondent. The United
Steelworkers of America is the successor union to the unions that
represented the employees at the time the pay order was made. The
Attorney General of Ontario has also intervened in support of the
respondents.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Positions of the Parties</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In early 1993, the appellant was considering purchasing a
bankrupt glassware manufacturing plant. The possible purchase and
subsequent investments involved a potential expenditure of some
$20 million. Before proceeding with an investment of that
magnitude, the appellant wanted to know the extent of its
potential liability for any money owed to the employees by the
bankrupt owner. It sought out the Ministry's position with
respect to its potential liability and in doing so made full and
accurate disclosure of all relevant facts. In a letter dated May
21, 1993 (&quot;the Jenkins' letter&quot;), the Ministry indicated that
according to its established policy, the appellant's liability
would be limited to about $27,000.00 of the $1.3 million of
vacation pay owed to the employees. Based on the Ministry's
representation, the appellant proceeded with the purchase and
further investments in the plant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant contends that after the purchase was
completed, the Ministry's interest changed from preserving the
business and related jobs to avoiding payment from a government
fund of the money owed to the employees. To serve this new
interest, the Ministry arbitrarily abandoned its existing policy
as reflected in the Jenkins' letter in favour of a diametrically
opposed one that shifted responsibility for payment of the $1.3
million to the appellant. The appellant goes on to argue that the
Ministry implemented this new policy to the detriment of the
appellant under the guise of an investigation made by Ms. Hoy
under the auspices of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The respondents contend that the representations made to the
appellant in the Jenkins' letter were no more than the author's
opinion on the appellant's potential liability for the unpaid
vacation pay owed to its employees. They further submit that Mr.
Jenkins made it clear that the appellant's ultimate liability
could only be determined under the procedures established by the
Act which provided for an independent investigation by an
employment standards officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  According to the respondents, Ms. Hoy was ultimately charged
with the responsibility of making that independent investigation.
In conducting her investigation, Ms. Hoy could not be bound by
any interpretation of the Act provided by a Ministry official.
The respondents submit that Ms. Hoy conducted her own
investigation and reached her own conclusion as to the
applicability of the Act to the facts as she found them to be.
The mere fact that Ms. Hoy's conclusion as to liability was
different from that set out in the Jenkins' letter does not mean
that the appellant was treated unfairly. Finally, the respondents
point out that the appellant is free to challenge the correctness
of Ms. Hoy's interpretation under the wide powers to review her
order established under the Act. They argue that the appellant
should first exhaust its statutory remedies before proceeding by
way of judicial review.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  There are two issues:
*    what was the effect of the Jenkins' letter?
*    if the Jenkins' letter, standing alone, did not preclude the
     order made by Ms. Hoy, does the conduct of the respondents,
     culminating in the pay order, amount to an abuse of process so as
     to compel the quashing of the order?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The first issue turns on the meaning to be given to the
Jenkins' letter and the applicability of the doctrine of
legitimate expectations. This issue was carefully canvassed in
the majority judgment (White J.) and the dissent (Saunders J.) in
the Divisional Court.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The second issue is fact-driven and turns on how one views
the events chronicled in the affidavits filed on the application
for judicial review. The appellant sees itself as the victim of a
arbitrary shift in Ministry policy motivated by a desire to
transfer a $1.3 million liability from a government fund to the
appellant. According to the appellant, this arbitrary shift in
policy took place after it was induced to make a substantial
investment in Ontario by the representation in the Jenkins'
letter. The respondents see the same events as evincing nothing
more than a proper functioning of the Act. From their
perspective, the evidence establishes that Ms. Hoy exercised the
statutory duties placed on her by the Act, conducted a proper
investigation and decided that the appellant was obliged to pay
the $1.3 million in unpaid vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The merits of the second issue raised on this appeal can
only be determined after a detailed examination of the evidence
filed on the judicial review application. That evidence comes
entirely from the appellant. Neither the Ministry nor Ms. Hoy
cross-examined on any of the affidavits filed by the appellant or
produced any evidence on the application.2</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] I begin with a detailed review of the evidence, proceed to a
consideration of the ground of appeal based on the Jenkins'
letter and conclude with an analysis of the abuse of process
claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Libbey-St. Clair Limited (&quot;LSC&quot;) operated a glassware
manufacturing plant in Wallaceburg, Ontario. It employed some 450
people and was the largest employer in the area. The plant had
been a mainstay of the Wallaceburg economy for years, but in
October 1992, LSC was placed into receivership by its secured
creditors. The receiver continued to operate the plant until
April 1993 when a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy was made.
The plant operations ceased and layoffs began. It was obvious
that the plant would close and the jobs would be lost unless a
purchaser could be found who was prepared to continue the
operation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Libbey Glass Inc. (Libbey) is an American company.3 Before
1993, it had no connection with LSC except that LSC was permitted
to use the Libbey brand name. Early in 1993, Libbey began
discussions with the receiver concerning the possible purchase of
the assets of LSC. In considering the commercial viability of the
purchase, Libbey focussed on three concerns :
*    stabilizing labour costs;
*    assuring itself that it would not be liable for wages or
     benefits accruing to employees under the former ownership; and
*    negotiating a reasonable purchase price.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] The first two concerns required the negotiation of new
collective agreements with the three unions that represented most
of the employees of LSC. A senior mediator from the Ministry
joined in those negotiations. By April 1, 1993, Libbey and the
unions, with the assistance of the Ministry mediator, had
negotiated new collective agreements which were to be effective
should Libbey proceed with the purchase of the assets of LSC.
Those agreements maintained wages at existing levels and provided
for somewhat smaller benefits packages. The unions also provided
broad releases in relation to any claims arising out of
employment prior to a purchase by Libbey. The unions specifically
agreed not to make any:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          claims for pay, notice of termination, pay in
          lieu of such notice, severance pay, overtime
          pay, interest, pension benefits, insurance or
          other benefits, and/or vacation pay and
          specifically including any claim under the
          Employment Standards Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15]  The union memberships ratified the agreements and, as will
be seen, lived up to those agreements until pressured to do
otherwise by Ms. Hoy and the Ministry in September 1994.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] Once Libbey reached a satisfactory agreement with the
unions, it turned its attention to the Ministry. LSC owed the
employees about $1.3 million in unpaid vacation pay as of the
date of the receivership. On Libbey's interpretation, the Act did
not impose any obligation on it to pay that amount if Libbey
purchased the assets. It was not prepared to proceed with the
purchase at the contemplated price ($12 million) if it was to be
held liable for the $1.3 million owed in unpaid vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Libbey's potential liability turned on s. 13(2) of the Act
which provides:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Where an employer sells a business to a
          purchaser who employs an employee of the
          employer, the employment of the employee
          shall be not be terminated by the sale, and
          the period of employment of the employee with
          the employer shall be deemed to have been
          employment with the purchaser for the
          purposes of Parts VII, VIII, XI and XIV.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Part VIII of the Act deals with vacation pay. Section 13(2)
does not directly address the potential liability of a purchaser
of a bankrupt business for vacation pay owed by the bankrupt. Its
application in that situation is a matter of interpretation and
Libbey was very anxious to know how the Ministry would interpret
the Act. It was made clear to the Ministry that this was a
crucial issue to Libbey. It was also clearly understood that the
employees were owed some $1.3 million in unpaid vacation pay. The
question Libbey wanted the Ministry to address was not whether
the employees were owed the money, but whether Libbey was
obligated to pay it to them if it purchased the plant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] Brian Smeenk, the solicitor for Libbey, set out Libbey's
concerns in a letter to the Ministry dated April 20, 1993:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In order to determine whether to proceed with
          the purchase of the assets of Libbey-St.
          Clair Limited and the operation of the
          Wallaceburg business, our client must
          determine whether it would have any liability
          for the vacation pay heretofore earned by
          employees of Libbey-St. Clair Limited. This
          question relates both to vacation pay which
          would normally have been payable prior to the
          closing date of the Purchase, as well as
          vacation pay earned prior to the Purchase but
          which would not normally become payable until
          later in 1993 or 1994.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is our view that the Purchaser under these
          circumstances is not liable for any such
          accrued vacation pay and the Unions are in
          agreement with this interpretation, however,
          our client requires confirmation from the
          Ministry as to whether or not it is in
          agreement with this interpretation of the
          Employment Standards Act. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Over the next month, Libbey met and corresponded with
Ministry officials. It provided all pertinent information to the
Ministry.4 On May 21, 1993, Mr. Peter Jenkins, an interpretation
specialist in the Policy and Appeal Branch of the Ministry,
responded to Libbey's request for &quot;confirmation&quot; of the
Ministry's position (the Jenkins' letter). Before providing this
confirmation, Mr. Jenkins had considered the material provided by
Libbey and consulted with the Legal Services Branch of the
Ministry. Copies of the Jenkins' letter were forwarded to the
Legal Services Branch and the Director of Employment Standards.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] I will reproduce almost the entirety of the Jenkins' letter
when I deal with the first ground of appeal. For present
purposes, it is sufficient to say that in the letter Mr. Jenkins
indicated that there was an established policy of the Employment
Practices Branch for determining liability for accrued vacation
pay in situations in which a bankrupt business was purchased and
the employees continued to be employed by the purchaser. Mr.
Jenkins referred to three possible dates on which the vacation
pay could become due. He then applied the established policy to
the facts of the proposed Libbey's purchase and concluded that
Libbey's liability would be approximately $27,000.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The &quot;policy&quot; of the Employment Standards Branch referred to
in the Jenkins' letter was set out in a memorandum issued to all
area directors, employment standards area managers and employment
standards officers in December 1992. Mr. Jenkins had prepared
that memorandum on behalf of the Ministry. The memorandum said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Where section 13 continuity is not broken for
          purposes of vacation pay, (i.e. there is not
          more than a 13 week lay-off), an employer
          which purchases a bankrupt business from a
          trustee will be liable for the vacation pay
          that accrued while the employee was working
          for the bankrupt employer. There are two
          qualifications to this principle: 1 - the
          vacation pay must not already have become due
          under the bankrupt employer, 2 - the
          purchaser must buy the business before the
          bankrupt employer becomes discharged under
          the Bankruptcy Act; (the bankrupt corporate
          employer becomes discharged under the B.A.
          when it debts are paid in full, which
          invariably never happens). Therefore, the
          officer may issue an order to pay against the
          purchaser of the business for vacation pay
          that accrued under the bankrupt company but
          did not become due until sometime when the
          employee was working for the purchaser.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The representation made in the Jenkins' letter was
consistent with the policy expressed in the memorandum of
December 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Armed with the releases that provided that the employees
would make no claim for vacation pay arising out of their
employment prior to Libbey's purchase, and the Ministry's
indication that according to its established policy, Libbey's
liability was limited to about $27,000.00, Libbey made the
purchase in June 1993. It paid $12,000,000.00 for the assets of
LSC. The purchase by Libbey kept the plant running and saved the
vast majority of the jobs that would have been lost had the plant
closed. In the 18 months following the purchase, Libbey added a
175 new employees, invested $8.5 million into the operation and
doubled the plant's exports.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] It was Libbey's unchallenged position that in negotiating
the price and deciding to proceed with the purchase, it relied on
both the unions' undertaking not to pursue any claims against it
under the Act and the Ministry's representation that, according
to its established policy, Libbey's liability for unpaid vacation
pay was approximately $27,000.00.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] When the purchase was completed in late June, it was
understood by Libbey, the receiver, the Ministry and the
employees that the employees5 were owed about $1.3 million in
unpaid vacation pay. The employees initially believed that the
receiver would pay all vacation pay owed by LSC. The receiver
subsequently said that it would pay only the vacation pay
obligations which arose after it was installed in October 1992.
The receiver took the position that the employees should look to
the Employee Wage Protection Program (&quot;the Program&quot;) for unpaid
vacation pay owed before October 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] The Program referred to by the receiver was established
under Part XIV.1 of the Act and provides for payment of unpaid
wages and other benefits, including vacation pay from a
government fund. Section 58.4 describes those employees who are
eligible for compensation from the fund. The decision whether
compensation should be given is left to the Program Administrator
or his/her delegate (s. 58.2(3)). If employees are compensated
under the Program, the Program Administrator is subrogated to all
claims the employees had for the amount paid from the Program and
may bring an action to recover that amount (s. 58.14).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Early in July 1993, representatives of the employees met
with Ministry officials, including Ms. Hoy, to discuss
compensation from the fund. Ms. Hoy and another official from the
Ministry confirmed that the employees were eligible for
compensation from the Program. She told the employees that this
was a simple case and that payment should come &quot;in record time.&quot;
Ms. Hoy suggested that the employees make a single claim to
facilitate the quick processing and payment to the employees. She
went on to tell the employees how to frame their request for
compensation from the fund. Acting on Ms. Hoy's instructions, the
employees directed a letter to her in these terms:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Please accept this request under the Ontario
          Wage Protection Fund, as our claim for unpaid
          Vacation monies owed to us by Libbey-St.
          Clair Inc. who have filed bankruptcy and have
          since been sold.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          You have in your possession the list of
          monies owed to all members... [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] It seems clear that Ms. Hoy was the person in the Ministry
delegated to deal with the employees' claim for compensation from
the Program. It seems equally clear that the &quot;claim&quot; referred
only to a claim for compensation from the Program. Ms. Hoy went
on to tell the representatives of the employees that they could
advise employees to expect payment by September 1993. She
indicated that each employee should sign a form showing the
amount owed to that employee. The representatives of the
employees informed Libbey that they had met with Ms. Hoy and had
been told that they qualified for compensation from the Program.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] The necessary forms were not completed until September 1993.
On October 28, 1993, Mr. Foster, the president of one of the
unions, spoke to Ms. Hoy and asked when the employees might
expect to receive payment. Ms. Hoy said that the cheques should
be available to the employees by the end of November. She did not
suggest that anything had occurred to change her mind as to the
employees' entitlement to compensation from the Program.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] On November 23rd, Mr. Foster received word from his local
member of the Legislature that the employees' claims had been
approved and were awaiting the signature of the Deputy Minister.
This source also confirmed Ms. Hoy's earlier advice that the
cheques would be available by the end of November.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] I pause in the narrative to deal with a submission made by
counsel for the Ministry. He submitted that the appellant's
evidence that the claim had been approved and the matter had
found its way to the Deputy Minister's office should be rejected
as double hearsay. Clearly, Mr. Foster or his member of the
Legislature are not the best source of information as to what was
going on inside the Ministry. It is, however, the only
information available as the respondents did not see fit to
adduce any evidence. I am not prepared to dismiss Mr. Foster's
sworn statement. It is some evidence of the status of the claim
for compensation from the Program in late November 1993. When
considered along with the unchallenged evidence of Ms. Hoy's
statements, it is also evidence that Ms. Hoy, who was apparently
responsible for determining whether funds should be advanced from
the Program, had made her decision and passed the matter on to
the Deputy Minister's office. The relevant provisions of the Act
do not appear to give the Deputy Minister any role in deciding
whether the Program should compensate employees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Ms. Hoy wrote to Libbey and the union representatives on
December 15, 1993. She indicated that her &quot;investigation&quot; of the
claim for vacation pay filed against LSC had led her to conclude
that the employees were owed vacation pay, but that she was
unable to say who owed that money to them. Ms. Hoy indicated that
she was inclined to recommend that a referee be appointed to
determine that question. This was the first hint that Ms. Hoy had
been engaged in any &quot;investigation&quot;. Her statement that as of
December 15th, her investigation had only enabled her to conclude
that the employees were &quot;in fact owed&quot; unpaid vacation pay is
somewhat startling in that no one ever suggested that the
employees were not owed the unpaid vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Ms. Hoy's letter came as a surprise to both the employees
and Libbey. The employees had been assured that their claim
against the Program was meritorious and straightforward. They
were unaware of any &quot;investigation&quot; and were anxiously awaiting
the cheques which had been promised to them by Ms. Hoy for five
months. Libbey had no idea that there was any controversy about
the employees' entitlement to payment from the Program or that
Ms. Hoy had purported to undertake an &quot;investigation&quot; to
determine who was responsible to pay the unpaid vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] There is nothing in the record that explains Ms. Hoy's
dramatic change of position in December 1993. There is no
evidence of any investigation she had conducted up to that time
and no evidence that she had received information that was
different in any way from that available to her in July and
October 1993 when she had assured the employees that they would
be compensated from the Program and that payment would be made in
short order.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] Libbey resisted Ms. Hoy's suggestion that a referee be
appointed to determine who was liable for the unpaid vacation
pay. Libbey based its resistance in part on the fact that no
claim had been made against it by the employees. Ms. Hoy took the
position that liability for the unpaid vacation pay under the Act
was unclear.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] On June 15, 1994, Ms. Hoy wrote to Libbey. In that letter,
she summarized her understanding of the collective agreements and
the results of certain interviews she had conducted with
employees. As I read her letter, Ms. Hoy interpreted the
collective agreements as providing that vacation pay was due in
the year that the vacation was taken, but she interpreted the
information supplied by the employees as indicating that LSC had
not actually paid the vacation pay until the year after the
vacation was earned. She concluded:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It would appear the outstanding vacation pay
          was due after the sale and as such the
          purchaser [Libbey] may be liable for payment
          of the outstanding vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] It would seem that Ms. Hoy was of the opinion that, despite
the terms of the collective agreements, the vacation pay was due
after the sale.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Libbey responded to Ms. Hoy's letter with a detailed summary
of the history of the matter. In that letter, Libbey referred to
the Jenkins' letter and the importance of the representations
made in that letter to its decision to proceed with the purchase.
Libbey pointed out that Mr. Jenkins had examined the same
collective agreements that Ms. Hoy had apparently examined. The
letter went on to say:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It can be seen from the above that the
          Purchaser was quite clearly advised that
          under these Collective Agreements the
          vacation pay became due &quot;at the end of the
          year for which the vacation is given.&quot; In
          your letter dated June 15, 1994, you are
          taking a contrary view, based on the same
          Collective Agreement provisions, that the
          outstanding vacation pay was due after the
          sale.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In our submission, Mr. Jenkins'
          interpretation is correct and in any event
          was relied upon by our client and is binding
          on Ministry in the circumstances of this
          case. In any event, there is no reason to now
          take a different approach.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] Ms. Hoy advised Libbey that the position that the Jenkins'
letter could not bind her as she had the duty under the Act to
make her own investigation and come to her own conclusion as to
liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] In September 1994, Ms. Hoy wrote to Libbey indicating that
she had decided that it was unnecessary to appoint a referee and
that she had reached the &quot;preliminary opinion&quot; that Libbey was
responsible for the unpaid vacation pay under s. 13(2) of the
Act. She said she would &quot;continue her investigation.&quot; In that
same letter under the heading &quot;Nature of Filed Claims With
Employment Standards&quot;, Ms. Hoy stated:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Wallaceburg Local 6-235-G, Aluminum, Brick
          and Glassworkers International Union
          requested, on behalf of its members, that
          claims be investigated as to their
          entitlement to unpaid vacation moneys owed by
          Libbey-St. Clair Inc., a bankrupt, which has
          since been sold. The claim was submitted
          after June 15, 1993 [the date when Libbey
          purchased the assets]. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] This is a misleading description of the only &quot;claim&quot; made by
the employees. That claim was prepared at Ms. Hoy's direction in
July 1993 and was a request for payment from the Program. Ms. Hoy
also did not advise Libbey that she had initially told the
employees that they would be compensated from the Program in
&quot;record time&quot; or that she had stood by that position for at least
four months. Furthermore, she gave no indication why she had
changed her mind and purported to embark on an inquiry to
determine who was responsible to pay the unpaid vacation pay.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] Three days after Ms. Hoy wrote to Libbey purporting to have
made certain preliminary findings following an investigation of a
claim made by the employees, Ms. Hoy and Mr. Andrew Steep, a
lawyer with the Employment Practices Branch of the Ministry, met
with Mr. Foster, a representative of the employees. Mr. Steep,
the lawyer from the Ministry, did most of the talking although
Ms. Hoy confirmed certain points. Mr. Steep did not speak like
someone engaged in a non-partisan &quot;investigation.&quot; According to
Mr. Foster's uncontradicted evidence, Mr. Steep said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... His office felt that they could get the
          Purchaser to pay the outstanding vacation pay
          owed to the former employees of LSC. He
          stated that the Ministry felt it could prove
          that the Purchaser owed the vacation pay
          under Canadian successor rights laws. He
          stated that if &quot;those Americans&quot;, referring
          to the owners of the Purchaser, think they
          can come in here and buy a Canadian company,
          the Ministry was going to show them what
          Canadian law is all about. They would force
          the Purchaser to pay these claims. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] Counsel for the Ministry would have the court dismiss these
comments as thoughtless utterances made in the heat of the
moment. I cannot do that. Mr. Steep did not seek to explain his
comments.6 I see no reason why Mr. Steep should not be taken as
having meant exactly what he said. The Ministry had decided to
&quot;force&quot; Libbey to pay the claims and to &quot;show them what Canadian
law is all about.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] Mr. Steep told Mr. Foster that the Ministry's case against
Libbey would be strengthened if Mr. Foster would write to the
Ministry stating that his original claim was a claim against
Libbey as well as LSC and that the employees took the position
that Libbey was also responsible for the unpaid vacation pay. Mr.
Steep asked Mr. Foster to specifically indicate that the claim
was made against Libbey as well as LSC.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] Mr. Foster was in a difficult position. He wanted the
employees paid the money owed to them, but he was also aware of
the unions' promise not to make any claim against Libbey. After
thinking the matter over, Mr. Foster wrote to the Ministry on
September 19 indicating that the original claim against the wage
protection fund was intended to include not only LSC, &quot;but also
any other party who may be liable under the eyes of the
Ministry.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Libbey met with Ms. Hoy and Mr. Steep about a month after
Mr. Foster had been pressured to amend the claim. Libbey pressed
for copies of any complaints that had been made by the employees
and asked whether the Ministry requested that the employees
include Libbey in their claim. Ms. Hoy and Mr. Steep, apparently
referring to their meeting with Mr. Foster and his subsequent
letter, said that the employees had &quot;clarified&quot; their initial
claim.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Troubled by these events, Mr. Smeenk spoke with Mr. Mac
Hassan, Ms. Hoy's supervisor. In his uncontradicted evidence, Mr.
Smeenk indicates that Mr. Hassan said that the Ministry had
previously been sympathetic to Libbey, but was now facing a large
claim against the Wage Protection Program and that Ministry
officials felt that they should take every avenue open to them to
pursue other possible sources to pay the claim instead of paying
it out of a government fund. Mr. Hassan refused to provide Libbey
with copies of any claims that had been made by the employees.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] On December 23, 1994, Ms. Hoy wrote to Libbey confirming her
&quot;preliminary determination&quot; that Libbey was liable for the unpaid
vacation pay in the amount of $1,304,253.71. She finalized that
&quot;preliminary determination&quot; in the order issued in January 1995.
In the narrative accompanying that order, Ms. Hoy based her
decision that Libbey was responsible for the unpaid vacation pay
on s. 64(2) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2.
This is the first reference in any of the material to that Act.
There is no suggestion in the narrative that Ms. Hoy was basing
her decision either on the wording of the collective agreements
or on information provided by the employees concerning how they
had been paid vacation pay by LSC. Ms. Hoy offers no reason for
departing from the established policy with respect to the effect
of s. 13(2) of the Act where the former employer is bankrupt.
Indeed, she makes no mention of s. 13(2) in her narrative.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] Attempts by Libbey and the Ministry to reach some settlement
of the matter failed and the application for judicial review was
commenced in March 1995.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">The Grounds of Appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">A: The Jenkins' Letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(i)  The Contents of the Letter</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] The relevant parts of the Jenkins' letter are set out below.
I have numbered the paragraphs for convenient reference:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [1] A determination as to whether or not the
          terms of employment contained in a collective
          agreement regarding vacation pay constitute a
          &quot;greater right or benefit&quot; pursuant to
          section 4 of the Employment Standards Act is
          one that is made by an employment standards
          officer during an investigation of a claim.
          Since Mr. Nax Nagalingam, Area Manager in our
          London office, has informed me that no claims
          for vacation pay have been filed by the
          employees or the union in connection with the
          above-noted matter, it is not possible at
          this time for the Ministry to make a decision
          on this issue. Furthermore, even if claims
          were to be filed and an officer to conduct an
          investigation that concluded that section 4
          of the E.S.A. did apply, an employee would
          have a right of appeal to an adjudicator
          under section 67 of the E.S.A. and the
          adjudicator may determine that the officer's
          decision was incorrect. ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [2] As mentioned earlier, it is the policy of
          the Employment Practices Branch that an
          employer which purchases a bankrupt business
          from a trustee in bankruptcy will be liable
          for any vacation pay which has accrued prior
          to the sale if that vacation pay has not
          already become due prior to the sale.
          Vacation pay becomes due at the earliest of
          three events - 1) within 7 days of
          termination of employment, 2) at the end of
          the ten month period following the year for
          which the vacation is given, and 3) when the
          vacation pay becomes due under the contract
          of employment (in this case, at the end of
          the year for which the vacation is given).
          Where there is a sale of a business within
          the meaning of section 13 of the E.S.A. and
          the employees accept employment with the
          purchaser of the business, the employees are
          not considered to be terminated for purposes
          of the E.S.A. Therefore, in this situation,
          the earliest of the three events for the
          coming due of vacation pay is the expiry of
          the year for which the vacation is given.
          From the chart you have provided with your
          letter of April 29, 1993, it is my
          understanding that, if the sale occurs
          between now and July 1993, and given the
          receiver's stated commitment to pay V.P.
          accrued between Oct. 5 and the date of the
          sale, the amount of vacation pay liability
          inherited by the purchaser, your client,
          after the receiver's payment, would be as
          follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Hourly employees    -    Nil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Salaried employees  -    $27,000.00 (approx.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [3] As you can see, given the above, the
          overall vacation pay liability of the
          purchaser is quite small indeed, especially
          when considered in the context of the size of
          the purchase. I would, however, reiterate
          that a determination of the matter could only
          be made after an investigation by an
          employment standards officer.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Please feel free to call me if you have any
          further questions or comments. ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] The first paragraph of the letter is directed to the
possibility that the new collective agreements proposed between
Libbey and the unions could be seen as contravening s. 3 of the
Act in that they purported to contract out of employment
standards set by the Act. Mr. Jenkins said that the applicability
of ss. 3 and 4 of the Act could only be determined after an
investigation by an employment standards officer of a complaint
made by an employee. He further indicated that any decision made
by the employment standards officer would be subject to appeal to
a referee. Ms. Hoy's eventual determination that Libbey was
responsible for the unpaid vacation pay did not turn on ss. 3 and
4 of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] Paragraph 2 of the letter sets out the Ministry's
established policy with respect to the liability of a purchaser
of a bankrupt business for unpaid vacation pay of employees who
are employed by the purchaser. The paragraph also indicates how
that policy would be applied in these circumstances and provides
an indication of Libbey's liability (approximately $27,000.00)
based on the application of the established policy to this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] The third paragraph makes reference to the relatively small
liability to which Libbey was exposed and concludes with this
caveat:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A determination of the matter could only be
          made after an investigation by an employment
          standards officer.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(ii) The Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] As the judgments in the Divisional Court and the arguments
of counsel here demonstrate, the applicability of the doctrine of
reasonable expectations raises two related questions:
*    can the doctrine be applied to foreclose a pay order that
     conflicts with the representation made in the Jenkins' letter?
*    if the doctrine of reasonable expectations can be applied to
foreclose the pay order, does the Jenkins' letter provide a
proper basis upon which to invoke the doctrine?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] The first question addresses the scope of the doctrine in
Canadian administrative law. The second turns on the actual
language of the letter and the criteria that must exist before
the doctrine operates. In my opinion, the doctrine cannot apply
to foreclose an investigation and order by an employment
standards officer under s. 65(1)(c) of the Act and, in any event,
the Jenkins' letter could not trigger the application of the
doctrine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(a)  The scope of the doctrine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] In Canada, the legitimate expectations doctrine has been
regarded as an aspect of procedural due process and not a source
of substantive rights. Where applicable, it gives a party a right
to certain procedural protections governing the manner in which a
public authority renders a decision affecting that party. The
doctrine does not compel a particular decision: Reference Re
Canada Assistance Plan (Canada) (1971), 83 D.L.R. (4th) 297 at
319 (S.C.C.); Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) (1996), 207 N.R. 57 at 67-8 (FED. C.A.), on reserve
in S.C.C.; D. Mullan, Administrative Law 3rd Ed. (1995) 213-218.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] Libbey's claim is not directed at any procedural manner.
Libbey relies on the doctrine to the create a substantive right
to have a statutory power of decision-making exercised in a
specific way to achieve a specific result. Libbey's claim is what
some English authors refer to as &quot;a substantive fairness&quot; claim.
One author explains substantive fairness in this way:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... the court cannot through the doctrine of
          legitimate expectation require a body to do
          what is prohibited by statute or confer upon
          it a power which statute has not given it.
          But it can use the doctrine to condition the
          way in which a power which undoubtedly exists
          will be exercised.7</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] This court's ability to embrace the substantive fairness
aspect of the doctrine is doubtful given the language in
Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan (Canada), supra. In any
event, even if the concept of substantive fairness can be
invoked, it does not reach this situation. I see two
insurmountable hurdles barring its application to this case.
First, nothing in the Act empowers the Ministry to set policies
which will be determinative of claims made under the Act. To the
contrary, the Act contemplates an individualized adjudicative
assessment of those claims by adjudicators specifically assigned
that task under the Act. The doctrine of reasonable expectations
cannot circumvent an adjudicative process established under the
Act for the determination of claims such as claims for unpaid
vacation pay. Second, unlike the tax cases in which the
substantive fairness doctrine has developed in English
jurisprudence, the interests at stake here are not only those of
the state and the party to whom the state made the
representation. Third parties, in this case the employees, have a
direct interest in the matter to which the representation was
directed. It is the employees and not the state who are entitled
to unpaid vacation pay. It is one thing to suggest that the state
may be foreclosed from collecting a tax based on a representation
made by the state to the taxpayer and quite another to suggest
that employees may be foreclosed from legitimate claims to unpaid
vacation pay based on representations made by the state to an
employer. The employees' claims for unpaid vacation pay can no
more be erased by the Ministry's representation than could the
duty to pay such a claim be imposed on an employer by a
representation made to the employees. Under the Act, claims like
those in issue here are to be resolved by an adjudicative process
in which all affected parties have an opportunity to participate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(b)  The application of the doctrine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Assuming that the doctrine could apply to foreclose the
making of a pay order, I am satisfied that the conditions
precedent to the operation of the doctrine do not exist.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] The doctrine of reasonable expectations in administrative
law is founded on notions of fairness. Broadly speaking, those
who deal with government bodies and agencies entrusted with the
authority to wield power for the public good should be able to
rely on representations made to them by those bodies and agencies
and to govern their affairs accordingly. In some circumstances,
the court will intervene by way of judicial review where a public
authority attempts to resile from a representation to the
detriment of someone who has relied on that representation.
Judicial intervention is, however, limited to cases where the
unfairness is manifest. As Lord Justice Bingham said in R. v.
Board of Inland Revenue Ex Parte M.F.K., [1990] 1 All E.R. 91 at
110-11:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... If a public authority so conducts itself
          as to create a legitimate expectation that a
          certain course will be followed it would
          often be unfair if the authority were
          permitted to follow a different course to the
          detriment of one who entertained the
          expectation, particularly if he acted on it.
          If in private law a body would be in breach
          of contract in so acting or estopped from so
          acting a public authority should generally be
          in no better position. The doctrine of
          legitimate expectation is rooted in fairness.
          But fairness is not a one way street. It
          imports the notion of equitableness, of fair
          and open dealing, to which the authority is
          as much entitled as the citizen. The
          Revenue's discretion, while it exists, is
          limited. Fairness requires that its exercise
          should be on a basis of full disclosure.
          Counsel for the applicants accepted that it
          would not be reasonable for a representee to
          rely on an unclear or equivocal
          representation. Nor I think on such facts as
          the present, would it be fair to hold the
          Revenue bound by anything less than a clear,
          unambiguous and unqualified representation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] The fairness inquiry required by the reasonable expectations
doctrine is fact-specific and cannot be reduced to an arithmetic
formula: R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioner's Ex Parte Unilever,
[1996] S.T.C. 681 at 694-95 (C.A.). The considerations identified
by Lord Justice Bingham, however, may be usefully applied here.
He identifies full disclosure by the party seeking the
representation, a clear and unequivocal representation by the
government authority, and detrimental reliance on that
representation by the party seeking it as three touchstones of
the fairness inquiry. I have no difficulty in concluding that
Libbey made full disclosure to the Ministry and relied, to its
detriment, on the Ministry's representation concerning its
applicable policy and the effect that policy would have on
Libbey's liability should it proceed with the purchase.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] I do, however, have considerable difficulty in
characterizing the representation made in the Jenkins' letter as
&quot;clear, unambiguous and unqualified.&quot; The first paragraph of the
letter describes a complaint process in some detail and makes it
clear that if that process is initiated, Libbey's liability will
ultimately be decided through an adjudicative process involving
one and perhaps two levels of adjudication.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] Even if paragraph 1 is read narrowly as referable only to a
complaint based on s. 3 of the Act, the third paragraph of the
letter concludes with the clear caution that &quot;a determination of
the matter could only be made after an investigation by an
employment standards officer.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] This caution is addressed to the &quot;matter&quot; discussed in the
letter. That &quot;matter&quot; was Libbey's liability for unpaid vacation
pay. I cannot read the qualification in paragraph 3, as Saunders
J. did in his dissent (pp. 137-38), as limited to the situation
in which the employment standards officer discovered that the
facts were not as represented to Mr. Jenkins. To the contrary, I
think Mr. Jenkins was making it clear that if there was a
complaint that triggered the adjudicative process of the Act, the
determination of Libbey's liability would be in the hands of
adjudicators. Mr. Jenkins was telling Libbey what the Ministry's
position was and would be assuming the relevant facts did not
change. Libbey was entitled to proceed on the basis that the
Ministry would maintain that position in any subsequent
proceedings where Libbey's liability for unpaid vacation pay was
an issue assuming the relevant facts did not change. Libbey was
not, in my view, on the basis of the Jenkins' letter, entitled to
assume that if a complaint was made and an investigation
commenced, the employment standards officer would be bound by the
Ministry's interpretation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] I also agree with the respondent's submission that as the
letter was directed to experienced and able counsel, it must be
read through the eyes of someone who was familiar with the Act
and its operation. Libbey, through its counsel, knew that the
Ministry and the employment standards officer could not be
equated under the Act. References to potential investigations and
adjudications of complaints under the Act clearly connotes, to
those familiar with the Act, decision-making independent of the
Ministry.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] While the Jenkins' letter was a clear representation of the
Ministry's position with respect to Libbey's potential liability,
it did not give rise to a reasonable expectation that any
investigation conducted by an employment standards officer would
necessarily yield the same conclusion as to Libbey's liability.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">B: The Abuse of Process Claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] Employment standards officers, like Ms. Hoy, have broad
powers under the Act and are charged with the obligation of
determining the legal rights and liabilities of employees and
employers. Employment standard officers must make findings of
fact and apply the law as they understand those findings of fact.
They are given broad investigative powers to assist in performing
these important tasks. When adjudicating claims as between
employers and employees, employment standards officers are
obliged to act independently of the Ministry and the parties.
They must arrive at their own factual findings, make their own
legal interpretations, and arrive at their own conclusions: Re
Dowing and Graydon et al. (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 292 at 305-307
(C.A.). The question here is whether the pay order made by Ms.
Hoy was the product of an independent adjudicative assessment by
her or the result of a Ministry decision to arbitrarily shift
liability for the unpaid vacation pay from the Program to Libbey?</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] The respondents submits:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The statutory decision-maker, Ms. Hoy, was
          entitled to a presumption that she acted in
          good faith in arriving at her decision.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[70] Although I would not use the language of presumptions, I am
satisfied that only clear and cogent evidence should lead to the
conclusion that Ms. Hoy's order was not the product of an
independent adjudication on the merits as she saw them. The
appellant has met that burden. The evidence and the reasonable
inferences to be drawn from that evidence satisfy me that the
decision to look to Libbey for payment of the unpaid vacation pay
was a Ministry decision motivated by a desire to avoid payment of
$1.3 million from the Program. As this conclusion rests on the
specific facts of this case, I must return to the evidence to
explain the reasons behind my conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] Ms. Hoy, who was delegated to deal with the employees' claim
for compensation from the Program, told the employees that they
were entitled to be compensated from the Program. She told them
how to draft their request for compensation. Her position was
unequivocal and indeed she assured the employees that they would
receive compensation &quot;in record time.&quot; She maintained her
position through late October 1993. As far as she was concerned,
it was not a matter of whether the employees would be compensated
from the Program but when they would receive their cheques. The
evidence demonstrates that by November 1993, the matter had left
Ms. Hoy's hands. She had made her decision and it remained only
to issue the cheques.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] Somehow the matter was back in Ms. Hoy's hands by early
December 1993 and its entire complexion had changed. No longer
was it a straightforward case of compensation from the Program.
It had now become an investigation to determine who should pay.
There is no direct explanation in the record for this sudden
change of course. Ms. Hoy didn't receive any new information
between October and December 1993 and the employees did not
change the nature of the request they had made in July 1993.
After reviewing the entire record, I am satisfied that the only
reasonable explanation for the December change of course is that
offered to Mr. Smeenk a year later by Mr. Hassan, Ms. Hoy's
supervisor. Mr. Smeenk said that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Mr. Hassan advised me that although the
          Ministry of Labour had previously been
          sympathetic to Libbey Canada Inc.'s
          situation, the Ministry is now facing a large
          claim under the Wage Protection Program and
          Ministry officials felt they must take every
          avenue open to them to pursue other possible
          sources to pay such a claim instead of paying
          it out of government funds.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] I can only interpret Mr. Hassan's candid statement as an
admission that the Ministry's priorities changed when its focus
shifted from maintaining the plant and the jobs to avoiding
payment from the Program. Mr. Hassan's comment also tells me that
this shift was made as a matter of Ministry policy and was not
the product of any independent investigation conducted by Ms. Hoy
or any interpretation of the relevant legislation she had arrived
at after her own analysis of that legislation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] Ms. Hoy's letter of December 15, 1993 is significant. It was
far from candid. The letter suggested that she had been
conducting an investigation since July 1993 into both the
employees' entitlement to unpaid vacation pay and the
identification of the party or parties liable to make any payment
owed to the employees. She had, of course, been conducting no
such investigation, at least not before late October 1993. If she
had discovered new facts or reconsidered her interpretation of
the applicable law, why did she not set out the history of her
dealings with the employees in her letter to Libbey? Why did Ms.
Hoy not make it clear to Libbey that she had initially decided
that the employees were entitled to compensation from the
Program, and that she had assured the employees that they would
be compensated quickly? Why did Ms. Hoy not explain to Libbey
what had caused her to turn the employees' request for payment
from the Program into an investigation into Libbey's potential
obligation to pay the amount? Ms. Hoy clearly did not want Libbey
to know of her initial determination and of her repeated
assurances to the employees that they would be compensated from
the Program. Instead, she wanted to create the impression that in
December 1993 she had been conducting an ongoing investigation
since July 1993 into both the employees' entitlement to unpaid
vacation pay and the identity of the entity obligated to make
that payment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] The meeting with Mr. Foster, the representative of the
employees, Ms. Hoy, and Mr. Steep, the lawyer from the Ministry,
in September 1994 is also important. On Mr. Foster's
uncontradicted description of that meeting, it is impossible to
place the benign interpretation on it urged by the respondents.
The purpose of the meeting is clear. Ms. Hoy, with Mr. Steep's
assistance, needed to manufacture a claim by the employees
against Libbey to give credence to her purported investigation of
such a claim over the previous nine months. The tenor of Mr.
Steep's remarks, with which Ms. Hoy clearly associated herself by
her presence and silence, demonstrates that Ms. Hoy was not
conducting an independent or impartial investigation. She had
clearly associated herself with the Ministry's determination to
shift liability from the Program to Libbey. Her subsequent
statement to Libbey that the employees had &quot;clarified&quot; their
claim hardly describes what happened at that meeting with Mr.
Foster.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] Ms. Hoy's various attempts to explain her decision that
Libbey was liable for the unpaid vacation pay adds further
credence to the appellant's contention that that decision was the
result of an arbitrary shift in Ministry policy and not Ms. Hoy's
independent analysis of the facts and applicable law. At one
stage (June 1994), Ms. Hoy indicated that she had reached her
decision based on information provided to her by the employees,
even though that information appeared to contradict the terms of
the collective agreements. In her narrative report justifying her
order (January 1995), she abandoned the justification she
advanced in June 1994. She now justified her conclusion on the
following basis:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is noted that under the Labour Relations
          Act of Ontario, that Libbey Canada Inc.
          pursuant to subsection 64(2) is bound by the
          terms of the collective agreements in force
          between Libbey-St. Clair Limited and the
          respective unions. I have determined the
          Ontario Labour Relations Board did not
          declare otherwise but simply permitted the
          early termination of the collective
          agreements then in force between the employer
          and the unions. In my view the liability of
          the successor employer, Libbey Canada Inc.,
          is such that any vacation pay owed to the
          employees is now the responsibility of the
          new employer, Libbey Canada Inc.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] Ms. Hoy's purported reliance on the Labour Relations Act
appears as if by abracadabra for the first time in her narrative
report. No one suggested in the previous 18 months that the
Labour Relations Act had any relevance, much less that it was
determinative of the question of who was liable for the unpaid
vacation pay. What everyone had thought was a matter turning on
the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act somehow magically
became a matter dependent upon a provision in the Labour
Relations Act. Ms. Hoy offers no basis for her apparent
conclusion that s. 13(2) had become irrelevant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Considering the entirety of this record, I am satisfied that
some time in November 1993 a decision was made, not by Ms. Hoy
but by persons within the Ministry, to look to Libbey for payment
of the money owed to the employees. From that point, Ms. Hoy's
efforts were directed at reformulating the initial request for
compensation from the Program, developing a &quot;claim&quot; by the
employees against Libbey and formulating a justification for an
order that departed from the Ministry policy and shifted
liability for payment of $1.3 million from the Program to Libbey.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] Libbey was not treated fairly. It did not receive the
benefit of an independent assessment of the facts and relevant
law by an employment standards officer. Instead, it was subjected
to an arbitrary change in Ministry policy effected under the
guise of adjudication of a claim made by the employees. The order
made by Ms. Hoy cannot stand. Unfortunately, the employees, who
everyone agrees are owed unpaid vacation pay, suffer from the
failure to accord Libbey due process. They are entitled to have
their claim for compensation from the Program determined
forthwith. That determination should be made bearing in mind the
representations made to the employees by the Ministry in the
summer of 1993. Should it be determined that the employees are
not eligible for compensation from the Program, then the
employees may have a claim against Libbey. If such a claim can be
brought and is made, it must be adjudicated by an employment
standards officer acting independently of the Ministry.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the
Divisional Court and grant an order quashing the pay order made
by Ms. Hoy. The appellant is entitled to its costs from the
respondents here and in the Divisional Court. I would make no
order as to costs for or against the interveners.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2    Some 3 1/2 months before the hearing of this appeal,
Morden A.C.J.O. gave the respondents leave to cross-examine on
the affidavit filed by the appellant in the judicial review
application. He also directed that they could file their own
affidavits in response to the allegation that they had acted for
an improper purpose. They did neither.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     3    The purchase of the assets of LSC was actually made by
Libbey Canada Inc. (the appellant) a wholly owned subsidiary of
Libbey incorporated for the purposes of the purchase. I will not
distinguish between the two entities in these reasons and will
refer to both as Libbey.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     4    The Ministry never took the position that Libbey
withheld relevant information or that its understanding of the
pertinent circumstances changed in any way between April 1993 and
January 1995 when Ms. Hoy issued the pay order.</font></pre>
