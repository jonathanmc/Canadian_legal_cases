    <pre>               OSBORNE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On June 16, 1997, the Honourable Mr. Justice Jarvis
suspended the appellant father’s access rights to his daughter
Shakyra. The appellant has appealed. He seeks to set aside Jarvis
J.’s order and submits that he should have access to his daughter
“… equal to that of her mother [the respondent].”

[2]  The appellant and the respondent were married in Montreal on
November 7, 1987. They have one child Shakyra Langille born
February 19, 1988. After the parties separated in March 1989, the
respondent moved with Shakyra to New Brunswick where she obtained
a divorce from the appellant on February 4, 1991. In the divorce
judgment Gurette J. granted custody of Shakyra to the respondent
with reasonable access to the appellant, on reasonable notice.
The appellant was ordered to pay child support of $300 each
month. At the time of the divorce proceedings, the appellant was
working and living in Toronto. He did not appear in those
proceedings.

[3]  The respondent married David Jarrell in 1991. They have one
child, Christian, who was born in 1993. In about April 1996, the
respondent, Mr. Jarrell, Christian and Shakyra moved to the
Toronto area. It was at that point that serious access problems
began. I do not propose to review each side’s version of the
cause of the problems beyond noting that from the appellant’s
standpoint all of the access-related problems were explained by
the respondent’s manipulation of Shakyra. The respondent
contended that the appellant took no account of Shakyra’s wishes
and that he exercised access in an unduly intrusive and uncaring
manner. Thus, Shakyra came to resent being forced to see her
father.

[4]  Because of the access problems, in September 1996 the
appellant applied to the Ontario Court, General Division, for an
order varying the New Brunswick divorce judgment’s access
provisions. He also sought a reduction of his child support
obligations and an order rescinding the accumulated arrears of
child support. In his application, he asked that a representative
of the Office of the Children’s Lawyer investigate and report on
all matters pertaining to access. In October 1996, in a cross-
application, the respondent sought to have certain specified
access to Shakyra established. She also sought an increase in
child support to $500 per month.

[5]  On January 9, 1997, Jarvis J. ordered that the appellant
have access on the first weekend of the following three months
commencing on January 31, 1997, from Friday at 6:00 p.m. until
Sunday at 6:00 p.m., and also each Wednesday from 6:00 p.m. to
8:00 p.m. On January 9, 1997, the parties consented to an order
staying the enforcement of child support arrears.

[6]  On April 14, 1997, Jarvis J. appointed the Children’s Lawyer
to conduct an investigation in respect of access. His endorsement
reflects the concern that Shakyra “is coping poorly with the
difficulties between the parents.”  Jarvis J.’s order of April
14, 1997, provided that the access arrangements established on
January 9, 1997, would continue.

[7]  On May 12, 1997, the matter again came before the Family Law
Division in Toronto. It was adjourned until June 16, 1997. In his
endorsement, Jarvis J. expressed the hope that by June 16, 1997
the Children’s Lawyer would be able to provide an interim report.
He again noted that “the child is said to be having
difficulties.”

[8]  Because of an increasing concern about the child’s welfare,
on May 30, 1997, access was suspended, on the recommendation of
the Children’s Lawyer, pending completion of the Children’s
Lawyer’s assessment.

[9]  A representative of the Children’s Lawyer conducted an
extensive investigation into the access-related problems. In the
course of her assessment she conducted a number of interviews, as
follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Michele Jarrell May 15, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Steven Lidkea May 16, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Shakyra May 30, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Shakyra and Michele and David Jarrel
     May 30, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Shakyra and Steven Lidkea May 30,
     1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Individual school interview with Shakyra June 5, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Meeting with Shakyra’s teachers Mrs. Cox, Mrs. MacIvor,
     and principal Mrs. Cox at Floradale Public School June 5,
     1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Telephone interview with Shakyra’s babysitter Linda Stark
     June 9, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Shakyra’s grandparents Mr. and Mrs.
     Lidkea Sr. June 6, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Office interview with Steven Lidkea June 6, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Telephone interview with Shakyra’s family physician Dr.
     Jonathan Peck June 9, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     - Telephone interview with Michele Jarrell June 9, 1997
     </pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>[10] I do not propose to review the report and recommendations of
the Children’s Lawyer in any detail. It is clear from the
assessment report that Shakyra was adversely affected by the
ongoing inability of the appellant to recognize and respect her
wishes. The assessor noted that the appellant tends to see the
access-related problems in terms of “rights” which he claims to
possess. As the assessor noted, “he feels that as Shakyra’s
father he should have the right to have contact to enjoy a
parental relationship with her regardless of her mother’s
wishes.”  The assessor further noted that the respondent was
frustrated by the appellant’s emphasis on parental rights and his
inability to recognize Shakyra’s genuinely held wishes. In this
court, the appellant continued to approach access on the basis
that it was his right. For example, in his factum he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is respectfully submitted that the appellant fathered a
          child with the respondent and is entitled to equal access to his
          daughter as per s. 26 and 28 of the Charter.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[11] The assessor confirmed that Shakyra had developed a strong
disinclination to have access visits continue. She expressed her
views on access privately to the assessor and in another
interview with the assessor at which the appellant was also
present. Shakyra told the assessor that the appellant simply
wanted to show her off to others during access visits. She
resented the appellant saying bad things about her family in
front of her. Shakyra also told the assessor that the appellant
said that it did not matter where her family moved since he would
follow them and keep the respondent in court until Shakyra was
18. Shakyra viewed the appellant’s biggest problem to be his
failure to listen. In a meeting with the assessor that Shakyra
attended, the appellant initially tried to laugh off Shakyra’s
complaints but then stated that she was being coached by the
respondent.

[12] As a result of the accumulation of information that was
collected, the assessor recommended and the court accepted that
access be suspended as of May 30, 1997, pending the return of the
application on June 16, 1997.

[13] Jarvis J.’s decision to suspend access was not made in
haste. In the approximate nine month period during which the
application and cross-application were before the court a variety
of strategies was attempted. None worked in the sense that
Shakyra consistently resisted and resented being forced to see
her father.

[14] The principle of the best interests of the child controls
the disposition of the issue of access, as it does the issue of
custody. There was considerable evidence, accumulated for the
most part in the nine month period extending from October 1996 to
June 1997, that supports the motions judge’s conclusion that
access was not working. The motions judge did not fall into error
in allowing the representative of the Children’s Lawyer to
determine what should be done about access. He observed when
commenting on the Children’s Lawyer’s assessment:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have read the report of Ms. Martin and must say that the
          fears she expresses and recommendations that she has made
          correspond with the conclusions I have reached over the past
          several months that this matter has been before me.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Regular access has exacerbated the
          difficult relationship between the parties
          and has led to unfortunate consequences for
          Shakrya.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[15] The motions judge’s conclusion is supported by the evidence.
As I have said, access was working against Shakyra’s best
interests at the time the order under appeal was made. Shakyra
had come to resent and be negatively affected by visits with her
father. This was recognized by the respondent, the family
physician, Shakyra’s teachers and the representative of the
Children’s Lawyer. Although the relationship between the
appellant and the respondent is not good, this is not a case
where the custodial parent has wilfully tried to frustrate the
non-custodial parent’s access rights.

[16] In my opinion, there is no basis upon which to interfere
with Jarvis J.’s decision to suspend access. I share Jarvis J.’s
hope that summer access visits with Shakyra’s paternal
grandparents can be arranged. I am satisfied that, to the extent
practicable, the respondent will co-operate in that endeavour.

[17] In his June 16, 1997 order Jarvis J. provided that Shakyra
not be removed from Canada without the appellant’s consent, or
further order of the court. Mr. and Mrs. Jarrell want to move to
the United States. I am reluctant to deal with this issue (there
was no cross-appeal from Jarvis J.’s mobility restrictions)
mainly because there is no evidence filed to support the move. I
am also reluctant to make a mobility decision based upon evidence
and information that is at least 18 months old. If Mr. and Mrs.
Jarrell want to move to the United States they should move to
vary the mobility part of Jarvis J.’s order. By proceeding that
way the court will have current information concerning the
proposed move and its impact on Shakyra’s best interests.

[18] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without costs.
