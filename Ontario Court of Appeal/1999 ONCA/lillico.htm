COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. JAMES
               LILLICO (Appellant)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        OSBORNE, ABELLA and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Keith Wright
               For the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Susan Reid
               For the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         January 20, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raised several grounds of appeal against his</pre>
    <pre>conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal and if leave is granted</pre>
    <pre>to appeal his sentence.

</pre>
    <pre>The Section 8 Violation

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We see no error in the trial judge’s reasons or with his</pre>
    <pre>conclusion on this issue. We also accept as correct the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge’s reasons and his conclusion with respect to the validity</pre>
    <pre>of the search warrant.

</pre>
    <pre>The Actus Reus Issue

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The complainants paid $100,000 to the appellant “in trust”.</pre>
    <pre>The funds were to be deposited in a separate bank account. The</pre>
    <pre>appellant manifestly used the trust funds for his own purposes.</pre>
    <pre>Although the complainants had parted with their money, they</pre>
    <pre>continued, as beneficiaries of the trust, to have a property</pre>
    <pre>interest in it. In the particular circumstances, we do not accept</pre>
    <pre>the submission that upon delivery of the trust funds to the</pre>
    <pre>appellant, the funds belonged to the appellant. We think,</pre>
    <pre>therefore, that the actus reus of the offence charged (theft by</pre>
    <pre>conversion) was made out. Moreover, the verdict was not</pre>
    <pre>unreasonable.

</pre>
    <pre>The Mens Rea Issue

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to</pre>
    <pre>adequately direct the jury on the mens rea of theft by</pre>
    <pre>conversion. In particular, the appellant contends that the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge should have explicitly directed the jury on the issue of</pre>
    <pre>“colour of right.”

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge made it clear to the jury that in order to</pre>
    <pre>convict the appellant, they had to be satisfied beyond a</pre>
    <pre>reasonable doubt that the appellant and the complainants “... had</pre>
    <pre>a clear understanding on both sides that the money would be used</pre>
    <pre>only for the franchise agreement.”  The trial judge also stated</pre>
    <pre>repeatedly that to convict the appellant, the jury had to be</pre>
    <pre>satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to act</pre>
    <pre>dishonestly in the manner in which he used the complainants’</pre>
    <pre>money.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  No objection was taken to that part of the charge dealing</pre>
    <pre>with mens rea, and in our view, the trial judge correctly</pre>
    <pre>directed the jury on that issue. He had no obligation to</pre>
    <pre>specifically use the words “colour of right.”

</pre>
    <pre>Sentence

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  This was a serious breach of trust which involved the</pre>
    <pre>retirement savings of one of the victims. The sentence imposed by</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge was, in our view, fit. The conditional sentence</pre>
    <pre>provisions of the Criminal Code were not available to the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge when he sentenced the appellant. However, we do not think</pre>
    <pre>that a conditional sentence is warranted in this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  A compensation order was clearly called for. However, the</pre>
    <pre>appellant takes issue with the quantum of the compensation order.</pre>
    <pre>In our opinion, when he dealt with the compensation order, the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge applied the correct principles and although the</pre>
    <pre>appellant applied a small part of the trust funds to the</pre>
    <pre>franchise, his actions, mainly within 48 hours of his receipt of</pre>
    <pre>the trust funds, made it impossible for him to comply with the</pre>
    <pre>provisions of the trust. Accordingly, we think the $100,000</pre>
    <pre>compensation order was justified in the circumstances and we are</pre>
    <pre>not prepared to interfere with it.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The community service order was an integral of the sentence</pre>
    <pre>imposed by the trial judge. We are not persuaded that there is a</pre>
    <pre>basis upon which we should reduce it.

</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION

</pre>
    <pre>[10] Accordingly, the leave against conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal against</pre>
    <pre>sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
