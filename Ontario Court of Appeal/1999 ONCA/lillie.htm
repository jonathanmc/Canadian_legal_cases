    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Southey,
Rosenberg and Cusinato JJ.) dated December 17, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal, with leave, from a judgment of the Divisional
Court places in issue the simplified procedures set out in rule
76 of the Rules of Civil Procedure R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 194.
Rule 76 is mandatory in an action where the plaintiff&#146;s claim is
exclusively for an amount of $25,000 or less, exclusive of
interest and costs.  There are other provisions of the rule that
are not relevant to this appeal.
[2]  In the case in appeal, the plaintiffs&#146; action arose by
reason of a motor vehicle accident and injuries alleged to have
been sustained as a result.  The claim was for general and
special damages.  The amount claimed from the defendant was the
sum of $25,000, exclusive of the statutory deduction provided in
s.267.1(8)3i of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 as amended.
[3]  The defendant took the position that the plaintiffs&#146; action
was not an action &#147;where the plaintiff&#146;s claim is exclusively for
an amount of $25,000 or less, exclusive of interest and costs&#148; as
it must be under rule 76.02(1) for the simplified procedure to be
available.  The defendant claimed entitlement to the discovery
rights under the ordinary rules.
[4]  The simplified procedures contained in rule 76.01 of the
Rules of Civil Procedure are intended to provide a readily
understandable and cost-effective method of resolving disputes
where the monetary claim is $25,000 or less.  The court should
encourage a liberal interpretation of rule 76 to carry out the
policy behind the rule which is to reduce the cost of litigating
claims of modest sums by reducing the amount of procedure
available in such cases.
[5]  In the case in appeal, the claim was initially $40,000.  The
claimant reduced it, however to $25,000.  The abandonment of the
excess claim is expressly authorised by rule 76.02(4). The claim
was accordingly net of what the court should later determine was
the plaintiffs&#146; entitlement less the statutory deduction under
the Insurance Act but not in any circumstances to exceed $25,000.
[6]  It is not necessary for the court to enlarge upon this
matter.  It was fully and correctly dealt with by Southey J.,
speaking for the majority of the Divisional Court.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
