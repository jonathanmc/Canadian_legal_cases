    <pre>[1]  We think this appeal must succeed.

[2]  The trial judge accepted the officer's evidence that she
smelled alcohol on the respondent's breath.  This observation led
her to suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body and
she made the ALERT demand accordingly.  An officer may make an
ALERT demand where she reasonably suspects that a person who is
operating a motor vehicle has alcohol in his or her body
(s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code).  There need only be a
reasonable suspicion and that reasonable suspicion need only
relate to the existence of alcohol in the body.  The officer does
not have to believe that the accused has committed any crime.  We
see no need to put a gloss on the words of s. 254(2).  The fact
that there may be an explanation for the smell of alcohol does
not take away from the fact that there exists a reasonable
suspicion within the meaning of the section.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the acquittal is
set aside and the conviction is restored.
