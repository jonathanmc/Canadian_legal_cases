    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Desotti J. with a jury on June 18,
1996 and sentence on August 30, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>MOLDAVER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was tried by a judge and jury on a 25-count
indictment alleging various acts of sexual and physical abuse
against his step-daughters, T.M. and P.M. and his three
biological sons, M.W., S.W. and T.W.  He was convicted on 20
counts, including 10 sex-related offences involving T.M. and
P.M., one count of assault causing bodily harm upon P.M. and
three counts of administering a noxious substance, unlawful
confinement and assault in relation to each of his three sons. He
was sentenced to a term of imprisonment totalling 18-1/2 years.
He appeals against conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>Allegations relating to T.M. and P.M. [1962-72]</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In 1961, the appellant met E.M.  E.M. had recently separated
from her husband and she and her 10 children were living in
Chatham, Ontario.  The appellant formed a relationship with E.M.
and took up residence with her and the children.  They lived in
Chatham until January 1962 and then moved to Etobicoke, Ontario.
[3]  Shortly after the move to Etobicoke, five of E.M.&#146;s
children, including a daughter S.M., returned to live with their
father in Chatham.  The appellant continued to reside with E.M.
and her five remaining children, R.M., B.M., T.M., P.M. and D.M.
In 1966, the family moved from Etobicoke to Tillsonburg.
[4]  Over the course of the appellant&#146;s relationship with E.M.,
which lasted until 1975, E.M. gave birth in 1963 to twin sons,
K.T.W. and K.L.W. and a third son, W.W. who died in infancy.
From 1962 to 1972, the appellant assumed the role of father
towards his natural children and his five step-children.  During
this period, two very different pictures emerge regarding the
appellant&#146;s role as husband and father within the household.
[5]  According to the evidence of E.M., T.M., P.M., R.M. and the
appellant&#146;s natural son, K.T.W., the appellant exerted violent
control over the family.  He systematically intimidated and
brutalized his wife and children and engaged in extreme acts of
violence and cruelty to enforce his will.  In short, he ruled
with an iron fist and brooked no opposition.  From his
perspective, E.M. and the children were his personal chattels to
do with as he saw fit.
[6]  The appellant, on the other hand, portrayed himself as a
loving husband and devoted father.  Indeed, when one reads his
testimony, the picture that emerges is that of a man of high
moral and ethical values.  After meeting E.M. in 1961, he was the
one who, more out of charity than love, rescued her and the
children from a life of poverty and misery.  Thereafter, he was
the one who worked hard to provide the family with a decent home
and comfortable lifestyle and he was the one responsible for
instilling moral and ethical values in the children.  When the
need arose to discipline the children, apart from one or two
minor exceptions, he was always in control.  At no time did he
ever use excessive force and contrary to the evidence of E.M. and
the children, he never struck the children with a wooden stick.
On those rare occasions when physical force was required to teach
the children a lesson, he either used his hands or a small
leather strap and the amount of force was always measured.
[7]  Apart from the appellant, the second of his twin sons,
K.L.W., was the only witness who supported his father&#146;s version
of the means and methods used to discipline the children.1</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Against this backdrop, I turn to the specific allegations
against the appellant involving his step-daughters T.M. and P.M.</pre>
    <pre>Assault causing bodily harm upon P.M. &#150; 1963</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The incident giving rise to this charge occurred in 1963,
when P.M., then aged 6 or 7, accidentally broke a household
ornament.  Upon learning of the broken ornament, the appellant
lined-up his five step-children in the living room and demanded
to know who was responsible.  One by one, the appellant struck
each of the children on their hands with a piece of wood until
P.M. finally confessed.
[10] Ignoring her tears and apologies, the appellant proceeded to
strike P.M. over and over again, causing her hands to swell up
&#147;like balloons.&#148;  According to P.M., the severity of the beating
left her unable to close her hands for a week.  She was required
to stay home from school and had to be fed by her siblings.
P.M.&#146;s description of the event was confirmed by her mother E.M.,
her siblings T.M. and R.M., and in many respects, the appellant
himself.
[11] The appellant had no difficulty recalling the &#147;broken
ornament&#148; incident.  He readily admitted to lining the children
up and giving each one four or five light taps on the hands,
albeit with a leather strap, not a wooden stick.  Contrary to the
evidence of P.M., E.M. and the others, he claimed that the force
used on P.M. was measured and occasioned no injuries whatsoever
to her hands.  He steadfastly maintained that P.M. did not
require treatment afterwards and she did not miss a week from
school.</pre>
    <pre>Sexual abuse of T.M. [1962-68]</pre>
    <pre>[12] T.M. testified that the appellant began to sexually abuse
her when she was 11 years old.  The first incident occurred when
the appellant drove her to Chatham to visit her father.  En
route, the appellant asked her to &#147;c&#146;mon on over here&#148; and they
began to cuddle.  T.M. told the appellant that she had previously
been sexually abused by her biological father and she therefore
knew what the appellant wanted.  T.M. then began to play with his
penis and when he asked what else her father had taught her, she
told the appellant that he could insert his finger inside her
vagina.  The appellant stopped the car, inserted his finger into
her vagina and told her that she was too small to do anything
else but that he would come back to it later.
[13] The next incident occurred in January 1963, when E.M. was in
the hospital giving birth to K.T.W. and K.L.W.  T.M., who was now
12, recalled being awakened by the appellant and taken
downstairs, away from the other children.  After reminding her of
what had occurred in the car, T.M. began to play with the
appellant&#146;s penis while he fondled her vagina.  The appellant
also attempted to have intercourse with her but she was still too
small.
[14] According to T.M., she and the appellant first engaged in
intercourse in December 1963, a few months after she had turned
13.  Thereafter, the appellant continued to have intercourse with
her on a regular basis until the end of 1968.  In July 1969 at
age 18, T.M. left the family home permanently.
[15] For his part, the appellant claimed that T.M.&#146;s allegations
were false and he completely denied any sexual contact with her.</pre>
    <pre>Sexual abuse of P.M. [1968-72]</pre>
    <pre>[16] P.M. testified that when she was 5 or 6 years old, the
appellant began telling her that she would marry him when she
grew up.  It was at about age 10, just after she had reached
puberty, that the appellant first began to touch her breasts and
vagina.
[17] P.M. stated that in the summer of 1968, at age 12, the abuse
escalated to full intercourse.  The first incident occurred in
Chatham at the home of the appellant&#146;s recently deceased father.
Thereafter, the appellant continued to have intercourse with her
on a regular basis.
[18] P.M. testified that when she was 13, the appellant took a
black magic marker and inscribed the word &#147;Len&#146;s&#148; on her abdomen,
just above her vagina, to demonstrate his &#147;ownership&#148; of her.
One evening, about six months after the appellant had begun this
practice, E.M. noticed the writing on P.M.&#146;s body.  This resulted
in a heated altercation between E.M. and the appellant in which
E.M. was violently assaulted.  According to P.M., the appellant
told E.M., &#147;It [the intercourse] was gonna go on.&#148;
[19] P.M.&#146;s description of this incident was confirmed by both
E.M. and the appellant&#146;s son K.T.W.  Significantly, K.T.W.
recalled witnessing E.M. and the appellant fighting about the
fact that the appellant was having sex with P.M. and he overheard
the appellant say, &#147;I&#146;ll have sex with her if I want to.&#148;
[20] P.M. testified that after this incident, E.M. realized that
she could not stand in the appellant&#146;s way and she began to
assist him in the abuse of her own daughter.  Once or twice a
week, over the next two or three years, E.M. would awaken P.M.
and tell her to go to the appellant&#146;s bed and &#147;deal with your
Dad.&#148;  When P.M. complied, E.M. would go downstairs to the
kitchen while the appellant had intercourse with her.
[21] P.M. stated that on some occasions, the appellant would come
directly to her bedroom and have intercourse with her.
Sometimes, she would feign sleep and on the following mornings,
the appellant would insist that she stay at home and have sex
with him. She also swore that on occasion, the appellant required
her to fellate him and swallow his ejaculate.
[22] E.M. confirmed the salient features of her daughter&#146;s
evidence.  She admitted to regularly waking P.M., telling her
&#147;Dad wants you.&#148;  She would then go to the kitchen and wait until
the appellant called for her to return to the bedroom.  While she
conceded that she did not witness the appellant having sex with
P.M. on these occasions, she knew they were &#147;not playing musical
chairs.&#148;  Much as she attempted from time to time to prevent the
abuse from continuing, her efforts proved futile and were usually
met with violence.
[23] This aspect of P.M.&#146;s testimony was also confirmed by one of
E.M.&#146;s other daughters, S.M.  S.M. was one of the children, who,
in 1963, was sent back to live with her father in Chatham.  In
1968, however, when she was 15, she returned to live with the
appellant and her mother and she shared a bedroom with her sister
P.M.
[24] One night, she recalled her mother coming to the bedroom and
saying to P.M., &#147;You deal with him.&#148;  P.M. got out of bed and
left the room.  When she returned, her crying caused S.M. to
awaken.  Some months later, when P.M. was 12 or 13, she confided
in S.M. that the appellant was having sexual intercourse with
her.
[25] Prior to turning 16, P.M. testified that the appellant
refrained from ejaculating inside her.  However, that changed
when she turned 16 and within a matter of months, she became
pregnant with the appellant&#146;s child.
[26] Following the birth of her daughter K.W. on December 1,
1972, P.M. continued to live with the appellant and E.M., who in
turn maintained a spousal relationship.  Nonetheless, the
appellant, with E.M.&#146;s assistance, continued to have regular
intercourse with P.M. and she became pregnant again, giving birth
to M.W. on July 25, 1974.  When P.M. began pregnant for a third
time in 1975, E.M. ordered her and the appellant to leave the
home.
[27] A third child, S.W. was born on February 6, 1976.  By that
time, the appellant and P.M. had established their own household.
On March 7, 1977, P.M. gave birth to a fourth child, T.W.
Shortly thereafter, the appellant, P.M. and the four children
moved to a home in Tillsonburg.
[28] For his part, the appellant denied engaging in any sexual
activity with P.M. before her 16th birthday.  He did, however,
admit to having sex with her at a local motel in March 1972, one
month after she had turned 16.
[29] On that occasion, in cross-examination, he claimed that he
and E.M. had had an argument about E.M. neglecting him and when
he told her he was leaving, P.M. insisted on coming with him.
After taking a room at a nearby motel, P.M. told the appellant
that she had loved him for a long time, not as a father but as a
boyfriend.  According to the appellant, much as he initially
tried to resist her advances, he ultimately gave in and he and
P.M. engaged in sexual intercourse.  He was insistent that the
incident at the motel occurred before P.M. became pregnant.
Indeed, according to his testimony, it was the first time he and
P.M. had engaged in any sexual activity.
[30] The appellant was then confronted with the fact that in-
chief, when asked why he had gone to the motel, he testified that
E.M. was furious about his sexual relationship with P.M. which
had resulted in her becoming pregnant and she told him, &#147;You
better leave and take her with you or I&#146;ll kill her.&#148;  The
appellant refused to admit that his evidence in-chief on this
subject was inconsistent with his evidence on cross-examination.
In his view, there was no difference between the two versions and
he accused Crown counsel of trying to put words in his mouth.</pre>
    <pre>ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO APPELLANT&#146;S BIOLOGICAL SONS [1977-81]</pre>
    <pre>[31] Between 1972 and 1977, P.M. gave birth to four children &#150;
K.W., M.W., S.W. and T.W. &#150; all of whom were fathered by the
appellant.
[32] P.M. stated that the appellant was pleased when she gave
birth to K.W. because he liked girls.  He reacted very
differently, however, to the successive birth of three sons.  She
testified that when their first son M.W. was born, the appellant
refused to go to the viewing room to see him and he told P.M.
that he did not want her to bring M.W. home.  He reacted
similarly to the births of S.W. and T.W.  In S.W.&#146;s case, he
urged P.M. to put S.W. up for adoption.  According to P.M., the
appellant told her that he did not want to invest time in boys,
who, unlike girls, would not do what he wanted when they grew up.
[33] E.M. confirmed this aspect of P.M.&#146;s testimony.  She
testified that the appellant was upset when she herself gave
birth to three sons and he reacted in a similar negative fashion
to the birth of M.W.  On many occasions, she overheard the
appellant telling P.M. that he wanted the three boys &#147;to be put
away in the care of the Childrens&#146; Aid Society.&#148;
[34] Further confirmation is found in the evidence of K.W., who,
at the time of trial, was 23 years old and a former employee of
the Ontario Association of Children&#146;s Aid.  According to K.W.,
during her formative years, the appellant treated her much
differently than the boys.  It was clear to her that the
appellant despised the boys and he regularly referred to them as
Slittle buggers&#148; or &#147;little bastards.&#148;
[35] P.M. testified that she and the appellant lived together as
husband and wife from 1975 to 1981.  Once again, two very
different pictures emerge regarding the appellant&#146;s role as
husband and father within the household.
[36] P.M. and the four children testified that the appellant
exerted violent control over the family.  K.W. recalled the
appellant describing himself as &#147;the king,&#148; making it clear that
he would brook no opposition or disobedience.  To enforce his
will, he systematically brutalized P.M. and the three boys,
subjecting them to extreme forms of cruelty and violence.
According to P.M., the appellant engaged in the same pattern of
behaviour towards her and the three boys that she herself had
witnessed and experienced as a child.
[37] For his part, the appellant maintained that he was a model
husband and father.  He denied abusing P.M. and the three boys,
claiming that he only disciplined the children as required and
then, in a measured and controlled fashion.  To the extent that
any of the children may have been abused, the responsibility lay
with P.M., not him.
[38] Once again, the only witness who supported the appellant&#146;s
version of his role as a parent and father was his twin son
K.L.W.  K.L.W. testified that whenever he was present with the
appellant and P.M., he never observed the appellant abusing P.M.
or the children.  Rather, on the odd occasion that he did witness
child abuse, it was P.M. who was responsible.</pre>
    <pre>Allegations of unlawful confinement and administering a
noxious substance to M.W., S.W. and T.W. [1977-81]</pre>
    <pre>[39] According to the evidence of P.M. and the four children, the
appellant engaged in a variety of mean-spirited and cruel
practices to punish and discipline the three boys.  By far and
away the most egregious was his practice of confining the boys on
a regular basis to bird-cages located in the basement of their
home, where they were required to sleep the night sitting upright
on a small potty.  The cages contained no food or water and as a
general rule, the boys were completely naked.  If they had to
urinate or defecate in the night, they were to call out to the
appellant and wake him up.  In the event they failed to do so,
the appellant would force them to drink their urine and eat their
feces the next morning.
[40] P.M. testified that this practice first began when the
appellant became infuriated with their infant son M.W. for
wetting his bed.  At the time, she recalled the appellant
describing M.W. as &#147;just a little bastard who was doing it on
purpose.&#148;
[41] Much as P.M. deplored the appellant&#146;s conduct, there was
nothing she could do to prevent it.  When she raised the subject
with the appellant, he would become violent and beat her.
Ultimately, in 1981, when she could no longer tolerate the
appellant&#146;s abuse of her and the children, she moved out of the
home and took the children with her.2
[42] At trial, the three boys, then aged 21, 20 and 19, recounted
their memories of being cooped up in the cages at night, sleeping
naked in an upright position on potties, feeling cold, frightened
and lonely and being forced to drink their urine and eat their
feces.
[43] In addition to the testimony of P.M. and the three boys,
K.W. also gave evidence about the appellant&#146;s practice of
confining the boys to cages in the basement.  She remembered in
vivid detail how the boys were forced to sit on potties, often
naked, cold and alone in a dark basement, without blankets, toys,
food or water.
[44] She testified that at one stage, after her brother M.W.
learned to lift the latch on his cage, the appellant placed a
combination lock on the door to prevent him from escaping.  She
remembered this well because she was given the combination to the
lock by the appellant, one of her duties being to let her
brothers out in the morning and report to the appellant if they
had urinated or defecated in their potties.  If they had, they
were taken upstairs to the bathroom.  Although she did not see
her brothers being forced to consume their urine or feces, she
recalled her mother arguing with the appellant about it, telling
him it was cruel and asking him to stop.  For his part, the
appellant insisted that the practice would continue.  K.W. also
remembered that the appellant took care to ensure that the cages
were hidden away and covered with blankets whenever friends of
the family were expected to visit.
[45] Further confirmation of the caging of the boys is found in
the evidence of three additional witnesses.  K.T.W., one of the
appellant&#146;s twin sons, testified that when he was 18, he lived
with P.M. and the appellant for three months in the early part of
1981.  On three or four occasions, he recalled seeing the boys
caged in the basement, wearing only T-shirts and sitting on
potties.  They appeared sad and were trying to amuse themselves
by playing with their hands and feet.
[46] C.H. testified that in 1981, she was dating the appellant&#146;s
twin son K.L.W. and from time to time, they would visit the
appellant and P.M. in Tillsonburg and stay the night.  She could
never figure out where the boys slept and when she asked K.L.W.
about this, he told her to mind her own business.
[47] On one occasion, she recalled going to the basement.  It was
completely dark and she heard M.W. whimpering.  Upon closer
inspection, she found M.W. confined to a cage.  As she recalled
it, the cage was petitioned into three sections, each one
containing a potty.  M.W. was sitting hunched over on a potty and
when she asked him why he was there, he told her that he could
not talk to her.  Outraged at what she had seen, C.H. went
upstairs and confronted K.L.W.  She was certain that the
appellant was home at the time.
[48] Finally, L.B., a next door neighbour, testified that in the
summer of 1981, she and K.W. went to basement of the appellant&#146;s
home to locate a leak in their common well.  The basement was
dark and when she shone her flashlight around, she observed M.W.
on his hands and knees in a cage secured with a padlock.  When
she asked M.W. why he was there, he did not respond.
[49] L.B. was shocked and in due course, she notified the
Childrens&#146; Aid Society.  That day, she waited until P.M. came
home and confronted her with what she had seen.  P.M. told her
that M.W. had been bad and the appellant had instructed that he
be placed in the cage.  P.M. promised that she would take the
matter up with the appellant when he returned home.
[50] For his part, the appellant testified that he never caged
the children.  He did remember coming home from work on four
occasions to find that P.M. had placed M.W. and S.W. in cages in
the basement.  On each occasion, he told P.M. to stop this
practice but claimed that he was unable to control her.  Contrary
to the evidence of C.H., he denied ever being at home when the
children were caged.  He also denied feeding urine or feces to
the children.  On one occasion, however, he recalled returning
from work to find P.M. feeding urine, feces and dog food to M.W.
and S.W.  The appellant was outraged by this and after throwing
P.M. to the floor, he picked her up and &#147;shook the living
daylights out of her.&#148;
[51] The only support for the appellant&#146;s version came from his
son K.L.W.  He testified that he stayed at the Tillsonburg
residence during the summer of 1979 and although he saw a cage in
the basement, he never observed a child in it.  He did remember
coming home on one occasion to find P.M. feeding dog food, urine
and feces to the children.</pre>
    <pre>Allegations of assault upon M.W., S.W. and T.W. [1977-81]</pre>
    <pre>[52] The charges of assault relate generally to the regular
beatings the appellant inflicted on his three sons to punish and
discipline them.  Sometimes, the appellant would use his hands,
striking the boys on various parts of their bodies and leaving
them bruised.  On other occasions, he would use a piece of wood
wrapped in electric tape and smack their hands.
[53] M.W. recalled one occasion when, as a youngster, the
appellant struck him about the face, knocking out two of his baby
teeth and bloodying his lip.  S.W. recalled an incident when his
younger brother T.W. was beaten by the appellant and thrown down
the stairs for failing to tie his shoelaces properly.
[54] P.M. and K.W. confirmed the appellant&#146;s assaultive behaviour
towards the three boys.  As well, the next door neighbour, L.B.,
testified that every time she saw the boys, they had long narrow
bruises on their arms and hands.
[55] The appellant admitted to disciplining the children but
denied ever using excessive force.  Other defence witnesses,
including friends of the family, a retired teacher and a public
health nurse testified that the children appeared healthy and
normal.  No signs of injury were apparent and they never saw the
appellant engage in abusive conduct towards the children.

    <pre>CONVICTION APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>Issues</pre>
    <pre>[56] Of the various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant,
the Crown was called upon to respond to the following five
issues:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.        Did the trial judge err in permitting the trial to
proceed with 11 jurors?;
2.        Did the trial judge err in permitting Crown counsel to
cross-examine the appellant on the details of a prior assault
conviction?;
3.        Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury
on the limited use that could be made of the appellant&#146;s criminal
record?;
4.        Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury
on the limited use that could be made of prior inconsistent
statements?; and
5.        Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury
on the use to be made of the evidence at large in deciding the
appellant&#146;s guilt or innocence on a particular count?

    <pre>Issue 1 &#150; Proceeding with 11 jurors</pre>
    <pre>[57] At the outset of the trial, 12 jurors were selected and the
appellant was put in charge of the jury.  Before evidence was
called, the trial judge discharged a juror from duty.  No issue
is taken with that decision.
[58] After the juror had been discharged, the trial judge invited
submissions from counsel about the propriety of proceeding with
11 jurors.  Both Crown and defence counsel [not Mr. Frost] stated
that they had no objection to continuing with 11 jurors.
[59] The appellant now submits, for the first time on appeal,
that the trial judge should not have permitted the trial to
proceed without 12 jurors.
[60] In my view, there is no merit in this submission.  Section
644(1.1) of the Criminal Code was not in force at the time of
trial.3  Accordingly, the trial judge was bound by this court&#146;s
decision in R. v. Varcoe (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 449, which held
that for the purposes of s. 644 of the Code, the trial commences
when an accused is put in charge of the jury.  It follows that
the trial judge did not err in continuing the trial with 11
jurors.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2 &#150; Cross-examination on details of a prior
          assault conviction</pre>
    <pre>[61] In the absence of the jury, before commencing his cross-
examination of the appellant, Crown counsel [not Mr. Cameron]
informed the trial judge that defence counsel was prepared to
concede that the appellant had placed his character in issue in
examination in-chief.  Accordingly, it was the Crown&#146;s intention
to cross-examine the appellant on his character.</pre>
    <pre>[62] Defence counsel admitted that although character witnesses
had not been called on behalf of the defence, the appellant had
indeed placed his character in issue, albeit in a general way by
taking the stand and giving evidence.  The trial judge agreed
with this observation and then sought clarification from Crown
counsel as to precise meaning behind his comment that the
appellant had placed his character in issue.  The following
exchange then took place between the trial judge and counsel:
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE CROWN:  Well, my immediate concern was cross examination
          and I intend to cross examine him on his character.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  Then I have no problem with
          that sir, but if we are getting in to calling
          reply evidence &#133; Are you going down that
          road?
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE CROWN:  I have not contemplated
          calling evidence of bad character in reply at
          this stage.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  There hasn&#146;t been any
          evidence dealing with the issue of good
          character and I really would hope that is all
          that you are talking about.  You are just
          talking about cross examination of character.
          [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE CROWN:  At this stage, I am, sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  Absolutely.
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. BATTIN:  I agree that that is
          correct.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  That&#146;s fine.</pre>
    <pre>[63] After this exchange, Crown counsel opened his cross-
examination by asking the appellant about his prior criminal
record and in particular, the circumstances of an assault upon
his sister in 1956 for which he had been convicted and sentenced
to six months definite and six months indefinite.4  The appellant
admitted the conviction and agreed that it was his father who had
reported the assault to the police.  He denied, however, that the
assault took the form of a beating, claiming instead that he had
simply slapped his sister.
[64] Crown counsel then established that the appellant had been
convicted of two further offences, one in October 1958 for
possession of burglary tools, the other in 1976 for theft under
$200.  The trial judge then excused the jury.  He was concerned
that the Crown was about to inquire into a further conviction for
possession of a prohibited weapon (a sawed off shotgun) and on
his motion, he requested that the Crown refrain from doing so.
Crown counsel complied and the jury heard nothing about the
prohibited weapon offence.
[65] The appellant now submits, for the first time on appeal,
that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to explore the
&#147;details&#148; of the 1956 conviction for assault upon his sister.  I
disagree.
[66] As a general rule, cross-examination of an accused on a
prior criminal record should be restricted to the nature of the
offence, the date and place of the conviction and the penalty
imposed.   (See R. v. Laurier (1983), 1 O.A.C. 128 (Ont. C.A.) at
p. 131.)  Where, however, an accused places his or her character
in issue, the same restrictions do not apply and it is
permissible for the Crown to cross-examine the accused on prior
acts of discreditable conduct, including the details of prior
convictions. (See R. v. McNamara et al. (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C.
(2d) 193 at 350 (Ont. C.A.);  and R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
124 at 145.)5
[67] Having reviewed the appellant&#146;s examination in-chief, I have
no doubt that he placed his character in issue, thereby opening
the door to being questioned about prior acts of discreditable
conduct, including the details surrounding the 1956 assault upon
his sister.  Throughout his examination in-chief, the appellant
availed himself of every opportunity to extol his moral and
ethical virtues in an effort to portray himself as the  kind of
person who would never abuse anyone physically or sexually, let
alone those people, such as his immediate family members, whom he
cared for and loved.  Having adopted that posture, he placed his
character in issue.
[68] In the exchange among the trial judge and counsel referred
to earlier, it would appear that the trial judge and defence
counsel were under the impression that an accused could only put
his character in issue by calling character witnesses.  With
respect, that is not the law.  A correct statement of the law is
found at p. 346 of R. v. McNamara, supra:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Manifestly, an accused does not put his character in issue
          by denying his guilt and repudiating the allegations made against
          him, nor by giving an explanation of matters which are essential
          to his defence.  An accused is not entitled, however, under the
          guise of repudiating the allegations against himself to assert
          expressly or impliedly that he would not have done the things
          alleged against him because he is a person of good character; if
          he does, he puts his character in issue.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[69] Once the appellant placed his character in issue, the Crown
was entitled to lead evidence designed to level the playing field
and provide the jury with a yardstick against which to measure
the clear and unmistakable impression that the appellant sought
to convey, namely, that he was not the type of person to commit
the offences in question.  As was pointed out in R. v. McNamara,
supra, at p. 350, where an accused puts his character in issue,
thereby opening the door to cross-examination on his past
conduct, the proof of previous bad conduct can be used in two
ways: (i) to rebut his claim to a good character; and (ii) to
impugn his credibility at large.6
[70] For these reasons, I am satisfied that the evidence
surrounding the 1956 assault conviction was properly admitted.
Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3 &#150; Failure to instruct the jury on the limited use of
          the appellant&#146;s criminal record</pre>
    <pre>[71] In his charge, the trial judge made no mention of the
appellant&#146;s criminal record and defence counsel raised no
objection.
[72] The appellant now submits that the trial judge erred in
failing to give the traditional instruction that the appellant&#146;s
criminal record could only be used to assess his credibility and
not to show that he was the type of person likely to commit the
crimes with which he was charged.
[73] There can be no doubt that the trial judge erred in failing
to give the appropriate limiting instruction.  In the
circumstances, however, I am of the view that the error was
harmless and occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.  In the overall scheme of things, the prior offences
were trivial and apart from the 1956 assault conviction, which
the jury was entitled to use to rebut the accused&#146;s evidence of
good character and impugn his credibility, they were wholly
unrelated to the allegations against the appellant.
[74] In my view, it is fanciful to think that the jury would have
used the prior convictions to infer that the appellant was the
type of person likely to commit the offences in question. As
well, given that the offences of possession of burglary tools and
theft under $200 involve an element of dishonesty, it would not
have enured to the appellant&#146;s benefit had the jury been told
that they could take this into account in assessing his
credibility.
[75] On balance, when the various factors are weighed, including
defence counsel&#146;s failure to object, I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.  In short, I am satisfied that the
verdicts would inevitably have been the same had the trial judge
properly instructed the jury on the limited use to be made of the
appellant&#146;s criminal record.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 4 &#150; Failure to provide legal instruction on the use of
          prior inconsistent statements</pre>
    <pre>[76] In his charge, the trial judge told the jury in general
terms that prior inconsistent statements could be used to assess
a witness&#146;s credibility.  He did not, however, instruct the jury
that prior inconsistent statements could only be considered as
original evidence if adopted as truthful by the witness.
[77] The appellant does not complain about the lack of
instruction in relation to any of the witnesses called by the
Crown.  Rather, his concern relates solely to the witness K.L.W.,
one of the appellant&#146;s twin sons, who was called by the defence
and who gave evidence that by and large supported his father&#146;s
testimony.
[78] As is apparent from the record, K.L.W. was vigorously and
effectively cross-examined by Crown counsel.  On numerous
occasions, he was confronted with his evidence from the
preliminary hearing which directly contradicted his trial
evidence on significant issues.  In each instance, K.L.W.
maintained that his trial testimony was true and he refused to
adopt his prior inconsistent evidence.
[79] In oral argument, counsel for the appellant fairly conceded
that as a result of the cross-examination, K.L.W.&#146;s trial
testimony was rendered worthless.  In other words, for the
purposes of the appeal, he accepts that the substance of K.L.W.&#146;s
trial testimony can be taken off the table.  He maintains,
however, that in failing to instruct the jury that K.L.W.&#146;s
unadopted evidence from the preliminary hearing could not be
considered as original evidence, the jury may well have used it
for that purpose, thereby occasioning serious prejudice to the
appellant.
[80] Unquestionably, the trial judge erred in failing to give the
appropriate limiting instruction to the jury.  Nonetheless, I am
satisfied that this error occasioned no harm to the appellant.
When the contradictions arising from the preliminary hearing are
closely scrutinized, it is apparent that they either relate to
the conduct of P.M., not the appellant, or to matters which the
appellant readily acknowledged in his evidence.
[81] For example, in relation to P.M., at trial, K.L.W. claimed
that he saw her feeding feces, urine and dog food to the
children.  At the preliminary inquiry, he denied seeing any such
thing.  Likewise, at trial, he denied ever seeing the children in
cages.  At the preliminary hearing, he claimed that he had seen
P.M. putting the children in cages and when he raised the matter
with his father, his father expressed utter disbelief.
[82] As for contradictions involving his father, at trial, K.L.W.
testified that the appellant always admitted that he was K.W.&#146;s
father.  At the preliminary hearing, he maintained that for
years, his father denied that K.W. was his child.  For his part,
the appellant readily accepted that K.W. was his child and the
question of paternity was a non-issue at trial.  In any event,
even if the jury accepted K.L.W.&#146;s preliminary hearing evidence
on this point, the risk of prejudice to the appellant was slight.
The issue at trial with respect to P.M. was whether the appellant
was having a sexual relationship with her before she turned 16,
not after.
[83] Another example relates to K.L.W.&#146;s evidence about his
father holding his and his brother&#146;s hands over a hot element on
the stove.  On this subject, K.L.W.&#146;s evidence at trial differed
in detail from his evidence at the preliminary hearing but he was
consistent throughout that neither he nor his brother was
injured, that the discipline was measured and that his father was
in control at all times.  For his part, in-chief, the appellant
admitted to holding his sons&#146; hands over the stove.  His evidence
did not differ from that of K.L.W. in any material respects.
[84] In these circumstances, the risk of prejudice to the
appellant was minimal to non-existent.  To the extent, if any,
that the jury may have used K.L.W.&#146;s testimony from the
preliminary hearing as original evidence, it was P.M. who stood
to lose, not the appellant.  Accordingly, the proviso can safely
be applied to sustain the convictions.  Had the trial judge
instructed the jury properly on the limited use of prior
inconsistent statements, in my view, the verdicts would
inevitably have been the same.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 5 &#150; Failure to instruct the jury on the use to be made
          of the evidence at large in assessing the appellant&#146;s guilt
          or innocence on a particular count</pre>
    <pre>[85] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
to instruct the jury that in determining the appellant&#146;s guilt or
innocence on a particular count, they were only to consider the
evidence directly related to that count.  In the alternative, the
appellant submits that to the extent the jury was entitled to
consider the evidence at large in deciding his guilt or innocence
on a particular count, the trial judge failed to explain how the
evidence could be used and more importantly, how it could not be
used.  In particular, the appellant contends that it was
essential that the jury be told that they could not use evidence
of similar acts or other reprehensible acts attributed to the
appellant to show that he was the type of person likely to commit
the offences in question.
[86] Dividing this submission into its component parts, there are
two reasons why the first aspect of the appellant&#146;s argument
cannot succeed.  The first relates to the strategy adopted by the
defence at trial; the second to the variety of legitimate uses
which the jury was entitled to make of the evidence at large in
determining the appellant&#146;s guilt or innocence on a particular
count.
[87] Beginning with the defence strategy at trial, notably,
defence counsel did not move to sever the counts in the
indictment; nor did he raise any objection about the trial
judge&#146;s failure to provide the kind of limiting instructions that
the appellant now claims he should have.
[88] Defence counsel knew all along that in support of its
position, the Crown was relying upon the evidence at large to
show a pattern of abusive conduct on the part of the appellant
towards his children and step-children.  Indeed, in his closing
address, defence counsel used the Crown&#146;s &#147;pattern of abuse&#148;
theory to gain important mileage for his client.  The Crown&#146;s
theory, he contended, could not be correct, because if it were,
one would expect to see allegations of abuse from 1972, when K.W.
was born, to and including 1981, when P.M. left the appellant,
taking the children with her.  And yet, no explanation was
offered to account for the five year gap  in the indictment
between 1972 and 1977, when no allegations of abuse were made
against the appellant.  In other words, the defence was quite
content to have the jury look at the whole of the evidence in
deciding whether the Crown had proved the appellant&#146;s guilt on
any particular count.
[89] Having adopted that strategy, it hardly lies with the
appellant to argue now, for the first time on appeal, that the
trial judge should have instructed the jury to confine itself to
evidence directly related to a particular count in deciding the
appellant&#146;s guilt or innocence on that count.
[90] In any event, regardless of defence counsel&#146;s strategy, I am
satisfied that there were many legitimate uses which the jury
could make of the evidence at large in determining the
appellant&#146;s guilt or innocence on a particular count.  Taken as
whole, the evidence discloses a pattern of abusive conduct on the
part of the appellant towards two families spanning two
generations.  Domination, subjugation and systemic brutalization
are the common themes that thread their way through the evidence.
Aside from his own testimony, the picture of the appellant that
emerges is that of a self-indulgent man, filled with his own
sense of self-importance and imbued with the belief that his
wives and children were his personal chattels to do with as he
saw fit.  The theory of the Crown, amply supported by the
evidence, was that the appellant&#146;s abusive conduct manifested
itself in different ways.  In the case of his two step-daughters,
T.M. and P.M., it took the form of degrading and dehumanizing
sexual abuse.  In the case of the children in general, it
involved intimidation, violence and monstrous acts of cruelty and
degradation.
[91] For present purposes, I see no need to explain in detail the
various uses which the jury was entitled to make of the evidence
at large in deciding the appellant&#146;s guilt or innocence on a
particular count.  Suffice it to say that the evidence as a whole
could be used for a variety of purposes, including:</pre>
    <pre>         to establish the appellant&#146;s motive for committing the
          offences. (See R. v. F. (D.S.) (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 106
          (Ont. C.A.));
         to reveal the true nature of the appellant&#146;s relationship
          with his children and stepchildren. (See R. v. Litchfield (1993),
          86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 116 (S.C.C.));
         to explain the reason for delayed disclosure and the failure
          on the part of E.M. and P.M. to leave abusive relationships.
          (See R. v. F. (D.S.), supra, at 107 and R. v. B. (F.F.) (1993),
          79 C.C.C. (3d) 112 at 137 (S.C.C.));
         to prove a pattern of abusive conduct on the appellant&#146;s
          part towards his children, thereby lending credence to the
          testimony of the individual complainants and belying the defence
          of innocent association.  (See R. v. B. (F.F.), supra, at 137; R.
          v. C.R.B. (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 27 and 28 (S.C.C.) and R.
          v. Litchfield, supra, at 116 and 117); and
         to rebut the appellant&#146;s self-portrayal as a man of high
          moral and ethical character and impugn his credibility at large.
          (See R. v. McNamara, supra, at 350).</pre>
    <pre>[92] Admittedly, certain aspects of the evidence at large could
not be used as positive evidence of guilt.  For example, as
stated earlier, evidence of bad character which did not
constitute similar fact evidence could only be used to rebut
evidence of good character and to impugn the appellant's
credibility.  By the same token, other aspects of the evidence at
large could be used as positive evidence of guilt.  For example,
if the jury were satisfied that the evidence disclosed a pattern
of abusive conduct on the part of the appellant towards his
children and step-children, this could be used to lend credence
to the testimony of a particular complainant.  Likewise, to the
extent that the jury was satisfied of the appellant&#146;s need to
dominate and control, this could be used to establish motive on
his part and shed light on the true nature of his relationship
with the children.
[93] Regrettably, the trial judge did not instruct the jury on
the uses that could be made of the evidence at large in assessing
the guilt or innocence of the appellant on a particular count.
More importantly, from the appellant&#146;s perspective, he also
failed to direct the jury that they could not use evidence of
similar acts or other morally reprehensible acts attributed to
the appellant to show that he was the sort of person likely to
commit the offences in question.  Manifestly, the trial judge
erred in failing to provide the requisite limiting instructions.
(See R. v. B. (F.F.), supra, at 138 and R. v. R.(K.N.) (1997),
114 C.C.C. (3d) 40 at 47 (Ont. C.A.).)  Accordingly, the only
remaining question is whether s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code can be invoked to the cure the error.
[94] In R. v. B. (F.F.), supra, the Supreme Court of Canada
observed that s. 686(1)(b)(iii) is only to be used in rare and
exceptional circumstances.  As Lamer C.J. pointed out at p. 117,
the curative proviso must be used with &#147;great circumspection&#148;
lest accused persons be deprived &#147;of the right to have their
guilt or innocence determined by a properly instructed jury of
their peers.&#148;  Similarly, at p. 140 of that decision, Iacoubucci
J. commented that &#147;[s]ection 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code
is for use in exceptional cases only&#133;.&#148;
[95] Where the Crown invites an appellate court to apply the
curative proviso in a case such as this, where the jury has not
received proper legal instruction, to succeed, the Crown must
establish (i) that the error was minor and inconsequential and
could not possibly have affected the verdict; or (ii) that
although the error was potentially serious, the evidence is so
overwhelming that the verdict would inevitably have been the same
had the jury been properly instructed.
[96] In this case, the error in question was serious in the sense
that it was realistically capable of occasioning prejudice to the
appellant.  (See R. v. B. (F.F.), supra, at 139.)  Accordingly,
if the Crown is to succeed, it must demonstrate that the evidence
against the appellant was overwhelming.
[97] Unquestionably, the hurdle is a difficult one.  As was
pointed out in R. v. B.(F.F.), supra, it becomes all the more
difficult in cases like this where credibility is the central
issue at trial.  Nonetheless, I do not read R. v. B. (F.F.) as
foreclosing the availability of the proviso in such cases.
[98] In the end, I have concluded that this is one of those rare
and exceptional cases where the Crown has met its onus.  In
reviewing the evidence, I have taken pains to show that in every
instance, apart from the allegations of sexual abuse involving
T.M., multiple witnesses provided corroborative evidence
substantiating material aspects of the testimony given by each
complainant.
[99] Commencing with the allegation of assault causing bodily
harm upon P.M., P.M.&#146;s evidence was corroborated by no less than
three witnesses, T.M., E.M. and R.M. With respect to the
allegations of sexual abuse upon P.M., P.M.&#146;s testimony was
likewise corroborated by three witnesses, E.M., K.T.W. and S.M.
[100]     As for the allegations of unlawful confinement,
administering a noxious substance and assault in relation to
M.W., S.W. and T.W., apart from confirming each others testimony,
additional confirmation is found in the evidence of P.M., K.W.,
K.T.W., C.H. and L.B.
[101]     In these circumstances, I am satisfied that had the
trial judge provided the proper limiting instructions on the use
and misuse of the evidence at large, the verdicts would
inevitably have been the same.  In short, the evidence against
the appellant on the counts involving P.M. and his three natural
sons was staggering, such that it can safely be said that the
error occasioned no miscarriage of justice.
[102]     In coming to this conclusion, I have not ignored the
appellant&#146;s evidence; nor have I ignored the fact that it is not
the function of an appellate court to make findings of
credibility.  That said, in deciding whether the evidence is so
overwhelming that a properly instructed jury would inevitably
convict, a court of appeal is surely entitled to examine and to
some extent, weigh and consider the effect of the evidence, just
as it does when determining whether a verdict is unreasonable.
(See R. v. W. (R.) (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 134 (S.C.C.).)  Were it
otherwise, there would be no room to apply the proviso in cases
of serious error where credibility is the central issue at trial.
As stated earlier, that is not the law.
[103]     Having examined and weighed the appellant&#146;s evidence
within the limits permitted, I am satisfied that no jury,
properly instructed and acting reasonably, could possibly give
effect to it.  Standing alone against the evidence of no less
than 10 family members, the appellant&#146;s testimony is filled with
hyperbole and marked by glaring contradictions and
inconsistencies on issues of singular importance.  Viewed
objectively, even the most charitable onlooker would be forced to
admit that the appellant&#146;s evidence is incredulous and deserving
of little or no weight.  In the final analysis, having assessed
the appellant&#146;s evidence, I am of the view that it is virtually
worthless and it poses no impediment to the application of the
curative proviso.
[104]     As indicated, the allegations involving T.M. stand on
somewhat different footing.  In short, there is no direct
evidence confirming her allegations of sexual abuse against the
appellant.  That said, had the jury been properly instructed,
they would have been told that P.M.&#146;s testimony was capable of
confirming T.M.&#146;s evidence.  Unquestionably, on the counts
involving T.M., P.M.&#146;s evidence was properly admissible as
similar fact evidence.  Moreover, as I have pointed out, the
entire body of evidence concerning the appellant&#146;s pattern of
abusive conduct towards his children and step-children was
properly admissible as similar fact evidence and it could be used
to lend credence to T.M.&#146;s testimony.
[105]     In these circumstances, I am satisfied that had the
jury been properly instructed, the verdicts on the counts
involving T.M. would inevitably have been the same.  Accordingly,
I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[106]     The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment
totalling 18-1/2 years.  He was 58 years old at the time of
sentencing and although not a first offender, his criminal record
was dated and involved relatively minor offences.
[107]     The appellant submits that having regard to his age and
minor criminal record, the sentence of 18-1/2 years is manifestly
unfit and far beyond the range of sentences imposed in like
cases.  I disagree.
[108]     There is no need to dwell upon the gravity and
seriousness of the offences for which the appellant was
convicted.  Suffice it to say that over the course of two
generations, he systematically brutalized his step-children and
natural children, subjecting them to acts of violence,
degradation and cruelty of unspeakable proportions.  If ever
there was a case of stark horror, this is it.
[109]     The following excerpt from a report co-authored by Dr.
Peter Jaffe and Ms. Samantha Poisson of the London Family Court
Clinic provides valuable insight into the enormity of the
consequences resulting from the appellant&#146;s 20 year long reign of
terror:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The senior author of this report has over one-quarter
          century experience working with victims and survivors of domestic
          violence through the police, courts, and mental health agencies.
          Mr. W.&#146;s abusive and violent behaviour would be in the category
          of the most severe form of family violence.  Mr. W. has been the
          architect of permanent mental health and adjustment problems for
          at least four of his victims.  It would be impossible to design a
          more horrific course of abuse and create more havoc on
          individuals&#146; lives than what Mr. W. has perpetrated on his
          victims.  He not only stole from the victims any possibility of a
          normal childhood and adolescence, but also, left permanent
          psychological scars and trauma beyond imagination.  At least four
          of his five victims will be forced to relive the trauma over and
          over again through flashbacks and nightmares.  Their adjustment,
          as adults, is forever compromised.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Mr. W.&#146;s abuse not only affected the
          victims in an historical sense but has also
          limited the victims&#146; future opportunity for
          recovery. Most trauma victims recover through
          supportive family relationships, caring
          communities, and trusted counsellors.  Mr. W.
          has violated the victims&#146; sense of trust that
          would allow them to develop the necessary
          relationships for their recovery.  They feel
          betrayed by family members who did not
          protect them or abandoned them at the time of
          their greatest need.  They have been so
          humiliated in their abuse, that they are
          suspicious of any supportive community
          members.  In other words, if society couldn&#146;t
          protect these victims for three decades, what
          can society (their community) do now?  Four
          of the victims show total disdain for the
          possibilities of any successful counselling.
          Although crises such as suicide attempts may
          draw them into the mental health system, they
          are distrustful of any therapist and feel
          hopeless about any real change.  The
          insidious nature of the abuse not only left
          four of the victims with permanent
          psychological scars, but also destroyed the
          chances of healing.</pre>
    <pre>[110]     In R. v. M. (C.A.) (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327, a case
which bears many similarities to this case, the Supreme Court of
Canada restored the 25 year sentence imposed upon the respondent
at trial for crimes involving a pattern of physical and sexual
abuse against his children over a number of years.  Manifestly,
the facts here are at least as egregious, if not more egregious
than those in R. v. M. (C.A.).  It follows, in my view, that the
appellant has no cause to complain about the length of his
sentence.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[111]     In the result, I would dismiss the appeal against
conviction.  I would grant leave to appeal the sentence and
dismiss the appeal.



Released: September 28, 1999
_______________________________
1     K.L.W.  was  vigorously and effectively  cross-examined  at
trial.  In oral argument, counsel for the appellant conceded that
his  trial  testimony  is virtually worthless  and  need  not  be
considered.
2    The evidence reveals that after moving away, P.M. engaged in
abusive  conduct  towards  the children  and  the  children  were
ultimately apprehended by the Childrens&#146; Aid Society.   P.M.  was
convicted of assault and sent to jail.
3    Section 644(1.1) of the Code was proclaimed in force on June
16,  1997.   It  enables trial judges, in the exercise  of  their
discretion,  to replace a juror in cases where the jury  has  not
yet begun to hear evidence.
4     In-chief, the appellant stated that at age 10,  his  mother
died and his sister, who was 19 years older, cared for him like a
mother.   He  loved her dearly and &#147;she became my mother  and  my
sister and the best friend I&#146;d ever have.&#148;
5    As is the case with most evidence, the trial judge retains a
discretion to exclude this type of evidence if its prejudicial
effect outweighs its probative value.  See R. v. McNamara, supra,
at p. 352.
6    The only established exception to this rule is for acts that
would  also  constitute evidence of similar  facts.  (See  R.  v.
McNamara, supra, at p. 350)</pre></td>
