    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) &#150;and&#150; L. M.
               (A Young Person) (Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>COUNSEL:       James Tomlinson, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               James A. Ramsay, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 4, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Belobradic J. dated
September 10, 1998.

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  We are not persuaded that the youth court judge misdirected
himself as to the standard of scrutiny applicable to the
testimony of the young complainant.  He was entitled to accept
her evidence as credible, which he did, and to convict the
appellant on all of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  As to the sentence appeal, in our opinion, this disposition
was not manifestly unfit or clearly unreasonable.  The youth
court judge had the benefit of a pre-disposition report.  In the
circumstances, denunciation and specific deterrence have to be
given great weight.  The appellant was found guilty of
participating in a gang assault involving multiple acts of
intercourse with four different men and the additional degrading
feature of multiple acts of oral sex and nude photography.
Sexually transmitted disease appears to have resulted along with
psychological trauma.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
