    <pre>HEARD:         September 21, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of His Honour Judge E.S. Lindsay
dated June 5, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We will assume that the appellant&#146;s contention that he did
not receive effective assistance of counsel raises a question of
law alone.
[2]  The failure to refresh the witness&#146;s memory does not in our
view fall below the competence standard.  The failure to place
the &#147;medical&#148; evidence before the trial judge does fall below the
competence standard.  Trial counsel in his affidavit admitted as
much.
[3]  The appellant cannot demonstrate that the failure to put the
medical evidence prejudiced him in the sense that there is a
reasonable probability that the verdict may have been different
had that evidence been placed before the trial judge.  Indeed,
the medical evidence may have assisted the Crown by providing
further cogent evidence of the appellant&#146;s motive for the
assault.
[4]  In any event, the trial judge did not decide this case based
on whether the complainant inadvertently ran over the applicant&#146;s
foot with her car.  He decided it on the basis of his assessment
of the credibility of the complainant and the applicant as it
related to the key issue at trial &#150; did the appellant
deliberately hit the complainant or did he strike her by
accident?  His determination was not predicated on any finding
with respect to whether the complainant&#146;s car actually ran over
the applicant&#146;s foot.
[5]  Leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
