COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and PHILIP

    <pre>HEARD:         March 17, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Philip Logan, was tried on a plea of not
guilty by the Honourable Mr. Justice Forestall and a jury on an
indictment charging him with second degree murder. The jury,
after deliberating for over seven hours, returned a verdict of
not guilty of murder but guilty of the included offence of
manslaughter. The appellant was sentenced to three and one half
years imprisonment. He appeals conviction and sentence.

[2]  The death of the victim arose out of a fight between the
appellant and the victim. Because of the disposition that we
propose, we intend to deal with but one ground of appeal and that
relates to the sufficiency of the charge to the jury with respect
to the issue of self defence.

[3]  The narrow but important issue is whether an error made by
the trial judge in his charge and subsequent recharge with
respect to s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code is cured by the
instruction in writing delivered to them later as a result of a
request from the jury.

[4]  The charge and the recharge had the effect of instructing
the jury that unless the appellant intended to cause death and
grievous bodily harm, s. 34(2) was not available to as a defence
to the homicide. The Crown concedes that this was an error. It
was a serious misdirection.

[5]  The jury, after it had deliberated for some time, made a
request of the trial judge in the following language:
          </pre>
    <pre>               We&#146;d like copies of the 4 questions we should be asking
          ourselves with reference to 34 1 &amp; 2 (self-defence). Judge
          reviewed them but we would like our own copies.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Subsequently, the trial judge delivered twelve copies to the
jury of his written response to their question. That response was
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>      Questions under section 34(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada
          </pre>
    <pre>               1)   Was the accused unlawfully
          assaulted by the deceased?
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)   Did the accused provoke the assault
          by the deceased?
          </pre>
    <pre>               3)   Was the force used by the accused
          in response to such unprovoked assault by the
          deceased intended to cause death or grievous
          bodily harm to the deceased?
          </pre>
    <pre>               4)   Was the force used by the accused
          no more than was necessary to enable him to
          defend himself against the deceased?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Questions under section 34(2) of the
          Criminal Code of Canada
          </pre>
    <pre>               1)   Was the accused unlawfully
          assaulted by the deceased?
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)   Did the accused, in repelling the
          deceased&#146;s assault, cause him death or
          grievous bodily harm whether or not he
          intended to do so?
          </pre>
    <pre>               3)   Did the accused, in causing the
          death of the deceased, do so under a
          reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
          bodily harm at the hands of Art Jones?
          </pre>
    <pre>               4)   Did the accused, in causing the
          death of the deceased, believe on reasonable
          and probable grounds that he could not
          otherwise preserve himself from death or
          grievous bodily harm at the hands of the
          deceased, Art Jones?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  At the same time as he delivered the written response, the
trial judge instructed the jury that this response was
substantially as he had charged them in the first instance. It is
common ground that the second question with respect to s. 34(2)
of the Code was correctly dealt with in the written response. But
this was not the instruction the trial judge had given earlier.

[8]  The Crown&#146;s submission is that this response, being the last
instruction to the jury on this issue, was sufficient to cure the
error in the original charge and recharge. We do not agree. At no
time did the trial judge specifically identify the error he had
made in the charge and recharge and relate the correct
instruction and its significance to the defence in the case in
appeal.

[9]  These sections, s. 34(1) and (2) of the Code, are not easy
of application. However, they are of particular importance to
this case where the victim was clearly the aggressor in pursuing
the appellant and instigating a fight that the appellant had made
every effort to avoid. We think that the trial judge&#146;s treatment
of this sensitive issue created sufficient confusion that we
cannot safely say that the verdict can stand.

[10] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside and a new trial is ordered on the charge of manslaughter.
