</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from a judgment of John DeP. Wright J. dated December
16, 1998 at Thunder Bay, Ontario.</pre>
      <pre>BORINS J.A.:
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by Leif Grann, the purchaser of a 500 acre
property from The Toronto-Dominion Bank (“TD”) pursuant to  power
of  sale contained in a mortgage from Rodney Logozzo to TD,  from
the  judgment of John deP. Wright J. declaring that  Logozzo  has
the  right to redeem the property prior to the closing of Grann’s
purchase from TD.
[2]  Subsequent to Grann and TD entering into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the property, Logozzo issued an application
to set aside the notice of sale issued by TD under the mortgage,
to stay the sale of the property to Grann and for other relief.
TD then issued a counter-application to add Grann as a respondent
to the proceedings and for directions respecting the status of
the sale.  TD took the position, in its supporting affidavit,
that it had no objection to Logozzo redeeming the mortgage,
provided that if the court permits him to do so, that it would
“not put the Bank at risk to any claim for damages by Mr. Grann”.
Consequently, TD asked the court to declare its agreement of
purchase and sale with Grann to be null and void if it permitted
Logozzo to redeem the mortgage. After he was added as a
respondent, Grann issued a counter-application in which he sought
a declaration that Logozzo was precluded from redeeming the
property by virtue of s.22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.M.40, and a judgment for specific performance of the
agreement of purchase and sale.  On the issues raised by the
parties, Wright J. ruled on only the right of Logozzo to redeem
the property.  However, it is implicit from his reasons that he
refused to stay the sale to Grann since he permitted Logozzo to
redeem the property prior to the closing of the Grann’s purchase
of the property.
[3]  One of the questions raised by this appeal is whether the
time within which a mortgagor is permitted to redeem the
mortgaged property under s. 22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act may be
extended by a provision in an agreement of purchase and sale
between the mortgagee, as the vendor under power of sale, and the
purchaser.  If the answer to this question is in the affirmative,
it must then be decided whether the mortgagor, not being a party
to the agreement of purchase and sale, can derive any benefit
from the provision.
[4]  To understand the discussion which follows, it is helpful to
reproduce s. 22(1)(a) of the Act and the provision in the Grann-
TD agreement of purchase and sale which is the focus of this
appeal.
[5]  Section 22(1) of the Mortgages Act reads as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               22.-(1) Despite any agreement to the contrary, where default
          has occurred in making any payment of principal or interest due
          under a mortgage or in the observance of any covenant in a
          mortgage and under the terms of the mortgage, by reason of such
          default, the whole principal and interest secured thereby has
          become due and payable,
          </pre>
      <pre>                     (a)  at any time before sale under
               the mortgage; or
               </pre>
      <pre>                     (b)  before the commencement of an
               action for the enforcement of the rights of
               the  mortgagee or of any person claiming
               through or under the mortgagee,
          </pre>
      <pre>                 the   mortgagor   may   perform   such
          covenant  or  pay the amount  due  under  the
          mortgage,   exclusive  of   the   money   not
          payable   by  reason  merely  of   lapse   of
          time,   and   pay  any  expenses  necessarily
          incurred  by  the  mortgagee,  and  thereupon
          the    mortgagor   is   relieved   from   the
          consequences of such default.</pre>
      <pre>[6]   The  agreement of purchase and sale between  Grann  and  TD
contains  a  schedule which forms part of the agreement.   It  is
part  of  the  Ontario  Real Estate Association’s  standard  form
agreement  of  purchase and sale when a vendor is  selling  under
power of sale.  The italicized portion of paragraph 2 is relevant
to  the issues in this appeal.  The schedule, which is signed  by
Grann and TD, reads, in part, as follows:
</pre>
      <pre>                   Ontario Real Estate Association
                  VENDOR SELLING UNDER POWER OF SALE

          </pre>
      <pre>          Attached to and forming part of Agreement  of
          Purchase  and Sale between “LEIF  GRANN”  and

          “22ND” day of “OCTOBER”, 19”98”.
          </pre>
      <pre>          1.   It is understood that the Vendor is selling as mortgagee
          under a Power of Sale contained in a “FIRST MORTGAGE &amp; FINANCING”
          mortgage made to the Vendor, dated the  “29” day of “Nov.” . 19
          “96” and registered as number “8520”.</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
2.   It is further understood that on the date of acceptance of
this offer there is default under the terms of the mortgage which
entitles the Vendor to exercise the Power of Sale.  The only
evidence of the default, which the Purchaser may require, shall
be a statutory declaration by the Vendor setting forth the facts
entitling the Vendor to sell under the Power of Sale, including
the particulars of the notice of exercising the Power of Sale,
the names of the persons upon whom service of the notice has been
effected, and declaring that default under the mortgage entitling
the Vendor to exercise the Power of Sale has continued up to and
including the date of acceptance of this offer and to the time of
closing. The Purchaser understands and agrees that the mortgagor
has the right to redeem the property up to the time of waiver or
expiration of all rights of termination or fulfillment of all
conditions, and this Agreement is subject to that right.  In the
event of redemption, by the mortgagor, this agreement shall be
null and void and only deposit monies paid will be refunded
without interest. [Emphasis added.]

      <pre>          
FACTS
</pre>
      <pre>[7]   The  land  in issue is a 500 acre unoccupied  water  access
wilderness tract on Lake Superior in the District of Thunder Bay.
It  consists  of a small island and lakeshore property  on  which
there  are no buildings.  Logozzo purchased the land in 1994  for
$75,000.   On November 29, 1996, he mortgaged the land to  TD  to
secure an indebtedness of $50,000.
[8]  Default occurred in the payment of the debts secured by the
mortgage in September 1997, following which TD made a number of
demands for payment which Logozzo ignored.  Consequently, on
April 17, 1998, TD served Logozzo with a notice of sale under the
power of sale in the mortgage requesting payment of the principal
amount of the mortgage, together with the interest unpaid and
owing.  The notice warned Logozzo that “unless the said sums are
paid on or before the 25th day of May, 1998, I shall sell the
property covered by the said mortgage under the provisions
contained in it”.  The mortgagor made no efforts to redeem the
property by May 25, 1998.
[9]  In October, 1998, TD listed the land for sale with a realtor
at $79,900, which was the asking price recommended by the realtor
with whom it was listed. Grann submitted an offer to purchase the
land for $80,000 on October 22, 1998.  The offer was accepted by
TD on October 23, 1998.  It contained a closing date of December
21, 1998 and allowed Grann until December 1, 1998 to examine the
title.  On October 27, 1998, the agreement was amended to change
these dates to November 16, 1998 and November 13, 1998,
respectively.
[10] On November 5, 1998, Logozzo received an offer from Lloyd
Purnell to purchase the land for $211,000, with a closing date of
November 20, 1998, four days after the closing date in the Grann-
TD agreement of purchase and sale.  Logozzo accepted the offer
and brought it to TD’s attention.  This offer was conditional on
Purnell obtaining the necessary funds to purchase the land by
November 8, 1998.  There was no evidence before Wright J. that
the condition was fulfilled, extended or waived.  Indeed, there
was no evidence that Logozzo would be able to redeem the property
prior to the scheduled closing date of the Grann-TD agreement,
either as a result of the proposed Purnell purchase, or by any
other means.  Purnell was not a party to the proceedings.  Nor
did Logozzo supply any evidence that Purnell was financially able
to complete the transaction.  The absence of such evidence, in my
view, is not without significance.
[11] On November 6, 1998, Logozzo issued his application to
prevent TD’s sale to Grann on November 16, 1998. His intention in
bringing the application was to permit him to sell the land to
Purnell, which would enable him to apparently “redeem the
mortgage”.  The application was made returnable on November 12,
1998, as was TD’s counter-application.  At Grann’s request, the
applications were adjourned, on consent, on terms that the rights
of the parties were preserved, as in the interim the closing
dates of the two offers would occur.  Following the conclusion of
the proceedings on November 23, 1998, Wright J. reserved judgment
until December 13, 1998 and endorsed the record: “All rights and
remedies suspended in the meantime.”  It is common ground among
the parties that their rights remain in suspension pending the
determination of this appeal.
[12] It should be noted that on the date fixed for closing by the
agreement of purchase and sale – November 16, 1998 – Grann
tendered on TD the amount due on closing, which it rejected on
the ground that Logozzo wished to redeem the property.  It was
explained by counsel that Grann, who considers the property to be
unique, did so out of an abundance of caution, not wishing to
lose the opportunity to acquire it.</pre>
      <pre>REASONS OF WRIGHT J.</pre>
      <pre>[13]  Wright  J. considered, and rejected, the following  grounds
advanced  by Logozzo in support of his position that he  had  the
right to redeem the property: defects in the notice of sale;  the
sale  of  the  property  to Grann for an improvident  price;  and
defects in the Grann-TD agreement of purchase and sale.   In  the
course   of   considering  these  grounds,  Wright  J.  observed,
correctly in my view, that a “sale” occurs within the meaning  of
s.22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act when the vendor and the purchaser
have  entered  into an agreement of purchase and  sale  with  the
result, generally speaking, that the mortgagor’s right to  redeem
is put to an end.
[14] Wright J. then considered the issue that has given rise to
this appeal.  He quoted the italicized portion of paragraph 2 of
the schedule to the agreement of purchase and sale which I have
quoted in paragraph [6].  For the sake of convenience, I will
repeat that part of paragraph 2:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The purchaser understands and agrees that the mortgagor has
          the right to redeem the property up to the time of waiver or
          expiration of all rights of termination or fulfillment of all
          conditions, and this agreement is subject to that right.  In the
          event of redemption by the mortgagor, this agreement shall be
          null and void and any deposit monies paid will be refunded
          without interest.</pre>
      <pre>[15]  Both  Logozzo and TD take the position that the  effect  of
this  language is to extend the mortgagor’s right to  redeem  the
property from the statutory time permitted by s. 22(1)(a) of  the
Mortgages Act to the date fixed by the agreement of purchase  and
sale for the closing of the sale by TD to Grann.
[16] As I understand Logozzo’s position before Wright J. and this
court, it is that the language of paragraph 2 creates, as a
condition precedent to the closing of the Grann purchase, the
expiry of the right of the mortgagor to redeem the property at
any time prior to the closing date of the Grann-TD transaction.
In other words, the closing of the transaction is conditional on
Logozzo not redeeming the property prior to the time to which
Grann and TD agreed for closing.
[17] In addition to adopting Logozzo’s position, TD advanced
another reason why, at the date Logozzo commenced his
application, the language of paragraph 2 of the schedule
permitted him to redeem the property.  Paragraphs 8 and 10 of the
agreement of purchase and sale concern the right of the purchaser
to examine the title to the property and to raise any objection
to title. In reliance on these paragraphs, TD submitted that
Grann’s right to terminate the agreement arising from any
objection to title he might have had not been waived, nor had it
expired.  Grann had until November 13, 1998 to examine the title
V which was seven days after Logozzo issued his notice of
application.
[18] After reciting the relevant part of paragraph 2 of the
schedule, Wright J. concluded his reasons as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The courts have held that where the subsequent agreement of
          purchase and sale preserves the right of a mortgagor to redeem
          right up to closing, then this is a right which may be exercised
          by the mortgagor.
          </pre>
      <pre>               In National Trust v. Saad 10 R.P.R. (3d)
          145  Abbey J. held that a similar clause gave
          a mortgagor a continuing right of redemption.
          </pre>
      <pre>                 I   have  some  difficulty  with  this
          conclusion.
          </pre>
      <pre>                The  law  should strive for  certainty.
          This  is so particularly where title to  land
          is  involved.  There is a difference  between
          an  agreement where the parties affirmatively
          stipulate that the mortgagor shall  have  the
          right of redemption up to the date of closing
          and an agreement which simply recognizes that
          a  mortgagor has certain rights  at  law  but
          does  not  extend  those rights.  If  I  were
          dealing with this clause at first instance  I
          would   have  concluded  that  this  schedule
          simply recognizes that until the agreement of
          purchase   and  sale  crystallizes   by   the
          satisfaction of all conditions and the waiver
          of  all  other  terms that agreement  is  not
          binding  and  the right of the  mortgagor  to
          redeem  continues,  but  once  the  agreement
          crystallizes the right of redemption is lost.
          </pre>
      <pre>                I  am  not dealing with this clause  at
          first   instance  however.   Abbey,  J.   has
          construed  this  clause and his  construction
          represents  the  law of this  province  until
          reversed by a higher court.
          </pre>
      <pre>                Under  the circumstances the  mortgagor
          has a right to redeem prior to closing.</pre>
      <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
      <pre>[19]  In  my  view, on the facts before Wright  J.  at  the  time
Logozzo  issued his notice of application, there are a number  of
reasons why he was not entitled to redeem the land secured by the
mortgage.</pre>
      <pre>                                                  I</pre>
      <pre>[20]  The  first  reason raises the issue of  whether,  under  s.
22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act, Logozzo was entitled to redeem the
property  after  TD  had  entered into  a  binding  agreement  of
purchase and sale with Grann.
[21] It is common ground that absent paragraph 2 of the schedule,
s.22(1)(a) permitted Logozzo to redeem the property “at any time
before sale under the mortgage”.  The effect of this provision is
to extend the time to redeem from the time in the notice of sale
– May 25, 1998 – to the time of the sale of the property pursuant
to the power of sale in the Logozzo – TD mortgage.
[22] Section 22 of the present Act originally formed part of s.
19a of the Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 239, having been
enacted in 1953: S.O. 1953, c. 66, s. 1.  Section 19a was divided
into two sections in R.S.O. 1970, c. 279, with s. 21 of the 1970
Act being s. 22 of the present Act.  It has remained unchanged
since 1970.  The purpose of s. 21(1), of the 1970 Act, and its
application, are outlined in Rayner &amp; McLaren, Falconbridge on
Mortgages, 4th ed., (1977) at 721-22:
          </pre>
      <pre>               … [I]t permits the mortgagor to put the mortgage in good
          standing at any time before sale upon payment of any money due,
          ‘exclusive of the money not payable by reason merely of lapse of
          time’ together with payments of costs.  Payment must, however, be
          made or tendered before an agreement for sale has been entered
          into by the mortgagee with a third party even where the agreement
          is said to be subject to the right of the mortgagor to redeem or
          put the mortgage into good standing. Before a mortgagor can
          obtain the benefit of s. 21 he must pay all arrears for such
          payment is a condition precedent to relief.  A vague hope of the
          mortgagor to find further financing, even where the security is
          ample is not sufficient reason to stay the sale proceedings.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[23]  As  authority for the proposition that the right to  redeem
must  be  exercised  before the mortgagee  has  entered  into  an
agreement  of purchase and sale with a third party,  “even  where
the agreement is said to be subject to the right of the mortgagor
to  redeem  or put the mortgage into good standing”, the  authors
rely  on,  inter  alia,  Re  Mission  Construction  Ltd.  &amp;  Seel
Investments Ltd., [1973] 2 O.R. 190 (H.C.J.).
[24] In Mission Construction, a mortgagor applied for an order to
stay the sale of his property under power of sale to enable him
to put the mortgage in good standing.  At the time the
application was commenced, the mortgagee had accepted an offer to
purchase the property.  In dismissing the application, Lieff J.
stated at 191-92:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Section 21(1)(a) provides that a mortgagor may put a
          mortgage in good standing “at any time before sale under the
          mortgage”.  The acceptance of an offer to purchase constitutes a
          “sale”, so that the applicant lost its rights under this section
          on February 28, 1973.  It was argued, however, that this right
          has remained in existence to the present date due to the
          following clause in the offer to purchase:
               </pre>
      <pre>                    Acceptance by the Vendor hereof shall be
               subject  to  the rights if  any  of  the
               registered  owner  of  the  property  to
               redemption or to put the Vendor’s mortgage in
               good standing.
          </pre>
      <pre>                I  cannot  accept this  argument.   The
          right  of  the  applicant under  s.  21(1)(a)
          to   put   the  mortgage  in  good   standing
          ended  on  the  acceptance of  the  offer  to
          purchase.   The  “rights  if  any”   referred
          to   in   the   above  clause  include   only
          those   rights   whose  existence   was   not
          terminated   by   the   acceptance   of   the
          offer,   such  as  the  right  to  redemption
          upon  proof  that  the  sale  was  fraudulent
          or improper.</pre>
      <pre>[25]  This  court agreed with this interpretation  of  former  s.
21(1)(a) of the Act in Theodore Daniels Ltd. v. Income Trust  Co.
(1982),  37  O.R. (2d) 316.  On behalf of the court,  Lacourcière
J.A. stated at 319:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The relief granted to the mortgagor may be obtained pursuant
          to s. 21(1)(a) at any time before sale under the mortgage.  Thus
          the mortgagor may perform the covenant or pay the arrears, etc.,
          before any action is commenced, after a notice of exercising
          power of sale has been served but before the actual sale. Sale in
          this context has been interpreted as meaning acceptance of an
          offer.  See Re Mission Construction Ltd. and Seel Investments
          Ltd., [1973] 2 O.R. 190 at 191, 33 D.L.R. (3d) 286.</pre>
      <pre>Thus, a contract of sale entered into by the mortgagor after  the
mortgagee has entered into a contract of sale to a third party in
the  exercise of his or her power of sale, can have no effect  on
the mortgagee’s exercise of the power of sale.</pre>
      <pre>[26]  Almost  90 years ago, before there was legislation  on  the
subject,  the  court considered whether a mortgagor could  redeem
the  property  after  the  mortgagee had  accepted  an  offer  to
purchase  the property which was being sold under power of  sale:
Standard Realty Co. v. Nicholson (1911), 24 O.L.R. 46 (K.B.).  In
this case, the mortgagor presented the mortgagee with a certified
cheque  for  the  sum  due on the mortgage, which  the  mortgagee
rejected as the land was subject to an agreement of purchase  and
sale, which was later completed.
[27] Riddell J. allowed the purchaser’s action against the
mortgagor, Nicholson, for possession of the property.  It was
significant to him that the purchaser had acquired rights under
the contract it had entered into with the mortgagee.  At p. 55 he
stated:
          </pre>
      <pre>               A binding contract for sale being entered into by the
          mortgagee, before any notice of any intention to redeem, I think
          that Mrs. Nicholson lost any right she previously had so to
          redeem.
          </pre>
      <pre>                In  Kenney v. Barnard (1910), 17 O.W.R.
          889,  2 O.W.N. 470, the second mortgagee,  on
          the  day  of a sale under the first mortgage,
          called  on the purchaser and offered him  the
          amount of his deposit and $25 for his trouble
          –  he  also made a legal tender to the  first
          mortgagee of the amount due, etc. Mr. Justice
          Sutherland  says  (17 O.W.R.  p.  900):  “The
          tender made after the sale was so made  at  a
          time  when  both  vendor and  purchaser  were
          bound by the agreement that had been made.  .
          .  .  The  vendor would have been willing  to
          cancel  the sale and permit the plaintiff  to
          redeem.  The purchaser . . . was unwilling to
          forgo  his  bargain. . . . He  declined,  and
          could  not, I think, be compelled to do  so.”
          An action brought by the second mortgagee was
          dismissed   with  costs.    I   follow   this
          decision,  and  wholly agree  in  my  learned
          brother’s conclusion.</pre>
      <pre>[28] In addition, Riddell J. discussed the distinction between  a
mortgagor’s  right to redeem after a final order of  foreclosure,
and  the  right to do so after a sale under power  of  sale.   He
pointed  out, at pp. 55-6, that  the authorities permit  a  final
order of foreclosure to be opened up in appropriate circumstances
to  allow a mortgagor to redeem.  This right, however, depends on
the  exercise  of  a discretion by the court depending  upon  the
circumstances  of each particular case.  On the  other  hand,  to
permit  a  mortgagor to redeem after the property has  been  sold
upon power of sale, as in this appeal, would require the court to
interfere with rights accruing to the purchaser and the mortgagee
under  their contract of purchase and sale.  In other  words,  it
would  interfere with the mortgagee’s contractual right  to  sell
under  power of sale contained in the mortgage entered into  with
the mortgagor, as well as the contractual rights of the mortgagee
and  the purchaser arising from the contract of sale under  power
of sale.
[29] A similar approach was taken by Crossman J. in Waring (Lord)
v. London &amp; Manchester Assurance Company, Limited, [1935] 1 Ch.
310. In that case, a mortgagee, exercising a power of sale
pursuant to s. 101 of the Law of Property Act, 15 Geo. 5, c. 20,
had entered into a contract to sell the mortgaged property.
Subsequently, the mortgagor tendered the monies due under the
mortgage and sought an injunction to prevent the completion of
the sale on the ground that it had not been completed.
[30] In refusing to issue an injunction on this ground, Crossman
J. had this to say at pp. 317-18:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The contract is an absolute contract, not conditional in any
          way, and the sale is expressed to be made by the company as
          mortgagee.  If, before the date of the contract, the plaintiff
          had tendered the principal with interest and costs, or had paid
          it into Court in proceedings, then, if the company had continued
          to take steps to enter into a contract for sale, or had purported
          to do so, the plaintiff would, in my opinion, have been entitled
          to an injunction restraining it from doing so.  After a contract
          has been entered into, however, it is, in my judgment, perfectly
          clear (subject to what has been said to me to-day) that the
          mortgagee (in the present case, the company) can be restrained
          from completing only on the ground that he has not acted in good
          faith and that the sale is therefore liable to be set aside. …In
          my judgment, s. 101 of that Act, which gives to a mortgagee power
          to sell the mortgaged property, is perfectly clear, and means
          that the mortgagee has power to sell out and out, by private
          contract or by auction, and subsequently to complete by
          conveyance; and the power to sell is, I think, a power by selling
          to bind the mortgagor.  If that were not so, the extraordinary
          result would follow that every purchaser from a mortgagee would,
          in effect, be getting a conditional contract liable at any time
          to be set aside by the mortgagor’s coming in and paying the
          principal, interest, and costs. Such a result would make it
          impossible for a mortgagee, in the ordinary course of events, to
          sell unless he was in a position to promise that completion
          should take place immediately or on the day after the contract,
          and there would have to be a rush for completion in order to
          defeat a possible claim by the mortgagor. [Emphasis added]</pre>
      <pre>[31] In Waring, the mortgagor had also supported his request  for
an  injunction on the ground that the pending sale could  not  be
allowed  to  stand  because it was made at a  gross  under-value.
This  was a ground which Logozzo advanced before Wright J., which
he  rejected.  He  raised it again before this court,  submitting
that  the price for which TD agreed to sell the property to Grann
is so low as to amount to fraud.
[32] In Waring, Crossman J. found no evidence showing anything
like a lack of good faith in the mortgagee’s conduct of the sale.
In a passage which has particular relevance to this appeal, he
sated at 319:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The law, as stated by Kay J. in Warner v. Jacob (I) [20
          Ch.D. 220 at 224] is perfectly clear.  The learned judge there
          says:
          </pre>
      <pre>               “…. a mortgagee is strictly speaking not
          a  trustee  of the power of sale.   It  is  a
          power  given to  him for his own benefit,  to
          enable  him the better to realize  his  debt.
          If   he  exercises  it  bona  fide  for  that
          purpose, without corruption or collusion with
          the  purchaser, the Court will not  interfere
          even though the sale be very disadvantageous,
          unless  indeed  the price is  so  low  as  in
          itself  to  be  evidence of  fraud.”   In  my
          judgment  it  is impossible on the  facts  of
          this  case to conclude that the price  is  so
          low as in itself to be evidence of fraud.</pre>
      <pre>I  am  satisfied  that Wright J. was correct  in  rejecting  this
ground.</pre>
      <pre>[33] Van Minnen Construction Ltd. v.  Murphy (1977), 19 O.R. (2d)
125 (H.C.J.) is another case in which it was held that it was too
late  for a mortgagor to redeem after the property had been  sold
at  auction under power of sale by the mortgagee.  The mortgagor,
who had tendered sufficient funds to discharge the mortgage after
the  mortgagee had sold the property, but before the  transaction
was  completed,  sought a declaration that  it  was  entitled  to
redeem the property.
[34] Krever J. rejected the mortgagor’s submission that on the
date when the tender was made a sale had not occurred because the
transaction had not been completed.  Applying Mission
Construction, he stated that the closing of the transaction need
not occur before it can be said that a sale within the meaning of
former s. 21 of the Mortgages Act has occurred.  Krever J. went
on to say at 131:
          </pre>
      <pre>               See also the judgment of Vannini, D.C.J., in Re Hal Wright
          Motor Sales Ltd. and Industrial Development Bank (1975), 8 O.R.
          (2d) 76, 57 D.L.R. (3d) 172, to the same effect. References may
          also be made to Arnold v. Bronstein et al., [1971] 1 O.R. 467, 15
          D.L.R. (3d) 649, in which Lacourcière, J., refused to restrain a
          mortgagee from selling under a power of sale where the mortgagor
          had not tendered the principal, interest and costs payable.  He
          held that postponement of the sale on the mortgagor’s indefinite
          hope of finding new financial backing would constitute an
          unwarranted interference with the mortgagee’s contractual rights.
          At p. 468 O.R., p. 650 D.L.R., Lacourcière, J., said (with
          reference to the equitable remedy of an injunction, which is not
          in issue in the instant case):
               </pre>
      <pre>                    The general rule developed from numerous
               cases is that a mortgagee, acting in good
               faith  and  without fraud, will  not  be
               restrained from a proper exercise of his
               power of sale, except upon tender by the
               mortgagor  of the principal moneys  due,
               interest and costs.
          </pre>
      <pre>                In  my  view,  in the  absence  of  bad
          faith   or   fraud  on  the   part   of   the
          mortgagee,  the  mortgagor  is  not  entitled
          to   relief   unless  he  has  tendered   the
          arrears   and  costs  before  the   mortgagee
          has  entered  into  a binding  commitment  to
          convey   the   property   to   a   purchaser.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[35] Mr. Justice Lacourcière’s statement that a mortgagor is  not
entitled to relief under s. 22(1)(a) of the present Act unless he
has tendered the arrears before the mortgagee has entered into  a
binding  contract to sell the property is in conformity with  the
interpretation placed on s. 19a(1) of the 1950 Act (ss.22 and  23
of  the  1990 Act) by Schroeder J.A. on behalf of this  court  in
Scarborough  Township v. Greater Toronto Investments  Corp.  Ltd.
(1956),  4  D.L.R.  (2d) 396 at 404-5.  In my  view,  Scarborough
makes  it clear that payment, or tender, of the amount due  under
the  mortgage  and of “any expenses necessarily incurred  by  the
mortgagee” before the mortgagee accepts an offer to purchase  the
land  is  a  condition precedent to the mortgagor being  able  to
utilize  s.  22(1)(a) to preclude a mortgagee  from  selling  the
property  by  power  of sale.  At p. 405,   Schroeder  J.A.  made
reference  to  the  well-established  principle  “that   a   mere
statement of readiness to pay is not a tender”.
[36] Applying the above principles, at the time Logozzo commenced
his application to prevent Grann from completing the purchase of
the property, it was too late for him to redeem the property.
Within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a), TD had already sold the
property to Grann. Moreover, Logozzo had not fulfilled the
necessary condition precedent to engage s. 22 (1)(a) as he had
failed to pay, or tender, the amount due to discharge the
mortgage.  At best, it can be said that he hoped to acquire the
funds required to repay the mortgage debt by selling the property
to Purnell.</pre>
      <pre>                              II</pre>
      <pre>[37]  Therefore,  it  comes down to whether paragraph  2  of  the
schedule to the Grann-TD agreement of purchase and sale makes any
difference.  Wright J. felt compelled by precedent to  find  that
it  did.   He  felt bound to follow the decision of Abbey  J.  in
National Trust Co. v. Saad (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 419 (Gen.  Div.).
In  my  view,  Wright J. erred when he felt bound to apply  Saad,
which I seriously doubt was decided correctly.
[38] In Saad, the mortgagee, which was selling the property under
power of sale, had entered into an agreement to sell the property
which was conditional for ten days upon the purchaser obtaining a
new first mortgage.  The ten-day period ended on January 10,
1997.  The agreement contained a term, in language identical to
that in the Grann-TD agreement of purchase and sale, stating that
the mortgagor had the right to redeem up to the time of the
waiver or expiry of the condition.  On January 9, 1997, the
mortgagor’s solicitor requested a statement of the mortgage from
the mortgagee and indicated that the mortgagor was in a position
to redeem. Relying on s. 22(1) of the Mortgages Act, the
mortgagor succeeded in obtaining a declaration that he was
entitled to redeem the property.
[39] In granting the declaration, Abbey J. stated at pp. 421-22:
          </pre>
      <pre>               It does not seem to me that the law pertaining to the
          interpretation of what is now s. 22(1)(a) is in any real doubt.
          The general principle which is set out in Mission Construction
          Ltd. v. Seel Investments Ltd., [1973] 2 O.R. 190, 33 D.L.R. (3d)
          286 (H.C.J.), is that the acceptance of an offer constitutes a
          sale within the meaning of the section. Subsequent authorities,
          however, and in particular the decisions in Miranda v. Wong (Ont.
          H.C.J., April 4, 1986) an unreported decision of Steele J., Weiss
          v. Standard Trust Co. (Ont. Gen. Div., August 5, 1993) an
          unreported decision of Wilson J., and Canada Permanent Trust Co.
          v. Rieckenberg  (Ont. Dist. Ct., December 5, 1983), an unreported
          decision of Kurisko J., have, as it were, pronounced an addendum
          to the general principle, and that is that if the agreement of
          purchase and sale itself contemplates a right of redemption
          continuing until a date after the date of the agreement, then the
          mortgagor is considered to have a right of redemption consistent
          with the terms of the agreement.
          </pre>
      <pre>                The  clause to which I earlier referred
          and   which  is  contained  in  the   subject
          agreement  of  purchase and sale specifically
          provides  that it is understood  between  the
          purchaser and the vendor mortgagee  that  the
          mortgagor has a right to redeem the  property
          up  to  the date of waiver or fulfillment  of
          the  financing  conditions  set  out  in  the
          agreement.  The clause also provides that  in
          the event of redemption the agreement is null
          and void.
          </pre>
      <pre>               I am satisfied, because of the inclusion
          of  that  particular clause  in  the  subject
          agreement  of  purchase and sale,  and  based
          upon   the  authorities  to  which   I   have
          referred,  that  the  applicants  are  to  be
          considered  as having a continuing  right  of
          redemption as of  January 10, 1997. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
      <pre>[40]  Although the mortgagor had neither paid, nor tendered,  the
amount  required  to discharge the mortgage as  required  by  the
authorities,  this  did not prevent Abbey J.  from  granting  the
mortgagor  the opportunity to redeem the property  prior  to  the
date  fixed for the closing of its sale under power of sale.   In
this regard, at p. 423 he stated:
          </pre>
      <pre>               I am satisfied, in this case, that the applicant should be
          taken to have complied with the provisions of s. 22(1)(a) of the
          Mortgages Act.  The steps taken by the applicants on January 9,
          prior to the expiration of the right of redemption, having regard
          to the terms of the agreement of purchase and sale are
          sufficient, in my view, to activate the section and cause the
          court, in the determination of the equities between the parties,
          to find the applicants entitled to a right of redemption.</pre>
      <pre>[41]  Apart from the question of whether Abbey J. was correct  in
declaring  that  the mortgagor had the right  to  redeem  in  the
absence  of  payment,  or  tender,  of  the  amount  required  to
discharge  the  mortgage, in my view, Saad, and  the  authorities
relied  on  by Abbey J., are distinguishable on their facts  from
this appeal.
[42] In  Saad, Miranda, Weiss and Rieckenberg, as well as in
Nalisa Investments Limited v. National Bank of Canada (1980), 28
Chitty’s L.J. 187 (Ont. H.C.J.), the agreement of purchase and
sale entered into between the mortgagee selling under power of
sale and the purchaser was subject to a condition. In Saad, the
condition was the ability of the purchaser to obtain financing.
In Miranda, Rieckenberg and Nalisa the agreement was conditional
upon the mortgage not being redeemed up to the date of closing.
In Weiss there is a condition which appears to have a similar
effect.  As I will explain, in this appeal, the agreement of
purchase and sale, like the agreement of purchase and sale in
Mission Construction, was not a conditional agreement, but
contained an understanding that the mortgagor had the right to
redeem in certain circumstances.
[43] The effect of the financing condition in Saad, and the
conditions in the cases which it followed, was to defer the
coming into force of a sale within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a) of
the Mortgages Act until the condition was fulfilled or waived.
In Saad, a sale would occur upon the fulfillment or waiver of the
financing condition. In the event that the purchaser was unable
to obtain financing, obviously there would be no agreement as the
condition had not been fulfilled.  However, in reaching his
decision, Abbey J. did not do so on the basis of Miranda, and the
other cases, but on the basis of the provision in the agreement
of purchase and sale, to which the mortgagor was not a party. In
my view, therefore, Abbey J. was incorrect in his observation
that the authorities on which he relied “pronounced an addendum
to the general principle” that acceptance of an offer constitutes
a sale within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a), “and that if the
agreement of purchase and sale itself contemplates a right of
redemption continuing until a date after the agreement, then the
mortgagor is considered to have a right of redemption consistent
with the terms of the agreement.” Those authorities, in my view,
do not support this proposition.  Nor does Saad.  In each of the
cases followed by Abbey J. the agreement of purchase and sale
entered into under the power of sale was a conditional agreement.
It appears to have been the opinion of the judges deciding those
cases that a conditional agreement of purchase and sale entered
into under power of sale does not constitute a “sale under the
mortgage” within the meaning of s. 22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act.
The correctness of this proposition need not be decided on this
appeal.
[44] Moreover, in my view, the provision of paragraph 2 of the
schedule to the Grann-TD agreement of purchase and sale does not
render it a conditional agreement. Once again, I repeat it for
convenience:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The purchaser understands and agrees that the mortgagor has
          the right to redeem the property up to the time of waiver or
          expiration of all rights of termination or fulfillment of all
          conditions and this agreement is subject to that right.  In the
          event of redemption by the mortgagor, this agreement shall be
          null and void and any deposit monies will be refunded in full
          without interest. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>On   its  face,  this  clause  represents  an  understanding  and
agreement  between Grann and TD that there are  circumstances  in
which  TD  may  permit the mortgagor to redeem the  property.  As
such,  it  has a similar effect to the similar clause in  Mission
Construction. However, this cannot serve to confer on  Logozzo  a
right  to  redeem beyond the time permitted by s. 22(1)(a).  This
provision  is  likely for the benefit of TD.   It  gives  TD  the
opportunity  to make the best deal possible in realizing  on  its
security  notwithstanding the effect of s.22(1)(a),  and  without
incurring  any liability to the purchaser.  For example,  if  the
amount  for  which it sold the property to Grann was insufficient
to  retire  the mortgage debt, it reserved for TD  the  right  to
permit  Logozzo  to  redeem  on the  payment,  or  tender,  of  a
sufficient amount “up to the time of waiver or expiration of  all
rights   of   termination  or  fulfillment  of  all  conditions”.
However, as between Logozzo and TD, it created no rights, nor did
it  provide  Logozzo the foundation to prevent the completion  of
the Grann - TD transaction.  As I have pointed out, in any event,
at  the time he brought his application, Logozzo had not effected
a redemption as he had neither paid, nor tendered, the amount due
on the mortgage.</pre>
      <pre>[45]  In my view, although paragraph 2 permits Logozzo to  redeem
if  certain  circumstances are met, he  could  not  enforce  this
benefit  against Grann or TD for the reason that  he  was  not  a
party  to the agreement of purchase and sale. As a general  rule,
the  doctrine of privity of contract provides that a contract can
neither  confer rights, nor impose obligations, on third parties.
Paragraph  2  may permit the mortgagee to allow the mortgagor  to
redeem  subsequent to the time of a binding agreement of purchase
and sale. Indeed, as I stated earlier, TD has no objection to the
court permitting Logozzo to redeem provided the court protects it
from  liability  should Grann decide to enforce  its  contractual
rights,  as  paragraph 2, in effect, provides.   However,  it  is
primarily the mortgagor, whose right to redeem is governed by  s.
22(1)(a), who is seeking to enforce a term in a contract to which
he is not a party.
[46] As for the purchaser, if he or she is content to enter into
an agreement of purchase and sale that contains such a provision,
he or she is taken to have assumed the risk that the transaction
may not close.  The provision leaves the vendor free to accept a
proper redemption within the time frame contained in the
provision and return the purchaser’s deposit, without incurring
liability to the purchaser. Thus, although it is apparent that
Grann acted in good faith in submitting his offer, he did so
knowing that TD could terminate the agreement by permitting
Logozzo to redeem the property within the time frame contained in
the provision, in which event the agreement becomes null and void
and TD must return his deposit. Grann is not prepared to
relinquish the rights which he acquired under the agreement of
purchase and sale and to go along with TD’s willingness to permit
Logozzo to redeem. TD’s willingness to do so, as stated earlier,
is conditional upon the court protecting it from any liability it
may have to Grann if the court declares the agreement of purchase
and sale null and void.  However, had Logozzo effected a proper
redemption in compliance with the provision in paragraph 2,
Grann’s rights under the agreement of purchase and sale would
have been at an end.
[47] It is helpful to examine the language of paragraph 2 which,
in my view, is needlessly convoluted.  As I read the penultimate
sentence of that paragraph, it is similar, in effect, to the
provision in the agreement of purchase and sale in Mission
Construction, which Leiff J. found did not preserve the
mortgagor’s right to redeem.  The clause in that case provided
that the mortgagee’s acceptance of the offer was “subject to the
rights” of the mortgagor to redeem the property or to put the
mortgage in good standing.  In this appeal, the agreement of
purchase and sale is “subject to [the] right” of the mortgagor to
redeem the property “up to the time of waiver or expiration of
all rights of termination or fulfillment of all conditions”.  The
only difference between the two clauses is that in this appeal
the mortgagor’s right to redeem terminates on the occurrence of
certain events, while in Mission Construction the right to redeem
is not subject to termination.
[48] As I have indicated, the clause in paragraph 2 does not
render the TD-Grann agreement of purchase and sale a conditional
agreement.  It does not make the right of Grann to complete the
purchase of the property dependent on the happening of a future
event, such as the purchaser obtaining the funds to complete the
purchase, as in Saad, or the mortgage not being redeemed prior to
closing, as in Miranda.  The clause simply contains an
acknowledgement that the mortgagor has the right to redeem the
property up to a particular time.  There are no conditions in the
agreement to be fulfilled.
[49] This analysis takes me back to Saad.  As I have indicated,
the agreement of purchase and sale in that case was conditional
for ten days on the purchaser obtaining financing.  It was before
the ten-day period had elapsed that there was an indication that
the mortgagor was in a position to redeem. The agreement of
purchase and sale contained the same clause found in paragraph 2
of the agreement of purchase and sale in this appeal.  It is
somewhat unclear from Abbey J’s reasons whether he felt the
mortgagor was entitled to redeem because the agreement of
purchase and sale was conditional as decided in the Miranda line
of cases, or because he found the mortgagor had the right to do
so by virtue of the clause in the agreement of purchase and sale.
In either event, it is my view that Saad was not decided
correctly.  If the decision rests on the ground that there was
not a sale within the meaning of s. 22(1)(b) of the Mortgages Act
because the agreement was conditional, assuming the correctness
of the Miranda line of cases, the mortgagor was unable to rely on
s. 22(1)(b) and redeem the property because he had neither paid,
nor tendered, the redemption funds.  If the decision rests on a
right to redeem found in the clause of the agreement of purchase
and sale, in addition to the absence of payment or tender, this
was not a right which the mortgagor could enforce as he was not a
party to that agreement.  In addition, a decision based on this
ground is contrary to Mission Construction.
[50] As I stated earlier, it is TD’s position that it remains
open to the court to permit Logozzo to redeem as the time had not
been reached for Grann to complete his examination of title when
Logozzo commenced his application.  TD submitted, therefore, that
it could agree to a redemption of the property as the time for
the “waiver or expiration of all rights of termination” of the
agreement, as contained in paragraph 2, had not expired.
[51] In making this submission, TD relied on the following
language in paragraph 10 of the agreement of purchase and sale:
“If within the specified times referred to in paragraph 8 any
valid objection to title … is made in writing to Vendor and which
Vendor is unable or unwilling to remove, remedy or satisfy  and
which purchaser will not waive this agreement … shall be at an
end …” In my view, this language does not create a right of
termination.  In any event, as the period in which Grann was
permitted to examine the title had not expired when the
application was commenced, it was premature for TD, or Logozzo,
to place any reliance on this aspect of the clause in paragraph
2.
[52] My interpretation of paragraph 10 is based on the reasons
for judgment of Danckwerts L.J. in Property &amp; Bloodstock Ltd. v.
Emerton, [1968] 1 Ch. 94 (C.A.), a power of sale and redemption
case, in which it was held that conditions respecting title in
the usual agreement of purchase and sale are just that – a mere
matter of title and, therefore, one of the usual terms found in
an agreement of purchase and sale - with the result that the
agreement is an unconditional contract of sale.  It is also
noteworthy that the Court of Appeal in Emerton approved Crossman
J.’s decision in Waring, observing, at p. 115, that it “was
plainly correct”.
[53] In summary, notwithstanding that the doctrine of privity of
contract precluded Logozzo from enforcing the apparent benefit
which was conferred on him by the language of paragraph 2, as
between Grann and TD, paragraph 2 entitled TD to accept a proper
redemption by Logozzo “up to the time of waiver or expiration of
all rights of termination or fulfillment of all conditions”
contained in their agreement, and to walk away from the agreement
without incurring any liability to Grann.  However, as I have
explained, in the circumstances of this appeal TD cannot rely on,
and enforce, paragraph 2 for three reasons.  Logozzo had not
effected a proper redemption at the time his application was
brought, as he had neither paid, nor tendered, the appropriate
amount of money owing on the mortgage.  Paragraphs 8 and 10 of
the agreement did not, as TD contended, give Grann a right to
terminate it which he had not waived and which had not expired.
Finally, the agreement was not conditional.
[54] Before leaving this analysis, it should be acknowledged that
in certain circumstances the courts have permitted a third party
to enforce a benefit or right established in its favour pursuant
to the terms of a contract.  For example, in London Drugs Ltd. v.
Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299, the
Supreme Court of Canada introduced what was intended as a
principled exception to the doctrine of privity of contract in
the context of a limitation of liability clause in a standard
form contract for the storage of a transformer.  See, also,
Fraser River Pile &amp; Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd., a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, released September 10,
1999, [1999] S.C. J. No. 48.  It was not argued in this appeal
that the principle established in London Drugs should be applied
to permit Logozzo to enforce the right to redeem contained in
paragraph 2.  However, were I inclined to apply London Drugs, it
is my view that Logozzo would have failed for the reasons which I
have summarized in the preceding paragraph.
</pre>
      <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
      <pre>[55]  As stated earlier, TD and Grann both regard their agreement
of  purchase and sale to be in force awaiting the release of this
judgment.  For all of the above reasons, they may now proceed  to
complete  their contract, freed from the unhappy interference  by
Logozzo at the eleventh hour.
[56] In the result, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
order of Wright J.  Grann is entitled to the costs of the
application, the cross-applications and the appeal from Logozzo
and TD.

</pre>
      <pre>Released: November 3, 1999
                                   “S. Borins J.A.”
                                   “I agree J.C. MacPherson J.A.”
</pre>
      <pre>GOUDGE J.A.: (Dissenting)</pre>
      <pre>[57]  I  have  had  the  benefit  of  reading  the  thorough  and
comprehensive  reasons for judgment of Borins J.A.  allowing  the
appeal.  With  respect, however, I approach  this  matter  rather
differently  and have reached a different result. My reasons  for
doing so are as follows.
[58] There were three applications heard together by Wright J.:
one by Mr. Logozzo, the mortgagor; one by the Toronto-Dominion
Bank, the mortgagee; and one by Mr. Grann, the purchaser from the
Bank pursuant to its power of sale.
[59] By agreement, the rights of all three parties were preserved
as of  November 12, 1998. Those rights remain in suspension
pending the determination of this appeal.
[60] In my view, the fundamental question before Wright J. was
whether on November 12, 1998, Logozzo was able to redeem the
mortgaged property or whether to do so would violate Grann’s
rights as purchaser from the Bank.
[61] Logozzo argued that because of s.22(1)(a) of the Mortgages
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.40, he was entitled to redeem as of that
date. The Bank supported him, indicating that it wished to have
him redeem provided that to do so would not violate Grann’s
rights. Grann took the opposite position, arguing that because of
his purchase from the Bank, there was no legal basis upon which
Logozzo could redeem.
[62] In my opinion, the resolution of this appeal depends on the
contract between the Bank and Grann. The critical term of that
contract is paragraph 2 of Schedule A which forms part of the
contract of purchase and sale. That paragraph reads as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               2. It is further understood that on the date of acceptance
          of this offer there is default under the terms of the mortgage
          which entitles the Vendor to exercise the Power of Sale. The only
          evidence of the default, which the Purchaser may require, shall
          be a statutory declaration by the Vendor setting forth the facts
          entitling the Vendor to sell under the Power of Sale, including
          the particulars of the notice of exercising the Power of Sale,
          the names of the persons upon whom service of the notice has been
          effected, and declaring that default under the mortgage entitling
          the Vendor to exercise the Power of Sale has continued up to and
          including the date of acceptance of this offer and to the time of
          closing. The Purchaser understands and agrees that the mortgagor
          has the right to redeem the property up to the time of waiver or
          expiration of all rights of termination or fulfilment of all
          conditions, and this Agreement is subject to that right. In the
          event of redemption, by the mortgagor, this agreement shall be
          null and void and only deposit monies paid will be refunded
          without interest.</pre>
      <pre>[63]  This  paragraph  constitutes the  agreement  of  these  two
parties  that the Bank can permit Logozzo to redeem the  property
Sup  to  the  time  of  waiver or expiration  of  all  rights  of
termination or fulfilment of all conditions” and further, that if
that  happens,  Grann’s agreement with the Bank is rendered  null
and void.
[64] This paragraph is designed to preserve for the Bank its
right to be repaid in full by the redeeming mortgagor right up to
the point at which the purchaser to whom the Bank is selling no
longer has a legal escape hatch from the transaction. That is the
point at which the Bank can look with certainty to the sale to be
repaid. The purchaser contracts with full knowledge that until
that point the Bank is entitled to be repaid by permitting the
mortgagor to redeem, thereby voiding the contract of purchase and
sale.
[65] The question then is whether as of November 12, 1998, the
deadline had passed for the Bank to permit Logozzo to redeem. I
do not think that it had.
[66] Paragraph 10, together with paragraph 8 as amended of the
agreement of purchase and sale, provides that the purchaser has
until November 13, 1998 to make any valid objection to title or
to any outstanding work order or to the unlawfulness of the
present use or to the lack of fire insurance. If the vendor does
not satisfy the objection the purchaser may waive it. Otherwise
the agreement is terminated. This provision gives Grann the right
to terminate the contract up to November 13, 1998 if he refuses
to waive an unsatisfied and valid requisition. Since Grann had
not waived this right, until it expired on November 13, the Bank
could not be certain that Grann was lawfully obliged to complete
the transaction. Until then the Bank could not look with
certainty to the sale to be repaid.
[67] This, I think, is precisely the kind of provision
contemplated by paragraph 2 of Schedule A. As I have said, its
purpose is to entitle the Bank to be repaid by a redeeming
mortgagor up to the point at which the purchaser under power of
sale ceased to have a legal escape route from the transaction. At
that point, the Bank can look with certainty to the sale as the
basis for repayment and the justification for permitting
redemption vanishes.
[68] As of November 12, 1998, Grann’s right under paragraph 10
had neither been waived, nor had it expired. The Bank could not
yet be certain that it could look to the sale to Grann as the
basis upon which it would be repaid. Hence, as of that date the
contract of purchase and sale entitled the Bank to allow Logozzo
to redeem. It could do so with no infringement of Grann’s rights
since the redemption would render the contract between Grann and
the Bank null and void.
[69] In summary, therefore, I conclude that as of the crucial
date, November 12, 1998, Logozzo was able to redeem the property
because the Bank has a contractual right to let him do so and it
is willing to exercise that right.
[70] While my conclusion differs from that of my colleague, it
also differs from that reached by Wright J. He found that Logozzo
had a right to redeem,  which existed not only on November 12,
1998, but ran to the date for closing. In my view, Logozzo could
redeem because the Bank had the contractual right to let him do
so, but only up to the deadline provided in paragraph 10 of its
contract with Grann, namely, November 13, 1998.
[71] However, in fashioning the necessary declaration I think
account should be taken of the fact that all rights have been in
suspension since November 12, 1998. Some allowance should be made
for start up time when the clock is restarted. Hence, I would
declare that as of November 12, 1998, the Bank had the right to
allow Logozzo to redeem the property. I would further provide
that the deadline for satisfying requisitions in the contract of
purchase and sale be extended for one week from the date of
release of this judgment.
[72] The conclusion I have reached is contractually founded. It
does not depend at all on s. 22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act. It
is, therefore, unnecessary to address the rights accorded to
Logozzo by that section in these circumstances. Nonetheless,
there are three points that might usefully be made in this
connection.
[73] First, I would be inclined to the view that if no sale has
transpired under the mortgage, the mortgagor has the statutory
right to redeem and the court can so declare even if the
mortgagor has not tendered the amount owing on the mortgage. The
Act does not require a tender as a precondition to possessing the
right to redeem. Nor, as I read it, does the case law, unless the
mortgagor is also seeking to enjoin the sale under power of sale
or unless the mortgagor is seeking a declaration after a sale
under the mortgage has occurred where, absent the prior tender,
the mortgagor’s rights, if any, have vanished.
[74] Where there has not yet been such a sale and the mortgagor
seeks no more than a declaration that he has the right to redeem,
I find it difficult to see the rationale for requiring as a
precondition to that relief that the mortgagor tender what is
owed. Indeed, if the mortgagor had tendered what is owed, he
would be entitled to an order that he has redeemed, not just a
declaration that he has the right to do so.
[75] Secondly, assuming the correctness of the Miranda line of
cases, which my colleague Borins J.A. correctly says we need not
decide, I would be inclined to find the contract between the Bank
and Grann to be conditional and therefore not a “sale under the
mortgage” within s. 22(1)(a) of the Mortgages Act.
[76] It seems to me that as of  November 12, 1998, this contract
was conditional in the same sense as that, for example, in
National Trust v. Saad 10 R.P.R. (3d) 145. In Saad, if
satisfactory financing did not materialize by the required date
the purchaser could either waive this condition or terminate the
contract. In this case, if an unsatisfied and valid objection to
title materialized by the required date the purchaser could waive
this condition or terminate the contract.
[77] While Danckwerts L.J. in Property &amp; Bloodstock Ltd. v.
Emerton, [1968] 1 Ch. 94 (C.A.) defined as unconditional a
contract containing a condition as to title, this case can be
distinguished on the basis that it was decided in the context of
the interpretation of a statute defining the mortgagee’s power to
sell, not the circumstances under which a mortgagor may redeem.
[78] In principle it would seem to make sense that a sale that
was conditional, as this one was as of November 12, 1998, should
not terminate the mortgagor’s right to redeem. At that point the
sale remains contingent. It may never happen. Until the
contingency is removed and the sale becomes a certain basis for
repayment of the mortgage debt, the mortgagor ought not to be
deprived of the right to serve as the basis for repayment by
redeeming the property. Otherwise, the mortgagee may be left with
no sale and a mortgagor with no right to redeem.
[79] In summary I would vary the order below as I have indicated.
Since this represents material success for Logozzo and the Bank
they should each have their costs of this appeal.</pre>
