    <pre>HEARD:         April 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Lampkin J., dated February 26, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged with two counts of mischief, the
first in relation to breaking and entering an aircraft and
committing mischief to the instrument panel and the second in
relation to wilfully damaging the wiring. The trial judge
acquitted the appellant of the first count of breaking and
entering, but convicted him of the included offence of mischief
in that count and in count two.
[2]  In his reasons, the trial judge stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I accept that Mr. Long had an honest belief that Mr. Shapiro
          did not want the instrument. Mr. Meade, called by the Crown, did
          not believe that Mr. Long had done anything wrong in removing the
          instrument based on what he believed Mr. Shapiro had said at the
          meeting. Mr. Long construed his understanding to mean that he had
          implied authority to enter the aircraft and remove the gauge and
          I find no criminal activity in his entering the aircraft to
          recover the gauge in which he had a genuine believe he or his
          company owned it. But he had a colour of right only in the gauge,
          not in the aircraft. He had an obligation to restore the aircraft
          to the state in which he had found it. He knew that he had done
          damage to the aircraft. Not only did he admit that he left a hole
          where the gauge was, but he even sent a bill to Mr. Shapiro for
          installing and de-installing the gauge. While the offence of
          breaking and entering and committing mischief will be dismissed,
          there will be a finding of guilt of the included offence of
          mischief in leaving the holes in the aircraft.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, the trial judge erred in his perception of the
events leading up to the installation of the gauge in question
and its subsequent recovery by the appellant. The holes in the
instrument panel to which he refers were not caused by the
removal of the gauge from the panel but were made at the time of
and for the purpose of the installation that was agreed to by the
complainant.
[4]  The trial judge then went on further to state:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There will similarly be a finding of guilt to wilful damage
          to the instrument wiring of Mr. Shapiro&#146;s aircraft. Mr. Meade saw
          wires hanging from the aircraft on December 9, 1995, and
          Constable Haak saw cut wires on the dash on December 18, the day
          when Mr. Shapiro inspected the aircraft, discovered the damage
          and called the police.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  There is no competent evidence that the wiring in this
aircraft was damaged. Neither the complainant nor the constable
was in a position to give expert evidence in this area and the
complainant simply recited hearsay as to whether the wires had
been cut or simply disconnected in the course of removing the
gauge. More importantly, there is no evidence before the court
that in removing the gauge, which the trial judge had held he was
entitled to do, the appellant had wilfully damaged the instrument
wiring without legal justification or excuse and without colour
of right as particularized by the Crown in count two.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are set
aside and verdicts of acquittal are substituted therefor.</pre>
