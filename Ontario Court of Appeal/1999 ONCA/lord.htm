    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Granger J. dated June 17, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The question raised by this appeal is whether, in an action
for damages under s.61 of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3,
the surviving relatives of a murder victim are entitled to assert
a claim for punitive, exemplary or aggravated damages.
[2]  The statement of claim alleges that Robert Lord was murdered
in an underground parking garage of the apartment building in
which he lived.  Lord&#146;s surviving relatives bring this action
against Miguel Ricardo Downer and Khary Adeen, alleging that they
murdered Lord, and against the owner, mortgagee in possession,
the management company and the manager of the management company,
alleging their failure to secure the parking garage when they
knew or ought to have known that criminal activity had occurred
and would likely recur in the garage.  The motion to strike the
claim for punitive, exemplary or aggravated damages was brought
by one of the corporate defendants, the mortgagee in possession,
but it is common ground that the issue raised affects all the
defendants, including the alleged murderers.
[3]  The motions court judge ruled that in law the plaintiffs
could not claim punitive, exemplary or aggravated damages and
struck out that portion of the claim.  For the reasons that
follow, I agree with the result reached by the motions court
judge.
[4]  At common law, the right to bring an action in tort did not
survive the death of the victim.  Neither the estate of the
victim nor the victim&#146;s relatives had a right to sue for their
losses: Baker v. Bolton (1808), 1 Camp. 493, 170 E.R. 1033.
Fatal accidents legislation, first introduced in England in 1846
(Lord Campbell&#146;s Act, 1846 (U.K.), c. 93) and in this
jurisdiction in 1847 (Fatal Accidents Act, 10 and 11 Vict., c.
6), gave enumerated dependants a statutory cause of action for
&#147;damages.&#148;: see Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 164, s. 2.
As explained by this Court in Mason v. Peters (1982), 39 O.R.
(2d) 27 at 31, (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
refused December 6, 1982), this provision only allowed recovery
for pecuniary losses.  Dependants of the deceased tort victim had
no right to recover damages for the non-economic losses of
guidance, care and companionship, nor could they claim damages as
solatium for grief or mental anguish.  Over time, the rights of
the dependants were perceived to be too limited.  Fatal accidents
legislation was replaced in 1978 by the Family Law Reform Act
(&#147;FLRA&#148;), s. 60. The FLRA provision was in turn replaced, in
virtually identical terms, by the presently applicable Family Law
Act, supra (&#147;FLA&#148;), s. 61.
[5]   Sections 61(1) and (2) of the FLA provide as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>            61(1)  If a person is injured or killed by the fault or
       neglect of another under circumstances where the person is
       entitled to recover damages, or would have been entitled if not
       killed, the spouse, as defined in Part III (Support Obligations),
       children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, brothers and
       sisters of the person are entitled to recover their pecuniary
       loss resulting from the injury or death from the person from whom
       the person injured or killed is entitled to recover or would have
       been entitled if not killed, and to maintain an action for the
       purpose in a court of competent jurisdiction.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (2)   The  damages recoverable  in  a
          claim under subsection (1) may include,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  actual expenses reasonably incurred
               for the benefit of the person injured or
               killed;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)  actual funeral expenses reasonably
          incurred;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)   a  reasonable allowance for travel
               expenses actually incurred in visiting the
               person  during his or her  treatment  or
               recovery;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  where, as the result of the injury,
               the     claimant    provides    nursing,
               housekeeping or other services  for  the
               person, a reasonable allowance for  loss
               of  income or the value of the services;
               and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)   an  amount to compensate  for  the
               loss of guidance, care and companionship
               that  the claimant might reasonably have
               expected  to receive from the person  if
               the injury or death had not occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (Emphasis added)</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The effect of this provision and its predecessor, FLRA,
s.60, is to expand the list of relatives who have a cause of
action, generally to restrict their right of recovery to
pecuniary loss, but to allow the dependants to recover damages
for the loss of guidance, care and companionship they might
reasonably have expected to receive had the tort not been
committed.
[7]  Counsel for the appellants concedes that punitive damages
and exemplary damages are identical for the purpose of assessing
damages in this case.  As is clear from its terms, s.61(1) limits
the claims of survivors to &#147;their pecuniary loss resulting from
the&#133;death&#148;.  &#147;Pecuniary loss&#148; refers to the actual monetary
losses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the injury:
Rainaldi et al., Remedies in Tort, vol 4, at p.27-99. While s.
61(2)(e) allows for recovery of certain specified non-pecuniary
damages, those damages are still compensatory in nature.  In my
view, the statutory language is fatal to any claim for punitive
or exemplary damages. Punitive damages are non-compensatory and
non-pecuniary in nature: see Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of
British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 at 1098.  Punitive damages
are an award made for the purpose of punishing and deterring the
defendant and not to compensate the plaintiff:  see  Waddams, The
Law of Damages, 3d ed. (1998) at p. 11-1.  In Hill v. Church of
Scientology of Toronto and Manning, [1995], 2 S.C.R. 1130 at
1208, punitive damages were described as &#147;the means by which the
jury or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious conduct of
the defendant. They are in the nature of a fine which is meant to
act as a deterrent to the defendant and to others from acting in
this manner.&#148; While it may be that the circumstances pleaded
could call for the censure of the court, the issue is whether the
legal entitlement asserted by the plaintiffs can embrace such a
claim.  As the plaintiffs assert a purely statutory cause of
action which limits recovery to pecuniary losses and certain
specified non-pecuniary compensatory losses, I fail to see any
basis for allowing the plaintiffs to claim punitive or exemplary
damages which are plainly non-compensatory in nature.
[8]  Aggravated damages are non-pecuniary in nature, yet they aim
at compensation.  Aggravated damages take into account intangible
elements of the injury suffered, such as distress and
humiliation: Waddams, supra at 11-1 to 11-2.  In Hill v. Church
of Scientology of Toronto and Manning , supra at 1205, Cory J.
quoted with approval the statement of Robins J.A. in Walker v.
CFTO Ltd. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 104 at 111: &#147;Where the defendant
is guilty of insulting, high-handed, spiteful, malicious or
oppressive conduct which increases the mental distress -- the
humiliation, indignation, anxiety, grief, fear and the like --
suffered by the plaintiff&#133; the plaintiff may be entitled to what
has come to be known as &#145;aggravated damages&#146;.&#148;  Aggravated
damages may be awarded in appropriate cases to augment damages
assessed under the generally applicable rules for the recovery of
damages: Vorvis, supra, at 1099.
[9]  In his forceful argument, Mr. Strosberg submitted that the
language of s.61(2)(e) widens the ambit of recovery beyond
&#147;pecuniary loss&#148;.  He contended that by opening the door to non-
pecuniary damages for loss of guidance, care and companionship in
s. 61(2)(e), the legislature also opened the door to recovery of
aggravated damages, in that they too are non-pecuniary but
compensatory in nature.
[10] The motions court judge rejected that submission, in part,
on the basis that the dependants could not be considered victims
of the tort.  He stated: &#147;clearly, it is not the family which
suffers any humiliation related to the defendant&#146;s conduct but
the victim.&#148;  It seems to me that as a matter of fact, the
dependants of the victim of a deliberate tort may well suffer
feelings of &#147;humiliation, indignation, anxiety, grief, fear and
the like&#148; as a result of the defendant&#146;s wrong.  The issue,
however, is not whether the dependants suffer feelings of this
kind, but rather whether such an injury is compensable under the
statute.
[11] In my view, in the light of Mason v. Peters, supra, the
inevitable conclusion is that such losses are not recoverable.
In that case, after a careful review of the legislation, its
history, and the authorities interpreting it and its
predecessors, Robins J.A. concluded that while the Act (there,
the FLRA, s. 60 (2), now, the FLA, s. 61 (2)), allows for the
recovery of the non-pecuniary loss of care, guidance and
companionship, the trial judge had properly excluded (at p. 39)
&#147;grief, sorrow and mental anguish suffered by reason of the death
as compensable items of damage.  Non-pecuniary loss of this kind,
unlike guidance, care and companionship, are not provided for in
the Act and under its terms remain non-recoverable.&#148;  See also
Reidy et al.  v.  McLeod Estate (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 661 at 662
(C.A.).  Mason v. Peters, supra, did not deal with the issue of
aggravated damages.  However, it is my view that by holding that
the statute does not allow recovery for grief, sorrow and mental
anguish, the decision effectively precludes recovery of
aggravated damages as they aim to compensate a similar, if not
identical, loss.
[12] Accordingly, while it is the case that the FLA, s. 61(2)
does provide that the damages recoverable &#147;may include&#148; certain
specified non-pecuniary losses, it does not follow that the door
has been opened generally for recovery for all other forms of non-
pecuniary loss.  As Mason v. Peters, supra, makes clear, the law
has long distinguished between loss of guidance, care and
companionship on the one hand and grief, sorrow and mental
anguish on the other.  The nature of the injury addressed by
aggravated damages is closely akin to, if not identical with,
compensation for grief, sorrow and mental anguish.  As the latter
is excluded from the statutory right created by the FLA, s.
61(2), there is no basis in law for recovery of aggravated
damages:  see Worobel Estate v. Worobel (1988), 67 O.R. (2d) 151
(H.C.J.) at 157.
[13] Mr. Strosberg urged us to expand the range of damages
recoverable by dependants for reasons of policy.  I find it
neither necessary nor appropriate to consider whether punitive or
aggravated damages should, as a matter of policy, be made
available in cases such as this.  This is quite unlike the
situation where the court is faced with an out-moded common law
rule and is invited to extend existing principles to keep the law
in step with the &#147;dynamic and evolving fabric of our society&#148; :
Cf. Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding
Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210 at 1262.  Here, the dependant&#146;s right
of action is wholly the creature of a recent statute which
circumscribes the right in precise terms.  I have concluded that
the statute excludes these very losses.  In these circumstances,
any variation, whether by increase or decrease of those rights,
is the function of the Legislature, not of this court.
[14] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
