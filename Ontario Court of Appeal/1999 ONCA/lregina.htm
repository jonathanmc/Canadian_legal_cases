    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Dunnet J. dated July 6, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal from the judgment of Dunnet J. dated July
6,  1998  in  which  she  awarded damages  to  the  plaintiff  of
$6,052.60  for work performed under the contract and $20,  822.20
for work performed outside the contract (for extras).
[2]  The appellant appeals with respect to only the second
component of this award.  Dunnet J. supported her award of
$20,822.20 for extras on two bases:
     </pre>
    <pre>  1.   There was an implied agreement between the plaintiff and
       defendant covering the work not comprised in the contract, and
     </pre>
    <pre>  2.   The defendant through its conduct waived paragraphs 11 and
       12 which required extras to be approved in writing by its project
       manager.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, Dunnet J. was entirely correct in both of these
conclusions.  The evidence she heard at the trial, especially the
evidence concerning the role and authority of the defendant&#146;s  on
site  superintendent, Mr. Rizzutto, supports her conclusions that
there  was  an  implied contract between the  parties  concerning
extras  and that the defendant was not, in its dealings with  the
plaintiff, standing on the strict application of paragraph 12  of
the contract.
[4]  In our view, Dunnet J. identified the correct legal
principles, carefully analyzed the relevant evidence and reached
the proper result in this action.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
