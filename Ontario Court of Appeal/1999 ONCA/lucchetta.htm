COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
      <pre>RE:            WALTER LUCCHETTA and SALVANO LUCCHETTA c.o.b. in
               partnership as LUCCHETTA BUILDERS (Plaintiffs
               (Respondents)) v. FORTE REALTY NIAGARA CORP.
               (Defendant (Appellant))</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        AUSTIN, BORINS AND FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       Nick Bozza
               For the appellant, Forte Niagara Realty Corp.</pre>
      <pre>               Walter Luchetta, In Person
               For the respondents</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         OCTOBER 8, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Forestell J. dated November 26, 1997.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   Although  the  trial  judge used  insensitive  language  in
describing  the  representative of the  defendant,  it  does  not
appear  to  us  after  reviewing the entire  transcript  and  the
reasons   for  judgment  that  there  could  be  any   reasonable
apprehension of bias.
[2]  We see no error in the trial judge’s refusal to permit a
second cross-examination of Mr. Lucchetta.  The request by Mr.
Bozza was the result of not having counsel conduct the trial.  No
prejudice appears to have resulted.  In the end the expert’s
report was neither ignored nor discounted.  The trial judge took
the issues addressed in the report into account in arriving at
the award to the plaintiff.
[3]  On the basis of the evidence before him, we see no error on
the part of the trial judge in dismissing the counter-claim.
[4]  The award of party and party costs was appropriate.
Pursuant to that award, the plaintiff will be entitled to costs
on that scale for the period during which he had counsel and only
certain expenses or disbursements during the period he did not.
[5]  The trial judgment awards pre-judgment interest at 10% but
omits any starting date.  Having regard to all of the
circumstances, it should commence December 16, 1994.  Paragraph 1
of the judgment is varied accordingly.  Otherwise the appeal is
dismissed.
[6]  The respondent is entitled to his costs on a party and party
scale.  As he conducted the appeal in person, such costs will not
include any counsel fee.
