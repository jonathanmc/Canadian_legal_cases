    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Kiteley dated
January 24, 1997, reported at (1997), 21 O.T.C. 197.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a medical malpractice case.  The appellant had a
giant aneurysm in his brain.  After extensive examinations, Dr.
Muller, a neurosurgeon, recommended surgery to remove that
aneurysm.  Dr. Muller performed the surgery.  Unfortunately, all
did not go as hoped and the appellant was left with permanent
paralysis in his right hand, arm and leg.  The appellant sued Dr.
Muller claiming that he had not been told of the risk of
permanent paralysis following the operation when he consented to
the surgery.  Dr. Muller acknowledged that permanent paralysis
was a material risk of the surgery but testified that he had told
the appellant of this risk.  The trial judge held that Dr. Muller
had not told the appellant about the risk of permanent paralysis.
She went on to find that the appellant had failed to establish
that a reasonable patient in the appellant&#146;s position would have
declined or postponed the surgery had he been told of the risk of
permanent paralysis.  As the appellant had failed to establish a
causal link between the non-disclosure of the risk of permanent
paralysis and the decision to proceed with the surgery, the
action was dismissed.
[2]  In determining whether a doctor&#146;s failure to make proper
disclosure of the risks caused the damage flowing from the
surgery, a modified objective approach is taken.  In Arndt v.
Smith, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539 at 547, the approach is described in
these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The test enunciated relies on a combination of objective and
          subjective factors in order to determine whether the failure to
          disclose actually caused the harm of which the plaintiff
          complains.  It requires that the court consider what the
          reasonable patient in the circumstances of the plaintiff would
          have done if faced with the same situation.  The trier of fact
          must take into consideration any &#147;particular concerns&#148; of the
          patient and &#147;special considerations&#148; affecting the particular
          patient&#148; in determining whether the patient would have refused
          treatment if given all the information about the possible risks.
          [Emphasis in the original.]</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant submitted that had the operation been
postponed for about two months, he would have completed his
probationary period at his employment, been made a permanent
employee and become eligible for long-term disability benefits
and life insurance.  He contended that had he been advised of the
risk of permanent paralysis, these benefits would have been of
particular significance to him in deciding whether to proceed
immediately with the operation or delay the operation for about
two months.  It is his position that a reasonable patient
informed of the risk of permanent paralysis would have considered
the potential availability of these benefits in some two months
and delayed the procedure until he had the economic advantage of
those benefits in place.
[4]  Counsel for the appellant persuasively argued that the trial
judge erred in holding that the potential availability of these
benefits had the operation been delayed for some two months could
not be factored into the causation analysis because on the facts
as found by the trial judge the appellant did not tell Dr. Muller
about the possibility of the availability of these benefits in
some two months.  We agree with this submission.  The question
was not whether the alleged non-disclosure was material.  It was
acknowledged that the risk of permanent paralysis was a material
risk that had to be disclosed to the appellant.  The question
here was whether a reasonable patient with the appellant&#146;s
&#147;particular concerns&#148; would have proceeded with the surgery as
scheduled given the risk of permanent paralysis.  The appellant&#146;s
failure to tell Dr. Muller about the potential availability of
disability and insurance benefits if the operation was delayed
for some two months does not mean that those concerns could not
be factored into the causation test.  Causation turns on an
assessment of how a reasonable patient in the circumstances of
the appellant would have reacted and not on the doctor&#146;s
knowledge of those circumstances.
[5]  That is not to say that the appellant&#146;s failure to alert Dr.
Muller to the possible benefits inherent in delaying the
procedure was irrelevant to the causation question.  The
appellant&#146;s failure to raise these concerns with Dr. Muller when
discussing the surgery is evidence that the availability or
unavailability of disability benefits and life insurance was not
&#147;a particular concern&#148; of the appellant when he decided to
proceed with the surgery.  In this regard, it is noteworthy that
the appellant was told about the risk of death in the course of
the surgery.  This risk did not cause him to postpone the surgery
until he had secured the life insurance benefits from his
employment.
[6]  Although we accept the appellant&#146;s submission that the trial
judge erred in concluding that failure to advise Dr. Muller of
the potential economic advantages of delaying the surgery
precluded a finding of causation in favour of the appellant, we
are satisfied that this error had no effect on the validity of
the trial judge&#146;s ultimate conclusion on the causation issue.
[7]  In discussing the test for causation where full disclosure
of the risks attendant upon an operation have not been made,
Chief Justice Laskin in Reibl v. Hughes, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880 at
899, said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               So too, other aspects of the objective standard would have
          to be geared to what the average prudent person, the reasonable
          person in the patient&#146;s particular position, would agree to or
          not agree to, if all material and special risks of going ahead
          with the surgery or foregoing it were made known to him.  Far
          from making the patient&#146;s own testimony irrelevant, it is
          essential to his case that he put his own position forward.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[8]  This appellant did not testify that he anticipated being
eligible for long-term disability benefits and life insurance in
about two months.  Nor did he testify that those matters would
have factored into his decision to proceed with the surgery had
he been told about the risk of permanent paralysis.  He gave no
evidence on the causation issue.  Counsel for the appellant
submits that it is self-evident that a reasonable patient would
have delayed the procedure had he been told of the risk of
permanent paralysis and had he anticipated becoming eligible for
long-term disability benefits in about two months.  We cannot
agree with that submission.  There were significant risks
involved in delaying the surgery and the availability of
permanent employment and long-term disability benefits was far
from certain.  It was incumbent on the appellant to lay the
proper evidentiary basis to support his position on the causation
issue.  He failed to do so.
[9]  In addition to finding against the appellant on the
causation issue on the basis that Dr. Muller was not told about
the potential economic advantages of delaying the surgery, the
trial judge found against the appellant on other grounds.  Those
grounds are rooted in her assessment of the evidence concerning
the appellant&#146;s employment and the possibility that he would have
completed his probationary period and become a full-time employee
entitled to disability and life insurance benefits.  The trial
judge held that there was &#147;no evidence&#148; that the appellant would
have been able to complete the probationary period.  It is
perhaps more accurate to say that there was meagre evidence on
that issue.  That evidence, viewed reasonably, could not support
a finding in favour of the appellant.  The trial judge&#146;s
conclusion on the causation issue is sustainable on this finding
standing alone.
[10] Finally, the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in
failing to give effect to the contention that the appellant&#146;s
religious beliefs constituted a &#147;particular concern&#148; of the
appellant which would have affected his decision to proceed with
the operation had he been advised of the risk of permanent
paralysis.  The trial judge, after a lengthy review of the
evidence, found that the appellant had not established that his
beliefs would have had a material impact on his decision.  That
conclusion is unassailable.  The appellant gave no such evidence.
&#147;Expert&#148; evidence to the effect that others with the same
religious beliefs would have postponed the operation had they
been told of the risk of permanent paralysis does not assist in
determining the question of whether those beliefs were a
&#147;particular concern&#148; of this appellant.
[11] The appeal is dismissed.
[12] Dr. Muller purported to cross-appeal from the trial judge&#146;s
finding that he had failed to disclose the material risk of
permanent paralysis to the appellant. Counsel for Dr. Muller
contended that the trial judge erred both in fact and in law.  He
submitted that the overwhelming weight of the evidence favoured a
finding that Dr. Muller did tell the appellant about the risk of
permanent paralysis.  Counsel further submitted that the trial
judge&#146;s approach to the evidence had the effect of placing an
onus on Dr. Muller to establish that all material risks were made
known to and understood by the appellant.  It is counsel&#146;s
position that the appellant had the onus of establishing that he
was not told of the material risks.
[13] There is much to be said in favour of both submissions.  The
evidence supporting Dr. Muller&#146;s position was formidable,
particularly when compared to the evidence supporting the
appellant's position.  The trial judge&#146;s reasons might also be
read as placing an onus on Dr. Muller to establish that he told
the appellant about the risk of permanent paralysis, and that the
appellant understood the nature of this risk.  The onus was on
the appellant, as the plaintiff, to establish material non-
disclosure.  In this case, that meant that the appellant had to
establish that Dr. Muller had not told him about the risk of
permanent paralysis.  The appellant&#146;s own testimony on this issue
was inconsistent.
[14] In the light of our disposition of the appellant&#146;s appeal,
we need not make any final pronouncement on the issues raised by
Dr. Muller, or on his right to raise those issues by way of a
cross-appeal.  Suffice it to say that we should not be taken as
approving of the trial judge&#146;s approach to the question of
whether proper disclosure was made, and we should not be taken as
holding that her conclusion that the risk of permanent paralysis
was not disclosed was a reasonable one on this record.
[15] Dr. Muller also cross-appealed against the trial judge&#146;s
refusal to award costs against the appellant at trial.  That part
of the cross-appeal was not pursued.
[16] The appeal is dismissed with costs.  The cross-appeal is
dismissed without costs.
