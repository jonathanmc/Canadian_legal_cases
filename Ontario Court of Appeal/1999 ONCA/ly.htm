    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Kinh Ly, was seriously injured in an
automobile accident on November 29, 1991.  The accident was
contributed to or caused by the negligence of the operator of an
unidentified motor vehicle.  Wellington Insurance (&quot;Wellington&quot;)
insured the vehicle in which the appellant was riding at the time
of the accident. This automobile insurance policy provided
uninsured/unidentified motorist coverage to a limit of $200,000.
The appellant has received in excess of $900,000 in accident
benefits from her own insurer.
[2]  A motion was brought pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended, for the
determination of the following question of law:

               Is Wellington Insurance entitled to deduct the amount of
          accident benefits paid to the appellant from its
          uninsured/unidentified motorist coverage limit of $200,000?
          
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Cullity J. held on April 28, 1998, that Wellington could
deduct the accident benefits from its uninsured motorist coverage
thereby reducing its liability to zero.
[4]  The appellant appeals against this finding.  Her position is
that the accident benefits should be deducted from the total
award of damages, and that Wellington should be liable for any
remaining damages to the extent of its $200,000 limit.  It is
common ground between the parties that the appellant&#146;s damages
exceed $200,000 even after deducting the accident benefits from
the total award.
[5]  The determination of the issue raised in this appeal turns
on the interpretation of s. 265(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. I.8, and the regulations thereunder.  The same issue
arose in Gignac v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, a
decision released concurrently with these reasons.
[6]  For the reasons given in Gignac, the appeal must be allowed.
The judgment of Cullity J. dated April 28, 1998 is set aside.
Wellington is not entitled to deduct the accident benefits from
its $200,000 limit.  Rather the accident benefits are to be
deducted from the total award of damages.  The appellant is
allowed her costs of the appeal.
