    <pre><b>                      ENDORSEMENT</b>
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  The appellant was convicted before Wren J. and a jury of
assault, sexual assault, forcible confinement, personating a
police officer, possessing a weapon dangerous to the public
peace, possessing a restricted weapon and using a firearm in the
commission of an offence. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a
total of 6 years. He appeals against conviction and, if leave is
granted, against sentence.</pre>
    <pre>     The conviction appeal</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Miguna advanced five grounds
in support of the appeal against conviction. They are set out
below:</pre>
    <pre>               1.        The trial judge failed to adequately
          instruct the jury regarding the presumption of
          innocence and the principle of reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, when the charge to the jury is read as a whole,
it does not  give rise to any likelihood that the jury would
misapprehend the proper standard of proof. We are fortified in
that conclusion by the fact that the jury ultimately acquitted
the appellant of threatening, which  demonstrates that they
understood the correct standard.</pre>
    <pre>               2.        The trial judge failed to instruct the
          jury that the central issue in the case before them was
          not credibility but rather was consent or lack of
          consent.
          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  We disagree. In our view, Wren J. properly instructed the
jury that the issue of consent was essentially a matter of
credibility.</pre>
    <pre>               3.        The trial judge improperly admitted
          irrelevant, unreliable, tainted or concocted evidence
          without probative value.
          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant's submission on this ground focused on the
admissibility of the gun. In our view, the gun was relevant and
probative evidence relating to an essential issue. It was linked
to the appellant by the spent casing that was found in his car.
The gun was properly admitted.</pre>
    <pre>               4.        The Crown made insufficient, inadequate
          and improper disclosure to the defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  This ground was not pressed in argument and we see no error
in this regard.</pre>
    <pre>               5.        There was bias, or a reasonable
          apprehension of bias, on the part of the trial judge.
          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  We have carefully considered the two comments of Wren J. on
which Mr. Miguna relied in support of this ground in argument in
this court. In our view, neither of these comments reflects any
bias or would raise any reasonable apprehension of bias.</pre>
    <pre>     The sentence appeal</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The sentence imposed by the trial judge was as follows: on
the count of sexual assault, 4 years; unlawful confinement, 2
years consecutive; assault, 6 months concurrent; personating a
police officer, 9 months concurrent; possessing a restricted
weapon, 1 year concurrent; and  using a firearm, 1 year
concurrent. The conviction on the count of possession of a weapon
dangerous to the public peace was stayed.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The Crown acknowledges that Wren J. imposed the sentence of
4 years for sexual assault because he had been advised by both
counsel before him, incorrectly, that sec. 272(2) of the Criminal
Code mandated a minimum sentence of 4 years. On behalf of the
Crown,  Mr. Tweney conceded that sec. 272(2) was inapplicable to
the manner in which the appellant was charged in this case. He
further noted that the sentence of 1 year on the charge of using
a firearm in the commission of an offence ought to have been made
consecutive to all of the other sentences. Mr. Tweney's principal
submission, however, was that the total sentence of 6 years was
fit, and he invited us to retain this total sentence by way of
different allocation.</pre>
    <pre>[10] We do not agree. The offences of which the appellant was
convicted arise out of a single transaction. While they were very
serious, when we have regard to all of the circumstances,
including the appellant's minimal prior record, we consider the
total sentence to be so high as to be unfit. We would vary the
sentences as follows: for sexual assault, 3 years; for use of a
firearm, 1 year consecutive; for  forcible confinement, 6 months
consecutive; for the other offences, as imposed by the trial
judge. In the result, the total sentence would be four-and-one-
half years.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave is granted
to appeal against sentence, the appeal against sentence is
allowed and the sentences are varied in the manner indicated.</pre></td>
