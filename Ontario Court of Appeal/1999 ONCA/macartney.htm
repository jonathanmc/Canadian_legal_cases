    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice George Yates dated
June 27, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is one of three involving the appellants Dana
and Cecil Macartney resulting from a trial before Yates J.  The
reasons in the other two appeals will be released in due course.
[2]  The issues in this appeal arise out of a motor vehicle
accident on January 21, 1987 between vehicles driven by Dana
Macartney and Mladen Islic.  Ms. Macartney was driving in an
easterly direction on Mud Street when her car collided with Mr.
Islic&#146;s truck.  Islic was proceeding southbound on Gilman Street.
There was a stop sign on Gilman Street and Ms. Macartney had the
right of way.  The collision occurred at approximately 5:00 p.m.
At the time, Ms. Macartney was not wearing her seatbelt and did
not have the car&#146;s headlights activated, contrary to the
provisions of the Highway Traffic Act.  The trial judge awarded
Ms. Macartney $20,000.00 in general damages and $11,518.72 in
special damages, and awarded Cecil Macartney $2,000.00 on his
Family Law Act claim.  The trial judge reduced the awards to Ms.
Macartney by a total of 25% for her contributory negligence in
failing to wear her seatbelt (15%) and in failing to have her
headlights activated (10%).  The respondents were ordered to pay
the appellants their party-and-party costs to February 14, 1995.
The appellants were ordered to pay the respondents their party-
and-party costs subsequent to February 14, 1995.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         1.   The headlight issue</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant Dana Macartney argues that there was no causal
connection between her failure to activate her headlights and the
accident and that the trial judge, therefore, erred in reducing
the award by 10%.  We do not agree.  There was evidence before
the trial judge that had the appellant activated her headlights,
as required by the Highway Traffic Act, the respondent Mladen
Islic might have seen her car and avoided the accident.  The
appellant was driving a dark-coloured vehicle and there was
expert evidence that one purpose of the legislation is to make
vehicles more visible near dusk.  We have not been persuaded that
the trial judge's finding is unreasonable.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         2.   The seatbelt issue</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant makes a similar argument in relation to
wearing her seatbelt.  Because of her stature the appellant
drives with the driver&#146;s seat very close to the steering wheel.
She submits that even had she been wearing the seatbelt it is
probable she would have sustained the same injuries.  Again,
there was expert evidence from a physician and an engineer upon
which the trial judge could properly find that the appellant&#146;s
failure to wear a seatbelt contributed to the severity of her
injuries.  We see no basis for interfering in the trial judge&#146;s
finding on this aspect of the case.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         3.   Reduction of the wage loss claim</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge reduced the wage loss claim while the
appellant worked at Comp-U-Guard from the sum claimed of
$13,261.26 to the sum of $7,000.00.  The appellant was absent
from work at Comp-U-Guard from October 1988 to August 3, 1989.
The trial judge made the reduction in the wage loss claim because
he found that the appellant could have returned to work by March
1989.  There was ample evidence upon which the trial judge could
make this finding.  Shortly after the collision the appellant
returned to school and then went to work.  However, she quit that
work in October 1988 and, as indicated, did not return to work at
Comp-U-Guard until August 1989, despite medical opinions that she
could work.  We refer in particular to the report of March 21,
1989 from the appellant&#146;s physician, Dr. Kronby.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         4.   Reduction in the general damages</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The trial judge reduced the award which he would otherwise
have made for general damages (from $25,000 to $20,000) because
the appellant failed to discharge the duty to mitigate.  His
reasons for making this reduction were as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The evidence of chronic pain has to be considered in light
          of Dana&#146;s life style, that is, horseback riding and horse
          jumping, the consumption of an average of 12 cans of diet Coke
          and two packages of cigarettes daily.  At one point she was
          having four drinks of gin each day.  I find on the balance of
          probabilities that the life style which Dana chose to follow
          would not be helpful to her recovery and would indeed aggravate
          her back problems which, in turn, would not help her level of
          depression.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Therefore, I assess the damages as
          follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               GENERAL DAMAGES
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my opinion the upper limit of the
          assessment should be $25,000.00 for pain and
          suffering.  However, I have reduced this
          amount by $5,000.00 since Dana has not, in my
          view, satisfactorily discharged the duty upon
          her to mitigate imposed by law in pursuing
          the life style that she chose, her lack of
          desire to follow certain medical advice, and
          her general attitude towards helping herself
          to recover.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In our view, the trial judge erred in reducing the award for
general damages because of the appellant&#146;s failure to mitigate.
The respondents were unable to refer us to any evidence that, at
the time, the appellant failed to follow medical advice
concerning her &quot;life style&quot; that would in any way have changed
the progress of her recovery.  Finally, the trial judge appears
to have misapprehended some of the evidence, especially the
evidence of the appellant&#146;s consumption of alcohol.  The &#147;four
drinks of gin&#148; refers to a very brief period of time in 1990
following the death of the appellant&#146;s son when the appellant
drank some alcohol to assist her in sleeping.  It was not a
change in &#147;life style&#148; that affected the appellant&#146;s recovery
from the 1987 accident or that affected her pain and suffering
from that accident.
[8]  Counsel for the respondents submit that even if the trial
judge erred, the award of $20,000 can be supported.  The
respondents, in effect, ask us to substitute our opinion for that
of the trial judge as to the assessment of general damages.
However, we have not been persuaded that the trial judge&#146;s
assessment of $25,000 is clearly erroneous and the respondents
conceded in argument that it would be difficult to support an
argument to this effect.  In our view, the appellant is entitled
to the award she would have received but for the trial judge&#146;s
error.  Accordingly, the appeal as to damages is allowed in this
respect.
          </pre>
    <pre>                         5.   The costs award</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellants do not dispute that it was open to the trial
judge to make the award that he did by reason of Rule 49.10(2) of
the Rules of Civil Procedure.  The appellants submit, however,
that the costs assessed against the appellants ought to be paid
by David Warner, the defendant in the companion action of
Macartney et al. v. Warner.  The appellants base this submission
on the theory that the position taken by Warner prevented the
appellants from accepting the offer to settle from the
respondents.  The appellants argue that the trial judge had the
jurisdiction to make such an order under s. 131(1) of the Courts
of Justice Act on the basis that Warner was the true litigant
behind this action.
[10] When the respondents in this action made their offer to
settle, counsel for Warner advised counsel for the appellants
that if the appellants accepted the respondents&#146; offer to settle,
it would be on a &#147;with prejudice&#148; basis.  As we understand it,
counsel for Warner was merely putting the appellants on notice
that some portion of the income loss subsequent to the 1990
accident upon which the action against Warner was based should be
attributed to these respondents. Warner had an expert opinion to
support this position.
[11] In our view, the trial judge properly refused to order
Warner to pay the costs awarded against the appellants.  The
position taken by counsel for Warner did not preclude the
appellants from accepting the offer to settle.  The circumstances
of this case are not analogous to the cases where courts have
required the &#147;true litigant&#148; to bear the costs, although that
litigant is not a party to the action.  Warner had evidence to
support his position and was entitled to lead that evidence
irrespective of whether or not the appellants accepted the
respondents&#146; offer to settle.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[12] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal only to the extent of
amending paragraph I of the judgment to provide that Dana
Macartney recover the sum of $25,000 in general damages for pain
and suffering.
[13] As success was divided in this appeal we would not make any
award of costs in this court.
