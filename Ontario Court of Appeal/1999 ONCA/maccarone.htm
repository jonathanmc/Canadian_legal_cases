</pre>
    <pre>Brooke and O&#146;Connor JJ.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The majority of the court are of the opinion that the
sentence reflects an error in principle in failing to give due
weight to the rehabilitation of the offender. Having regard to
this principle, the driving prohibition as a component of his
sentence was too long. We think that coupled to three years in
the penitentiary ten years prohibition from driving was unduly
punitive.

[2]  The appellant had no previous criminal convictions. While it
is true that at the time of the accident true he was driving
while his license was suspended and there had been previous
suspensions, the suspensions were the result of the non-payment
of fines for unspecified traffic violations. While this is
significant, for the reason stated above, in our respectful
opinion, when considered with the rest of the evidence, a
prohibition from driving for ten years as part of the sentence
was not justified. In the result, consistent with the sentences
we have been referred to for like offences and offenders, we
grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and reduce the period of
prohibition to five years.</pre>

    <pre>Finlayson J.A.: (dissenting)</pre>
    <pre>
[3]  With respect, I am unable to agree with the disposition of
the majority. In my opinion, the trial judge made no error in
principle in imposing a ten year driving prohibition upon the
conviction of the appellant of one count of dangerous driving
causing death and an additional count of dangerous driving
causing serious bodily harm.

[4]  The appellant clearly had been drinking but he managed to
deprive the police of the ability to make a demand for a breath
sample by accusing his passenger, who was incapacitated by
injuries suffered at the hands of  the appellant, of being the
driver of the vehicle.

[5]  While it is asserted that the appellant was a first offender
in that he had no criminal convictions for driving or other
offences, at the time of the accident, the appellant was driving
his car while his licence was suspended. He had, in fact, four
prior convictions for driving with a license suspension covering
the period commencing in May of 1990 through to the year of this
accident. In my opinion, his conduct has demonstrated a history
of contempt for driving suspensions.

[6]  While the argument is made that he has rehabilitated
himself, particularly with respect to his problem of alcohol
abuse, upholding this driving suspension does not leave him
without recourse. If he can demonstrate a change in attitude,
such as to show that he has been rehabilitated, he may apply to
the parole board after serving five years of his suspension for
relief pursuant to s. 109 of the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act, R.S.C. 1992, c. 20.

[7]  Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss
the appeal.
