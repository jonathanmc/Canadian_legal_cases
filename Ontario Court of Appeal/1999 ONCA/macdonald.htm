    <pre>ABELLA J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On May 2, 1988, John MacDonald started working for ADGA</pre>
    <pre>Systems International Ltd. He had previously spent 35 years with</pre>
    <pre>the Canadian Air Force, reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</pre>
    <pre>He was an engineer, and developed an expertise with CF-18 fighter</pre>
    <pre>planes in his last years with the Air Force. When he was</pre>
    <pre>recruited by ADGA, he was living in Lahr, Germany and was about</pre>
    <pre>to retire.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  His retirement plan had been to move with his family to</pre>
    <pre>Vancouver, but he decided instead to accept a contract of</pre>
    <pre>employment with ADGA in Ottawa. He signed the contract on April</pre>
    <pre>29, 1988.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The termination clause of that contract states:

</pre>
    <pre>          12.  The Company may terminate this Agreement
          without notice at any time by reason of the
          Employee's dissipations, violation of any
          instruction or rule of the Company, or
          failure to comply with any of the agreements
          on the part of the Employee as herein set
          out. In addition it is also agreed that
          either party to this Agreement may terminate
          this Agreement at any time by giving not less
          than one (1) month's prior written notice
          sent either by registered mail or bailiff.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  ADGA is a professional consulting engineering company. It</pre>
    <pre>provides its services primarily to the federal government,</pre>
    <pre>determining what projects the government wants to have completed</pre>
    <pre>by the private sector, and finding the appropriate people for the</pre>
    <pre>particular project. It makes clear to these employees that their</pre>
    <pre>employment will likely end with the project. ADGA often hires</pre>
    <pre>retirees from the Canadian Armed Forces for contracts with the</pre>
    <pre>Department of National Defence.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  John MacDonald was hired because ADGA hoped that his skill</pre>
    <pre>and connections would attract contracts with the Department of</pre>
    <pre>National Defence, particularly a service contract for CF-18</pre>
    <pre>fighters.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As the letter making a conditional offer of employment to</pre>
    <pre>MacDonald clearly demonstrates, his employment with ADGA was</pre>
    <pre>linked to the awarding of the CF-18 contract:

</pre>
    <pre>          ADGA Systems International Limited (ADGA) is
          pleased to make you a contingent offer of
          employment with our firm, when you are
          available for civilian employment, to the
          following conditions:
</pre>
    <pre>          a)   ADGA obtains the projected contract
               with the Department of National
               Defence for services in the
               management of certain CF-18 sub-
               systems.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  ADGA's aspirations were realized when it was awarded a CF-18</pre>
    <pre>contract in 1988, which John MacDonald oversaw. MacDonald's</pre>
    <pre>salary was billed back to the Department of National Defence. The</pre>
    <pre>contract was renewed in 1990 and again in 1992.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In 1994, the contract was not awarded to ADGA. MacDonald's</pre>
    <pre>employment was therefore terminated by letter dated June 15,</pre>
    <pre>1994, and he received 13.2 weeks compensation from ADGA, a total</pre>
    <pre>of $23,951.22.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  MacDonald sued ADGA, claiming he was wrongfully dismissed</pre>
    <pre>and entitled to 14 months' compensation in lieu of notice, an</pre>
    <pre>amount totalling $87,964.72 exclusive of the $23,951.22 he had</pre>
    <pre>already received from ADGA.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial was essentially a dispute over whether ADGA had</pre>
    <pre>just cause to terminate MacDonald's employment. ADGA blamed the</pre>
    <pre>failure to win the 1994 CF-18 contract on MacDonald's behaviour;</pre>
    <pre>MacDonald denied any inappropriate conduct.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] The secondary issue was the notice entitlement: ADGA argued</pre>
    <pre>that it had complied with its contractual (and statutory)</pre>
    <pre>obligations by giving MacDonald more than 3 months' compensation;</pre>
    <pre>MacDonald argued that the contractual term was essentially</pre>
    <pre>meaningless given the length and nature of his employment.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] MacDonald was successful at trial, and was awarded the full</pre>
    <pre>amount requested. The trial judge found there was no just cause</pre>
    <pre>for his dismissal, that MacDonald was wrongfully dismissed, and</pre>
    <pre>that he was entitled to &quot;reasonable notice&quot; - a period of 14</pre>
    <pre>months in the circumstances of this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge treated the termination clause as a base</pre>
    <pre>only, and was of the view that it did not insulate ADGA from its</pre>
    <pre>common law requirement to provide reasonable notice to an</pre>
    <pre>employee who is wrongfully dismissed. He explained his approach</pre>
    <pre>in his oral reasons:

</pre>
    <pre>          ... Some time was spent on the contract
          provision. I have no difficulty with it. The
          contract document said ... that it is agreed
          either party may terminate the agreement at
          any time by giving not less than one month
          prior written notice sent either by
          registered mail. I've taken it quite simply
          that that was a commitment in the event of
          discharge by ADGA that they would give at
          least one month's written notice or one
          month's pay in lieu of notice. The case law
          amply supports that a requirement for written
          notice can be substituted by payment in lieu
          thereof.
</pre>
    <pre>          In any event, I simply view that as a base,
          an agreement by ADGA that, in fact, if Mr.
          MacDonald had performed so poorly, they
          wanted to let him go in the first few weeks,
          they would nevertheless owe him a month's
          pay. It does not, in any way create a
          ceiling, and I do not accept any suggestion
          that because a month is mentioned here, that
          the month should be taken as a base figure
          from which additions or subtractions can be
          made. Certainly the contract says, no
          subtractions. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>Analysis
</pre>
    <pre>[14] On appeal, ADGA did not quarrel with the &quot;no just cause&quot;</pre>
    <pre>finding. Instead, the appeal focused exclusively on the</pre>
    <pre>interpretation to be given to the termination clause.

</pre>
    <pre>[15] Both MacDonald and ADGA relied on the analysis in Machtinger</pre>
    <pre>v. HOJ Industries Ltd. (1992), 91 D.L.R. (4th) 491 (S.C.C.). In</pre>
    <pre>Machtinger, the termination provisions in two employment</pre>
    <pre>contracts were found to be void because they provided for a</pre>
    <pre>notice period less than the applicable statutory minimum in the</pre>
    <pre>Employment Standards Act. As a result, there no longer being a</pre>
    <pre>contractual provision setting a notice period, the dismissed</pre>
    <pre>employees were entitled to rely on their common law presumptive</pre>
    <pre>entitlement to an implied term of reasonable notice.

</pre>
    <pre>[16] On behalf of MacDonald, it was argued that the termination</pre>
    <pre>clause in his contract, which obliged the employer to give &quot;not</pre>
    <pre>less than&quot; one month's notice, sets out a term of notice less</pre>
    <pre>than that required by the Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990,</pre>
    <pre>c. E.14. Pursuant to s. 57(f) of that Act, an employee who has</pre>
    <pre>worked between 6 and 7 years for an employer, as MacDonald had,</pre>
    <pre>is entitled to 6 weeks' notice. ADGA argued that the provision,</pre>
    <pre>as worded, does not set out a notice period less than that</pre>
    <pre>required by statute and is therefore binding.

</pre>
    <pre>[17] There is no dispute about the applicable law. Both parties</pre>
    <pre>acknowledge that where an employment contract is for an</pre>
    <pre>indefinite period and the dismissal is without cause, an employee</pre>
    <pre>is entitled at common law to the presumption of an implied right</pre>
    <pre>to reasonable notice of an intention to terminate the contract,</pre>
    <pre>unless the employment contract clearly stipulates a notice</pre>
    <pre>period: Carter v. Bell &amp; Sons, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 438 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>But if the stipulated notice period in the contract provides for</pre>
    <pre>a term less than the minimum notice requirements of the</pre>
    <pre>Employment Standards Act, that provision is &quot;null and void&quot;:</pre>
    <pre>Machtinger at p. 505. Since voiding the contractual notice period</pre>
    <pre>renders the contract silent on the question of notice, there is</pre>
    <pre>no contractual rebuttal to the presumption of reasonable notice.</pre>
    <pre>The employee will therefore be entitled to the reasonable notice</pre>
    <pre>period implied at common law, a period which usually exceeds the</pre>
    <pre>period expressed in employment standards legislation: Machtinger</pre>
    <pre>at p. 508.

</pre>
    <pre>[18] It is helpful to compare the language of the termination</pre>
    <pre>clause in MacDonald's employment contract with that found in</pre>
    <pre>Machtinger's contract with HOJ. The termination clause in</pre>
    <pre>MacDonald's contract states:

</pre>
    <pre>          12.  The Company may terminate this Agreement
          without notice at any time by reason of the
          Employee's dissipations, violation of any
          instruction or rule of the Company, or
          failure to comply with any of the agreements
          on the part of the Employee as herein set
          out. In addition it is also agreed that
          either party to this Agreement may terminate
          this Agreement at any time by giving not less
          than one (1) month's prior written notice
          sent either by registered mail or bailiff.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[19] Machtinger's termination clause stated:

</pre>
    <pre>          Termination - Employer may terminate
          employment at any time without notice for
          cause. Otherwise, Employer may terminate
          employment on giving Employee 2 weeks' notice
          or salary ... in lieu of notice. ...
</pre>
    <pre>[20] In my view, the clause in Machtinger is easily</pre>
    <pre>distinguishable from the termination provision in MacDonald's</pre>
    <pre>contract. The Machtinger clause sets out a specific notice period</pre>
    <pre>which, on its face, violates the four week notice provisions</pre>
    <pre>required for these employees under the Employment Standards Act.

</pre>
    <pre>[21] The MacDonald clause, on the other hand, does not, on a</pre>
    <pre>plain reading, conflict with any legislative entitlement. ADGA is</pre>
    <pre>required to give MacDonald not less than 1 month's notice. This</pre>
    <pre>does not contravene the duty to comply with the Employment</pre>
    <pre>Standards Act's minimal requirement of one week's notice per year</pre>
    <pre>of service, up to a maximum of eight weeks.

</pre>
    <pre>[22] While not determinative, moreover, ADGA's payment of both</pre>
    <pre>the minimal six weeks' compensation to which MacDonald was</pre>
    <pre>entitled by statute, as well as an additional seven weeks'</pre>
    <pre>severance pay, reflects an understanding of the termination</pre>
    <pre>clause as requiring, at the very least, compliance with the</pre>
    <pre>notice requirements under the Employment Standards Act. Unlike</pre>
    <pre>Machtinger, there is no &quot;attempt to contract out of the minimum</pre>
    <pre>notice requirements of the Act&quot;: Machtinger at p. 502. To find</pre>
    <pre>that the clause in MacDonald's contract violates the Employment</pre>
    <pre>Standards Act requires an interpretation of the clause which</pre>
    <pre>injects an illegal term into what is, on its face, apparently</pre>
    <pre>legal.

</pre>
    <pre>[23] It would no doubt have been linguistically preferable had</pre>
    <pre>the termination provision in MacDonald's contract contained words</pre>
    <pre>after the term of notice such as &quot;in accordance with the relevant</pre>
    <pre>provisions of the Employment Standards Act.&quot; But while this layer</pre>
    <pre>of specificity might have enhanced the clarity of the parties'</pre>
    <pre>intentions, its absence does not detract from the provision's</pre>
    <pre>legality.

</pre>
    <pre>[24] In this case, the common law presumption in favour of</pre>
    <pre>reasonable notice has been rebutted. There is a clear - and</pre>
    <pre>clearly expressed - term providing for not less than one month's</pre>
    <pre>notice. Neither on its face, nor inferentially, does this term</pre>
    <pre>provide for a notice period less than that required by the</pre>
    <pre>Employment Standards Act, nor reflect an attempt to contract out</pre>
    <pre>of that requirement. Accordingly, the contractual term prevails</pre>
    <pre>over the common law presumption.

</pre>
    <pre>[25] The appeal is therefore allowed, the trial judgment is set</pre>
    <pre>aside, and the action is dismissed with costs of both the appeal</pre>
    <pre>and the trial.
