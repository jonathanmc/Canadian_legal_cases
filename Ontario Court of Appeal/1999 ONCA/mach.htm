</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Keenan J. with a jury dated 
November 27, 1993
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from his conviction on one count of
first degree murder and one count of attempted murder.  Of the
six grounds of appeal raised, we only found it necessary to hear
from the Crown on the following two grounds:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.     In view of the appellant&#146;s admitted liability for
manslaughter and aggravated assault, did the trial judge err in
instructing the jury that the appellant&#146;s post-offence conduct
(flight and concealment of evidence) could be taken into account
in assessing his culpability for the offences with which he was
charged;
2.     Did the trial judge err in failing to give the jury a
limiting instruction on the use that could be made of evidence,
led by the co-accuseds, that the appellant had a reputation for
dishonesty and manipulation?

</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On the afternoon of September 26, 1991, when 13-year-old
Felicia Lam returned home from school, the appellant and four
other men forced their way into her apartment.  The appellant
struck Felicia at the base of her skull with a heavy object and
when she offered resistance, she was set upon by the others.
Felicia was ultimately subdued and dragged into the washroom
adjacent to the master bedroom.  Before being bound and gagged,
her cries for help were met with repeated beatings about the
head.  At one point, the appellant produced a gun and told her to
&#147;shut up.&#148;
[3]  When her father, Albert Lam, returned home, he called out
for Felicia.  Within moments, he began to scream and Felicia
heard the sound of someone being struck &#147;with something really
hard.&#148;  She then heard a loud thud and the screaming stopped but
the blows continued.
[4]  Felicia next recalled someone being dragged across the
floor.  By then, she had managed to loosen her gag and she was
screaming loudly.  The appellant entered the bathroom and struck
her five times over the head with a full wine bottle.  She
described the blows as being much harder than those to which she
had previously been subjected.
[5]  Shortly thereafter, Felicia called out to the intruders,
telling them that her father&#146;s spouse Carol was likely to be home
soon.  It was her hope that this would cause the men to leave but
they did not.  According to Nash Ali and Don Yu, two accomplices
called as witnesses by the Crown, the appellant insisted that no
one leave as &#147;someone else might be coming.&#148;  As a result, the
men remained in the apartment for another two hours.  Ali and Yu
also testified that the appellant was the prime mover throughout
and that he was responsible for inflicting most of the injuries
to Felicia and her father.
[6]  Once the intruders had gone, Felicia managed to crawl to the
master bedroom where she found her father&#146;s lifeless body on the
floor.  A post-mortem examination revealed that his skull had
been bashed in, causing massive brain damage.  The pathologist
could not say whether Albert Lam died from brain injuries or loss
of blood.  Whatever the cause, it was apparent that he had been
the victim of a ferocious and brutal attack.  Felicia&#146;s injuries,
though less serious, were nonetheless life-threatening. She
suffered three separate skull fractures and had to be
hospitalized for several weeks.
[7]  The violent episode resulting in the death of Albert Lam was
the culmination of a series of events dating back to the early
1980&#146;s, when the appellant assisted Carol Chau, her sister Teresa
Khuu and their parents to escape from Vietnam to Canada.  For a
period of time in Vietnam and thereafter in Canada, the appellant
and Teresa formed a relationship and it was expected that they
would marry.  As time went on, however, the appellant became
increasingly possessive and violent towards Teresa and she broke
off the relationship in 1988.
[8]  Both before and after the break-up, the appellant blamed
Carol Chau for being a bad influence on Teresa because Carol had
formed a relationship with Albert Lam, a married man.  He was
also upset about the fact that neither Carol nor Teresa seemed to
appreciate his efforts in orchestrating their escape from
Vietnam.
[9]  A compelling body of evidence led at trial established the
existence of a deep-seated and long-standing animus on the part
of the appellant towards Teresa, Carol and Albert Lam.  From 1983
to 1991, the appellant engaged in a pattern of abusive conduct
towards them which included: actual violence, direct and indirect
threats of bodily harm and death, stalking, harassment and other
forms of conduct designed to dominate and intimidate.
[10] Following the appellant&#146;s arrest, several cassette tapes
were seized from his residence and motor vehicle.  These tapes
contained recordings of a number of telephone conversations,
including a conversation between the appellant and Teresa&#146;s aunt,
Ms. Cheung, in which the appellant made it known that he was
thinking of killing Teresa, Carol and the family and that he was
quite capable of doing so.
[11] Another tape contained a soliloquy recited by the appellant
in which he proclaimed his intention to kill four people,
including Teresa and Carol.  Reproduced below are four
significant excerpts from that tape:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Today is October one.  That is my &#133; the last &#133; day of my
          life.  This affection I have for you &#133; but no matter how much
          effort I have put in it, what I am saying is &#133; it&#146;s of no use,
          because she is a very cruel person, would come if so desired and
          would leave when so desired to &#133; but would not remember our &#133;
          nine years of affiliation &#133; and also that we have been through
          hell and back.  Throughout my life, gave my life for her.  In
          Vietnam, I have no more money left.  I also do not have honour
          any more.  I have also suffered for her but I did not think that
          I would end up like this today.
          </pre>
    <pre>               But, I think that, these four persons
          also &#133; also would meet the same fate as I &#133;
          would also vanish in Canada.  Because, in the
          end, they have been ungrateful and act
          contrary to justice, they will not die
          peacefully.  As human beings, they are very
          cruel.  I have thought about it many times
          before, originally, I&#146;d not want to kill
          them.  But, all along, she forced me into
          doing it.  There were two occasions when I
          have already bought a gun but, in the end, my
          logic and conscience took control of me and
          finally I threw the gun into the sea.  But,
          this time, really can no longer bear it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               But, I know that my life has reached the
          end in these few days.  I feel blue.  During
          this past sixty days, I come to this beach at
          Lakeshore everyday.  I thought about it
          deeply on what my next move should be. Kill
          her?  Of course, I have to consider the legal
          consequences, but, if not, I would feel the
          hurt for the rest of my life.  Frankly
          speaking, the way they behave is really too
          much.  Being ungrateful and contrary to
          justice.  Without shame, worse than a bitch,
          Ah Kwan [Carol] is an animal.  Seduced
          other&#146;s husband, led her own younger sister
          astray.  And, a person like Ah Man [Teresa],
          does not know how to think for herself.  I
          have painfully spoken to her on numerous
          occasions but, from beginning till end, she
          mistreated me all along.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Today is September, twenty-ninth &#133; in
          the night, at two o&#146;clock &#133; I came here to
          Lakeshore in a rage.  I have already decided
          to do it this way.  All have been decided
          like this. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[12] In their search of the appellant&#146;s apartment, the police
also discovered a message on his bedroom wall, written in Chinese
characters.  Translated, the message read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Thirteen years ago, I used every heard means in addition to
          my money, my reputation and my life to flee from Vietnam with
          this family through the rough sea.  After arriving in Canada I
          took my life and welfare heedlessly to provide them with
          education and treating them as if they were my own children.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is to be regretted that this family
          of scum; the eldest has committed adultery
          and becomes a mean person.  She seduces
          other&#146;s husband, ruining and scattering his
          family.  This family is dropping their
          benefactor as soon as his help is no longer
          needed, and is requiting one&#146;s kindness with
          enmity.  Today, let me get even with them,
          blood demands blood. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>Position of the parties at trial</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant was tried jointly with two of his accomplices,
Gary Mo and Lam Vien.  Each was charged with first degree murder
in connection with the death of Albert Lam and attempted murder
in respect of Felicia Lam.  As mentioned, two other accomplices,
Ali and Yu, testified for the Crown.  None of the defendants
testified at trial but each gave statements to the police which
were admitted into evidence.
[14] It was the position of the Crown that the appellant, driven
by hatred, resentment and jealousy over his failed relationship
with Teresa, devised a plan to murder Teresa and her sister
Carol, as well as Albert Lam and his daughter, and that he
enlisted four of his friends to assist him in carrying out the
plot.
[15] The defendants, on the other hand, took the position that
although they intended to intimidate and assault Albert Lam, they
did not intend to kill him or his daughter Felicia.  Each
attempted to shift the blame to others for the severe injuries
occasioned to Albert and Felicia.  In particular, the appellant
claimed in his statement to the police that he merely intended to
warn and threaten the occupants of the apartment, one of whom he
mistakenly believed to be Teresa Khuu.  According to the
appellant, when Albert Lam came home, he was swarmed by the
appellant and his accomplices and during the ensuing melee, blows
were struck by a number of people solely for the purpose of
subduing him. As for Felicia, the appellant admitted to striking
her but claimed that he did so only to keep her quiet, not to
kill her.  In short, the appellant conceded his liability to
manslaughter and aggravated assault but denied having the
requisite intent for murder or attempted murder.
[16] By its verdict, the jury clearly rejected the appellant&#146;s
defence of lack of intent.  However, in convicting the co-accused
of manslaughter and aggravated assault, the jury accepted their
position that they did not intend to kill the occupants of the
apartment and that they had been deceived by the appellant as to
his true motive and intention when he enlisted their services.</pre>
    <pre>Issue I - The Appellant&#146;s Post-Offence Conduct</pre>
    <pre>[17] In his charge, the trial judge outlined the post-offence
conduct of the appellant and his co-accused Mo from which the
jury could infer consciousness of guilt.  Of the four items
mentioned, the only one directly referable to the appellant was
&#147;his departure [from Toronto] to Kingston on what appears to be
the second day after the homicide.&#148;  The other items included
Mo&#146;s false statement to the police, his flight from Toronto to
Singapore and his removal and disposal of evidence from the crime
scene.  Accordingly, in terms of the appellant, the jury was left
to consider his flight from Toronto and his indirect involvement
in the concealment of evidence as evidence from which they could
infer consciousness of guilt.
[18] In his instructions to the jury on the use they could make
of flight and concealment, the trial judge said this:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Similarly, evidence of flight may be considered as evidence
          of consciousness of guilt.  Before the inference is properly
          drawn, you must find that indeed there was flight and that it was
          not caused by any other cause but that it was intended by the
          accused to flee to avoid detection and arrest.  If that inference
          is properly drawn from the evidence, then you must also consider
          the involvement in what offence that the accused was fleeing
          from.  Finally, if the inference of consciousness of guilt is
          properly to be drawn, it is not conclusive of the issue of guilt.
          You must consider that inference along with all the other
          evidence in determining whether the Crown has proved the guilt of
          an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The same test applies as well to
          evidence of cover-up or attempting to conceal
          evidence.  You must find that it was done
          deliberately and for the purpose of avoiding
          detection.  You must be satisfied that it was
          for the purpose of avoiding detection and
          arrest for the offence with which the accused
          is charged and not because of [an] attempt to
          avoid some other offence.  Then finally, if
          you draw the inference of consciousness of
          guilt, that is not conclusive.  It must be
          considered along with all of the other
          evidence in determining whether the Crown has
          proved the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[19] Later in his charge, the trial judge returned to the
evidence of post-offence conduct in his instructions on planning
and deliberation.  In this respect, he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Evidence of what transpired after the killing may be used to
          support a finding of planning and deliberation, but only if you
          find that it was an integral part of the plan formulated before
          the homicide.  Evidence of flight or concealment or attempts to
          conceal do not alone support an inference that the murder was
          planned and deliberate.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[20] After reminding the jury of the substantial body of
evidence, apart from flight and concealment, upon which the Crown
was relying to prove that Albert Lam&#146;s death was the product of a
calculated plan, devised by the appellant, to murder the
occupants of the Lam residence, the trial judge completed his
remarks on flight and concealment as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               They [flight and concealment] are also capable of supporting
          an inference of planning and deliberation if you find that they
          were a part of an ongoing process of formulating an intention to
          kill one or more of those persons and a course of deliberation on
          the consequences of doing so.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[21] As a result of this court&#146;s decision in R. v. MacKinnon and
Crooks, [1999] O.J. No. 346, Ms. Copeland conceded that flight
and concealment were factors which the jury could properly take
into account in determining whether the appellant engaged in a
planned and deliberate murder.  In other words, she accepts that
it was open to the jury to consider the appellant&#146;s post-offence
conduct in determining his level of culpability.  She maintained,
however, that the same evidence could not be used to show that
the appellant had the requisite intent for murder and that the
trial judge erred in failing to so instruct the jury.  We
disagree.
[22] In view of Ms. Copeland&#146;s concession that the appellant&#146;s
post-offence conduct was relevant to prove that he had engaged in
a planned and deliberate murder, a fortiori, it was also relevant
to prove that he had the requisite intent for murder.
Manifestly, a planned and deliberate murder is one which
necessarily includes the requisite mental element for murder.
Accordingly, in our view, it was open to the jury to consider the
post-offence conduct as a factor in determining whether the
appellant had the requisite intent for murder, so long as the
jury was otherwise satisfied that flight and concealment were an
integral part of the plan formulated by the appellant before the
homicide.
[23] If the trial judge erred at all, it was in failing to
instruct the jury, in more precise terms, how the post-offence
conduct could be used to prove intent.  Assuming that he erred in
this regard, we are of the view that the error was harmless and
occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The
post-offence conduct paled in value beside the other direct and
circumstantial evidence which went to prove that the appellant
had the requisite intent for murder.  Indeed, in our view, the
case against the appellant in this respect was overwhelming.
Accordingly, even if the trial judge had been clearer in his
instructions, we are satisfied that the verdict would inevitably
have been the same.</pre>
    <pre>Issue II &#150; Failure to provide a limiting instruction on the use
of the appellant&#146;s reputation for dishonesty and manipulation</pre>
    <pre>[24] As indicated, it was the position of the co-accuseds that
although they were guilty of manslaughter and aggravated assault,
they did not intend to kill Albert or Felicia Lam.  In support of
their position, they relied in part on the fact that in agreeing
to assist the appellant, they were misled by him as to his true
motivation and intent.  To substantiate this, the co-accuseds led
evidence from various Crown witnesses that the appellant had a
reputation for dishonesty and manipulation.  Although the Crown
could not have led this evidence, it is accepted that it was
admissible on behalf of the co-accuseds.
[25] In his charge, the trial judge carefully instructed the jury
that they could not use the evidence of the appellant&#146;s prior
acts of violence and his abusive conduct towards Carol, Teresa,
Albert Lam and others to show that he was a person of violent
disposition and therefore more likely to have committed the
offences with which he was charged.  Rather, that evidence went
to the appellant&#146;s state of mind and it could only be used to
establish a motive on his part for wanting to kill the occupants
of the Lam residence.  The trial judge made no mention of the
appellant&#146;s reputation for dishonesty and manipulation, except to
point out, on behalf of the co-defendant Mo, that this aspect of
the appellant&#146;s character lent credence to Mo&#146;s position that in
agreeing to assist the appellant, he had been misled as to the
appellant&#146;s true motivation and intent.
[26] After taking objections to the charge, the trial judge
provided further instructions to the jury on the issue of motive.
As well, he drew the jury&#146;s attention to the appellant&#146;s
statement to the police and reminded the jury that if they
believed or had a reasonable doubt that the appellant lacked the
requisite intent for murder, he could not be convicted of murder.
[27] After the jury had been excused, counsel for Mo [not Mr.
Ruby or Ms. Copeland] requested, for the first time, that the
jury be recalled and instructed that in assessing the weight to
be given to the appellant&#146;s statement to the police, they should
disregard the evidence of his reputation for dishonesty and
manipulation.
[28] The trial judge recalled the jury and provided further
instruction on the issue of motive.  He again reminded the jury
that the evidence of the appellant&#146;s prior acts of violence and
abusive conduct could not be used to show that he was a person of
violent disposition but only to determine whether he had a motive
to commit murder.  He also told the jury that as far as the co-
accuseds were concerned, evidence of the appellant&#146;s motive could
not be used against them unless they were aware of his motive.
He then provided the following instruction on the limited use the
jury could make of the appellant&#146;s reputation for dishonesty and
manipulation:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Then the other possibility that is available to you in
          dealing with the question of the intent of the other accused, or
          either of them, or what their purpose was in being there, you can
          take into account the evidence of Son Mach, his previous conduct
          and the evidence that he tended to lie and be manipulative, which
          I discussed with you, and you can use that evidence if you see
          fit to consider whether the others may have [been] deceived [by]
          him and that it is more likely that he is the person who would
          have deceived them to come to the premises and then embark upon a
          killing spree of his own, to put it that way.  That is a
          permissible inference if you consider that that is the
          appropriate inference to be drawn from that evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[29] On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Ruby contends that although
this instruction was correct insofar as the co-accuseds were
concerned, the trial judge should have gone further and
instructed the jury that they could not use that evidence against
the appellant in assessing the weight to be given to his
statement to the police.
[30] Although it would have been preferable had the trial judge
instructed the jury along these lines, we are not persuaded that
his failure to do so was fatal.  Even if the jury accepted that
the appellant was prone to lying and manipulation, it is fanciful
to think that they would have used this to infer that he was the
sort of person likely to commit murder.  In any event, as we have
already observed, the evidence led by the Crown to prove that the
appellant had the requisite intent to kill Albert and Felicia Lam
was overwhelming.  Had the trial judge directed the jury to
disregard the evidence of the appellant&#146;s reputation for
dishonesty and manipulation in assessing his statement, the
verdict, in our view, would inevitably have been the same.
[31] Accordingly, the appellant&#146;s appeal from conviction is
dismissed.
