</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Ferguson J. dated December 18, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellants, joint owners of a cottage property adjacent
to  Pigeon  Lake  in  the  Township  of  Harvey,  applied  for  a
declaration  determining  the  rights  of  the  respondents  with
respect  to a 20 foot right of way over the appellants&#146; property.
The  right of way, shown on Appendix A, affords the owners of two
islands  access  to their properties. Ferguson  J.  rejected  the
appellants submissions and ruled as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)   the right of way extends not only to the registered owners
of the two islands but to anyone to whom they give their
permission including invitees, guests, tradespeople, etc.;
(b)   the users of the right of way may install, maintain and
store on the right of way a dock to afford access to the islands;
(c)   the users of the right of way may park cars and boat
trailers on the right of way when gaining access to the islands;
(d)   the users of the right of way may use the right of way to
access the &#147;vehicle turnaround&#148; (shown on Appendix A as Part 2,
Plan 45R-5573) that is located on the lands adjacent to those of
the appellants owned by the respondents Norman and Beverley
Matthews;
(e)   the appellants have no right to fence the western boundary
of their property to preclude users from having access to the
vehicle turnaround; and
(f)   the appellants have no right to place a locked or unlocked
gate to be accessed only by proper users of the right of way at
the top of the right of way.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  appellants appeal all aspects of the declaration,  but
before this Court, they placed particular emphasis on the related
issues of their claim to a right to fence the western boundary of
their property and of their assertion that the users of the right
of way have no right to access the vehicle turnaround.</pre>
    <pre>HISTORY OF THE RIGHT OF WAY</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The right of way at issue in this appeal was created in 1980
by Herbert Neil (&#147;Neil&#148;) who, at the time, owned the property now
owned  by  the  appellants. Neil also owned the two  islands.  In
August  1980,  Neil  conveyed the two islands  to  his  wife.  By
separate  deed, Neil also conveyed to his wife and her successors
in  title  &#147;a  right  of way for persons and vehicles&#148;  over  the
westerly  20 feet of his mainland parcel (the lands now owned  by
the  appellants). Shortly thereafter, Neil conveyed the  mainland
parcel   to  Joanne  Illingworth  (&#147;Illingworth&#148;).  A  subsequent
agreement between Neil and Illingworth, also registered on title,
clarified  the right of way as a &#147;private right of way  providing
access  to  the  registered owners&#148; of the  islands  and  further
provided  that Illingworth would not grant any right  of  way  to
&#147;the public at large&#148; over this strip of land or to anyone &#147;other
than the owners, guests and tradesmen&#148; of the islands.
[4]  Neil then reacquired the islands from his wife in September
1980. In 1985, while Neil still owned the islands, he had a
dispute with Mr. Kemp, who at the time, owned the parcel of land
now owned by the respondent Beverley Matthews, immediately to the
west of the lot then owned by Illingworth and now owned by the
appellants. Neil asserted a right to a 15 foot right of way at
the easterly edge of the Kemp property in favour of the west
island. Neil contemplated using the 15 foot right of way in
conjunction with the 20 foot right of way he had created over the
Illingworth parcel. The 15 foot strip would allow for vehicle
turning movements. Kemp contested Neil&#146;s claim and litigation
ensued. The law suit was settled on the basis that Neil would
forego his claim for a right of way over the entire 15 foot
strip, and in return, Kemp would agree to a right of way over a
strip of land 4.5 m wide by 12.2 m long for the purpose of
allowing vehicles to turn around. A survey was prepared and a
conveyance registered, granting to Neil, as the registered owner
of the two islands, an easement &#147;for vehicle turnaround&#148; over
Part 2 of  Plan 45R-5573 as shown on Schedule A. The Matthews
subsequently acquired the Kemp property as well as the two
islands owned by Neil. The present owners of those two islands
are the respondents Norman Matthews and Suzanne and Norma Koch.
The Matthews operate on their properties, which include
additional lands to the west, a commercial operation known as
STrails End Lodge&#148;.
[5]  The right of way over the Illingworth property and the right
of way over the vehicle turnaround on the Kemp property were
physically opened in 1991. The appellants acquired their property
from Illingworth in February 1994. When the appellants acquired
the property, it was vacant. Both rights of way were registered
on title, physically opened, in use, and plainly visible. The
appellants have since constructed a cottage on their property.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>(a)  Who Has the Right to Use the Right of way?</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In my view, the applications judge correctly concluded &#147;that
the  wording of the grant gives a right of user to the registered
owners and the occupiers of the islands and anyone [to] whom they
give  permission  to cross the right of way for  the  purpose  of
gaining  access  to  one  of  the  islands&#148;.  I  agree  with  his
conclusion  that the clarification agreement between  Illingworth
and  Neil  did not cut back the rights of the island owners,  but
rather,  restricted the rights of Illingworth by  precluding  her
from  affording others the right to use this right  of  way.  The
construction proposed by the appellants limiting the use  of  the
right of way to the registered owners of the islands would, in my
view,   be   contrary  to  common  sense  and  to  the   ordinary
construction  afforded such easements: see:  Baxendale  v.  North
Lambeth Liberal and Radical Club Ltd., [1902] 2 Ch. 427 at 429.
[7]  One of the appellants&#146; concerns is that the right of way is
being used by visitors to the respondent Matthews&#146; property and
to the lodge rather than by the owners of the islands and their
guests. There is no doubt that such use is improper and
unauthorized. The judgment under appeal makes that clear by
declaring that &#147;the lawful users of the right of way are the
registered owners and occupiers of the two islands and anyone
[to] whom they give permission but only for the purpose of
gaining access to one of the two islands&#148;. The respondents take
no issue with limiting the right to use the right of way and the
vehicle turnaround in this manner.</pre>
    <pre>(b)  Ancillary rights: dock and parking</pre>
    <pre>[8]  I also agree with the applications judge that &#147;the grant  of
an  easement  includes  a  grant of ancillary  rights  which  are
reasonably  necessary to the use and enjoyment  of  the  easement
which  was  contemplated  by  the  grantor&#148;.  The  easement   was
specifically intended to afford owners of the islands  access  to
their properties by boat and the installation and maintenance  of
a  dock  is  implicit  in such an easement.  Moreover,  there  is
evidence  that a dock existed at the end of the right of  way  at
the  time  it  was  created. I agree that  the  installation  and
maintenance  of a dock is an ancillary right that  is  reasonably
necessary  to the use and enjoyment of the easement in  question:
see Jones v. Pritchard, [1908] 1 Ch. 630 at 638; Smith v. Morris,
[1935] O.R. 260 at 264-265 (C.A.).
[9]  The purpose of the right of way is to provide access to the
islands. Users of the right of way must arrive in vehicles which
they cannot transport to the islands. I agree with the
applications judge that the parking of vehicles while the users
enjoy access to the islands is an ancillary right reasonably
necessary to the use and enjoyment of the easement. In this
regard, I note that on behalf of the respondents, Mr. Webster
indicated that no right was being asserted to store boat trailers
at the end of the right of way for the entire season. The
respondents merely claimed the right to bring boat trailers on
the right of way on a temporary basis to load and unload the
boats.</pre>
    <pre>(c)  Right of Access to the &#147;Vehicle Turnaround&#148; and Right to Fence</pre>
    <pre>[10]  As I have already indicated, these related issues were  the
focus of the appeal. In his very able submission on behalf of the
appellants,  Mr. Wigley relied on the well established  principle
that  &#147;[i]f a right of way be granted for the enjoyment of  Close
A,  the grantee, because he owns or acquires Close B, cannot  use
the  way  in  substance for passing over Close  A  to  Close  B&#148;:
Harris v. Flower (1904), 74 L.J.Ch. 127 at 132 per Romer L.J. See
also  Miller  v.  Tipling (1918), 43 D.L.R. 469 (Ont.  C.A.)  per
Mulock  C.J.Ex. at p. 475:  &#147;The law is well-established  that  a
right  of way appurtenant to a particular close must not be  used
colourably for the real purpose of reaching a different adjoining
close.&#148;; Purdom v. Robinson (1899), 30 S.C.R. 64 at 71 per Strong
C.J.  &#147;&#133;a  right  of way granted as an easement incidental  to  a
specified  property cannot be used by the grantee  for  the  same
purposes in respect of any other property&#148;. The appellants submit
that,  as the right of way in question was created expressly  and
explicitly  to provide access to the islands, it is not  open  to
the  owners of the islands to use the right of way to gain access
to  and  from the vehicle turnaround area located on the adjacent
property.
[11] In my view, the rule that an easement cannot be used to gain
access to a property other than that for which the easement was
created does not apply in the circumstances of this case. That
rule precludes the user of a right of way from enlarging the
burden of the easement on the servient tenement by using it for a
purpose different from that for which it was created. In Harris v
.Flower, supra, the owner of the dominant tenement owned an
adjacent parcel which he had landlocked by his own acts. He then
built a factory, partly on the servient tenement and partly on
the adjacent parcel. The only access to the factory was by the
right of way. The English Court of Appeal found that this created
a significant and unacceptable enlargement of the burden of the
right of way. Similarly, in Purdom v. Robinson, supra, and Miller
v. Tipling, supra, the owner of the dominant tenement sought to
exercise the rights granted by the easement to access a property
other than that for which the easement was intended. In an
Ontario case relied on by the appellants,  Re Gordon and Regan
(1985), 49 O.R. (2d) 521 (H.C.J.), aff&#146;d., (1989) 71 O.R. (2d)
736 (C.A.), Griffiths J. was confronted with a situation where an
owner of the dominant tenement sought to add to the burden of the
easement. The applicants enjoyed a right of way over a mutual
drive. They also owned an adjoining property with a garage and
planned to convert their single family dwelling into two semi-
detached houses and to have both owners use the drive to gain
access to the garage. Griffiths J. held that the proposed use of
the right of way could not be authorized (at p. 528):  &#147;As I
interpret the authorities, the rights under the easement must be
restricted to some purpose connected with the direct enjoyment
and use of the dominant tenement.&#148;
[12] There is no mechanical way to determine what constitutes an
unreasonable demand upon an easement. Each case depends upon both
a proper construction of the instrument creating the easement and
the factual circumstances: see : Laurie v. Winch, [1952] 4 D.L.R.
449 at 455 (S.C.C.); National Trust v. White, [1987] 1 W.L.R. 907
at 913 (Ch.D.). It is important to consider the language of the
conveyance creating the easement, its purpose and the
circumstances of its creation, the history of its development in
conjunction with the vehicle turnaround, and the circumstances of
its use. In my view, these factors lead to the conclusion that
access to and from the vehicle turnaround on the Matthews
property is a reasonable ancillary use, provided that such use is
in relation to access to the islands by those who enjoy the right
to use the easement for that purpose. The burden on the
appellants&#146; property is not increased. Access to the vehicle
turnaround area may be had only for a purpose identical to that
of the right of way at issue: namely, to gain access to the
islands. Access to and from the vehicle turnaround enhances the
easement for its intended purpose; quite the contrary of the
situation in the cases cited by the appellants where the easement
was being used to enhance the use or enjoyment of some property
other than the one the easement was intended to benefit.
[13] The appellants also rely on the common law right of an owner
to fence his or her property: Lewis v. Wakeling, (1923), 54
O.L.R. 647 (C.A.). They say that this right allows them to fence
the western boundary of their land, and preclude the respondent
island owners from accessing the vehicle turnaround area on the
Matthews property. In my view, the analysis in National Trust v.
White, supra, provides a complete answer to that submission. The
National Trust enjoyed a right of way over White&#146;s lands to
provide public access to an historic site. To avoid congestion,
the National Trust established a car park on lands adjacent to
White&#146;s land. The car park was accessed from the right of way.
White made the same argument advanced by the appellants in the
case at bar, namely, that the right of way over his land could
only be used to access the historic site, not the car park, and
that he had the right to erect a fence along the right of way to
preclude entry to and from the car park. Warner J. rejected
White&#146;s submission and held that as the car park could only be
used by those visiting the historic site, permitting access to it
from the right of way was (at p. 913) &#147;properly to be regarded as
ancillary to the enjoyment&#148; of the right of way. I adopt as
applicable to the present case Warner J.&#146;s disposition of the
claimed right to fence: (at p. 913):
          </pre>
    <pre>          What would, in a particular case, constitute a derogation
     from the grant and what would, in that case, constitute an
     unreasonable demand depends, of course, in the first instance on
     the proper construction of the grant and then on the factual
     circumstances. So here, if on the true construction of the grant
     in the&#133;conveyance [from White&#146;s predecessor in title] it is
     reasonable for the National Trust to do that which it claims to
     be entitled to do, the defendants may not exercise their right to
     fence their land so as to prevent it.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  I have found that access to and from the vehicle turnaround
is  a  reasonable ancillary use. Such use benefits  no  right  or
interest  other than the easement itself. In my view, it  follows
that the appellants&#146; common law right to fence their property has
been  limited by the easement to the extent necessary  to  afford
the respondents access to and from the vehicle turnaround.</pre>
    <pre>(d)  Right to erect a gate</pre>
    <pre>[15]  As noted, there was some evidence that the right of way  is
being  used  by  unauthourized persons to and from  the  Matthews
property.  The  applications judge found that since  the  parties
contemplated  a  fence along the boundary of the  properties  and
around  the  vehicle  turnaround such  that  the  turnaround  was
accessible,  a  gate  might  not be required  and  could  not  be
presently  justified. He did, however, reserve to the  appellants
the right to apply to the court again for a declaration that they
may  erect  a  gate  if  the proposed fencing  does  not  prevent
unauthorized access.
[16] It is apparent from the reasons of the applications judge
that he found that there was evidence of unauthorized use, and
that the issue was how, not whether, such unauthorized use was to
be stopped. In my view, it is important that there be a final
determination of the rights of the parties. An unlocked gate
would constitute a minimal interference with the right of the
island owners and their guests, but at the same time would
discourage others from entry onto the appellants&#146; property: see
Siple v. Blow (1904), 8 O.L.R. 547 at 554 (C.A.). I would vary
the judgment to permit the appellants to erect an unlocked gate
at the top end of the right of way where it meets Chalet Lane. I
would add that the appellants&#146; request for permission to erect a
locked gate should be rejected as it would significantly
inconvenience the island owners and, particularly, their guests
in a manner not contemplated by the grant and not required by the
circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[17]  For  these reasons, I would vary the judgment  by  deleting
paragraph 6 and substituting in its place the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          THIS COURT ORDERS that the MacKenzies have the right to
     erect an unlocked gate blocking access to the right of way at the
     north end of their property.</pre>
    <pre>[18]  Otherwise,  I would dismiss the appeal. As the  respondents
have  achieved  substantial success, they are entitled  to  their
costs of the appeal.
