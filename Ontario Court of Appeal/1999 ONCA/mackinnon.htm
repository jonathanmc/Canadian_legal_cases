                               I.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants were charged with first degree murder. After
a lengthy trial, MacKinnon was convicted of first degree murder.
Crooks was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 8 years'
imprisonment. The trial judge ordered that Crooks serve at least
one-half of his sentence before being eligible for parole.
MacKinnon appeals his conviction. Crooks appeals both conviction
and sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  I would affirm MacKinnon's conviction and order a new trial
for Crooks on the charge of manslaughter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              II.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  I will set out the evidence only to the extent needed to
understand the issues raised on the conviction appeals. Mr.
Norman Chow worked at the Durham Sports Shooters Gun Club (the
club). Mr. Chow knew MacKinnon who was a member of the gun club.
Mr. Chow was shot and killed while working at the club. Both
appellants were present when Mr. Chow was shot. They fled the
scene with some money and a gun belonging to the club.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  It was the theory of the Crown that MacKinnon had decided to
steal guns from the club some time prior to Mr. Chow's death.
MacKinnon was known to the employees at the club, including Mr.
Chow, and knew he would have to kill whoever was working when he
stole the guns. MacKinnon unsuccessfully tried to enlist the
assistance of various friends until he eventually approached
Crooks who agreed to participate in the plan.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Dewayne Ransome drove the appellants to the club. He
insisted that he knew nothing about the planned robbery. The
appellants entered the club and Ransome remained in the car. A
short time later Mr. Chow was shot. The appellants stole a gun
and some money and fled the scene in the car driven by Ransome.
According to Ransome, both appellants were excited and laughing
when they returned to the car. They said that they had sent the
deceased &quot;back to China.&quot; Ransome drove the two appellants to a
schoolyard where they disposed of certain material in a dumpster.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The Crown argued that Mr. Chow's killing was a planned and
deliberate murder. According to the Crown's theory, MacKinnon was
the shooter and Crooks was guilty of first degree murder as an
aider and abettor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Counsel for MacKinnon maintained that MacKinnon was not a
party to any agreement to robbery and that Crooks shot and killed
Mr. Chow on his own. MacKinnon did not testify. It was Crooks'
position that he went to the club with MacKinnon believing that
they were going to make an illegal purchase of a firearm. Crooks
claimed that there had been no discussion of any robbery and that
MacKinnon, acting entirely on his own and without any prior
knowledge on Crooks' part, shot and killed Mr. Chow. Crooks
testified.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  There was some evidence that Crooks was the shooter, but
significantly more evidence pointing to MacKinnon as the shooter.
There was also a considerable body of evidence implicating Crooks
in the robbery, including evidence that he stole a gun from the
club in the course of the shooting and later sold that weapon.
There was, however, some evidence capable of supporting Crooks'
contention that he was not a party to the robbery.  There were
several weapons in the open safe of the club when Mr. Chow was
shot. These weapons were not taken by MacKinnon and Crooks. It
could be argued that had robbery been the motive, the guns would
have been taken from the club. In addition, Crooks' first comment
to Ransome when he returned to the car after the shooting could
be understood as being consistent with his claim that he did not
anticipate any violence when he went into the club with
MacKinnon. Crooks also denied laughing about the shooting in the
car. He said he was terrified and afraid that MacKinnon might
kill him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The jury's verdict against MacKinnon indicates that it was
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the shooter and
had planned to kill Mr. Chow. The verdict of manslaughter against
Crooks indicates that the jury was satisfied that he was an aider
and abettor in MacKinnon's plan to rob and that he knew or ought
to have known that the plan involved the risk of bodily harm to
Mr. Chow or someone else.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              III.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] MacKinnon contends that the trial judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury that evidence of after-the-fact conduct could
not assist them in determining MacKinnon's level of culpability
should they find that he was party to a culpable homicide.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] At the time of trial, there was considerable uncertainty in
the law as to how a jury should be instructed concerning after-
the-fact evidence. The trial judge wisely decided to canvass
counsels' views on the matter. After extensive discussion, the
trial judge delivered an instruction which was entirely
consistent with that requested by all counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The trial judge commenced his instruction with reference to
the evidence which could constitute &quot;consciousness of guilt.&quot; He
said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The Crown alleges that the following conduct
          on the part of the two accused is evidence of
          consciousness of guilt for the offence
          charged and inconsistent with their
          protestations of innocence. For the two
          accused this consists of the following: 1,
          their flight from the shooting scene; 2,
          their laughing about the incident in the car;
          and 3, their disposing of evidence in the
          dumpster once they returned to school.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The judge carefully instructed the jury that before the
evidence had any value they had to determine whether or not the
alleged conduct had occurred. He reviewed the relevant evidence
and the positions of the parties on this issue. The trial judge
continued his instruction:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... In order for you to reach the conclusion
          that these items of conduct constitute
          consciousness of guilt the Crown must satisfy
          you beyond a reasonable doubt that they acted
          in the manner alleged and that the accused so
          acted either to conceal their complicity in
          this murder, not any other offence such as
          dealing in firearms, or in a manner totally
          inconsistent with having been a mere witness
          to this fatal shooting. Having concluded
          that, you may use the conduct as evidence of
          consciousness of guilt. You must then decide
          whether or not you will use it for that
          purpose. In this regard consider all of the
          evidence and the surrounding circumstances.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          You will recall that Mr. Crooks testified
          that he panicked and did not want to have any
          connection with this incident because he did
          not expect the police would believe his
          story. To my mind this was basically Mr.
          Ransome's response to his involvement as
          well. If, having considered all of the
          evidence and surrounding circumstances you
          decide to use the evidence, you may proceed
          to do that and draw an inference that the
          conduct of the accused shows a consciousness
          of guilt on his part respecting this offence.
          By itself, this conduct is only evidence of
          the consciousness of guilt. But from that
          finding you are asked by the Crown to infer
          that both accused are guilty of the offence
          with which they are charged. If you have
          drawn an inference that the conduct of the
          accused shows a consciousness of guilt on the
          part of the accused respecting the offence
          before the court then you may go on to
          consider that inference and to draw the
          further inference that the accused is guilty
          of offence with which he is charged. This is
          an inference which may be drawn, but not one
          which must be drawn, by you.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          By itself, a consciousness of guilt is not
          proof of guilt itself. It is only a
          circumstance from which you may draw an
          inference of guilt. Before such an inference
          can be drawn against Mr. Crooks for the
          conduct related to flight and disposal of the
          items in the dumpster, you must be able to
          foreclose the illegal gun deal as a possible
          explanation beyond a reasonable doubt. Only
          then does this shooting become potentially
          referrable to that conduct. As well, you
          would have to foreclose panic on the part of
          Mr. Crooks as being a potential explanation
          beyond a reasonable doubt before you could
          refer the alleged conduct to his complicity
          in this shooting. It is to be remembered that
          totally innocent individuals may respond in a
          superficially incriminating manner because of
          the emotion of the moment. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Evidence of after-the-fact conduct is a type of
circumstantial evidence. Its potential probative value will
depend upon the nature of the evidence, the issues in the case
and the positions of the parties. Often, evidence of after-the-
fact conduct will be probative of the accused's participation in
the crime alleged, but will have no probative value in
determining the level of the accused's culpability. Sometimes,
however, as a matter of common sense and human experience, the
evidence will be capable of supporting an inference that an
accused had a particular state of mind: R. v. White and Cote
(1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 400-403 (S.C.C.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] The appellants' conduct as described by Ransome, from the
time they fled the club until they disposed of evidence in the
dumpster could, when viewed in its entirety, support the
inference that they had done exactly what they had planned to do,
that is, enter the club, commit a robbery and shoot Mr. Chow.
This inference would lend considerable support to the Crown's
claim that the murder was planned and deliberate. As the evidence
had some probative value on the question of whether the
appellants had engaged in a planned and deliberate murder as
opposed to a robbery or some other illegal activity which had
gone awry, the trial judge could not have instructed the jury
that the evidence had no value in determining the appellants'
level of culpability. The alleged non-direction does not
constitute misdirection on the evidence adduced in this case.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The &quot;consciousness of guilt&quot; instruction given by the trial
judge was overly favourable to the appellants in two ways. First,
the trial judge did not make it as clear as he might have how the
evidence could be probative on the charge of first degree murder.
Second, the trial judge, applying since overruled authority from
this court (R. v. Court (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 237), told the
jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the evidence supported the inference of consciousness of guilt
before the evidence could be used against the appellants. It is
now established that the reasonable doubt standard is not applied
when determining what inferences should be drawn from after-the-
fact conduct: R. v. White and Cote, supra, at pp. 405-410.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] If I am wrong and the non-direction could amount to an error
in law, I would apply the curative proviso to preserve
MacKinnon's conviction. The case against MacKinnon was
overwhelming. The consciousness of guilt evidence paled in value
beside the other direct evidence of MacKinnon's plan to commit a
robbery and murder. Furthermore, considered in its entirety, the
consciousness of guilt instruction was far from prejudicial. I am
completely satisfied that had the jury been told they could use
the consciousness of guilt evidence only to implicate MacKinnon
in the culpable homicide, their verdict would inevitably have
been the same.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                              IV.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] Crooks claims that the trial judge failed to relate the
evidence capable of supporting his defence in a way which would
ensure that the jury appreciated the significance of the evidence
to the issues raised by the defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] The trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the many
evidentiary matters which arose in this lengthy and complex
trial. He effectively related the evidence to those evidentiary
instructions. The trial judge also correctly instructed the jury
as to the applicable law of homicide and liability as a party. He
summarized Crooks' position in these words:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The position of Mr. Crooks is equally
          straightforward. He had absolutely nothing to
          do with the murder of Norman Chow which was
          committed independently and suddenly by
          Nathan MacKinnon. The extent of his
          criminality ... was in an illegal firearms
          deal and nothing more.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] The trial judge did not, however, relate any of the evidence
to the position of Mr. Crooks as he had summarized it. Counsel
for Mr. Crooks objected to the trial judge's failure to do so. He
said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... because the key element for Crooks'
          defence is: 1. He is not the shooter but; 2.
          He is not a party ... but you made no
          reference to any of the evidence that Crooks
          relies on to demonstrate he is not a party
          ... [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The trial judge responded by indicating that he had set out
Crooks' position to the jury. Counsel replied:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... Yes you did. But, what you didn't do is
          refer to any evidence of any witness that,
          any piece of evidence that Crooks relied upon
          in support of that ...</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Counsel also argued that the trial judge had reviewed the
evidence relevant to the positions of the Crown and MacKinnon and
that in failing to accord equal treatment to Crooks, he had
diminished the defence of Crooks.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] The trial judge refused to recharge the jury, saying:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I'm not with you on this one at all Mr.
          Miller [counsel for Crooks]. I can recall
          your very able submissions to the jury and
          the items in the evidence that supported Mr.
          Crooks' position and I am satisfied beyond
          the point of absolute certainty that the jury
          is sensitive to that being your position.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] The responsibility of the trial judge to relate the evidence
to the issues raised by the defence is well established. In
Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495 at 497, it was said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The rule which has been laid down, and
          consistently followed, is that in a jury
          trial the presiding judge must, except in
          rare cases where it would be needless to do
          so, review the substantial parts of the
          evidence and give the jury the theory of the
          defence, so that they may appreciate the
          value and effect of that evidence, and how
          the law is to be applied to the facts as they
          find them. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] In R. v. Jacquard (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), the
court reiterated the obligation set out in Azoulay. Lamer C.J.C.
cautioned against a standard of perfection when reviewing trial
judges' instructions and said, at p. 11:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... As long as an appellate court, when
          looking at the trial judge's charge to the
          jury as a whole, concludes that the jury was
          left with a sufficient understanding of the
          facts as they relate to the relevant issues,
          the charge is proper.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Cory J., in R. v. Cooper (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301
(S.C.C.), made the same point when he observed:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... At the end of the day, the question must
          be whether an appellate court is satisfied
          that the jurors would adequately understand
          the issues involved, the law relating to the
          charge the accused is facing, and the
          evidence they should consider in resolving
          the issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] In Jacquard, Lamer C.J.C. stressed that a functional
approach must be taken when assessing the adequacy of jury
instructions. I take this to mean that instructions must be
tested against their ability to fulfil the purposes for which
they are given and not by reference to whether any particular
approach or formula has been used. By the end of the
instructions, whatever approach is used, the jury must
understand:
‚    the factual issues which had to be resolved;
‚    the law to be applied to those issues and the evidence;
‚    the positions of the parties; and
‚    the evidence relevant to the positions taken by the parties
on the various issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] That is not to say that the approach taken to the task of
instructing a jury is unimportant. A sound approach will go a
long way to producing a satisfactory result. The current effort
to develop specimen jury instructions, headed by the Honourable
Mr. Justice D. Watt, reflects the need to develop a more
systematic approach to the formulation of jury instructions in
this province.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] In this case, the trial judge ably fulfilled the first,
second and third requirements of a proper jury instruction. The
fourth requirement, that is the relating of the evidence relevant
to the positions of the parties on the contested issues, is most
often achieved by a review of the evidence in the context of the
various issues and an indication of what parts of the evidence
may support the respective positions of the parties. By a review
of the evidence, I do not mean a lengthy regurgitation of large
parts of the trial judge's notes of the testimony of various
witnesses. I mean references to the evidence which are sufficient
in the context of the case and the entirety of the charge to
alert the jury to the particular parts of the evidence which are
significant to particular issues and to the positions taken by
the parties on those issues. A good example of an effective
review of evidence relevant to positions taken by the parties is
found in the trial judge's instructions on the issue of the
identity of the shooter. In the space of about three pages of
transcript, the trial judge effectively put the positions of the
appellants and the Crown and highlighted the evidence relied on
by each in support of their positions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] It must also be stressed that the review described need not
be exhaustive: R. v. John (1970), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 157 at 166
(S.C.C.). The trial judge is not expected to rehash each and
every argument made by counsel. The charge is proper if it leaves
the jury with a sufficient understanding of the evidence relating
to the positions taken by the parties on the various issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] The trial judge did not review any of the evidence relating
to Crooks' position that he was not a party with MacKinnon to a
plan to rob Mr. Chow. He also did not review the evidence relied
on by the Crown to demonstrate that Crooks was a party to the
robbery. The absence of that review takes on particular
significance in the light of the jury's verdict. Their
manslaughter verdict clearly indicates that they had decided that
Crooks was a party to a robbery, but they had at least a
reasonable doubt as to his participation in the murder either
under s. 21(1) or s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] The trial judge's failure to relate any of the evidence to
Crooks' position that he was not a party to any robbery was not
inadvertent. As the trial judge's response to counsel's objection
indicates, he was satisfied, based on counsel's effective closing
address, that the jury had a sufficient appreciation of the
evidence relevant to that issue. Counsel's closing cannot relieve
the trial judge of his obligation to ensure that the jury
understands the significance of the evidence to the issues in the
case. Certainly, the trial judge can consider counsel's closing
arguments in deciding how to discharge his or her obligation.
Reference to, or incorporation by reference to, counsel's
submissions are techniques which may be used by a trial judge to
assist in relating the evidence to the positions of the parties
on the contested issues.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Mr. Campbell, for the Crown, quite correctly contends that a
failure to review the evidence relevant to the positions taken by
the parties on contested issues is not necessarily fatal. He
acknowledges that the situations in which no review is necessary
will be &quot;rare&quot;, but submits that this is one of those rare
situations. He referred to several cases in which instructions
were found to be adequate despite the absence of any review of
the evidence relevant to the contentious issues, eg. see R. v.
Cipolla, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 179 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd, [1966] 1 C.C.C.
205 (S.C.C.); R. v. Dwyer (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont. C.A.);
R. v. Ambrose and Hutchison (1976), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.);
R. v. Guyatt (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 304 at 336 (B.C.C.A.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Each of these cases turns on its own facts and demonstrates
the functional approach to the adequacy of jury instructions. I
will refer only to R. v. Ambrose and Hutchison, supra. The
accused were charged with the capital murder of two police
officers. The circumstantial evidence against them was
overwhelming. Neither testified. It was their position that gaps
in the circumstantial evidence led by the Crown should leave the
jury with a reasonable doubt as to whether Ambrose and Hutchison
had committed the murders. In instructing the jury, the trial
judge outlined that theory and then said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... That, in a nutshell, is the theory of the
          defence and, Mr. Bell, [counsel for the
          accused] I don't feel it is necessary to go
          into the evidence there, the theory has been
          put forward, Mr. Bell has done that most
          adequately and has pointed out what
          undoubtedly are some discrepancies, whether
          material or not is up to you to decide, in
          the evidence of the witnesses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In rejecting the argument that the trial judge had failed to
adequately relate the evidence relied on by the defence to the
position of the defence, Spence J., for a unanimous court, said
at p. 104:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ... If counsel for the defence based the
          theory of the defence upon discrepancies in
          1,371 printed pages of evidence given by
          Crown witnesses, then it was his duty in his
          address to outline those discrepancies. The
          learned trial judge was of the opinion that
          counsel for the defence had done so most
          adequately and was, therefore, I think
          properly of the opinion that it was neither
          necessary nor desirable that he should repeat
          the outline of those discrepancies in his
          charge. ... To have burdened the jury with a
          recital of discrepancies which had already
          been outlined in the very long and most
          complete address of counsel for the accused
          would not have served any useful purpose and
          might well have so confused the jury as to
          distract from their efficient discharge of
          their sworn duty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] There are at least three important differences between
Ambrose and Hutchison and this case. Crooks did testify and
denied any involvement in a plan to rob Mr. Chow. Crooks relied
not primarily on &quot;gaps&quot; in the Crown's case, but on evidence,
including his own testimony, which could be viewed as
inconsistent with the Crown's contention that he was a party to a
robbery. Finally, this trial judge did not incorporate by
reference into his instructions counsel's submissions as to the
evidence said to support the position of the defence. Absent any
such reference to counsel's submissions, it cannot be assumed
that the jury would accept as accurate counsel's contention as to
the relevance of certain evidence to his submission that Crooks
was not a party to the robbery.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Having read and re-read the instructions, I have come to the
conclusion that the absence of any review of the evidence capable
of supporting the defence position that Crooks was not a party to
the robbery constituted non-direction amounting to an error in
law in the circumstances of this case. It cannot be said that,
without any review, the jury had a sufficient understanding of
the evidence as it related to the defence position on that issue.
I come to that conclusion reluctantly. In all other respects, the
trial judge's charge and his answers to the questions posed by
the jury were marked with a clarity and balance reflective of
extensive preparation and a determination to deliver a helpful
and fair instruction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] I have given anxious consideration to the application of s.
683(1)(b)(iii). The Crown's case was a formidable one and, in my
opinion, the weight of the evidence pointed towards Crooks'
willing participation in the robbery. It is doubtful that Crooks
could do better than a manslaughter conviction. There was,
however, evidence which could leave the jury with a reasonable
doubt as to Crooks' participation in the robbery. The jury
obviously had difficulty with this case as their deliberations
spanned some 20 hours. I cannot say that a reasonable jury,
properly instructed would necessarily have reached the conclusion
that Crooks was a party to the robbery and, therefore, on the
facts of this case, guilty of at least manslaughter.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                               V.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] I would dismiss MacKinnon's appeal. I would allow Crooks'
appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial on the charge
of manslaughter.
