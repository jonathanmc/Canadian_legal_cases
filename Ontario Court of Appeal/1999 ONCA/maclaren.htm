    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Cavarzan J. dated November
20, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following his trial by a judge and jury, the respondent was
convicted of impaired driving causing bodily harm, failing to
remain at the scene of an accident and a charge of failing the
breathalyzer test.  The trial judge imposed conditional sentences
totalling 18 months to be followed by a period of probation of
one year.  The respondent was prohibited from driving for a
period of two years.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal the
sentence.
[2]  The convictions arise out of two separate incidents, both of
which occurred in the early morning of March 26, 1996.  At
approximately 1:50 a.m., the respondent was driving his van west
on Barton Street in Hamilton when he struck a cyclist.  The
respondent did not stop and drove away from the scene leaving the
cyclist lying injured on the ground.
[3]  Approximately 15 minutes later a police officer saw the
respondent driving erratically on a street approximately 200
yards away from where the cyclist had been struck.  There is no
evidence of the respondent&#146;s whereabouts during this 15 minute
period.  On being pulled over the respondent exhibited signs of
serious impairment.  He provided samples of his breath.  His
blood alcohol readings were 204 and 191 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml.
of blood.
[4]  The victim was severely injured.  His injuries included a
head injury that by the time of the trial required seven
surgeries, damage to all of his teeth, soft tissue injuries to
his neck and shoulders, nerve damage in one arm, a broken
vertebrae, a fractured left fibula, a fractured pelvis in three
places and knee damage.  He was hospitalized for two and one-half
weeks.  The victim impact statements from the victim and his wife
disclosed that the victim continues to live with considerable
physical pain and psychological scarring. Two years after the
accident he was unable to return to work and was unsure if he
would ever be able to resume his previous job.
[5]  The pre-sentence report was favourable to the respondent.
At the time of sentencing in November 1998, he was 45 years old
with no criminal record.  He was employed in the painting
business and was reported to be conscientious and trustworthy.
He was the sole income provider for himself and his wife.  After
the date of the offences the respondent stopped drinking and
sought counselling from his minister.
[6]  The trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of 12 months
on the impaired driving charge, 6 months concurrent on the charge
of failing the breathalyzer test and a further conditional
sentence of 6 months on the charge of failing to remain.  It is a
term of the conditional sentences that the respondent perform 180
hours of community service.
[7]  Fresh evidence filed on the appeal revealed that the
respondent has continued with counselling, that he has complied
with the conditions of his sentence and has completed 68½ hours
of community service.  Further, a psychologist provided an
opinion that the respondent is not a callous person.
[8]  The Crown appeals the sentences arguing that the trial judge
erred in not imposing a custodial sentence. At trial, the Crown
sought a term of imprisonment in the range of 12 to 18 months.
[9]  This court will only interfere with a sentence where it is
satisfied that a trial judge has made an error in principle or if
the sentence is demonstrably unfit.  A number of different kinds
of errors are said to constitute errors in principle including a
failure by a trial judge to take into account or to give
sufficient weight to relevant factors.
[10] Pursuant to s. 742.1(b) the court may only impose a
conditional sentence if it is satisfied that a sentence in the
community would not endanger the safety of the community and if
the sentence would be consistent with the principles for
sentencing set out in ss. 718 and 718.2.
[11] One of the objectives of sentencing under s. 718 is to
denounce the unlawful conduct of the offender.  The circumstances
of this case required a clear and strong statement denouncing the
conduct of the respondent.  In determining the appropriate
sentence it was incumbent on the trial judge to focus on the very
serious aggravating circumstances involved in the commission of
these offences and to reflect the seriousness of those
circumstances in the sentence he imposed.
[12] The respondent was extremely impaired.  His blood alcohol
was in excess of twice the permitted level.  He caused grave and
possibly permanent injuries to the victim.  The serious nature of
this conduct was aggravated by his flight from the scene leaving
the victim lying injured, for all the respondent knew dying,
without rendering assistance.  This behaviour was callous,
irresponsible and cowardly.  It was essential that the sentence
adequately denounce the gravity of this behaviour.
[13] In setting out what he considered to be the aggravating
factors the trial judge only once referred to the respondent&#146;s
flight from the scene of the accident.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               His criminal behaviour in failing to stop and render
          assistance is the subject of count 3 of the indictment.  I have
          difficulty, therefore, characterizing it as a mere aggravating
          factor.</pre>
    <pre>In the result he imposed a sentence of 6 months consecutive to be
served in the community for that offence.</pre>
    <pre>[14] We are not certain what the trial judge meant in the above
passage.  However, we are satisfied that in imposing conditional
rather than a custodial sentences the trial judge gave no weight
to the respondent&#146;s flight from the scene of the accident.  It
was essential that the trial judge attach significant weight to
this circumstance in the context of his determination of whether
to impose conditional or custodial sentences and in particular in
his consideration of whether conditional sentences would be
sufficient to adequately denounce these offences.  His failure to
do so constituted an error in principle.
[15] That being the case it falls to this court to determine what
it is an appropriate sentence free from the deferential
presumption that would otherwise apply.  As the trial judge
pointed out, the respondent&#146;s acceptance of responsibility for
driving while impaired, his favourable pre-sentence report and
his role as sole provider for his family are mitigating factors.
There does not appear to be a need for specific deterrence or
rehabilitation.  It is not necessary to incarcerate the
respondent for the protection of the community.
[16] We have kept in mind the admonition in s. 718.2(e) that all
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable
in the circumstances should be considered.  We are, however, of
the view that the requirements of general deterrence and
denunciation far outweigh the mitigating circumstances and call
for the imposition of a substantial custodial sentence.  This
court has held on a number of occasions that &#147;ordinarily&#148; the
objective of general deterrence requires a custodial sentence for
the offence of impaired driving causing bodily harm.  See for
example, R. v. McPhee (1990), 21 M.V.R. (2d) 318 (Ont. C.A.).
The need for a custodial sentence for general deterrence is even
greater where as here, the impaired offender leaves the scene and
the injured victim without rendering assistance:  R. v. Ramdass
(1982), 1 M.V.R. 265 (Ont. C.A.).  In addition to the need for
general deterrence, the gravity of the respondent&#146;s conduct in
this case is such that, in our view, adequate denunciation can
only be met by a custodial sentence.
[17] In R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344, this court
considered the appropriate sentence in a case involving drinking
and driving resulting in serious injury.  The court allowed an
appeal by the Crown against a conditional sentence and imposed a
custodial sentence of 15 months in order &#147;to adequately reflect
the objective of general deterrence combined with the need for
denunciation of this particular conduct.&#148;  Although the
circumstances in Biancofiore were somewhat different than those
in this case, they could not be said to be more serious.  The
respondent in this case was much more seriously impaired than the
accused in Biancofiore and significantly, as we have said, left
the scene of the accident.  Like Biancofiore, this was a
particularly serious case of drinking and driving both because of
the conduct of the offender and the devastating consequences to
the victim.
[18] In our view, the length of the total sentence, 18 months,
imposed by the trial judge was appropriate.  In cases where this
court is substituting a custodial sentence for a conditional
sentence, the amount of credit to be given for that part of the
conditional sentence that has been served will vary depending on
the particular circumstances of each case. The respondent in this
case has served over 7 months of a conditional sentence that has
few restrictions on his freedom and has performed 68½ hours of
community service.  There is no doubt that incarceration at this
point in time brings an additional hardship and, in addition, we
recognize that the respondent will not receive credit for
statutory remission or parole eligibility for the time that has
been served on the conditional sentence.  Having regard to these
factors, we consider that a custodial term of imprisonment of 12
months from the present to be the appropriate sentence at this
time.
[19] The question then arises whether we should impose this
sentence by crafting a sentence that commences on the date that
the original sentence was imposed or whether we can simply impose
the custodial sentence to commence from the date on which the
respondent is taken into custody.  The answer is not readily
apparent from the wording of the relevant sections in the
Criminal Code &#150; ss. 687(2), 719(4) and 742.1.  Simplicity and
clarity argue in favour of the latter approach and that is what
we propose to do.  If there is any difficulty in implementing our
decision we may be spoken to.
[20] Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.
We vary the sentence to a total of 12 months in custody, 8 months
on the impaired driving charge, 4 months concurrent on the charge
of failing the breathalyzer test and 4 months consecutive for the
failing to remain charge.  The sentence will commence when the
respondent is taken into custody.  We do not interfere with the
order for probation or with the driving prohibition.  We ask the
parties to arrange for a time for the respondent to surrender
into custody, failing which a warrant may issue for his arrest.
