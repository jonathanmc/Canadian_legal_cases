    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Cavarzan J. dated November
20, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Counsel have brought to our attention an ambiguity in our
reasons released June 30, 1999.  That ambiguity concerns the
length of the driving prohibition imposed on the respondent.
This addendum is intended to clarify that ambiguity.
[2]  The trial judge intended that the respondent should be
prohibited from driving for 2 years effective from the date of
sentencing (November 20, 1998).  Neither party took issue with
the length of the prohibition on the appeal.  In our reasons, we
indicated that we did not propose to interfere with the 2-year
prohibition.
[3]  In written submissions provided after the release of our
reasons, counsel have pointed out that our reasons, read in
combination with the actual order made by the trial judge, are
ambiguous and could be read as extending or shortening the
prohibition period which the trial judge intended to impose.
[4]  To clarify any potential ambiguity and to accord with the
language of s. 259 of the Criminal Code, our order will be varied
to provide that the appellant will be prohibited from driving for
a period of 4 months and fifteen days, plus the 12-month term of
imprisonment imposed by this court.  The term of imprisonment
commenced on July 5, 1999 and, for the purpose of calculating the
prohibition period, ends 12 months later on July 5, 2000.  The
prohibition period will run for four months and fifteen days from
July 5, 2000 and terminate on November 20, 2000.  Consequently,
our order will prohibit the appellant from driving until November
20, 2000, as intended by the trial judge.
