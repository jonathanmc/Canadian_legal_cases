    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

               ALEXANDER MacPHERSON (Appellant)</pre>

               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 10, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of the Honourable Mr. Justice Quinn
dated November 19, 1996 and the sentence imposed on December 16,
1996.</pre>
    <pre>                                
                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of arson and sentenced to two
years less a day.  The appellant appealed conviction and sentence
but has abandoned his appeal from sentence.
[2]  The fire occurred in the appellant&#146;s place of business.  On
the evidence, the appellant had virtually the exclusive
opportunity of setting this fire.  The appellant did not testify.
We propose to deal with only the grounds of appeal on which we
required submissions from the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>Did the trial judge misdirect the jury on the reasonable doubt standard?</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We have considered the initial charge to the jury on
reasonable doubt, the instruction on circumstantial evidence and
the recharge in answer to the jury&#146;s question.  We are satisfied
that when the instructions are considered in their totality, the
jury would have understood that they could convict the appellant
only if they were satisfied that his guilt was the only
reasonable inference on the evidence.  In the course of
instructions to the jury, the trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Before basing a verdict of guilty on circumstantial evidence
    you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of
    the accused is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the
    proven facts.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In our view, this instruction brought home the degree of
certainty needed to justify a conviction in this case.</pre>
    <pre>Was there sufficient evidence to instruct the jury on motive?</pre>
    <pre>[5]  While the evidence of motive was not strong, we are
satisfied that there was some evidence that the appellant was
having financial problems with his business.  This evidence was
sufficient to justify an instruction on motive.  The trial
judge&#146;s instructions on motive were accurate in law.
[6]  The appeal must be dismissed.</pre></td>
