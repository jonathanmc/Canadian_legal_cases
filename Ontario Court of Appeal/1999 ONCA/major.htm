               For the respondent, the Liquor Licence Board of

    <pre>HEARD:         April 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (O&#146;Driscoll,
Steele and White JJ.), dated December 19, 1994
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Major Mack Hotel appeals from the decision of the Divisional
Court on December 19, 1994, dismissing the appeal of the hotel
from the decision of June 16, 1994 by the Liquor Licence Board of
Ontario revoking the Hotel&#146;s liquor licence.
[2]  The factual bases of the Hotel&#146;s complaints are errors
alleged to have been made by the Board in the procedure it
followed and in the conclusions it reached, which conclusions,
with one exception were accepted by the Divisional Court.
[3]  It is argued that although particulars were given to the
Hotel of the disciplinary offences with which it was charged,
such as serving under-age persons, inadequate disclosure was made
with respect to the matters which led to the revocation of its
licence.
[4]  A review of the uncontradicted facts persuades us that
adequate disclosure was provided.  This disclosure came through a
letter from a municipal councillor which was forwarded by the
Board, from discussions with the councillor and from the
representations made by local residents at the hearing held by
the Board.  Those residents were available for cross-examination
at the outset of that hearing.  They were also available for
cross-examination for many months thereafter had counsel for the
Hotel so wished, the hearing having spanned over one year.
[5]  It was also argued that the Board erred in reversing the
onus.  This complaint is made in the context of the Board having
said in its reasons that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Residents called on behalf of the licence holder indicated
          that the operation was acceptable or of no concern.  There was no
          evidence called to indicate any support for the establishment.
          The Board does not find any real attempt to respond to the
          residents&#146; concerns.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The Hotel&#146;s argument ignores the history of criminal
prosecutions against hotel personnel and the plethora of
complaints respecting grossly anti-social behaviour on the part
of the hotel&#146;s customers.  The Board&#146;s comments did not place any
onus upon the hotel; those comments simply noted that there was
no evidence that the hotel had taken any steps to avoid the
repetition of such behaviour in the future.
[7]  It was also argued that while the Liquor Licence Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.L-19 ss. 8(4)(a)  and 9, provide for a &#147;public meeting&#148;
to receive the representations of residents when the issuance of
a licence is applied for, there is no provision in the Act for
the holding of a public meeting to consider a proposal to revoke
a licence.  Accordingly, it is argued that the Board&#146;s holding of
a meeting was ultra vires.
[8]  We agree with the Board and the Divisional Court that what
was held was not a meeting under s.8 or s.9, but a hearing, as
authorized by s.23 of the Act.  Accordingly, there is no merit in
this complaint.
[9]  The Hotel argues, in the alternative, that assuming arguendo
that what occurred was a hearing rather than a meeting, the
residents had no standing at that hearing and the Board had no
power to hear their objections.  As support for this argument, it
is pointed out that the Act sets out a procedure for the hearing
of representations of residents on an application for a licence
but no procedure is prescribed for the involvement of residents
in the event of a proposal by the Board to revoke a licence.
[10] Section 23(7) of the Act provides that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Board may, in such manner as it considers advisable,
          give notice of a hearing to such other persons as it considers
          appropriate.</pre>
    <pre>Here notice of a proposal by the Board to revoke the hotel&#146;s
licence was given to the local councillor and to the community at
large.  Amongst the grounds which may be considered on such an
occasion are the past conduct of the persons having
responsibility for the management or operation of the business
and &#147;the public interest having regard to the needs and wishes of
the residents of the municipality in which the premises are
located&#148;.  (Section 6(2)(h)).  The representations of the
residents who attended the meeting were received in order to
determine their needs and wishes and their expression of the
public interest.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Having regard to the purpose of the hearing and the
circumstances which gave rise to it, the course of action taken
by the Board is unobjectionable.  It appears to us to be at least
implicit, if not express, in the Act.  In any event, it was a
fair and effective means of carrying out to the provisions of the
Act.  To accept the Hotel&#146;s submission, that at a hearing to
consider a proposal to revoke a licence, the residents of the
area have neither rights nor voice, would be to emasculate  the
Act.
[12] It is argued that the Board erred in assuming that all of
the 70 residents at the hearing were opposed to the hotel when
only 11 of them made representations.  That assessment is surely
a matter properly made by those in attendance at the meeting, in
this case, the two members of the Board who conducted the
hearing.
[13] A further ground of appeal was based on s.46 of O. Reg.
546/90.  It reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The holder of a licence that applies to outdoor premises
          shall not permit noise that arises directly or indirectly from
          entertainment on the premises or from the sale and service of
          liquor to disturb persons who reside near the premises.</pre>
    <pre>[14] It was argued that because there is no parallel prohibition
with respect to licenced indoor premises such as those of the
appellant, the Board erred in considering the noise made by its
exiting customers.  On questioning, counsel extended this
argument to everything that occurred outside of the walls of the
licenced premises including noise, disturbance, profanity,
parking infractions, driving infractions, fighting, violent
behaviour, urinating, defecating, vomiting and passing out on
public streets and on private property and littering same, such
litter including needles and condoms.  Insofar as these matters
had occurred and were occurring beyond the walls of the licenced
premises, it was argued that they were beyond the consideration
of the Board on this hearing and the Board had exceeded its
jurisdiction in hearing evidence on them and in considering them.
[15] We do not accept this proposition.  Section 6 of the Act
deals with applications to the Board for licences to sell liquor.
Section 6(2)(h) is one of the matters the Board is required to
consider.
[16] In our view, all of the matters set out in the preceding
paragraph could be relevant to consideration under s.6(2)(h) on
an application for a licence as well as on a proposal to revoke a
licence.  The weight to be attached to each item would, of
course, vary according to the circumstances.
[17] The main argument advanced on behalf of the hotel is that
the expressions &#147;in the public interest&#148; and &#147;needs and wishes&#148;
are so vague and imprecise as to be meaningless and that
accordingly s.6(2)(h), the foundation  of the revocation order,
is void for vagueness.
[18] This argument was made before the Divisional Court.  After
referring to Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society v. The Queen
(1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), and R. v. Morales (1992), 77
C.C.C. (3d) 91 (S.C.C.), the Divisional Court said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In this case, no substantive Charter issue has been raised.
          Since no right or freedom has been infringed, s.1 of the Charter
          does not come into play.  Therefore, there is no constitutional
          ground to consider the possible invalidity of the law on the
          basis of its vagueness.</pre>
    <pre>We agree.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Even if void for vagueness were a free-standing principle,
we are of the view that it has no application in the present
circumstances.  &#147;The public interest having regard to the needs
and wishes of the residents of the municipality in which the
premises are located&#148; is not so uncertain or imprecise a concept
as to be beyond legal debate.  This ground of appeal must
therefore fail.
[20] The Divisional Court set aside one finding of the Board
having to do with two incidents of drunkenness, violent or
disorderly conduct on January 31, 1992.  No argument was
delivered in this court with respect to that matter.
[21] The appeal from the Divisional Court is therefore dismissed
with costs.
