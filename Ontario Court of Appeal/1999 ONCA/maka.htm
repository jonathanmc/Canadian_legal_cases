    <pre>On appeal from the order of Paisley J. dated March 13, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the Crown from the order of Paisley J.
dismissing the charges against the respondents Maka and Wilson
for want of prosecution.
[2]  The facts giving rise to the impugned order are
straightforward.  On February 7, 1997, the respondents were
charged with trafficking in cocaine, possession of proceeds of
crime, two counts of possessing a prohibited weapon, careless
storage of a firearm and possession of a firearm with the serial
number defaced.  Maka was also charged with breach of
recognizance.  Show cause hearings were conducted and Wilson was
detained in custody on February 7, 1997.  Maka, on the other
hand, received bail on February 24, 1997.
[3]  At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry on October 28,
1997, the respondents were committed for trial on all charges and
ordered to attend at the Ontario Court (General Division) on
November 28, 1997.  On December 17, 1997, a trial date of January
26, 1998 was fixed.
[4]  On January 7, 1998, Crown counsel learned from the officer
in charge that one of the police witnesses would be away on
annual leave during the week of January 26th.  Crown counsel
immediately notified defence counsel of the problem and sought
their position on an adjournment.  Over the next several weeks,
plea negotiations were conducted but these proved unsuccessful.
To this point, defence counsel had not advised the Crown about
their position on an adjournment.  Accordingly, Crown counsel
instructed the investigating officer to have the witnesses who
were available attend in court on the morning of January 26 in
the event the trial was ordered to proceed.  It was not until
January 25, 1998 that the Crown finally received word from
defence counsel that they were prepared to consent to an
adjournment.
[5]  On the morning of January 26th, counsel appeared before the
trial judge, Whealy J.  Crown counsel advised His Honour that one
of her witnesses was absent and that defence counsel were not
opposing an adjournment.  After observing that the request for an
adjournment seemed &#147;like an appropriate remedy,&#148; Whealy J.
traversed the case to the practice court to fix a new trial date.
[6]  The parties then appeared before Paisley J. and after
explaining what had occurred before Whealy J., they jointly
requested that April 6, 1998 be fixed as the new trial date.
Paisley J. inquired into the reason for the adjournment and was
told by Crown counsel that one of the police officers was on
leave participating in a sailing competition.  Paisley J. was
uniquely unimpressed with this excuse.  He was also troubled by
the fact that Crown counsel had failed to comply with Rule 26 of
the Criminal Proceedings Rules governing adjournment
applications.  Nonetheless, after much discussion, he acceded to
the request and fixed April 6, 1998 as the new trial date.
[7]  The next day, on his own motion, Paisley J. ordered the
Crown to show cause why the charges against the respondents
should not be dismissed for want of prosecution by reason of the
Crown&#146;s failure to comply with Rule 26.  On March 13, 1998, Crown
and defence counsel appeared before Paisley J. and after a full
hearing, he dismissed the charges for want of prosecution.
[8]  In concluding that he had jurisdiction to make the impugned
order, Paisley J. stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Nothing in these reasons should be considered as in any way
          a review of the decision of Justice Whealy.  That is not the
          focus of this proceeding.  This court expressed its reasons for
          feeling dismay when it adjourned the trial to a new date, and
          this court, in exercising its inherent jurisdiction to review
          whether this case has been prosecuted as required, also exercises
          its jurisdiction under s. 485.(1) of the Criminal Code.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  As for the merits, Paisley J. based his decision on the fact
that the Crown had not complied with Rule 26 and further, that
the adjournment placed the trial date outside the 60-day period
recommended for accused in custody by the Canadian Judicial
Council in its annual 1994-95 report.
[10] On appeal, the respondents concede, correctly in our view,
that Paisley J. erred in dismissing the charges against them for
want of prosecution.  In view of this concession, we need not
detail the many reasons why the impugned order cannot stand.
Suffice it to say that there was no basis in fact or law for
making the order and it is most unfortunate that Paisley J. took
it upon himself to raise the issue of want of prosecution on his
own motion.  Conduct of this sort should be avoided.  In the end,
as this case illustrates, it results in a disservice to the
parties and the administration of justice.  Accordingly, the
appeal is allowed and the order of  Paisley J. dismissing the
charges for want of prosecution is set aside.
[11] That, however, does not end the matter.  The respondents
submit that they have been prejudiced as a result of the 10-month
delay from the time the notice of apeal was filed by the Crown to
the date of perfection.  We see no merit in this submission.
[12] In the course of oral argument, it was brought to our
attention that the bulk of the delay in this matter is
attributable to the respondents, both of whom requested that the
Crown refrain from pursuing the appeal with diligence to enable
them to retain counsel.  Having taken that position, the
respondents are now estopped from arguing the issue of delay.
[13] Apart from estoppel, in our view, the delay in question is
by no means inordinate.  Moreover, the respondents have been at
liberty throughout the appeal period and they have filed no
material to substantiate their bald allegations of prejudice.  In
the final analysis, the evidence falls short of establishing that
this is one of those rare and exceptional cases justifying the
drastic remedy of a stay of proceedings.
[14] Accordingly, an order will go remitting the matter to the
trial court to fix a new trial date and to proceed to trial on
all charges.
