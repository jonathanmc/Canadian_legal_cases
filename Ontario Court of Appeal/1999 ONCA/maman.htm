               MAMAN (Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>COUNSEL:       Howard Borenstern, for the appellant
               Scott C. Hutchison, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Marin J., dated July 22, 1998,
and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Marin J., dated August
13, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant submits that the evidence of the complainant
is so riddled with perjury that a conviction based on her
testimony must be quashed as unreasonable.  However, the trial
judge was clearly alive to the frailties of the complainant&#146;s
testimony.  She isolated and listed some seven events testified
to by the complainant in the course of her narrative of what took
place for the two days leading up to the assault.  The trial
judge described her account with respect to these incidents as
&#147;&#133;simply incredulous when considered collectively against any
standard of explicable behaviour&#148;.
[2]  However, as to the assault itself, which was the only
contentious issue upon which she found against the appellant, the
trial judge expressly believed the complainant and disbelieved
the appellant.  She found supporting evidence to the
complainant&#146;s testimony by finding that the nature of the
injuries that the complainant received was consistent with her
testimony and totally at odds with the version of events as
recounted by the appellant.
[3]  This is not an unreasonable verdict.  A conviction was
supportable on the evidence available to the trial judge.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
