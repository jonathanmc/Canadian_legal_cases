      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Wallace J. dated October 27, 1998
in Kitchener.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

      <pre>[1]   The  central issue in this case is whether for the purposes
of  s. 73 of the Registry Act the appellant received monies worth
when she gave the mortgage.
[2]  In our view the trial judge was correct in answering this
question affirmatively.
[3]  In return for receiving the mortgage from the appellant, the
mortgagee promised to hold $100,000 for the appellant, to invest
it for her, and to pay her the spread between the interest earned
on the investment and the interest she owed on the mortgage. In
effect, the mortgagee agreed to put the appellant’s $100,000 to
work for her.
[4]  Following the giving of the mortgage and its assignment, for
a number of months the investment scheme yielded the appellant a
monthly payment as promised. During that period of time her
$100,000 was  indeed working for her.
[5]  Under s. 73 of the Registry Act the mortgage therefore was
security to the extent of the monies worth advanced by the
mortgagee. The respondent was assigned the mortgage and is
entitled to recover on it. The wrong done to the appellant by the
original mortgagee in connection with her investment scheme took
place after the assignment of the mortgage and does not serve as
a defence to the respondent’s claim.
[6]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs. The
appellant concedes that given the terms of the mortgage those
costs must be on a solicitor-and-client scale.</pre>
