                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants moved under Rule 21.01(3)(a) to stay or
dismiss paragraph 1(b) of the respondent&#146;s Amended Statement of
Claim on the ground that the Ontario Court (General Division),
now the Superior Court of Justice, has no jurisdiction to grant
the relief claimed in that paragraph.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Paragraph 1(b) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The Plaintiff claims:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  an interim, interlocutory and
          permanent Order compelling the Defendants
          Costco Wholesale Corporation, Price Costco
          Canada Inc., Price Club St. Foy Inc. and
          Costco Wholesale Canada Ltd. (collectively,
          &#147;Costco&#148;) to sell Coca-Cola products to the
          Plaintiff on a retail basis and prohibiting
          the Defendants Coca-Cola Ltd. and Coca-Cola
          Bottling Ltd. (collectively &#147;Coca-Cola&#148;) from
          engaging in a boycott of the Plaintiff with
          respect of the sale to the Plaintiff of Coca-
          Cola products;</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This appeal is from the order of Sanderson J. dismissing the
appellants&#146; motion.
[4]  The respondent argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal because the order of Sanderson J. was
interlocutory, not final.  We disagree.  In our view, the
decision of this court in Ball v. Donais (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322
(C.A.) is dispositive of the issue.  The effect of the order
under appeal is to preclude the appellants from raising again the
issue that the Ontario Court lacks jurisdiction to make a
mandatory order of the nature sought in paragraph 1(b).  The
order under appeal finally disposes of that jurisdictional issue
and deprives the appellants of a substantive right that could be
determinative in opposing the remedy sought in paragraph 1(b).
[5]  Indeed, counsel for the respondent took the position that if
the order of Sanderson J. stands he would be entitled to argue at
trial that the jurisdiction of the court to make the mandatory
order sought in paragraph 1(b) has been determined and is res
judicata.  We are of the view that the appeal of the order of
Sanderson J. relating to paragraph 1(b) is final and is,
therefore, properly before this court.
[6]  The respondent&#146;s action is based on three common law causes
of action:  unlawful conspiracy, wrongful interference with
contractual relations and wrongful interference with economic
relations.  These claims are based on an allegation that since
March 1996, the appellants have refused to supply the respondent
with Coca-Cola products because the respondent intended to export
those products from Canada.  By way of remedy, the respondent
seeks an award of damages and the mandatory order set out in
paragraph 1(b).
[7]  Simply put, the effect of the mandatory order sought by the
respondent would be to require the appellants to sell Coca-Cola
products to the respondent.  Other than one contract for the sale
of three shipping container loads of Coca-Cola products in March
1996, the Amended Statement of Claim does not allege that the
appellants are contractually obligated to supply products to the
respondent.  There is no allegation of an ongoing supply
contract, nor is there any allegation that the appellants have
interfered with any contract other than the March 1996 agreement.
The Amended Statement of Claim does not allege any basis upon
which the respondent would be entitled to require an ongoing or
future supply of products.
[8]  In our view, this appeal must be allowed.  On the facts as
pleaded, the respondent has no common law right to purchase
goods; nor do the appellants have any corresponding common law
obligation to sell goods to the respondent.  There is no common
law obligation to contract with another party.  Parties are free
to contract as they see fit.  The freedom to contract includes
both the ability to enter into contracts and to refrain from
entering into contracts.  The effect of the remedy sought in
paragraph 1(b) would be to compel the appellants to enter into
contracts for the sale of Coca-Cola products to the respondent on
an ongoing basis.  There is no jurisdiction in common law to make
this order.
[9]  Even counsel for the respondent does not suggest such a
remedy exists in common law.  His argument seems to be that the
wording of the relief sought in paragraph 1(b) does not seek an
order compelling supply of product in the future.  However, in
our view, the plain meaning of the language used in paragraph
1(b) does not lend itself to that interpretation.  If an order is
made in the form requested, it would clearly compel the future
supply of Coca-Cola products to the respondent.
[10] Although the remedy sought in paragraph 1(b) does not exist
in common law, there are statutory remedies in the Competition
Act available in certain circumstances which may require a
supplier of product to sell that product to persons whose
businesses would be substantially affected if the supplier did
not do so and also which may prevent a supplier of product from
limiting the sale of product by its customer (See s. 75 and s. 77
of the Competition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-34 as amended).  These
remedies are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Competition
Tribunal.  The respondent has not pursued the relief available
under the Competition Act.
[11] For the reasons above, we would allow the appeal and dismiss
the respondent&#146;s claim for relief under paragraph 1(b) of the
Amended Statement of Claim.  We note that the appellants have
accepted that the court would have jurisdiction to grant an
injunction preventing the appellants from conspiring with one
another to injure the respondent.  With this in mind, we grant
leave to the respondent to amend its Amended Statement of Claim
to seek an injunctive remedy that would be consistent with this
endorsement.
[12] The appellants have also appealed the order of Sanderson J.
dismissing their motion to strike out paragraph 10A of their
Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim.  The appellants accept
that this order is interlocutory, but argue that this court has
jurisdiction under s. 6(2) of the Courts of Justice Act to hear
the appeal from this order.  Section 6(2) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine
          an appeal that lies to the Divisional Court or the Superior Court
          of Justice if an appeal in the same proceeding lies to and is
          taken to the Court of Appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellants have not obtained leave to appeal this order
to the Divisional Court.  Thus, this is not an appeal that lies
to the Divisional Court (See Albert v. Spiegel (1993), 17 C.P.C.
(3d) 90).  There is no jurisdiction in this court to hear the
appeal of this interlocutory order and it is, therefore, quashed.
[14] We direct that there be no costs of this appeal or of the
motion before Sanderson J.  We note that the appellants did not
bring the motion that gives rise to this appeal at the same time
as they brought two earlier motions.  It would have been
appropriate to do so.  For that reason, the appellants should be
denied the costs to which they would otherwise be entitled.</pre></td>
