    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of the Divisional Court (Justices Coo,
Chapnik and Wallace) dated May 13, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A. :</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On March 6, 1992 the appellant, Maple Leaf  Foods Inc.,
announced that it was closing its processing plant in Kitchener,
Ontario effective May 29, 1992.  All employees at the plant
received twelve weeks' notice of termination in accordance with
the notice requirement for mass terminations under the Employment
Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.14 (&quot;the Act&quot;).
[2]  Employees at work during the notice period received the
termination pay called for by the Act.  Four employees were
absent from work for the entire notice period due to injury.
These employees received workers' compensation payments but
nothing more for that period.
[3]  The four employees claimed that pursuant to the Act they
were also entitled to termination pay for the period of notice.
The Ministry of Labour concurred and issued an Order to Pay
against Maple Leaf.  Maple Leaf sought a review of that order
under the Act, arguing that when employees are given notice but
do not make themselves available for work the employer is not
required to pay them as if they were at work.
[4]  On October 30, 1996 the referee issued his decision
dismissing Maple Leaf's application for review.  After analysing
the Act, the regulation under it concerning termination pay, and
the two lines of referee decisions, one supporting the
appellant's position and one supporting that of the four
employees, the referee concluded that the proper statutory
interpretation required the payment of termination pay even
though these employees were off work and in receipt of workers'
compensation benefits during the notice period.
[5]  The Divisional Court dismissed the appellant's application
for judicial review in a short endorsement which concluded by
inviting the parties to seek leave to appeal in order that there
might be a review of the conflicts in decision-making about the
statutory interpretation involved.  Leave was granted by this
court on August 20, 1998.
[6]  The appeal raises two issues:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.             In the circumstances of this case, what is the
               appropriate standard of review of the referee's decision?
2.        Given that standard of review, can the decision of the
referee stand?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  For the reasons that follow I have concluded that the
appropriate standard of review is one of reasonableness and that
the decision of the referee meets that standard.</pre>
    <pre>     Standard of Review</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The statutory context for the referee's decision is of
relevance in determining the standard of review to be applied to
that decision on judicial review.  The following sections of the
Act are germane:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Definitions:  In this Act,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;termination pay&quot; means the amount of
          pay to which an employee is entitled under
          section 57; (&quot;indemnité de licenciement&quot;)
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;wages&quot; means any monetary remuneration
          payable by an employer to an employee under
          the terms of a contract of employment, oral
          or written, express or implied, any payment
          to be made by an employer to an employee
          under this Act and any allowances for room or
          board as prescribed in the regulations or
          under an agreement or arrangement therefor
          but does not include,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  tips and other gratuities,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  any sums paid as gifts or bonuses
               that are dependent on the discretion of the
               employer and are not related to hours,
               production or efficiency,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  travelling allowances or expenses,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  contributions made by an employer
               to a fund, plan or arrangement to which
               Part X of this Act applies; (&quot;salaire&quot;)
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               57. (2)  Despite subsection (1), the
          notice required by an employer to
          terminate the employment of fifty or
          more employees in any period of four
          weeks or less shall be given in the
          manner and for the period prescribed in
          the regulations, and until the expiry of
          such notice the termination shall not
          take effect.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               (13) Where the notice referred to in
          subsection (1) or (2) has been given,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  no employer shall alter the rates
               of wages or any other term or condition of
               employment of any employee to whom notice has
               been given;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  an employer shall pay during the
          period of notice,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (i)  the wages the employee is
               entitled to receive, which in no case shall
               be less than his or her regular wages for a
               regular non-overtime work week, and
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (ii) those contributions to be made
               with respect to a fund, plan or
               arrangement to which Part X applies in
               order to maintain the benefits to which
               the employee is entitled; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  upon the expiry of the notice, the
               employer shall pay to the employee any
               wages or vacation pay to which the
               employee is entitled.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               68.  (7)  A decision of the referee
          under this section is final and binding
          upon the parties thereto and such other
          parties as the referee may specify.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The companion regulation is Regulation 327 which is entitled
&quot;Termination of Employment&quot;.  Sections 11 and 13 of that
regulation read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               11.  (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the employer shall pay
          to the person given notice of termination of employment the wages
          to which the person is entitled for work performed during the
          period of notice, but in no case shall the employer pay to the
          person for each week during the period of notice an amount less
          than the amount the person would have received for a normal non-
          overtime work week at his or her regular rate, whether the person
          performed work or not.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Where, during the period of notice
          of termination, the person who has been given
          that notice is guilty of wilful misconduct or
          disobedience or wilful neglect of duty that
          has not been condoned by the employer,
          section 57 of the Act and this Regulation
          does not apply.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               13.  Where the employment of a person is
          terminated by notice of termination or
          otherwise under the provisions of this
          Regulation, any payments to which the person
          is entitled under,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  retirement pension;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  sickness or disability insurance;
          or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  workers' compensation,
          </pre>
    <pre>               shall not be payments for the purposes
          of subsections 57 (13) and (14) of the Act
          and section 11 of this Regulation.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant argues that the existence of two lines of
referee decisions yielding different results from this statutory
context requires this court to apply a standard of correctness,
the more so because each has successfully withstood an attack by
way of judicial review.  In the alternative, it contends for the
standard of reasonableness as does the respondent Ministry of
Labour.
[11] In Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 Bastarache J. provides a useful
elucidation of the approach courts should take in determining the
appropriate standard of review of a decision of an administrative
tribunal.  As he indicates, the central inquiry in each case is
whether the question addressed in the decision under review was
intended by the legislators to be left exclusively to the
tribunal.  This is answered by using a pragmatic and functional
analysis to determine the proper level of curial deference.
[12] While Bastarache J. speaks of the proper level of deference
being located on a spectrum ranging from the more exacting to the
more deferential, he describes only three points on that
spectrum: the traditional standards of correctness and patent
unreasonableness and between them, the standard of reasonableness
first elaborated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada
(Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997]
1 S.C.R. 748.
[13] Without foreclosing the possibility of further levels of
deference to meet particular novel circumstances, this approach
properly recognizes the importance of individual standards of
review being separated by enough conceptual space that each is
capable of clear articulation and is distinguishable from the
others.  A proliferation in the levels of curial deference would
make this more difficult.
[14] In Pushpanathan, Bastarache J. divided the factors relevant
to determining the appropriate standard of review into four
categories, all of which must be considered together in this
task:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)            first, whether the legislation provides a full
               privative clause, a full right of appeal, or something in
               between;
(b)       second, whether the decision under review involves in
some degree the application of a highly specialized expertise;
(c)       third, whether the purposes of the relevant statute and
of the decision maker are primarily conceived in terms of
establishing rights as between parties or in terms of balancing
interests amongst various different constituencies; and
(d)       fourth, whether the issue presented to the tribunal
approaches a question of law which is of general application or
is a rather more particular one which may engage the tribunal's
specialized expertise.</pre>
    <pre>[15] In this case, factors from all four categories are relevant
to the determination of the appropriate standard of review.
[16] First, while s. 68(7) of the Act is not a full privative
clause in that it does not exclude all forms of judicial review,
it does represent a clear legislative intention that referee
decisions are to be final and binding on the parties.  This
clearly suggests significant curial deference.
[17] Second, the decision under review arose because the Act sets
up the referee to render interpretations of statutory concepts
specific to this, his home, or constituent legislation.  While
referees appointed under the Act were not, at this point, members
of a permanent tribunal, as this court said in U.S.W.A. Local
14097 v. Franks (1994), 16 O.R. (3d) 620 at 624:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A referee, through experience with the Act, may reasonably
          be expected to acquire that familiarity with its underlying
          policies and detailed provisions that is so important to the
          process of sound statutory interpretation.</pre>
    <pre>     This scheme suggests a legislative
intent to achieve specialized and expert
decision-making and hence points towards
significant curial deference.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Third, while legal concepts such as &quot;termination pay&quot; are
specifically drawn for this Act, the specialized nature of this
legislation primarily regulates the rights and obligations of
employers and employees.  It is not centered on balancing the
various interests of a number of different constituencies as is
some regulatory legislation.  This points towards rather less
curial deference.
[19] Fourth, while the nature of the problem in this case is one
of statutory interpretation and to that extent a question of law,
it arises in the context of a specialized Act where the expertise
of the referee is engaged.  It is not a question of law of such
general application beyond the world of the Act as to suggest the
need for enhanced curial scrutiny.
[20] While all of these factors must be considered, it seems to
me that amongst them two are of particular moment.  While not
complete, the privative clause is substantial.  In addition, the
decision requires the specialized expertise of a referee
interpreting his constituent legislation.  I would thus conclude
that the appropriate standard of review is that of
reasonableness. While less than the full curial deference that
comes with the standard of patent unreasonableness, the standard
of reasonableness does accord a significant degree of finality to
the referee's decision and does not expose it to the
&quot;right/wrong&quot; analysis that comes with the strict scrutiny of
correctness.
[21] In Franks, supra this court determined that the standard of
review of a referee's decision was that of reasonableness.  That
decision preceded the elaboration of the separate standard of
reasonableness in Southam, supra and was made in the context of
the traditional standards of reasonableness (which was
essentially undistinguished from patent unreasonableness) and
correctness. Nonetheless, the analysis is very similar to that in
which I have engaged and the conclusion of reasonableness is one
which I endorse.
[22] The appellant argues, however, that the existence of two
conflicting lines of authority on a question of statutory
interpretation changes the situation.  It argues that the court's
task is to set aside any curial deference and to determine which
decision represents the correct interpretation of the Act.
[23] In my opinion, Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission d'appel en
matière de lésions professionnelles), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756 is a
complete answer to this argument.  There, the Supreme Court of
Canada made clear that where our administrative law requires
courts to respect the decision (whether right or wrong) of
administrative tribunals within their areas of expertise, then a
lack of unanimity in those decisions must be accepted as the
price of having independent and specialized decision-makers.  It
seems to me that this is just as true where the appropriate
standard of review is reasonableness as it is for patent
unreasonableness.  In both cases, the court accords some measure
of deference to administrative decision-making and hence must
accommodate the possibility of some inconsistency in results.  In
neither circumstance can the court impose a standard of
correctness without compromising the objective of independent
administrative decision-making that is the basis for curial
deference in the first place.</pre>
    <pre>     Reasonableness of the Referee's Decision</pre>
    <pre>[24] If the applicable standard of review is that of
reasonableness, how does one give some delineation to that
concept?  In Southam, supra Iacobucci J. defined it this way at
pp. 776-77:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not
          supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing
          examination.  Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the
          reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons
          support it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The difference between
          &quot;unreasonable&quot; and &quot;patently unreasonable&quot;
          lies in the immediacy or obviousness of the
          defect.  If the defect is apparent on the
          face of the tribunal's reasons, then the
          tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable.
          But if it takes some significant searching or
          testing to find the defect, then the decision
          is unreasonable but not patently
          unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Hence, the task here is to determine whether, in the sense
outlined by Iacobucci J., the decision of the referee in this
case can be said to be reasonable.  To reiterate, the essence of
that decision was that s. 57(13) of the Act entitles the four
complainants to receive termination pay for the period of notice
even though they were unable to attend at work and received
workers' compensation payments throughout that period.
[26] The backdrop for the statutory interpretation required of
the referee was described in Re Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd.,
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at 47:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Finally, with regard to the scheme of the legislation,
          since the ESA is a mechanism for providing minimum benefits and
          standards to protect the interests of employees, it can be
          characterized as benefits-conferring legislation.  As such,
          according to several decisions of this Court, it ought to be
          interpreted in a broad and generous manner.  Any doubt arising
          from difficulties of language should be resolved in favour of the
          claimant.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Consistent with this approach the referee in this case first
determined that the concept of &quot;wages&quot; under the Act extends
beyond remuneration required by the contract of employment to any
payment required by the Act.  This simply reflects the definition
set out in the legislation.
[28] The referee then found that these claimants could not be
excluded from the entitlement because they could not attend at
work and were in receipt of workers' compensation benefits.
[29] In reaching his decision the referee had regard to both
s. 57(13) of the Act and Regulation 327 which together form an
integrated scheme for the provision of termination pay.  Given
that circumstance, this was an appropriate interpretive approach.
See R. Sullivan, ed., Driedger on the Construction of Statutes,
3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994), p. 246.
[30] Section 57(13) of the Act clearly does not ground
entitlement to termination pay in attendance at work since it
fixes a minimum amount payable that is independent of the actual
hours worked.  Section 11 of the Regulation makes explicit that
this entitlement exists whether the person performed work or not.
Section 13 of the Regulation provides that workers' compensation
payments are not to be considered payments for the purposes of
s. 57(13) of the Act.
[31] The referee determined that these considerations yielded the
conclusion that the statutory scheme entitles the complainants to
termination pay for the period of notice even though they were
not available for work and were receiving workers' compensation
payments throughout.  In my view, this conclusion meets the
standard of reasonableness.  Indeed, I think it is the correct
interpretation.
[32] Before us, the appellant argued that the referee's decision
fails any standard of review because it allows the complainants
to recover both termination pay and workers' compensation
payments for the period of notice, thereby putting them in a
better position than those employees who remained at work.  This
double recovery is said by the appellant to be both contrary to
cases such as Sylvester v. British Columbia, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 315
and wrong as a matter of policy.
[33] I do not agree.  The Sylvester line of cases concerns the
calculation of damages arising from a common-law cause of action,
not an entitlement arising from legislation.  Moreover, the
policy justification for the receipt of both payments is that
there is a separate rationale for each.  The termination pay
entitlement can be said to address the objective of compensating
for the loss of the job.  The workers' compensation entitlement
addresses the objective of compensating for the workplace injury.
Hence, in my opinion the appellant's argument must fail.
[34] I would therefore conclude that the decision of the referee
meets the applicable standard of review and that, as a
consequence, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
