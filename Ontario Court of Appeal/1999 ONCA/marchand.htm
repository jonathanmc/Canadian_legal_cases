    <pre>[1]  The first issue is whether condition 2 of the Dominion of
Canada policy provides insurance coverage to Maryanne Marchand.
She is not the owner of the boat, but her husband is, and the
definition of insured includes all members of the family. Does
the coverage provision referring to “watercraft you do not own”
refer only to Maryanne or does it refer collectively to her and
her husband?  The respondent refers us to the provision under the
head of “Amount of Insurance” reading:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Coverage  applies separately to  each  person
          who  is  insured, but this does not  increase
          the  amount  of  insurance provided  by  this
          policy.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  While this reference is generally to the amount of insurance
it does stipulate that the coverage applies separately to each
insured. Maryanne is the applicant for coverage and, treating her
separately, she does not own the boat. The contra proferentum
rule must resolve the ambiguity in favour of the policyholder and
we therefore agree with the motions judge that the “you” in
condition 2 refers to the separate coverage of Maryanne in
respect of a boat she does not own.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  On the issue of whether the “other insurance” issues are
offsetting, we agree with the trial judge that both policies were
intended to the same purpose of creating an excess policy to
other insurance, and, such being the case, they cancel one
another out. There is no real suggestion in Canadian
jurisprudence that a “closest to the risk” policy should be
embraced, and no consensus in the American authorities.
Commercial efficacy and the avoidance of litigation between
insurance companies supports a split responsibility and the
avoidance of litigation as to which policy is closer to the risk
or the coverage.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant argues that if Dominion must respond it should
only be as to one-quarter of the liability and defence costs
because Cignet must cover both husband and wife defendants and
Dominion is only called upon to answer for the wife. At the
outset of the litigation there were two defendants with one
defence and one defence representative. Dominion of Canada was
obligated to defend the husband whether or not a defence was
entered for his wife. In defending for the husband, it would have
been defending against 100% liability. The same applies to Cignet
who had to respond for both parties. And the same applies to the
settlement which involved joint liability of both parties to the
extent of 100%, the wife as the tortfeasor, and the husband as
the owner.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  On this analysis we can see no basis for dividing
responsibility for defence costs or judgment liability on any
other basis than an even split.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre></td>
