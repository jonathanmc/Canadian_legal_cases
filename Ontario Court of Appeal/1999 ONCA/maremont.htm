</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The negotiations leading to the formation of the May 30,
1995 closure agreement were carried out pursuant to the statutory
requirements then embodied in s. 41.1 of the Labour Relations
Act.  They were not conducted under article 14 of the collective
agreement, the provision which enabled the parties to amend or
modify the terms of the collective agreement on consent.  Section
13 of the closure agreement makes it clear that the closure
agreement was not meant to and did not form part of the
collective agreement.  It follows that we cannot accept the
position of the Union that the closure agreement merely amended
and became part of the collective agreement.  Rather, it is
properly characterized as a free-standing agreement entered into
by the parties for the sole purpose of determining the terms and
conditions referable to the closure of the production arm of the
Company.
[2]  Pursuant to s. 13 of the closure agreement, the arbitrator
was empowered to determine whether the Company had complied with
or violated the terms of that agreement.  Assuming, without
deciding, that this included the right to determine whether the
closure agreement itself was a product of bad faith bargaining,
the arbitrator did not have the power to add to, amend, modify or
change the agreement.  The Divisional Court concluded that the
remedy imposed by the arbitrator did precisely that.  We agree.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
                                                                 </pre>
