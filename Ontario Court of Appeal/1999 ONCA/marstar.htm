    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Judge Gilles Renaud dated August
5, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Crown appeals the stay of proceedings entered by
Renaud Prov. Ct. J. with respect to multiple charges contrary
to the Customs Act and the Export and Import Permits Act.  The
trial judge found that the rights of both the individual
respondent and the corporate respondent as protected by s.
11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were
infringed.  I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed
in relation to the corporation but the appeal of the stay of
proceedings against Mr. St-Amour should be dismissed.
[2]  The history of these proceedings begins with the execution
of search warrants at the respondents&#146; place of business and
Mr. St-Amour&#146;s home on March 13, 1995.  The execution of the
warrants attracted a great deal of attention.  The respondents
are international arms merchants and the police raid was
carried out with the assistance of a SWAT team and a military-
style helicopter.  This raid had an immediate impact on the
respondents&#146; ability to carry on their business.  The
respondents retained counsel who corresponded with the federal
prosecutor, urging the prosecutor to lay charges as quickly as
possible so that the respondents&#146; legal position could be
resolved.  Throughout the proceedings, the respondents
repeatedly asserted a desire to resolve their legal situation
as quickly as possible.
[3]  On May 23, 1995, charges were laid against the respondents
under the Export and Import Permits Act and the Customs Act.
The police also laid charges against Mr. St-Amour and his wife
under the Criminal Code in respect of the careless storage of
certain firearms in their home.  Mr. Radford, counsel for the
respondents and Mrs. St-Amour, immediately made a request for
disclosure, indicated that he had instructions to proceed
without delay, and sought a pre-trial conference as soon as
possible.  The respondents and Mrs. St-Amour appeared in court
on June 14, 1995 and the matters were adjourned for two weeks
to permit the Crown to make disclosure.  In fact, disclosure in
the form of fourteen volumes of documents was not made until
July 21, 1995.  The cases were, however, at that point ready to
proceed.  Disclosure had been made, counsel had been retained,
and a judicial pre-trial was scheduled for September 8, 1995.
Not quite two years later, on August 5, 1997, the trial judge
stayed the proceedings against the respondents because of
unreasonable delay.
[4]  It is not necessary to provide a detailed chronology of
the events between September 1995 and August 1997.  It is only
necessary to deal with certain parts of the chronology that are
important to the Crown&#146;s arguments.</pre>
    <pre>     Attributing certain delay to the Crown</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The September 8, 1995 pre-trial was adjourned at the
request of the Crown.  Because of scheduling problems for the
pre-trial judge, who ultimately became the trial judge, the pre-
trial was not held until November 20, 1995.  The appellant
argues that this delay is of no moment, and should not be
counted against the Crown because Mr. and Mrs. St-Amour did not
retain counsel on the criminal charges until October 23, 1995.
I do not agree.  It was clear that counsel, acting initially
for the respondents and Mrs. St-Amour, was prepared to deal
with all of the charges at the pre-trial on September 8, 1995,
and he made it clear that the respondents and Mrs. St-Amour
wanted the matter to proceed as quickly as possible.  The trial
judge properly attributed at least the delay from September 9,
1995 to October 22, 1995 to the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>     The length of systemic delay</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The trial judge found that there was systemic or
institutional delay of 25 months.  The appellant concedes a
total systemic delay of only 14-½ months.  The difference
between the view of the trial judge and the view of the
appellant rests primarily on the effect of a series of
decisions made by the parties in the conduct of the
proceedings.  Counsel for the respondents and Mrs. St-Amour
asked that the Criminal Code charges proceed before the other
charges, because delay in prosecuting the Criminal Code charges
was causing greater prejudice to the accused.  Also, all
counsel agreed that the pre-trial judge should be the trial
judge because he had become familiar with this relatively
complex case in preparation for the pre-trial.  I will examine
these two principal issues below.  However, some of the other
arguments of counsel can be dealt with first.
[7]  The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
attributing the delay from October 23, 1995 to November 20,
1995 to systemic delay.  This delay arose from the inability of
the judge to attend because of other more urgent commitments
that intervened.  The appellant submits that this delay was
really due to the respondents&#146; delay in retaining separate
counsel, Mr. Martin, for the criminal charges.  I do not agree.
In his letter of October 19, 1995, Mr. Martin indicated that he
wished to have a separate pre-trial after October 30th to deal
with the criminal charges.  There is no indication that the pre-
trial in relation to the Export and Import Permits Act and the
Customs Act could not have proceeded as scheduled.  To the
contrary, in the letter Mr. Martin indicated that Mr. Radford
would be attending the pre-trial on October 23rd and would be
able to set a date for a separate pre-trial on the criminal
charges.  Mr. Martin observed correctly that the issues
respecting the criminal charges &#147;could be dealt with more
expeditiously than the issues Mr. Radford is dealing with&#148;. I
have not been persuaded that the trial judge erred in
attributing this delay to systemic factors.
[8]  Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge
erred in attributing the entire period from July 18, 1995 to
January 16, 1997 to systemic delay rather than to the inherent
time requirements of the case.  She argues that this period of
almost eighteen months should be considered neutral because it
was needed for the complex application by the respondents to
exclude evidence as a result of an unreasonable search and
seizure.  No doubt, some period was justified by the inherent
time requirements of the case, and is properly attributable to
poor time estimates for the length of time needed to argue the
motion.  However, I have not been persuaded that the trial
judge erred in attributing most of this time to systemic delay.
[9]  The principal difficulty in this case is that the
provincial court system in the jurisdiction was so burdened
with serious cases that any miscalculation in the length of
time needed to complete a matter had a profound effect on the
system&#146;s capacity to try the case.  The court administration
had limited flexibility to find time for the continuation or
completion of a case.  In his lengthy reasons, the trial judge
reviewed the factors that resulted in the court taking eighteen
months to resolve the search-and-seizure motion.  Those factors
included the workload in the jurisdiction and the lack of
adequate judicial resources.  They combined to deprive the
court of any ability to deal expeditiously with a matter that
could not be completed within the initially assigned time.
This was largely a systemic failure.
[10] In R. v. Morin, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, the court dealt
extensively with the question of systemic or institutional
delay.  Sopinka J. laid down certain guidelines for tolerable
systemic delay.  He noted, however, that those guidelines would
have to be adjusted bearing in mind a number of factors, such
as prejudice, especially from pre-trial custody, and having
regard to local conditions.  Whether the systemic delay
exceeded permissible limits contributing to an unreasonable
delay was first a question for the trial judge.  Sopinka J.
wrote as follows at pp. 799-800:
                    These suggested time periods are intended for the
          guidance of trial courts generally. These periods will no doubt
          require adjustment by trial courts in the various regions of
          the country to take into account local conditions and they will
          need to be adjusted from time to time to reflect changing
          circumstances. The Court of Appeal in each province will play a
          supervisory role in seeking to achieve uniformity subject to
          the necessity of taking into account the special conditions and
          problems of different regions in the province.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[11] Sopinka J. also made it clear that the government must be
given some leeway with systemic delay where the jurisdiction is
experiencing an unusual strain on its resources.  In R. v.
Morin, the court was concerned with a case that arose in a
district that was experiencing an unusual and rapid growth in
population.  Even allowing for that unusual factor, the court
considered that a period of eight to nine months was a
reasonable guideline for systemic delay in the provincial
court.  An unusual increase in population is a matter over
which the government may have very little control, and no doubt
it must be given a reasonable period of time to respond.  The
delay in this case seems to have resulted partly from a change
in enforcement policies.  The government must also be given a
reasonable time to respond to this change of circumstance.
However, since this is a matter over which the government has a
greater control, the courts are entitled to subject this factor
to greater scrutiny.
[12] Some deference must be paid to the view of the trial court
on the impact of local conditions and changing circumstances.
In this case, the trial judge has provided substantial
information on the cause of delay and the reasons for the
system&#146;s inability to cope properly with the case within a
reasonable time.  I have not been persuaded that the trial
judge misperceived his function or that he erred in attributing
the delay to systemic or institutional conditions.  Nor have I
been persuaded that he was wrong to find that the delay
exceeded what is reasonable, even given the particular
conditions that overtook the provincial court in that region.
[13] Closely associated with the previous submission is the
appellant&#146;s argument that the trial judge failed to take into
account both the effect of the decision by all parties to have
the pre-trial judge become the trial judge, and the
respondents&#146; desire to have the Criminal Code charges dealt
with first.  I do not agree.  The record discloses that even if
another trial judge from Ottawa had been assigned to the case,
this would not have materially reduced the delay.  As to the
desire of the respondents to deal with the Criminal Code
charges first, this was a reasonable way of proceeding, and I
fail to see how that decision impacted upon the delay in trying
these charges.  As I understand the record, the respondents
were simply asking that the Code charges proceed immediately
before the other charges.  That method of proceeding would not
have delayed the proceeding, but for the inability of the
system to cope with this case.</pre>
    <pre>     Prejudice</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellant&#146;s final argument concerns prejudice.
Concerning Mr. St-Amour, counsel for the appellant submits that
the trial judge confused the prejudice attributable to the mere
fact that the charges were laid with the prejudice from the
delay.  In the course of his reasons, the trial judge said, &#147;In
these unusual circumstances, I am of the view that the
notoriety of the proceedings resulting [sic] in a &#145;merger&#146; of
both types of prejudice.&#148;  In my view, when the trial judge&#146;s
reasons are considered as a whole, he did not misapprehend the
prejudice to Mr. St-Amour.  In R. v. Morin at pp. 801-03,
Sopinka J. discussed the proper approach to measuring prejudice
from delay in the case of an individual accused.  With respect
to inferred prejudice he said, in part, as follows at pp. 801-
02:
               We have decided in several judgments, including the
          unanimous judgment in Smith, supra, that the right protected by
          s. 11(b) is not restricted to those who demonstrate that they
          desire a speedy resolution of their case by asserting the right
          to a trial within a reasonable time. Implicit in this finding
          is that prejudice to the accused can be inferred from prolonged
          delay. In the American concept of this principle, expounded in
          Barker v. Wingo, the inference is that no prejudice has been
          suffered by the accused unless he or she asserts the right.
          While the observation of Dubin C.J.O. in Bennett that many,
          perhaps most, accused are not anxious to have an early trial
          may no doubt be accurate, s. 11(b) was designed to protect the
          individual, whose rights are not to be determined on the basis
          of the desires or practices of the majority. Accordingly, in an
          individual case, prejudice may be inferred from the length of
          the delay. The longer the delay the more likely that such an
          inference will be drawn. In circumstances in which prejudice is
          not inferred and is not otherwise proved, the basis for the
          enforcement of the individual right is seriously undermined.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               As also noted by Cory J. in Askov,
          supra, &quot;the s. 11(b) right is one which can
          often be transformed from a protective
          shield to an offensive weapon in the hands
          of the accused&quot; (p. 1222). This right must
          be interpreted in a manner which recognizes
          the abuse which may be invoked by some
          accused. The purpose of s. 11(b) is to
          expedite trials and minimize prejudice and
          not to avoid trials on the merits. Action
          or non-action by the accused which is
          inconsistent with a desire for a timely
          trial is something that the court must
          consider.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[15] This is not a case where the accused attempted to avoid a
speedy trial.  To the contrary, from the moment the search
warrant was executed, they demonstrated a desire to have the
charges dealt with expeditiously, because of prejudice.  The
trial judge could properly infer prejudice to Mr. St-Amour in
the circumstances.
[16] There was also a basis upon which he could find that the
respondent had shown actual prejudice.  With respect to proof
of actual prejudice, Sopinka J. held as follows at pp. 802-03
in Morin:
                    Apart, however, from inferred prejudice, either party
          may rely on evidence to either show prejudice or dispel such a
          finding. For example, the accused may rely on evidence tending
          to show prejudice to his or her liberty interest as a result of
          pre-trial incarceration or restrictive bail conditions.
          Prejudice to the accused's security interest can be shown by
          evidence of the ongoing stress or damage to reputation as a
          result of overlong exposure to &quot;the vexations and vicissitudes
          of a pending criminal accusation&quot;, to use the words adopted by
          Lamer J. in Mills, supra, at p. 919. The fact that the accused
          sought an early trial date will also be relevant. Evidence may
          also be adduced to show that delay has prejudiced the accused's
          ability to make full answer and defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Conversely, the prosecution may
          establish by evidence that the accused is
          in the majority group who do not want an
          early trial and that the delay benefited
          rather than prejudiced the accused. Conduct
          of the accused falling short of waiver may
          be relied upon to negative prejudice.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[17] There was evidence that the delay in prosecution caused
prejudice to Mr. St-Amour&#146;s security interest in the manner
described by Sopinka J.  In my view, the trial judge&#146;s comment
about the &#147;merger&#148; of the prejudice arising from the manner in
which the investigation commenced and the prejudice from the
delay must be understood in this light.  It only stands to
reason that the more public the investigation, the greater the
ongoing stress or damage to reputation as the prosecution drags
on.
[18] However, I take a different view of the prejudice to the
company. In R. v. CIP Inc., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 843, the court held
that a corporation cannot rely upon a presumption of prejudice
or inferred prejudice.  A corporation must be able to establish
that its fair trial interest has been irremediably prejudiced.
The trial judge made no finding that the respondent
corporation&#146;s fair trial interest was prejudiced.  In my view,
in the absence of such a finding the corporate respondent has
not established a violation of its right under s. 11(b) of the
Charter.
[19] Counsel for the respondent argues that the corporation
involved in this case should be accorded different treatment,
and that the holding in CIP Inc. has no application because
this is a one-person corporation.  He argues that in these
circumstances, delay in trying the corporation affects the
security interests of the individual owner and that, therefore,
the court is entitled to find or infer prejudice.  I do not
agree.  Section 11(b) is a personal right.  Prosecution of any
accused may have collateral effects on other persons such as
members of the accused&#146;s family.  However, the protected right
is that of the accused.
[20] Furthermore, in principle, I cannot see a basis for
distinguishing between private and public corporations.  The
owners or shareholders choose to conduct and arrange their
affairs through use of the corporate vehicle.  That choice has
certain advantages, even in criminal proceedings.  In the
prosecution of a corporation, only the corporation can be
punished, although criminal liability is attributed to the
corporation because of the acts of its directing minds.  I
agree with the following statement of Twaddle J.A. in R. v.
Deslauriers (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 329 (Man. C.A.) at 340:
                    I see no reason to distinguish between corporations
          which are public and those which are private for the purpose of
          determining when a violation of the corporate right to a trial
          within a reasonable time has occurred. The right belongs to the
          corporation: not its members or agents. The effect of delay on
          the individual persons responsible for the allegedly criminal
          activity will likely be much the same whether the corporation
          is public or private.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Those who incorporate private
          corporations do so to gain certain
          advantages such as limited liability for
          its members and a distinction between the
          corporation and its members for tax
          purposes. It seems to me that those who use
          the corporate shield for some purposes
          cannot shed it for others. In my view, the
          Charter confers no right on an individual
          to security of the person from the
          consequences of a delayed prosecution
          against a corporation of which the
          individual is an agent or a member.
          
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[21] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal from the stay of
proceedings for Marstar Trading International Inc., set aside
the stay of proceedings, and remit the matter for trial.  I
would dismiss the appeal concerning John St-Amour.
