      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

      <pre>[1]   The  respondent  was acquitted on a  charge  of  aggravated
assault  by  a  court composed of a judge and  jury.   The  Crown
appeals  the  acquittal on the following three  grounds:  1)  the
trial  judge  erred in instructing the jury that the  defence  of
intoxication  was available to the accused; 2)  the  trial  judge
failed  to  instruct the jury in accordance with s. 33.1  of  the
Criminal Code; and 3) the trial judge failed to instruct the jury
that consent to the intentional application of force was vitiated
in the circumstances of this case.
[2]  Neither the Crown nor the defence submitted to the jury that
intoxication was a defence to the charge of aggravated assault.
It is unclear why the trial judge chose to charge the jury on
intoxication.  Clearly, the offence of aggravated assault is a
crime of general intent.  See R. v. Daviault (1994), 93 C.C.C.
(3d) 23 (S.C.C.).  The defence of intoxication was not available
in this case.  The trial judge's instruction on it was an error
of law.
[3]  The trial judge should have charged the jury in accordance
with s. 33.1 of the Criminal Code.  This section would have made
it clear to the jury that self-induced intoxication was not
available as a defence to the respondent.  The trial judge's
failure to charge on s. 33.1 was also an error of law.
[4]  Although it would have been preferable had the trial judge
briefly charged the jury on the basis stated in R. v. Jobidon
(1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (S.C.C.) at 494-6, we are not
persuaded that the trial judge committed an error on this issue.
He made it clear to the jury that the victim had not consented to
the application of force.
[5]  In our view, the two errors of law are of such importance
that it cannot be said the verdict would necessarily have been
the same, absent these errors.
[6]  The appeal is allowed, the acquittal is set aside, and a new
trial is ordered.
