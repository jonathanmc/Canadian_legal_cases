</strong></pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The question posed in this appeal is whether, for the</pre>
    <pre>purposes of business assessment, the appellant Martin-Brower of</pre>
    <pre>Canada Limited carries on the business of a wholesale merchant as</pre>
    <pre>set out in s. 7(1)(b) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990,</pre>
    <pre>c. A.31. Given the repeal of all business assessment in Ontario</pre>
    <pre>by the Fair Municipal Finance Act, S.O. 1997, c. 5, the answer to</pre>
    <pre>this question carries no prospective import.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant carries on business from premises located at</pre>
    <pre>12 Barton Court, in the City of Brampton. The respondent Regional</pre>
    <pre>Assessment Commissioner has responsibility for this location.</pre>
    <pre>Martin-Brower was assessed for business assessment purposes on</pre>
    <pre>the basis that it carries on the business of a wholesale merchant</pre>
    <pre>at that location. It successfully challenged the assessment</pre>
    <pre>before MacKenzie J. The Regional Assessment Commissioner then</pre>
    <pre>appealed to the Divisional Court where Steele J., speaking for</pre>
    <pre>the court, allowed the appeal and restored the original</pre>
    <pre>assessment. Pursuant to leave, the matter comes to this court.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The Divisional Court, following the case of Buchman &amp; Son</pre>
    <pre>Lumber Company Ltd. et al. v. Regional Assessment Commissioner,</pre>
    <pre>Region 9 et al. (1982), 14 O.M.B.R. 166 (Div. Ct.), held that</pre>
    <pre>Martin-Brower carries on the business of a wholesale merchant at</pre>
    <pre>this location and that its business assessment must be on that</pre>
    <pre>basis. For the reasons that follow I agree with this result.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The relevant provision of the Assessment Act is s. 7(1)(b).</pre>
    <pre>That subsection, which has since been repealed along with the</pre>
    <pre>rest of s. 7, reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               7.—(1)  Irrespective of any assessment
          of land under this Act, every person
          occupying or using land for the purpose of,
          or in connection with, any business mentioned
          or described in this section, shall be
          assessed for a sum to be called &quot;business
          assessment&quot; to be computed by reference to
          the assessed value of the land so occupied or
          used by that person as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  The business of a wholesale merchant,
          brewer, insurance company, loan corporation,
          trust corporation, express company carrying
          on business on or in connection with a
          railway or steamboats or other vessels, land
          company, loaning land corporation, bank,
          banker, credit union, caisse populaire or any
          other financial business, for a sum equal to
          75 per cent of the assessed value of the land
          so occupied or used.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant argues against the application of this</pre>
    <pre>subsection to the facts of this case but says rather that</pre>
    <pre>s. 7(1)(k) applies. It reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
          (k)   Any business not specially mentioned
          before in this section, for a sum equal to 30
          per cent of the assessed value of the land so
          occupied or used.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The relevant facts concerning the appellant are quite</pre>
    <pre>unique. Martin-Brower is an independent company having no</pre>
    <pre>ownership connection with McDonald's Restaurants of Canada.</pre>
    <pre>Martin-Brower purchases large quantities of restaurant food and</pre>
    <pre>supplies, warehouses them, and resells them in large quantities</pre>
    <pre>to McDonald's Restaurants, both those that are corporately owned</pre>
    <pre>and those that are franchised outlets. Martin-Brower has its own</pre>
    <pre>premises, its own equipment and its own work force. It uses its</pre>
    <pre>own capital to finance these purchases and it alone is</pre>
    <pre>responsible for payment to the suppliers. McDonald's has no</pre>
    <pre>responsibility for these debts nor for the debts owed to Martin-</pre>
    <pre>Brower by its franchisees.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Martin-Brower sales are exclusively to McDonald's</pre>
    <pre>Restaurants. Its suppliers are selected by McDonald's. The prices</pre>
    <pre>it pays are set by agreement between McDonald's and those</pre>
    <pre>suppliers. The prices it charges on resale are set by agreement</pre>
    <pre>between Martin-Brower and McDonald's so as to provide Martin-</pre>
    <pre>Brower with an adequate agreed rate of return on its working</pre>
    <pre>capital. In this regard, Steele J. made the following finding of</pre>
    <pre>fact:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The overall return to Martin-Brower is
          directly linked to its costs of operation
          including an appropriate return on investment
          and profit margin so as to give Martin-Brower
          a return usually in a range of 16 to 20
          percent. In other words, Martin-Brower takes
          the risk of the operation and historically
          has achieved the above profit margins.
          However, even within that range it is Martin-
          Brower's risk. I believe that Martin-Brower
          does realize a profit on the overall
          inventory handled by it.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The Divisional Court reached its conclusion by applying</pre>
    <pre>Buchman, supra to these facts. That case sets out two criteria</pre>
    <pre>for determining whether a business is that of a wholesale</pre>
    <pre>merchant for the purpose of s. 7(1)(b) of the Assessment Act.</pre>
    <pre>First, does it engage in sales of large quantities of product</pre>
    <pre>and, second, are those sales to a person other than the end user.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In my view these criteria are properly applied in this case.</pre>
    <pre>They represent a sound test of whether the business of Martin-</pre>
    <pre>Brower is that of a wholesale merchant, giving those words their</pre>
    <pre>ordinary meaning, as required by Xerox of Canada Ltd. v. Regional</pre>
    <pre>Assessment Commissioner et al., [1981] 2 S.C.R. 137. Moreover,</pre>
    <pre>because the repeal of all business assessment has closed the</pre>
    <pre>universe of such cases, it would be undesirable to depart from</pre>
    <pre>what has been sound law since 1982 nor is it necessary to explore</pre>
    <pre>whether this might represent an exhaustive definition of the term</pre>
    <pre>&quot;wholesale merchant&quot;.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] The business of the appellant clearly meets both criteria</pre>
    <pre>set out in Buchman. Its sales are of large volumes and the</pre>
    <pre>purchasing restaurants are not the end users. Rather, their</pre>
    <pre>customers are.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant argues that because Martin-Brower has reduced</pre>
    <pre>its freedom of decision-making in a number of respects and in</pre>
    <pre>return has reduced the risk to its rate of return, it therefore</pre>
    <pre>does not meet the definition of &quot;wholesale merchant&quot;. I disagree</pre>
    <pre>with this approach. I can see no principled basis on which to</pre>
    <pre>define how much freedom must be retained or how much risk must</pre>
    <pre>remain for the definition to be met. Indeed, the degree to which</pre>
    <pre>an enterprise has freedom of decision-making and carries business</pre>
    <pre>risk seems to me to reflect not whether it is a wholesale</pre>
    <pre>merchant but rather the particular market circumstances of the</pre>
    <pre>enterprise. In my view, the ordinary meaning of &quot;wholesale</pre>
    <pre>merchant&quot; can encompass a wide range of market circumstances. In</pre>
    <pre>any event, in this case Martin-Brower has retained some freedom</pre>
    <pre>of operation and some commercial risk.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] In summary, therefore, I agree with Steele J. that Martin-</pre>
    <pre>Brower carries on the business of a wholesale merchant at this</pre>
    <pre>location. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.
