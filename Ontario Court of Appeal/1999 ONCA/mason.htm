COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) and JAMES
               MASON (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        WEILER, ROSENBERG and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Chris Hicks, for the appellant

    <pre>HEARD:         March 31, 1999

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Having regard to the fact that over three years have elapsed
between the finding that the appellant was a dangerous offender
and this appeal, it appears to us to be in the interests of
justice and necessary for a proper determination of the real
issues before the court to receive further information.

[2]  This appeal is adjourned to provide the court with a current
picture of the appellant including a recent psychiatric
assessment provided the appellant consents to such assessment.
The psychiatrists who testified at the hearing are requested to
agree on a willing psychiatrist they would nominate in British
Columbia to conduct the assessment. In any event, a post-sentence
sentence report is ordered.

[3]  Counsel for the appellant has also indicated that he may
seek to raise the long term sentence provisions which have been
enacted since the finding was made that the appellant was a
dangerous offender. In view of this, further time may be required
for the hearing of this appeal and an application to the list
judge may be appropriate.</pre>
