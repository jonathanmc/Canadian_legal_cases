    <pre>On Appeal from the judgment of G. Ferguson J. dated March 19, 1997

</pre>
    <pre>AUSTIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, a psychologist, appeals from his conviction
on March 19, 1997, by G. Ferguson J., sitting without a jury, on
two charges of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal
Code, and in particular, of having had sexual intercourse with
two patients without their consent.  Dr. Matheson also applies
for leave and, if granted, appeals from the sentence of one year
imprisonment on each count, to be served consecutively, imposed
on May 12, 1997.

</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was the chief psychologist at Etobicoke
General Hospital.  The complainants, whose names are subject to a
non-publication order, will be referred to simply as &#147;X&#148; and &#147;Y&#148;.
[3]  X was 47 years old, married and had a grown son when she
began therapy with the appellant on an out-patient basis.  She
was his patient from March 1987 to March or April 1989.  Sexual
intercourse began at her home and later occurred at the
appellant&#146;s office and home and at her office.  The sexual
relationship continued for about three and one-half years after
the doctor/patient relationship ended.  The charge included only
the period of March 1, 1987 to April 1, 1989.
[4]  Y was a 29 year old registered nurse, married and the mother
of two children when she became a private patient of the
appellant in March 1992.  She remained his patient for seven
months.  From June to August 1992, they engaged in a sexual
relationship.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUES ON APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appeal raises the following issues:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   Whether the trial judge erred in editing the records of
               persons who treated the complainants after the appellant;
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   Whether  one of such errors involved the trial  judge&#146;s
               failure to note the expression &#147;brain washing&#148;;
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   Whether the evidence of Dr. Gail Robinson was admissible
               expert evidence;
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.   Whether the verdict was unreasonable having regard to the
               parts played by health professionals and lawyers after the times
               covered by the charges; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.   Whether  the  consent or submission of the complainants
               to  sexual  activities was procured or induced  by  the
               exercise  of  authority  within  the  meaning   of   s.
               265(3)(d) of the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION OF GROUNDS 1 TO 4</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The first two grounds were dealt with together as a
preliminary matter.  The expression &#147;brain washing&#148; did not
appear anywhere in the evidence.  The trial judge used it towards
the end of his reasons for conviction.  The appellant&#146;s concern
was that it may have been in the notes or records of the health
professionals who had treated the complainants subsequent to the
periods set out in the charges.  Had that been the case, it was
the appellant&#146;s position that that note or record should have
been disclosed but was not.
[7]  After hearing arguments on this matter, the court recessed
to consider it.  We were satisfied that the expression was used
by the trial judge as a form of shorthand and that there was no
basis for a review of his editing of those notes and records.
Those grounds were accordingly rejected from the bench.
[8]  Dr. Gail Robinson testified for the prosecution at the
preliminary hearing and at trial.  She is a full professor of
psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology at the University of
Toronto.  Dr. Robinson has written and lectured widely on the
subject of the sexual exploitation of female patients by health
professionals and on the issue of therapist/patient sexual
misconduct.  In my view, her evidence met the criteria set out in
R. v. Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.), namely,
relevance, necessity to assist the trier of fact, absence of any
exclusionary rule and proper qualification of the expert.  It
should be noted that the defence called its own experts.
[9]  The unreasonable verdict argument appears to depend in part
upon the remaining ground, namely, the interpretation of
&#147;exercise of authority&#148;, and the proposition that although both
complainants consented to sexual activities, they were later
persuaded by their therapists, lawyers and the material they read
that &#147;they couldn&#146;t have consented&#148;.  The influence of the
therapists, lawyers and readings fell to the trial judge to
consider and weigh.  I am not persuaded that he erred in
rejecting this proposition.
[10] Accordingly, in my view, the first four grounds of appeal
listed in paragraph [5] of these reasons must fail.
[11] The interpretation of &#147;exercise of authority&#148; will be dealt
with next.  In my view, it is the only ground of any substance.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[12] Both complainants engaged in sexual activity, including
sexual intercourse, with the appellant.  Both consented to such
activity.  The issue is whether this consent was vitiated by the
&#147;exercise of authority&#148; as that expression is used in s.
265(3)(d) of the Criminal Code.  The appellant argues that in the
circumstances he had no authority and exercised no authority
within the meaning of that section.
[13] In 1987, X was dismissed from her job of 22 years.  She was
devastated.  She could not sleep or eat and was suicidal.  X was
referred to the appellant.  She commenced seeing him twice a week
at his office at Etobicoke General Hospital.  She discussed her
personal background with the appellant, including the fact that
as a young person she had been physically and sexually abused
while under the care of the Children&#146;s Aid Society.
[14] During therapy, X and the appellant would sit in chairs
facing each other.  As time passed, he would move closer while
she would push her chair away from him.  When things were
particularly difficult for her to discuss, the appellant would
touch X on the foot or leg with his own foot or leg.  He told her
that it would be easier for her if he touched her.
[15] In July 1988, the appellant asked X for a kiss because it
was his birthday.  She presented her cheek and he turned her face
and kissed her on the lips.
[16] When X described her husband to the appellant as a person
with problems of his own who was not supportive of her, the
appellant told her that unless she left her husband she would
never get better.
[17] In late July 1988, the appellant came to X&#146;s house, at
night, uninvited.
[18] The appellant returned several times, sometimes with food
and wine.  On one such occasion, he told X that his marriage was
a mistake and that he was in love with her.  X told the appellant
that it would not be difficult for her to get a lover, but that
what she wanted and needed was a therapist.
[19] By August 1988, the appellant was coming to X&#146;s house every
night.  They eventually started having sexual intercourse there.
She continued to see him at the hospital for therapy.
[20] In August 1988, the appellant went to Europe to attend an
International Society of Hypnosis meeting.  Before he left, X
told him that she only wanted him to be her therapist.  He
agreed.  However, while he was gone, she received a barrage of
letters, telephone calls and gifts from the appellant.  The
messages on some of the postcards he sent were sexual in nature.
A constant in his communications was his love and sexual desire
for X.
[21] When the appellant returned from Europe, both the sexual and
therapeutic relationships resumed.  X said she had had no
intention of continuing with the sexual relationship.
[22] X repeatedly asked the appellant to send her to another
therapist.  In addition, when she was suicidal, she asked him to
admit her to the hospital&#146;s psychiatric department.  The
appellant told her that if she went to see another doctor, or for
that matter to a hospital, they would drug her.  He also reminded
her that it had taken a long time for her to trust him and that
she did not trust others.  He told her that he knew her better
than anyone else and that she felt comfortable with him because
he was a good person.  As the trial judge found, &#147;he would
explain about the length of time it took to develop trust with
him and to talk about what had happened in her background&#148; and
&#147;whatever the accused said to her made sense to her&#148;.
[23] X separated from her husband in December 1988.  Her sexual
relationship with the appellant continued until September 1992
when she found him in bed with another patient.  The therapeutic
relationship had ended some time earlier.
[24] When X went to the appellant she was in desperate need of
help.  She was mentally fragile and vulnerable and the appellant
held himself out to her as a professional who could help her.  X
trusted the appellant as a therapist without reservation.  She
revealed her entire background to him and accepted everything he
told her for the purpose of getting professional help from him.</pre>
    <pre>[25] I turn now to Y.  She was sexually victimized as a young
girl and subsequently suffered depression and was suicidal.  As
an adult, these earlier events contributed to a depression that
manifested itself in her sexual relationship with her husband.
Her husband, also a doctor, suggested hypnotherapy.  Together
they sought a female hypnotist with experience dealing with
survivors of child sexual abuse.  The Ontario Society for
Clinical Hypnosis recommended the appellant who had a female
associate who might be available to assist Y.
[26] Before seeing the appellant, Y sent him a fax in which she
outlined in detail her background and present difficulties.  When
she met the appellant, she made it clear that she wanted a female
therapist.  The appellant offered to and did hypnotize her.
Under hypnosis, she was returned to her childhood and felt the
experience of desperately needing someone to rescue her.  Y
agreed to continue seeing the appellant because she felt hypnosis
would be helpful.  The appellant, however, did not use hypnosis
with her again even though she asked him to.</pre>
    <pre>[27] During the initial therapy sessions, there was non-sexual
touching of Y by the appellant.  This comforted her when she
talked of something troubling or painful.
[28] Over time, the touching grew more intimate.  The appellant
started to rest his hand on Y&#146;s knee or shoulder.  He also pulled
his chair closer to her, placed his arm around her and pulled her
onto his lap.
[29] The appellant told Y that his touch comforted her and
allowed her to speak freely about difficult issues.  He suggested
that they embrace at the outset of each meeting in order that she
would feel comfortable right away.  Y complied.
[30] Y trusted the appellant implicitly.  She felt comforted by
the appellant&#146;s touching and believed his actions were intended
to replace the comfort and reassurance she had not received as a
child.
[31] During one session, while Y told the appellant of childhood
abuses, he stroked her arm.  When she told him that she was
sexually aroused by this, he responded that it was normal for
patients to develop strong feelings for their therapists.  Y told
the appellant that she felt guilty and distressed because she did
not want to have sexual feelings for him.  Knowing how she felt,
he continued to touch her in this manner.  He told her that she
needed therapy and he was going to help her.
[32] The appellant knew that as an adolescent Y was unable to say
&#147;no&#148; to any man who asked for sex.  He also knew that she valued
her fidelity to her husband of 12 years.
[33] Y sent the appellant a fax saying that she wanted to end
therapy with him because it was having a harmful effect.  Her
husband did not agree.  When she told him about the touching he
understood that it was a therapeutic tool used to trigger
positive feelings of comfort.  He encouraged her to discuss her
feelings with the appellant.  The net result was that Y continued
to see the appellant and the sessions were increased to two a
week.
[34] By this time, Y realized that the appellant&#146;s touching had
nothing to do with her comfort but was about his desire for sex.
However, she was unable to talk to him about her realization and
felt powerless to alter the course of action.
[35] During the next session, the appellant embraced Y and
stroked her while she spoke of the childhood abuse.  She asked
him to touch her as she was upset.  He told her he did not want
to do anything to hurt her.  She asked if his touching would hurt
her.  He said he did not know.  He touched her breasts and she
rubbed his chest for 10 or 15 minutes.
[36] The subsequent session started in the same manner.  Y and
the appellant eventually started touching each other, then stood
up, took off their clothes and had sex on the floor of his
office.  After the last session, she had anticipated that he
would want to have intercourse so she brought a condom.  After
the sex, Y told the appellant she was very distressed.  He
assured her he was going to provide her with therapy.
[37] By the next session, Y decided that sex was not a price she
wanted to pay for therapy.  She wanted to phone the appellant to
tell him but feared that her husband would again intervene.
Instead, she went to the appellant&#146;s office.  She placed her
chair as far away from him as she could and would not look at
him.  She was crying while she told him how terrible she felt
about what they had done and that they could not do it again.
She said she needed therapy and that she did not want him to
touch her.  She also told him she did not want to have sex with
him.
[38] The appellant told Y that she did need therapy, that she was
very close to being better and that he could help her.  He told
her she did not have to disclose anything to her husband.  He sat
on the floor next to her and touched her knee.  She kept telling
him she did not want him to touch her.  He spoke to her
throughout in a very reassuring tone, repeatedly telling her that
he cared a great deal for her and was going to help her.
[39] By the end of the session, Y had agreed to continue seeing
the appellant twice a week, one day for sex and the other for
therapy.  She later told him that if sex was going to continue
she did not want to have sex on the floor of his office as she
found it humiliating.  She agreed to and did have the &#147;sex
sessions&#148; in his apartment about five times.
[40] Although the appellant had not expressly asked Y for sex,
she testified that she &#147;always went more by his actions and
behaviour than his words&#148;.  She also testified that during the
time that the sexual activity was happening she never in any way
evidenced that she did not wish to have it.  Y said that she did
not believe that she could stop the appellant from touching her
or having sex with her.
[41] In early June, Y sent the appellant a fax telling him that
she desperately needed therapy but that he had betrayed her.  She
felt that he had manipulated her and was not helping her.  Y told
the appellant that she felt trapped because there was nobody else
in the world she could talk to except him.  The appellant&#146;s reply
was the same as before &#150; that Y was close to being better, that
he could help her and that she needed therapy.
[42] In August, the appellant went away for three weeks.  While
he was gone, Y decided she was not going to resume therapy with
him.  Upon his return, the appellant called Y at home and she
agreed to meet him because she did not want to be rude.  They met
and had sex.  She had a panic attack, rolled off the bed and
pulled a blanket around herself.  She told the appellant that she
was very frightened and to leave her alone.  Again, he was very
reassuring.  As always, he said it was all right, it was him, Dr.
Matheson, he was going to help her and she did not have anything
to fear.
[43] In September, 1992, Y read the book &#147;Sex in Forbidden Zone&#148;
which says that a therapist can not have sex with a patient and
also provide therapy to that patient.  Y gave this book to the
appellant and told him that what he had done was harmful.  The
appellant was apologetic and acknowledged that he had done
something wrong.  Y told him that he should not do it again.  He
offered to find her another therapist.  After this meeting, Y did
not see the appellant again.
[44] After their dealings with the appellant, X and Y saw and
were advised by the same therapist and the same lawyer.
[45] The trial judge accepted and relied upon the evidence of Dr.
Robinson.  She testified that patient/therapist sexual misconduct
is a recognized area of study within psychiatry and psychology.
A therapist has great power and influence over a patient.  The
relationship creates a significant &#147;power imbalance&#148; which has a
potential for the &#147;misuse of authority&#148;.  The patient is very
vulnerable &#147;and the therapist is treated as an authority figure
who has enormous influence over the patient&#148;.
[46] Dr. Robinson testified about the concept known as
&#147;transference&#148;.  This concept has been described as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Transference refers to the phenomenon whereby  the
          patient begins to relate to the psychotherapist as
          if  he  were  a  parent or some other  significant
          person  in  her life.  The degree of  transference
          involved places this relationship close to that of
          the parent-child on the continuum of exploitation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          To  benefit  from psychotherapy, the patient  must
          reveal   intimate   information   about   herself.
          Because  these  revelations are so  personal,  and
          often  involve information which could be damaging
          to the patient, she must develop a strong sense of
          trust in her psychotherapist before she makes such
          disclosures.  Consequently, she is likely to &#147;fall
          in  love&#148;  with  her psychotherapist,  fantasizing
          that  he  will  be  able to make  her  well.   The
          patient&#146;s  fantasy is similar to the belief  of  a
          child that the parent can solve any problem.  As a
          result  of  the transference, adult  patients  may
          attempt   to   change   the   relationship    from
          therapeutic   to   sexual.   Such   behaviour   is
          analogous  to  the &#147;flirtatious&#148;  behaviour  of  a
          daughter with her father.  Nevertheless,  just  as
          the  father must encourage his daughter to develop
          her  sexuality without responding  to  her  in  an
          overtly  sexual  manner, the psychotherapist  must
          deny   the  patient  sexual  gratification   while
          providing  a  safe  place for exploration  of  her
          sexual nature.</pre>
    <pre>Phyllis  Coleman,   &#147;Sex  in Power Dependency  Relationships:   Taking
Unfair Advantage of the &#145;Fair&#146; Sex&#148; (1988), 53 Albany Law Review 95 at
pp. 103-4.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The three experts who testified at trial agreed that sexual
activity should never occur between therapist and patient.  They
were unanimous in the view that &#147;when sex enters the
relationship, therapy leaves&#148;.
[48] The Coleman article referred to above continues at p. 104 as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  therapist must reject any overt  response  to
          sexual   feelings  because,   as   a   result   of
          transference, the patient&#146;s consent  to  a  sexual
          relationship is inherently suspect.  As  with  the
          child  incest victim, coercion ordinarily  is  not
          required.   The  dependent person&#146;s &#147;consent&#148;,  or
          even  her  initiation of sexual  contact,  is  not
          voluntary  because  she  cannot  make   a   mature
          decision  based on existing information.   Rather,
          she  &#147;agrees&#148; as a result of unconscious  factors,
          and therefore lacks the state of mind necessary to
          consent.    Sex   under  these  circumstances   is
          tantamount  to  sex  without  consent  and  should
          result in liability for damages.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[49] With respect to X, the trial judge found that the appellant,
knowing she wanted to see another therapist, pressured her not do
so, referring to the length of time the therapy would involve,
the closeness of their relationship and how well he knew her.  He
pressured her not to become an in-patient in the hospital because
she would be drugged.  In the course of the first year of
therapy, the appellant initiated the process of touching but that
touching was not of a sexual nature.  Then he solicited a
birthday kiss in 1988.  After that, the appellant initiated
visits to X&#146;s home, bringing her food and wine.  X told the
appellant that she wanted therapy from him and not sex.  He
ultimately gave her both, telling her that he was in love with
her.  Even though she told him she did not want to see him, he
insisted on seeing her and having sex with her.  In summary, as a
result of &#147;therapy&#148; sessions, X became involved in a long-term
sexual and social relationship with the appellant which ended
when she discovered him having sex with another patient.
[50] With respect to Y, the trial judge found that the appellant
engaged in a progressive pattern of touching which culminated in
his suggestion with respect to embracing.  He led her to believe
that the touching process was a helpful part of therapy.  She
accepted that it was reassuring and proper.  Having decided to
terminate therapy because she felt it was harmful and having
advised the appellant of that decision, she then continued as a
result of her husband&#146;s intervention.  The touching process then
increased to include stroking.  This aroused her sexually.  The
appellant told her there was nothing wrong with that.  She then
assumed and decided that the appellant wanted to have sex with
her so at the next session she brought a condom which was used
for intercourse after sexual touching.  The appellant had not
demanded or asked for sex, but when Y asked him if he wanted sex,
he said he did.  There was repeated discussion between Y and the
appellant about her need for therapy and his confirmation and
reassurance that he was going to give it to her and that it would
help her.  By virtue of his position of superior power, Y was
reduced and manipulated by the appellant.
[51] The appellant did not testify at trial.  His position, here
and below, is that the relationship of therapist and patient does
not involve authority.  He contends that he had no authority over
X or Y, that they were fully conscious of what they were doing
and that both consented and agreed to engage in sexual activity
with him.
[52] The trial judge rejected this claim.  In reaching this
conclusion, he made the following remarks at pp. 67-68, 70 and 72-
73:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Common  sense  dictates  that  when  there  is   a
          significant     power     imbalance      in      a
          psychologist/patient  relationship,  there  is  an
          ability   to   dominate,  to  influence   and   to
          manipulate.  Thus the psychologist is normally  in
          a position of authority over the patient.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Under  the Criminal Code, the intentional exercise
          of  such  a  position of authority to  obtain  any
          sexual  activity  is  criminalized  because  under
          those  circumstances,  if proven  to  be  genuine,
          consent  is no defence, so the sexual assault  has
          occurred.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  this  case,  there is no suggestion  from  any
          expert     that    under    a    therapist-patient
          relationship,  the  therapist  did  not  have   an
          existing  potential  power or authority  over  the
          patient.  There is also no suggestion from  anyone
          that  when a therapist-patient relationship  turns
          into  a  sexual relationship, that the therapist&#146;s
          power  or authority is downgraded or ceased,  even
          though the real therapy has ceased.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  evidence  in  my  view  is  overwhelming   in
          establishing   that   there  was   a   substantial
          imbalance  of  power between  the  powers  of  the
          accused and each of his alleged victims during the
          term  of real therapy.  During the term stated  in
          the  indictment,  in each one of the  charges,  he
          held  the  power, and he held it by a  significant
          degree.   He had the professional status  to  gain
          and  hold that power, and his alleged victims were
          vulnerable to that power, and he knew  it.   As  a
          result of the power imbalance, he had the power to
          apply   pressure  to  and  manipulate  those   two
          patients, and he did so.  All of that, in my view,
          means that the exercise of authority, and where it
          happens  for a sexual purpose, there is no consent
          to an assault for a sexual purpose.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Here,   the  evidence  on  each  charge   provides
          overwhelming  evidence in establishing  that  each
          alleged  victim  in the course of  real  or  bogus
          therapy  was extremely vulnerable, and, therefore,
          substantially under the control and  authority  of
          the accused.  The evidence is also overwhelming in
          providing proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          accused as a practicing psychologist, knew that he
          had  the  capacity  and ability and  awareness  to
          maintain  that authority and to exercise  it,  and
          overwhelming  in  proving that during  the  period
          stated  in each charge, he intentionally exercised
          that   authority  for  the  specific  purpose   of
          participating  and  obtaining  sexual  intercourse
          with   each   one  of  the  victims.    There   is
          overwhelming evidence in my view that the exercise
          of   authority   in  each  one  of   the   charges
          incorporated   a   slow,  gradual   seduction,   a
          conditioning,  and a manipulation.   It  could  be
          called  a brainwashing of two extremely vulnerable
          women who were totally fenced in by an intentional
          exercise   of  power  and  authority   which   was
          calculated,   intentional   blatant,    deceptive,
          persistent and consistent.  Each of these women, Y
          and  X, being seriously disturbed mentally,  being
          under  stress  to  a  great extent,  went  to  the
          accused  for  therapy and not  for  sex.   Knowing
          that,   the   accused  intentionally  abused   and
          exercised  his  superior  position  of  power  and
          authority, and he did that, I am satisfied  it  is
          proven,   not   for  any  aspect  of  professional
          therapy, but for sexual intercourse and to satisfy
          his own sexual lust.  I find the accused guilty on
          both counts.

    <pre>[53] Absent consent, there can be no doubt that the events in
issue were assaults.  The sole defence was that all sexual
activity was consensual.  The onus was on the prosecution to
prove that any consent was vitiated by the exercise of authority.
The position taken on behalf of the appellant was that he was not
in a position of authority with respect to either complainant and
that their consents were not induced by the exercise of
authority.

    <pre>LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF SECTION 265(3)(d) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE</pre>
    <pre>[56] Exercise of authority was introduced to the statutory law of
assault in Canada as part of Bill C-127, An Act to Amend the
Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Offences Against the Person),
which came into force on January 4, 1983.  The current
s.265(3)(d) was s.244(3)(d) in Bill C-127.
[57] In 1982, a history of Bill C-127, Sexual Offences (Ottawa:
Law and Government Division, Research Branch, Library of
Parliament, 1982), was prepared by Donald Macdonald for the
Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.  At p. 4,
Macdonald notes that the effect of s.244(3) was to significantly
change the circumstances in which consent to sexual activity is
not genuine.  At the time, the predecessor to s. 244(3), s.
143(b) of the Criminal Code, stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A male person commits rape when he has sexual
               intercourse with a female person who  is  not
               his wife,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  with her consent if the consent
                    </pre>
    <pre>                    (i)  is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm,
                    </pre>
    <pre>                    (ii) is obtained by personating her husband, or
                    </pre>
    <pre>                    (iii)is obtained by false and fraudulent representations as
                         to the nature and quality of the act.</pre>
    <pre>[58] Macdonald&#146;s comments on the scope of the changes
contemplated by s. 244(3) are limited to the following at p. 5:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  necessity for fear of bodily harm is dropped;
          the  application or fear of &#147;force&#148; to the  victim
          or   another  person  is  sufficient  to   vitiate
          consent.   The qualification as to the  nature  of
          fraudulently  obtained consent will no  longer  be
          necessary  and  a  new element,  the  exercise  of
          authority, is added.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[59] In An Information Paper on Bill C-127 (Ottawa:  January
1983) released by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada to coincide with Bill C-127&#146;s coming into force, it was
noted that the impetus for Bill C-127 was the Law Reform
Commission of Canada&#146;s Report on Sexual Offences, released in
1978.  In that Report, the Law Reform Commission proposed
sweeping changes to the law on sexual offences in Canada.  The
Report recognized that any changes to the criminal law in this
area should reflect a number of objectives, including:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    1.     Protection   of  the   individual
                    integrity   of  the  person  from   non-
                    consensual sexual contact; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                    2.    Protection  of  children  and  the
                    psychologically vulnerable  from  sexual
                    contact.</pre>
    <pre>[60] Once again, the Information Paper on Bill C-127 makes only
passing mention of s.244(3)(d).  At p. 2, it states:  &#147;Section
244(3) outlines the circumstances where no consent to the assault
or sexual assault is obtained&#133;.The new Section 244 sets out in
subsection 3 the factors which vitiate consent to any form of
assault&#148;.
[61] In The New Offences Against the Person:  The Provisions of
Bill C-27 (Toronto:  Butterworths, 1984), David Watt (now the
Honourable Mr. Justice Watt) includes a discussion of s.244(3).
At p.132, he writes:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Section  244(3) lists a number of factors,  which,
          though  they  may  cause V. to submit  or  not  to
          resist  D.&#146;s conduct, will not amount  to  consent
          sufficient  in  law to negate that aspect  of  the
          external circumstances of any form of assault.</pre>
    <pre>[62] Watt provides a more detailed analysis of s.244(3)(d) at pp.
220-21:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  final  element whose existence  will  vitiate
          V.&#146;s  consent  arises when such consent  has  been
          obtained   by  the  exercise  of  authority.    No
          specific  relationships are  listed  as  excluding
          consent so that the issue in each case will become
          whether   the  authority  allegedly  negated   the
          voluntary character of the consent given.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On  occasion, the exercise of D. of authority over
          V.  may  deprive the latter of a true appreciation
          of  all the risks involved as for example where D.
          uses  the employment relationship to induce V.,  a
          subordinate, to have sexual intercourse with  him.
          On  other  occasions,  however,  the  exercise  of
          authority  may  be  restricted  in  scope   by   a
          statutory provision, as for example s. 43  of  the
          Code which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    43.   Every  schoolteacher,  parent   or
                    person standing in the place of a parent
                    is  justified in using force by  way  of
                    correction toward a pupil or  child,  as
                    the  case may be, who is under his care,
                    if  the  force does not exceed  what  is
                    reasonable under the circumstances.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  submitted that when it is asserted that  a
          consent,  apparently given, has been  vitiated  by
          the  exercise  of  authority,  the  circumstantial
          facts  ought  to  be first examined  to  determine
          whether  D.,  by  law, custom or usage,  is  in  a
          position  of authority vis-à-vis V.  In the  event
          that  it  is  determined that such a  relationship
          existed, it must next be ascertained whether, as a
          matter  of  fact,  V.&#146;s  submission  or  lack   of
          resistance was founded upon such relationship.  An
          affirmative response upon both issues will  render
          legally  ineffectual  V.&#146;s  consent  and  hold  D.
          liable  to  the  extent of his conduct.   Upon  it
          being  asserted that V. consented to D.&#146;s conduct,
          it  will be incumbent upon the prosecution,  where
          it  is alleged that V.&#146;s consent has been vitiated
          by  exercise of authority, to prove the  existence
          of  the  authority relationship,  its  nature  and
          extent, and that V.&#146;s consent has been vitiated by
          the exercise of such authority.</pre>
    <pre>[63] It could be argued on behalf of the appellant that the
analysis suggested by Watt was never undertaken by the trial
judge.  That is, that there was never any determination as to:
(a) whether the appellant, by law, custom or usage, was in a
position of authority vis-à-vis the complainants; (b) whether the
appellant exercised his authority over the complainants; and (c)
whether the complainants consented or submitted by reason of the
exercise of authority by the appellant.
[64] In Sexual Assault (Toronto:  Carswell, 1984), Professor
Christine Boyle discusses the changes to the law of sexual
assault under Bill C-127.  She explains s. 244(3)(d) and the
&#147;exercise of authority&#148; as a basis for vitiating consent at pp.
70-71:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This  is  a  new  factor, so  little  guidance  is
          available.  The obvious issues are when one person
          can  be said to be in a position of authority over
          another,  and when that authority can be  said  to
          have been exercised.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          One  would  expect the definition of authority  to
          depend  on  the rationale for the rule itself  but
          that is of limited assistance.  The meaning of the
          word   in   this   context&#133;will  depend   on   the
          judiciary&#146;s  view  of  the scope  of  the  morally
          reprehensible conduct which ought to  attract  the
          attention   of  the  criminal  law&#133;.[T]he   Oxford
          English Dictionary indicates that authority means,
          inter   alia,  the  power  or  right  to   enforce
          obedience;  the power to influence the conduct  or
          actions   of   others;   personal   or   practical
          influence.  The possibility therefore exists  that
          an extremely broad definition of authority will be
          adopted by the courts.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Employers  (including persons put in positions  of
          authority  by  them), teachers,  police  officers,
          immigration  officers, judges, all have  power  to
          enforce  obedience  and a fortiori  the  power  to
          influence  the  conduct  or  actions  of   others.
          Husbands  who  insist on being  the  head  of  the
          household might well be in trouble here, if judged
          according to their view of reality&#133;.This provision
          may   well  cover  the  not-unknown  case  of  the
          professor  who engages in sexual activity  with  a
          student.   Doctor/nurse romances may  be  somewhat
          risky.</pre>
    <pre>[65] The central issue raised by this appeal is as to the meaning
of the word &#147;authority&#148; as used by Parliament in enacting
s.265(3)(d).
[66] The appellant argues that &#147;authority&#148; in the present context
means &#147;power or right to enforce obedience&#148;.  He argues that as
the complainants&#146; psychologist he had neither the power nor the
right to enforce obedience.  Accordingly, his conduct does not
fall within the ambit of s. 265(3)(d).
[67] It is further argued that &#147;authority relationships&#148; are
numerous, e.g. parent and child, teacher and pupil, employer and
employee and superior and junior ranks in military and other
organizations.  In each of these organizations, there is a power
or right to enforce obedience in some respect &#150; but that is not
true of the doctor/patient relationship nor of the
therapist/patient relationship.  The doctor may prescribe, but he
or she has no power or right to enforce obedience.
[68] The fourth meaning ascribed by the dictionary to
&#147;authority&#148;, and that advanced by the respondent, is &#147;power to
influence the conduct and actions of others; personal or
practical influence&#148;.  Taking the example of a doctor prescribing
a medication or a course of treatment, he or she does have the
power to influence his or her patients by way of persuasion.
[69] A review of the jurisprudence reveals examples of both the
interpretations of &#147;authority&#148; set out in paragraphs [66] and
[68].</pre>
    <pre>JURISPRUDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[70] In R. v. Cadden, [1986] B.C.J. No. 2778 (Co. Ct.) (QL
Systems), an elementary school teacher was charged with sexual
assault and gross indecency.  Although consent was irrelevant by
virtue of the ages of the complainants, s.265(3)(d) was
considered. Arkell C.C. J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is abundantly clear from the evidence that the
          Accused,  with  the  authority as  their  teacher,
          manipulated the complainants as his students,  and
          they  were  subject  to his direction.   [Emphasis
          added]</pre>
    <pre>[71] Arkell C.C.J. then discussed s.43 of the Criminal Code,
which is quoted in paragraph [62] above, and noted:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This section is an indication of the position  and
          authority held by a school teacher.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 6th Edition, the
          definition  of  force  there  refers  to  strength
          exerted on a person by coercion or compulsion.  It
          refers  to  mental  or moral strength,  influence,
          controlling   power,  efficacy,   and   power   to
          convince.   The  definition  as  a  verb   is   to
          constrain,  compel,  to compel  a  person  to  act
          prematurely or adopt a policy unwillingly.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Here  the  Accused, as a teacher,  by  his  subtle
          threats, had the potential to put into effect, his
          authority   either  through  fear   or   coercion,
          intimidation  or  direct  compulsion.   From   his
          exercise of authority these boys were required  to
          perform   the   sexual  acts   of   fellatio   and
          masturbation  upon him.  To submit that  this  was
          consensual sexual activity by the students is  not
          valid  since  no  consent can be obtained  by  the
          exercise of authority.  The Accused had the power,
          or  right, to enforce obedience as a teacher,  and
          the power to influence the conduct and actions  of
          the students.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[72] The conviction in Cadden was affirmed by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal [(1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 122].  The
issues in that court dealt with what constituted an assault and
did not touch upon the matter of authority.
[73] In R. v. S. (C.E.) (1988), 84 N.S.R. (2d) 30 (Co. Ct.), the
accused was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl
who was, by virtue of a common law relationship, his
stepdaughter.  The court found that she submitted to the sexual
activity in question by reason of &#147;the exercise of authority&#148; by
the accused.  The trial judge said at pp. 33-34:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  find  that  the accused was in  a  position  of
          authority with respect to the complainant.  As she
          said  in  her evidence the accused was the  father
          figure  in  the  home.  He was the father  of  her
          little   sister  and  she  regarded  him  as   her
          stepfather.  She had been informed that since  she
          was  living  in his home she had to  live  by  his
          rules.   The  accused  exercised  discipline   and
          control over her.  Clearly the accused was in loco
          parentis with respect to the complainant.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  final  question  is whether  the  complainant
          submitted  to the sexual acts as a result  of  the
          exercise of authority by the accused?
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  my view&#133;the persistence of the accused in  his
          requests  to this young girl of fifteen years  for
          sexual   favours  and  his  continuing  to   apply
          pressure to her while demonstrating anger,  for  a
          period  of ten to fifteen minutes in circumstances
          where  she  had virtually no means of  escape  and
          where  no other alternatives were apparently  open
          to  her  and her being fearful of the consequences
          of  refusing,  amounted  to  an  exercise  of  the
          accused&#146;s  parental authority, which  resulted  in
          the complainant submitting to the sexual act.   In
          these  circumstances I find that  no  consent  was
          obtained  because  the  complainant  submitted  by
          reason,  of  the  exercise  of  authority  by  the
          accused within the meaning of section 244(3)(d) of
          the Criminal Code.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[74] On appeal, the conviction was set aside and a new trial
ordered on the admission of fresh evidence in which the
complainant said she had really consented but refused to swear an
affidavit to that effect.
[75] It should be noted that in R. v. S. (C.E.) the trial judge
followed the analysis suggested in Watt&#146;s commentary.
[76] In R. v. Tremblay, [1988] O.J. No. 2436 (Prov. Ct.) (QL
Systems), the charge was sexual assault by a &#147;boss&#148; or purported
&#147;boss&#148;.  The accused told the complainant, a fellow employee,
that when he became owner of the firm in October, there would be
layoffs, but he would fire girls other than her.  The trial judge
found that the accused was not in fact the &#147;boss&#148; of the
complainant.  However, the trial judge also found that the
complainant believed the accused was her boss and had engaged in
sexual activity with him as a direct consequence of this belief.
The trial judge went on to deal with the question of a purported
&#147;boss&#148; and concluded that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  accused  assumed  the  mantle  of  authority,
          exercised  it improperly for his illicit purposes,
          and thus, he cannot now set up his actual lack  of
          authority  as  a  defence, on these  facts  he  is
          guilty.</pre>
    <pre>[77] In R. v.  Singh, [1992] O.J. No. 219 (C.A.) (QL Systems),
this court dismissed a Crown appeal as to sentence.  The brief
report of this case indicates that the respondent doctor pleaded
guilty to six counts of indecent assault and ten counts of sexual
assault involving brief touching of his female patients on their
breasts through their clothing.  The endorsement of this court
states in part that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  respondent&#146;s  authority as a  medical  doctor
          constituted an abuse of his position of  authority
          as  a  medical doctor and, in some cases, a  gross
          breach of trust.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>No issue appears to have been raised as to whether or not the
respondent was in a position of authority with respect to the
complainants.</pre>
    <pre>[78] In R. v. Levandier, [1992] N.S.J. No. 593 (Co. Ct.) (QL
Systems), a police officer was charged with the sexual assault of
a young civilian.  It was argued by the prosecution that any
consent was vitiated by the use of force, threats, fraud or the
exercise of authority.  The trial judge concluded on the facts
that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The only possible obtaining of consent through one
          of  those  enumerated  factors,  is  the  possible
          exercise of authority.
          </pre>
    <pre>          There  is  no evidence before this court that  the
          accused exercised his authority as a Peace Officer
          in  order  to have the complainant remain  in  the
          police  vehicle or engage in the conduct which  is
          the subject matter of these charges.</pre>
    <pre>In the result, the charges were dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[79] Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226 is a closely related
civil matter in which a medical doctor exchanged prescriptions
for drugs to which his patient was addicted, for sex.  The action
for damages against Wynrib on the grounds of sexual assault,
negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract was
dismissed at trial.  The dismissal was affirmed by the majority
in the British Columbia Court of Appeal upon the ground ex turpi
causa non oritur actio.  The Supreme Court of Canada was also
divided in its reasoning.  On the issue of sexual assault, La
Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ. decided that the plaintiff&#146;s
consent was vitiated by the imbalance of power between doctor and
patient, her vulnerability and his exploitation of that
vulnerability.  L&#146;Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ. declared the
doctor/patient relationship to be fiduciary and that the action
lay for breach of that relationship, in this case, by the doctor.
Sopinka J. held that while her consent to sexual activity was not
vitiated by the circumstances, fairness or the doctrine of
unconscionability required that the transaction be set aside.
His approach was to acknowledge the validity of the consent but
to go on to consider the doctor&#146;s conduct in the light of his
professional duty to his patient.
[80] La Forest J. spoke for a plurality on the subject of
consent.  After dealing at length with consent in the context of
an imbalance of power between the parties involved in tort and in
contract, he went on to consider the same factors in the criminal
field starting at pp. 250-51:
          </pre>
    <pre>          There  is some support in the criminal law for  an
          approach  that  takes  into account  the  relative
          positions  of the parties.  This can be seen  from
          the definition of assault, which includes assault,
          sexual assault, under s. 265 of the Criminal Code,
          R.S.C., 1985, c.C-46.</pre>
    <pre>[81] After reproducing s. 265, La Forest J. commented on the
concept of &#147;authority&#148; as a basis for vitiating consent under s.
265(3)(d).  Specifically, he said at p. 252:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The general notion of submission to an &#147;authority&#148;
          figure  indicates an inequality of  power  between
          the  parties  such that the existence  of  genuine
          consent  is  questionable.  Section 265(3)  is  an
          expression   of   the   fact   that   in   certain
          circumstances,  considerations  of  public  policy
          will  negate  the legal validity of consent  as  a
          defence to a charge of assault.</pre>
    <pre>[82] La Forest J. proceeded to consider the cases of W.(B.) v.
Mellor, [1989] B.C.J. No. 1393 (S.C.) (QL Systems) and Lyth v.
Dagg (1988), 56 C.C.L.T. 25 (B.C.S.C.) in which the defence of
consent was rejected where sexual relations took place in the
context of an unequal power relationship, in the former case
between a doctor and his patient and in the latter case between a
teacher and his 15-year-old student.  In both cases, the ability
to dominate and influence was equated with the existence of an
unequal power relationship.  La Forest J. discussed these
concepts as indices of power at pp. 255-56:
          </pre>
    <pre>          An  ability  to  &#147;dominate and influence&#148;  is  not
          restricted  to  the student-teacher  relationship.
          Professor  Coleman outlines a number of situations
          which  she calls &#147;power dependency&#148; relationships:
          see    Coleman,    &#147;Sex   in   Power    Dependency
          Relationships:   Taking Unfair  Advantage  of  the
          &#145;Fair&#146;  Sex&#148; (1988), 53 Alb. L. Rev. 95.  Included
          in    these    relationships   are   parent-child,
          psychotherapist-patient, physician-patient, clergy-
          patient,  professor-student, attorney-client,  and
          employer-employee.  She asserts that &#147;consent&#148;  to
          a  sexual  relationship in such  relationships  is
          inherently suspect.  She notes, at p.96:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The   common   element  in  power  dependency
               relationships  is an underlying  personal  or
               professional  association  which  creates   a
               significant   power  imbalance  between   the
               parties.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Exploitation   occurs  when  the   &#147;powerful&#148;
               person  abuses the position of  authority  by
               inducing the &#147;dependent&#148; person into a sexual
               relationship, thereby causing harm.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          If the type of sexual relationship at issue is one
          that  is  sufficiently  divergent  from  community
          standards of conduct, this may alert the court  to
          the possibility of exploitation. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[83] La Forest J. then considered whether consent was vitiated in
the case under consideration at pp. 256-61:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  trial judge held that the appellant&#146;s implied
          consent to the sexual activity was voluntary.  Dr.
          Wynrib,  he  stated, exercised neither  force  nor
          threats  of force and the appellant&#146;s capacity  to
          consent  was  not impaired by her drug  use.   The
          Court   of   Appeal  agreed  that  the   appellant
          voluntarily  engaged  in  the  sexual  encounters.
          However,  it  must be asked if the  appellant  was
          truly  in  a  position to make a free choice.   It
          seems   clear  to  me  that  there  was  a  marked
          inequality  in  the  respective  powers   of   the
          parties.  The appellant was a young woman  with  a
          limited   education.   More  important,  she   was
          addicted  to  the  heavy use of tranquilizers  and
          painkillers.  On this ground alone it can be  said
          that  there  was an inequality in the position  of
          the  parties arising out of the appellant&#146;s  need.
          The  appellant&#146;s  drug dependence  diminished  her
          ability  to make a real choice.  Although she  did
          not  wish  to engage in sexual activity  with  Dr.
          Wynrib,  her  reluctance was  overwhelmed  by  the
          driving  force of her addiction and the unsettling
          prospect   of  a  painful,  unsupervised  chemical
          withdrawal.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          On  the other side of the equation was an elderly,
          male  professional &#150; the appellant&#146;s  doctor.   An
          unequal distribution of power is frequently a part
          of  the  doctor-patient relationship.   As  it  is
          stated  in The Final Report of the Task  Force  on
          Sexual  Abuse  of  Patients, An  Independent  Task
          Force  Commissioned by The College  of  Physicians
          and   Surgeons  of  Ontario  (November  25,  1991)
          (Chair:  Marilou McPhedran), at p. 11:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Patients  seek the help of doctors when  they
               are  in  a  vulnerable state &#150; when they  are
               sick,  when  they are needy,  when  they  are
               uncertain about what needs to be done.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The  unequal  distribution of  power  in  the
               physician-patient     relationship      makes
               opportunities  for  sexual exploitation  more
               possible  than in other relationships.   This
               vulnerability gives physicians the  power  to
               exact  sexual compliance.  Physical force  or
               weapons   are   not  necessary  because   the
               physician&#146;s  power  comes  from  having   the
               knowledge and being trusted by patients.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  this  case, Dr. Wynrib knew that the appellant
          was  vulnerable  and driven by her compulsion  for
          drugs.   It  is likely that he knew  or  at  least
          strongly  suspected  that she was  dependant  upon
          Fiorinal before she admitted her addiction to him.
          It  was  he who ferreted out that she was addicted
          to drugs.  As a doctor, the respondent knew how to
          assist  the  appellant medically and he  knew  (or
          should have known) that she could not &#147;just  quit&#148;
          taking drugs without treatment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  respondent&#146;s medical knowledge and  knowledge
          of  the  appellant&#146;s addiction, combined with  his
          authority to prescribe drugs, gave him power  over
          her.   It  was  he who suggested the sex-for-drugs
          arrangement.
          </pre>
    <pre>          However,  it  must  still be asked  if  there  was
          exploitation.   In  my  opinion  there  was.   Dr.
          Herbert  of  the  Department of  Family  Practice,
          Faculty   of   Medicine,  University  of   British
          Columbia, expressed the opinion that &#147;a reasonable
          practitioner would have taken steps to attempt  to
          help  Ms.  Norberg  end  her  addiction  by,   for
          example, suggesting drug counselling, or,  at  the
          very least, by discontinuing her prescriptions  of
          Fiorinal&#148;.   However, Dr. Wynrib did not  use  his
          medical  knowledge and expertise  to  address  the
          appellant&#146;s  addiction.  Instead,  he  abused  his
          power  over  her and exploited the information  he
          obtained concerning her weakness to pursue his own
          personal interests.  It seems to me that a sex-for-
          drugs  arrangement initiated by a doctor with  his
          drug  addict  patient is a relationship  which  is
          divergent  from what the community would  consider
          acceptable.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          There  is  also  a body of opinion  which  regards
          sexual  contact in any doctor-patient relationship
          as exploitative.  In the opinion of the Task Force
          on Sexual Abuse of Patients, supra, at p.12:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Due  to  the position of power the  physician
               brings  to  the  doctor-patient relationship,
               there  are NO circumstances &#150; NONE &#150; in which
               sexual  activity  between a physician  and  a
               patient   is  acceptable.   Sexual   activity
               between   a  patient  and  a  doctor   ALWAYS
               represents sexual abuse, regardless  of  what
               rationalization or belief system  the  doctor
               chooses to use to excuse it.  Doctors need to
               recognize  that they have power  and  status,
               and  that  there may be times when a  patient
               will test the boundaries between them.  It is
               ALWAYS  the doctor&#146;s responsibility  to  know
               what  is  appropriate and never to cross  the
               line into sexual activity.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Indeed, the Hippocratic Oath indicates that sexual
          contact between a doctor and his or her patient is
          fundamentally improper:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In  every  house where I come I  will  enter
               only  for  the good of my patients,  keeping
               myself  far  from all intentional  ill-doing
               and   seduction,  and  especially  from  the
               pleasures of love with women or with men, be
               they free or slaves.

    <pre>               (Dorland&#146;s   Illustrated  Medical  Dictionary
               (27th ed. 1988), at p.768.)
          </pre>
    <pre>          These observations were directed at the regulation
          of  the  doctor-patient relationship, rather  than
          civil  liability  and I need  not  consider  their
          precise  implications in the latter context.   For
          we are not here dealing with just a doctor-patient
          relationship    but    a    doctor-drug     addict
          relationship,  and  it  was  not  just  a   sexual
          relationship  but  a  sex-for-drugs  relationship.
          These  circumstances suggest that the  appellant&#146;s
          consent  was not genuine for the purposes  of  the
          law.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          To  summarize, in my view, the defence of  consent
          cannot succeed in the circumstances of this  case.
          The appellant had a medical problem &#150; an addiction
          to  Fiorinal.   Dr.  Wynrib had knowledge  of  the
          problem.   As  a doctor, he had knowledge  of  the
          proper   medical  treatment,  and  knew  she   was
          motivated  by her craving for drugs.   Instead  of
          fulfilling  his  professional  responsibility   to
          treat  the  appellant,  he  used  his  power   and
          expertise  to  his  own  advantage  and   to   her
          detriment.   In  my  opinion,  the  unequal  power
          between the parties and the exploitative nature of
          the  relationship removed the possibility  of  the
          appellant&#146;s  providing meaningful consent  to  the
          sexual contact.</pre>
    <pre>[84] In Norberg, La Forest J. speaks of the power imbalance
between doctor and patient and of her vulnerability, but not of
his authority over her or of the exercise of any such authority.
[85] The discussion in Norberg was followed almost a year and one-
half later by the decision of the Supreme Court in R. v.
Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333.  Litchfield was a medical doctor
charged with sexual assault on his patients.  The issues before
the Supreme Court of Canada were procedural in nature but in the
process of approaching them, Iacobucci J., speaking for the
court, said the following at pp. 343-46:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Before  directly discussing the issues  raised  in
          this  appeal, I think it is important to  keep  in
          mind  the nature of the offence of sexual  assault
          as  well  as  the  specific manifestation  of  the
          alleged   sexual   assaults  in  a  doctor-patient
          relationship.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The importance of looking to all the circumstances
          surrounding  an  accused&#146;s  impugned  conduct   is
          thrown  into relief by a case such as  that  under
          consideration  in  this appeal,  where  a  doctor-
          patient  relationship  is  concerned.   Certainly,
          medical  evidence will be important  to  assessing
          the  nature  of  an  accused physician&#146;s  conduct.
          However, when determining whether a complainant in
          fact consented to that which occurred, courts must
          also ensure that they neither ignore the testimony
          of  a patient who complains of sexual assault  nor
          underestimate  the  position of  vulnerability  in
          which a patient often finds herself when she is in
          the care of a professional medical doctor.  All of
          the  opinions  in the judgment of  this  Court  in
          Norberg  v. Wynrib, [citation omitted], recognized
          the  imbalance of power that may occur  between  a
          doctor  and  a  patient where  an  alleged  sexual
          assault is concerned.
          </pre>
    <pre>          La  Forest  J. (Gonthier and Cory JJ.  concurring)
          stated  at  p.258:   &#147;An unequal  distribution  of
          power  is  frequently a part of the doctor-patient
          relationship&#148;.  McLachlin J., who also  wrote  for
          L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J., focused on the fiduciary nature
          of the doctor-patient relationship and wrote at p.
          272:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I  think  it  is  readily apparent  that  the
               doctor-patient   relationship   shares    the
               peculiar    hallmark   of    the    fiduciary
               relationship &#150; trust, the trust of  a  person
               with  inferior power that another person  who
               has assumed superior power and responsibility
               will  exercise that power for his or her good
               and  only for his or her good and in  his  or
               her best interests.
     </pre>
    <pre>          Thus the nature of a complainant&#146;s relationship to
          her  alleged  assaulter, including  the  patient&#146;s
          lack  of  power  and  knowledge  as  well  as  the
          doctor&#146;s duty to perform medical examinations only
          for  the  good of the patient and in the patient&#146;s
          best   interest,  must  be  kept  in   mind   when
          determining whether the patient in fact  consented
          to the conduct in question.</pre>
    <pre>[86] The decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Saint-
Laurent (1993), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 291 (Que. C.A.) was released a
month after Litchfield.  Saint-Laurent was a psychiatrist charged
with sexual assault of two of his female patients.  The
circumstances were much like those in the instant case.  The
issue was with respect to the validity of the consent given by
the patients - was it procured by fraud (s.265(3)(c)) or by the
exercise of authority (s.265(3)(d)) or was it genuine?
[87] The decision of the preliminary inquiry magistrate did not
make it clear upon which subsection the committal order was made.
The accused attacked the committal by way of certiorari.  The
Superior Court concluded that there was evidence on which a jury
could find that the consent of the two patients had been obtained
as a result of the exercise of authority or by fraud.
[88] This decision was appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal.
Its decision was divided.  Beauregard J.A. would have allowed the
appeal and set aside the committal.  Tourigny and Fish JJ.A.
dismissed the appeal and allowed the matter to proceed.  In
reaching opposite conclusions, the dissent and the majority
ascribed different meanings to &#147;authority&#148; as it appears in s.
265(3)(d).  Beauregard J.A. adopted the first dictionary
definition of &#147;authority&#148; and that advanced by the appellant as
the &#147;power or right to enforce obedience&#148;.  Fish J.A. defined
authority as the &#147;power to influence the conduct and actions of
others&#148;; the fourth meaning ascribed by the dictionary and that
argued by the respondent in the instant appeal.   Tourigny J.A.
did not accept Beauregard J.A.&#146;s approach and concurred with Fish
J.A. in dismissing the appeal.
[89] In dissenting, Beauregard J.A. took a narrow view of the
meaning of &#147;authority&#148; in s. 265(3)(d).  At pp. 294-95 he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  my  humble  view,  the  person  who  exercises
          authority within the meaning of s. 265(3)  of  the
          Criminal  Code is one who has the right  to  issue
          orders  and  to enforce their obedience&#133;[F]or  the
          purposes  of  s.265(3), it is not sufficient  that
          the  person  be in a position of trust toward  the
          other  person; the person must exercise authority,
          that  is  a  right to issue orders and to  enforce
          obedience to the orders.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Furthermore, in the present case, the evidence  of
          the appellant&#146;s patients is not to the effect that
          he was a person in authority whom they had to obey
          failing  which they could be punished;  they  only
          complained that the appellant abused the  position
          that he had over them, especially having regard to
          the phenomenon of transference.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[90] In her reasons, Tourigny J.A. reviewed  the decision in
Norberg at length.  She also made brief reference to s.153 of the
Criminal Code,  which deals with the exploitation of &#147;position of
authority&#148;.  At p. 304, she said:  &#147;It [s.153] concerns persons
who exercise a form of authority, like the one considered by the
Supreme Court in Norberg.&#148;
[91] Fish J.A. rejected Beauregard J.A.&#146;s interpretation of
&#147;authority&#148; in favour of a broader meaning at pp. 309:
          </pre>
    <pre>          With  respect, however, I am unable to  adopt  the
          restrictive   interpretation   favoured   by    my
          colleague.   On a plain reading, &#147;authority&#148;  does
          not  signify the legal right to command obedience.
          The context of s. 265 of the Criminal Code is more
          hospitable, in my view, to a broader construction.</pre>
    <pre>[92] He then quoted Prof. Boyle&#146;s comments on the meaning of
&#147;authority&#148; in the context of sexual assault, as outlined in
paragraph [64] above.  Fish J.A. continued at pp. 310-14:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This  was not intended to suggest, I am sure, that
          judges are entitled to stretch the plain words  of
          the  statute so as to extend its reach beyond  the
          evil  contemplated by Parliament, or, in cases  of
          doubt,   to   construe   an  ambiguous   provision
          adversely  to  the  accused.   The  point   as   I
          understand it was, rather, that &#147;authority&#148;,  even
          considered  literally, bears a broad  meaning;  s.
          265(3)(d) may, therefore, be interpreted liberally
          without  doing  violence  either  to  its  express
          language or to its evident purpose.
          </pre>
    <pre>          This   is  precisely  the  approach  mandated   by
          Parliament  itself  in  the  Interpretation   Act,
          R.S.C. 1985, c.I-21:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    12.  Every enactment is deemed remedial,
                    and  shall be given such fair, large and
                    liberal  construction and interpretation
                    as  best ensures the attainment  of  its
                    objects.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  need  hardly add that a fair, large and liberal
          construction  of  the  word  &#147;authority&#148;   in   s.
          265(3)(d)  implies no relaxation of the principles
          of fundamental justice that protect every accused,
          including  doctors,  charged in  Canada  with  any
          crime, including sexual assault.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Returning,  then to the meaning of &#147;authority&#148;  in
          s.  265(3)(d) of the Criminal Code, it seems to me
          that  the  purpose  of the law in  this  area  has
          always   been  to  criminalize  a  coerced  sexual
          relationship.  Mutual agreement is a safeguard  of
          sexual  integrity imposed by the state  under  the
          threat  of  penal  sanction.  In  the  absence  of
          consent,  an act of sex is, at least prima  facie,
          an act of assault.
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  a  matter both of language and of law, consent
          implies  a  reasonably  informed  choice,   freely
          exercised.   No  such  choice has  been  exercised
          where  a  person engages in sexual activity  as  a
          result of fraud, force, fear, or violence.  Nor is
          the  consent requirement satisfied if, because  of
          his  or  her  mental state, one of the parties  is
          incapable  of understanding the sexual  nature  of
          the act, or of realizing that he or she may choose
          to decline participation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#147;Consent&#148;  is,  thus  stripped  of  its   defining
          characteristics  when  it  is   applied   to   the
          submission, non-resistance, non-objection, or even
          the apparent agreement, of a deceived, unconscious
          or  compelled will.  Putting the matter  this  way
          emphasizes   the   difficulty  of  distinguishing,
          otherwise than by reference to vitiating  factors,
          between &#147;consent&#148; and &#147;non-consent&#148; in relation to
          the  offence  of assault (see Glanville  Williams,
          Textbook  of  Criminal Law (2d ed., 1983),  p.550;
          Alan W. Bryant, &#147;The Issue of Consent in the Crime
          of  Sexual Assault&#148;, (1989) 68 Can. Bar Rev. 94 at
          p.105).
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  I mentioned earlier, Beauregard J.A. takes the
          view    that   &#147;authority&#148;,   in   this   context,
          necessarily denotes a right to issue orders and to
          enforce their obedience.  Tourigny J.A. points out
          that  the Supreme Court of Canada appears to  have
          adopted a much broader interpretation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Neither  of  my  colleagues, when  they  expressed
          these  views,  had  the  benefit  of  taking  into
          account  the  very recent judgment of the  Supreme
          Court  of  Canada  in  R. v.  Litchfield  not  yet
          reported, (citations omitted).
          </pre>
    <pre>          Dr.  Litchfield, a family physician practising  in
          Edmonton,  was alleged to have sexually  assaulted
          seven of his patients while examining them at  his
          office.   Unlike the present matter, the existence
          of an assault depended in that case on whether the
          physical  acts  of  the  accused  were  sexual  or
          medical  in  nature.  The meaning of &#147;exercise  of
          authority&#148; was, therefore, not really in issue.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  may  be  for  this reason that  Iacobucci  J.,
          writing  for  the  court on the  issue  of  sexual
          assault,   included   as  a   relevant   statutory
          provision  para.  (c) of s. 265(3)  of  the  Code,
          which  deals with fraud, but excluded  para.  (d),
          which   concerns   the  exercise   of   authority.
          Alternatively, he may have sought to underline the
          impact  of  a material imbalance of power  on  the
          legal effectiveness of consent independently of s.
          265(3)(d).
          </pre>
    <pre>          On  any  view of the matter, I think it can fairly
          be said that Litchfield incorporates as an element
          of  its ratio a judicial policy that binds  us  in
          this case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          To   begin  with,  Litchfield  removes  any  doubt
          concerning the relevance of much that was said  in
          Norberg, supra, to the crime of sexual assault  as
          opposed  to  a  civil claim in damages.   I  refer
          particularly  to  the  effect  on  consent  of   a
          significant  power imbalance between  the  alleged
          offender and the complainant, and to the impact in
          this  context  of  a  fiduciary or  doctor-patient
          relationship.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Thus,  setting out the framework for his  analysis
          of the issues in Litchfield, Iacobucci J. found it
          &#147;important  to  keep in mind  the  nature  of  the
          offence  of sexual assault as well as the specific
          manifestation of the alleged sexual assaults in  a
          doctor-patient relationship&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[93] Fish J.A. extensively quoted from Iacobucci J.&#146;s reasons in
Litchfield, which are set out at paragraph [85] above.  He then
continued to quote the following from Iacobucci&#146;s reason, at
p.314:
          </pre>
    <pre>               As  Sopinka J. wrote in Norberg, at pp.474-5,
               in the context of tortious sexual battery:
          </pre>
    <pre>                           &#147;In  assessing  the  reality   of
                    consent and the existence and impact  of
                    any of the factors that tend to negative
                    true consent, it is important to take  a
                    contextually  sensitive  approach.    In
                    relation to medical procedures,  several
                    courts  have  emphasized  the  need   to
                    consider    all   relevant   surrounding
                    circumstances in assessing whether there
                    was valid consent&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                         &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                          &#147;Certain relationships, especially
                    those  in  which there is a  significant
                    imbalance in power or those involving  a
                    high degree of trust and confidence  may
                    require   the  trier  of  fact   to   be
                    particularly  careful in  assessing  the
                    reality of consent&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In   reproducing  this  extensive   passage   from
          Litchfield,  I  am  mindful,  I  repeat,  of   the
          difference  between that case and  this  one.   In
          Litchfield,  the dispute centred  on  whether  the
          contact  between patient and physician was medical
          or  sexual.  Here, the acts in question were of an
          overtly sexual character.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Moreover,  in Litchfield, there was no consent  at
          all &#150; real or apparent, valid or vitiated - to any
          contact for sexual purposes.   Here, according  to
          the  evidence  as  we  have it,  the  complainants
          engaged  with  the appellant in manifestly  sexual
          relations on an apparently consensual basis.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  case  for  the prosecution is that  appellant
          committed  the offences charged by exercising  his
          imputed authority over his two named patients in a
          way that deliberately induced them to &#147;submit&#148; to,
          or   &#147;non-resist&#148;,  sexual  relations  with   him.
          Subsidiarily, the prosecution alleges fraud.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Even  in  relation to this subsidiary  allegation,
          the   prosecution  does  not  claim  that   either
          complainant was unaware of the sexual character of
          these  acts.   At best, the issue is whether  they
          were  induced  to engage in sexual  conduct  by  a
          representation as to its therapeutic value.</pre>
    <pre>[94] The matter before the Quebec Court of Appeal was whether
there was an error in the lower court&#146;s failure to grant
certiorari.  Therefore, as Fish J.A. explained, the outcome of
the appeal depended on the governing principles of law and of
jurisdiction and on the evidence of the record before the court.
[95] Fish J.A. went on to review in some detail the evidence
given on the preliminary hearing.  The burden of that evidence
was that the two complainants were completely in the control of
their doctor.  Having acknowledged that the references provided
were not intended to give a balanced overview of the entire
record at the preliminary inquiry, Fish J.A. concluded as follows
at pp. 317-18:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Our  role  on this appeal, however is to determine
          whether   there  is  any  basis  upon  which   the
          appellant  could be committed to trial for  having
          sexually  assaulted his former patients  V.L.  and
          J.A.   In  my view, the evidence to which  I  have
          referred did provide that basis.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  stating  this conclusion, I repeat once  again
          that  the  question before us is not  whether  the
          evidence is sufficient for committal, but  whether
          it  provides  a rational basis for the  conclusion
          reached by the justice who presided at preliminary
          inquiry.   I need hardly add that this is  not  an
          appeal  against  that  judgment  &#150;  the  committal
          itself  is  not appealable &#150; but rather an  appeal
          against the judgment of the Superior Court denying
          certiorari.
          </pre>
    <pre>          For  the  reasons  stated, I  believe  the  appeal
          fails.</pre>
    <pre>Leave to appeal from the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada was refused on May 5, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>[96] The inference I draw from the reasons of Fish J.A. is that
whether a doctor generally has &#147;authority&#148; for the purposes of s.
265(3)(d) with respect to his or her patients is not relevant.
What is relevant is whether the particular relationship has,
rightly or wrongly, vested him or her with the ability to control
the lives of patients in such a manner as to be able to extract
their agreement to sexual activity.  In short, as expressed by
Fish J.A., the concern addressed in s. 265(3)(d) is the reality
of consent rather than the nominal nature of the relationship of
the parties.
[97] More recent is the decision in R. v. Audet, [1996] 2 S.C.R.
171 concerning a charge of sexual exploitation against a high
school teacher under s. 153(1) of the Code.  That section reads
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          153       (1)   Every person who is in a  position
                    of  trust or authority towards  a  young
                    person  or  is  a person with  whom  the
                    young  person  is  in a relationship  of
                    dependency and who
          </pre>
    <pre>                               (a)   for  a sexual  purpose,
                         touches,  directly  or  indirectly,
                         with a part of the body or with  an
                         object, any part of the body of the
                         young person, or
          </pre>
    <pre>                               (b)   for  a sexual purposes,
                         invites,  counsels  or  incites   a
                         young person to touch, directly  or
                         indirectly, with a part of the body
                         or  with an object, the body of any
                         person, including the body  of  the
                         person who so invites, counsels  or
                         incites  and the body of the  young
                         person,
          </pre>
    <pre>                          is guilty of an indictable offence
                    and  liable to imprisonment for  a  term
                    not exceeding five years or is guilty of
                    an   offence   punishable   on   summary
                    conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[98] The female complainant was 14 years of age at the time of
the incident and the teacher was 22.  He had taught her during
the school year immediately prior to the events complained of
which occurred during the summer in non-school circumstances.
The trial judge granted an acquittal upon the ground that the
teacher was not in a position of trust or authority with respect
to the complainant at the time of the incident.
[99] The Crown&#146;s appeal to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal was
dismissed.  Ayles J.A., dissenting, was of the opinion that the
complainant&#146;s consent to the acts in question was irrelevant in
the context of a charge of sexual exploitation and that the
courts have consistently held that the Crown need not establish
any nexus between the person&#146;s position and the alleged sexual
activity.
[100]     When appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, there was
another split.  The majority was of the view that by reason of
the language of s. 153(1) that all that was required was proof
that:
     (a)  the complainant was a young person within the meaning of
     s.153(2);
     (b)  the accused engaged in one of the activities referred to in
     s.153(1); and
     (c)  at the time the acts in question were committed, the accused
     was either:
          (i)  in a position of trust; or
          (ii) in a position of authority with respect to the young person; or
          (iii)the young person was in a relationship of dependency
               with the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[101]     Consent was irrelevant by virtue of s.150.1(1).  It
reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          150.1   (1)   Where an accused is charged with  an
                  offence  under s. 151 or 152 or subsection
                  153(1),  160(3) or 173(2)  or  is  charged
                  with an offence under section 271, 272  or
                  273  in respect of a complainant under the
                  age  of  fourteen  years,  it  is  not   a
                  defence that the complainant consented  to
                  the   activity  that  forms  the  subject-
                  matter of the charge.</pre>
    <pre>[102]     The Crown did not need to prove that the accused abused
or exploited his position.  That was inherent, by virtue of s.
153, when the three matters listed above (a, b and c) were
established.  These matters had been established at trial.
Accordingly, the appeal was allowed, the acquittal set aside and
a conviction entered.
[103]          Audet is of interest to the present appeal as it
concerned s. 153 of the Criminal Code which contains the
expressions &#147;position of trust&#148; and &#147;position of authority&#148;.  La
Forest J. discussed the meaning of these expressions at pp. 193-
94 as follows:</pre>
    <pre>           (a)  &#147;Position  of Authority&#148;  and  &#147;Position  of Trust&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The courts have had little to say on a theoretical
          level  about the scope of these expressions, which
          are  nowhere defined in the Criminal Code.  Proulx
          J.A.  wrote  the following about the &#147;position  of
          authority&#148; concept in Léon, supra, at p.483:
               </pre>
    <pre>               [TRANSLATION]  In  its primary  meaning,  the
               notion  of  authority stems from the  adult&#146;s
               role in relation to the young person, but  it
               will  be  agreed that in the context of  this
               statutory provision, to be in a &#147;position  of
               authority&#148;  does not necessarily entail  just
               the  exercise of a legal right over the young
               person,  but also a lawful or unlawful  power
               to command which the adult may acquire in the
               circumstances.
          </pre>
    <pre>          For  his part, Blair J. made the following comment
          in R. v. S.(P.) [(1993), 19 W.C.B. (2d) 256.]:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;  [a  position of authority] invokes notions
               of  power  and the ability to hold  in  one&#146;s
               hands the future or destiny of the person who
               is   the  object  of  the  exercise  of   the
               authority&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Finally,  Blair  J.,  also in  S.(P.),  wrote  the
          following about the term &#147;position of trust&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>               One  needs  to keep in mind that what  is  in
               question  is not the specialized  concept  of
               the law of equity, called a &#147;trust&#148;.  What is
               in  question is a broader social or  societal
               relationship between two people, an adult and
               a  young person.  &#147;Trust&#148;, according  to  the
               Concise  Oxford  Dictionary  (8th  ed.),   is
               simply  &#147;a firm belief in the reliability  or
               truth  or  strength of a person&#148;.  Where  the
               nature  of the relationship between an  adult
               and a young person is such that it creates an
               opportunity  for  all of the  persuasive  and
               influencing  factors which adults  hold  over
               children and young persons to come into play,
               and the child or young person is particularly
               vulnerable to the sway of these factors,  the
               adult  is  in a position where those concepts
               of reliability and truth and strength are put
               to  the  test.  Taken together, all of  these
               factors  combine  to create  a  &#147;position  of
               trust&#148;  towards the young person.   [Emphasis
               by La Forest J.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  the  absence  of  statutory  definitions,  the
          process  of  interpretation  must  begin  with   a
          consideration of the ordinary meaning of the words
          used  by Parliament.  Le Grand Robert de la langue
          francaise, 2nd ed. (1986), defines the French word
          &#147;autorité&#148; as a [TRANSLATION] &#147;[r]ight to command,
          power  (recognized  or  unrecognized)  to  enforce
          obedience&#148;, which is, at least in substance, quite
          similar to the definition proposed by Proulx  J.A.
          It  adds  that  another meaning of  &#147;autorité&#148;  is
          [TRANSLATION]   &#147;[s]uperiority   of    merit    or
          seductiveness     that    compels    unconstrained
          obedience,  respect, trust&#148;.  The  Oxford  English
          Dictionary,  2nd  ed.  (1989),  suggests   similar
          definitions  for  the  English  word  &#147;authority&#148;:
          &#147;power or right to enforce obedience&#148; and &#147;[p]ower
          to  influence the conduct and actions of  others&#148;.
          I  am  in complete agreement with Proulx J.A. that
          the meaning of the term must not be restricted  to
          cases in which the relationship of authority stems
          from a role of the accused but must extend to  any
          relationship   in   which  the  accused   actually
          exercises such a power.  As can be seen from these
          definitions,  the  ordinary meaning  of  the  word
          &#147;authority&#148;  or  &#147;autorité&#148;  does  not  permit  so
          restrictive  an  interpretation. Furthermore,  the
          comments  of  Proulx J.A. are entirely appropriate
          in  view  of  the express intention of Parliament,
          which, in declining to include in s.153(1) a  list
          of  the cases in which a person must refrain  from
          sexual  contact with a young person,  intended  to
          direct   the  analysis  to  the  nature   of   the
          relationship  between  the young  person  and  the
          accused rather than to their status in relation to
          each other.   [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[104]     The minority, Major and Sopinka JJ., did not deal with
the scope of &#147;position of authority&#148;.  Rather, they relied on the
finding of the trial judge that Audet was not in a position of
authority at the time of the events.  That finding was supported
by the majority in the Court of Appeal.  The minority in the
Supreme Court of Canada took the position that that finding
should not and could not be disturbed by the Supreme Court of
Canada.
[105]     The comments of the majority with respect to the
meaning of &#147;authority&#148; reject the view of Beauregard J.A. and
support the opinions of Tourigny and Fish JJ.A. in Saint-Laurent.
They also support the conclusion of the trial judge in the
instant case that &#147;authority&#148; is not to be confined to persons
with a &#147;right to command, power (recognized or unrecognized) to
enforce obedience&#148; but rather includes those persons with the
&#147;power to influence the conduct and actions of others&#148;.
[106]     Before leaving this issue, I note that the appellant
relies on s. 273.1 of the Criminal Code as illustrating the
limitations of the phrase &#147;exercise of authority&#148; in s.
265(3)(d).
[107]     Section 273.1 was part of the 1992 amendments to the
Code.  It came into force on August 15, 1992 and is not
applicable to either of these counts.
[108]     The relevant parts of that section are as follows:
    </pre>
    <pre>              273.1     (1)  Subject to subsection (2) and
               subsection 265(3), &#147;consent&#148; means, for the
               purpose of sections 271, 272 and 273, the
               voluntary agreement of the complainant to
               engage in the sexual activity in question.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271,
               272 and 273, where
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  the accused induces the complainant to
                    engage in the activity by abusing a
                    position of trust, power or authority;</pre>
    <pre>[109]     Counsel for the appellant argues that &#147;exercise of
authority&#148; in s. 265(3)(d) is distinct from merely occupying a
position of &#147;trust&#148;, &#147;power&#148; or &#147;authority&#148; in s. 273.1(2)(c).
The appellant maintains that the addition of s. 273.1 has
broadened the scope of criminal conduct.  Accordingly, simply
because the doctor/patient relationship is one of trust involving
an imbalance of power, this does not mean that sexual activity
between doctor/patient will involve an &#147;exercise of authority&#148;
within the meaning of s. 265(3)(d).
[110]     This argument depends upon &#147;authority&#148; being
interpreted as it was by Beauregard J.A. in Saint-Laurent.  As
noted in paragraph [103] above, this interpretation has been
rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada.
[111]     The appellant argued that when interpreting the words
&#147;exercise of authority&#148; this court should apply the rule of
statutory construction that provides that if a penal provision is
reasonably capable of two interpretations, the court should adopt
the interpretation that is most favourable to the accused.  This
rule of strict construction, however, only becomes applicable
when attempts at the interpretation suggested by s. 12 of the
Interpretation Act fail to resolve the uncertainty.
[112]     In R. v. Hasselwander (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 471, Cory
J. set out the principle as follows, at p.478:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Thus,  the  rule  of strict construction  becomes
          applicable  only  when attempts  at  the  neutral
          interpretation   suggested   by   s.12   of   the
          Interpretation  Act still leave reasonable  doubt
          as  to  the meaning or scope of the text  of  the
          statute.  As Professor Côté has pointed out, this
          means  that  even with penal statutes,  the  real
          intention of the legislature must be sought,  and
          the meaning compatible with its goals applied.</pre>
    <pre>[113]     For the reasons above, I am satisfied that the purpose
of s. 265(3)(d) is to criminalize coerced sexual relations rather
than to proscribe sexual relations within specific categories of
relationships.  Viewed in that light, the meaning of s. 265(3)(d)
is clear and there is no need to resort to the restrictive rule
of construction relied upon by the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[114]     Whether or not the appellant had a right to command or
to enforce obedience, he clearly had the power to influence the
conduct and actions of others.  He also, clearly, exercised that
power for his own benefit and interest and against the interests
of his patients X and Y.  Accordingly, I see no merit in this
last ground of appeal and I would dismiss the appeal against
conviction.</pre>
    <pre>SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[115]     On May 12, 1997, the appellant was sentenced to one
year imprisonment on each count to be served consecutively.  At
the time of sentencing, the appellant was 48 years of age.  He
had been married and divorced three times.  He has two children
from his second marriage.
[116]     He did not testify at his trial.
[117]     He pleaded guilty to charges of sexual misconduct
brought by the Ontario Board of Examiners in Psychology and
surrendered his licence to practice as a psychologist.
[118]     Since April 1994, he has resided in Victoria, B.C. with
Dr. Tana Dineen, a licenced psychologist and author.  They run a
bed and breakfast.
[119]     The Crown&#146;s position at trial was that the sentence
should be three years.  The defence position was that a suspended
sentence with probation would be sufficient; or, at most, a
conditional sentence of three to six months should be imposed.
[120]     The trial judge found that &#147;there was a blatant long-
term breach of trust by a highly intelligent and experienced
psychologist regarding two patients, who as a result of his
unprofessional and criminal activity, have suffered harm&#148;.
[121]     He further found that the appellant had a fiduciary
relationship with the victims and he deliberately groomed and
manipulated them to satisfy his lust, knowing that doing so would
harm them.  The trial judge noted that any remorse expressed by
the appellant was for the loss of his licence, not for his
criminal acts.
[122]     The trial judge found that a conditional sentence would
not be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of
sentencing.
[123]     I agree with all of the above conclusions.  The gravity
of the offences demands incarceration.  The extent of the
denunciation required removes a conditional sentence as a
possibility.  I would grant leave to appeal the sentence but
dismiss that appeal.
