    <pre>[1]  The main issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge’s
finding that the respondent had a one-half interest in the
Currell property on the date of the marriage is reasonably
supported by the evidence. In our view, the evidence shows that
the appellant treated the Currell property as jointly owned from
the date of the marriage. The appellant completed both his and
his wife’s income tax returns. These returns show the respondent
to be a 50% owner of the property from the date the parties were
married.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Thus the income and losses on the property were divided
equally between the parties.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We, therefore, think that the trial judge’s finding that the
Currell property was jointly owned on August 8, 1987, the date of
the marriage, is reasonably supported by the evidence.
Accordingly, the trial judge was correct that the appellant was
not entitled to a pre-marital deduction for his equity in the
property. Although the trial judge may not have accurately
calculated the financing on Currell that error is of no
consequence because the appellant is not entitled to a pre-
marital deduction.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant also attacks the allocation of $40,000 equity
in Currell to the respondent. We think it was reasonably open to
the trial judge to make this award in favour of the respondent
and we would not interfere with it.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant further argues that the trial judge’s finding
that the value of the Currell property on the date of the
marriage was $165,000 was unreasonable. We disagree . The trial
judge was not obliged to accept the appraiser’s evidence at face
value, and indeed the appraiser conceded a $165,000 value for
Currell was reasonable if the property was in bad condition on
the date of the marriage. There was some evidence supporting the
poor condition of Currell on that date. Moreover, because as the
trial judge found, the parties each had a 50% interest in the
property on the date of the marriage, the value of the property
on that date is immaterial.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant raised several other issues concerning the
calculation of the equalization payment. In each case, in our
opinion, the trial judge exercised his discretion reasonably on
the evidence and we would not interfere with his discretion.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   It follows that the award of solicitor/client costs at
trial was properly made. Even if leave had been granted to appeal
this award we, find no basis to interfere with it.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  For these reasons the appeal is dismissed, with costs.</pre></td>
