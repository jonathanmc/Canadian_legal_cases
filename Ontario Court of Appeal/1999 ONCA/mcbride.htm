</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals against his conviction for the sexual
touching of a young girl, 3 years of age, contrary to s. 151 of
the Criminal Code. The only evidence of the offence was
introduced in the form of unsworn, out-of-court statements of the
complainant and her sister, aged 5, that were admitted as proof
of the truth of the events described in them.
[2]  We assume, without deciding, that the statements made by the
complainant to her mother and then to her father shortly after
the events in issue were properly admitted by the trial judge
under the principles set out in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531.
The issue that must be decided is whether the trial judge erred
in admitting the statement of the older sister that was made to a
police officer and a social worker on videotape on the day
following the alleged incident. In that statement the older
sister gave a description of events incriminating the appellant
that supported the statements made by her younger sister on the
previous day.
[3]  On a voir dire, the older sister was permitted to testify on
a promise to tell the truth. In response to the initial
questioning she was able to remember many details of the events
on the day in question, but when asked about what happened at the
time the appellant allegedly touched her sister, she repeatedly
said that she did not know.  She also stated that she did not
remember telling the police officer about what had happened.
[4]  The trial was recessed overnight and the next morning before
court began, the older sister was shown a portion of the
videotaped statement. When the examination-in-chief resumed
however, she was still unable to remember the events in issue.
[5]  On application by the Crown, the trial judge ruled that a
two and one-half minute segment of the videotape, during which
the older sister had described the events implicating the
appellant, could be shown to her in the courtroom in order to
determine whether that would refresh or revive her memory. After
viewing this part of the videotape in court, she first said that
what she said on the videotape was true and that was what had
happened. However, on further questioning she made it clear that
she still had no memory of the events that formed the basis of
the charge against the appellant. We are unable to be certain
whether her first answers after reviewing the videotape were
simply referring to what she had just seen or to the fact that at
the time she made the statement, she believed what she had said
to be the truth.
[6]  After the older sister completed her evidence, the issue of
introducing the videotaped statement as evidence was raised for
the first time. In the discussion that followed, the issue was
narrowed to whether the statement should be admitted as past
recollection recorded. There was no further evidence called to
address the factual issues that are relevant to a consideration
of whether the statement was admissible on this basis. After
hearing counsel&#146;s submissions (not transcribed), the trial judge
ruled that the two and one-half minute segment was admissible.
Although in his reasons for admitting the evidence the trial
judge referred to his ruling as being &#147;something analogous to a
Khan or K.G.B.&#148;, the primary basis upon which he admitted the
evidence was past recollection recorded.
[7]  Evidence may be admitted on this basis when a witness is
unable to attest to the truth of a record made at an earlier time
because of a lack of memory if it is established that the witness
had a reliable recollection of the events when the record was
made and if the witness, though having no present memory,
testifies to the honesty and accuracy of the record when it was
made. This exception to the hearsay rule has often been applied
in the case of business records or those types of records that
have a high degree of reliability because they are made in the
course of exercising a duty.
[8]  We have difficulty conceiving that a statement made in
circumstances similar to those in this case should even be
admitted under this evidentiary rule. We observe that in cases
involving sexual assaults on children, the Crown in appropriate
circumstances, may seek to introduce out-of-court statements of
children under the principles set out in Khan or under s. 715.1
of the Criminal Code. However, because of the conclusion we
reach, it is not necessary to decide this issue.
[9]  In our view, the Crown has not established a satisfactory
foundation for admitting the evidence on this basis. The
statement was made the day following the events described. When
it is sought to introduce a record that was not made
contemporaneously to the events described, it is important,
particularly when the witness whose recollection is being
recorded is a young child, to show that there were no intervening
events that may have influenced the reliability of the record.
In this case there was little evidence to alleviate the concern
about what, if anything, occurred before the older sister made
the statement that may have affected the reliability of what she
said in that statement. Moreover, in this case the witness did
not satisfactorily verify the accuracy of the statement. Although
initially, after viewing the videotape, she said the statement
was true, she later said she could not remember what had
happened. She was not asked and did not testify that when she
made the statement she was attempting to be honest and truthful.
In our view, the trial judge erred in admitting the videotaped
statement on the basis of past recollection recorded.
[10] We also point out that, in fairness to the appellant, the
older sister was not cross-examined on the issues that arise in
the context of an issue of past recollection recorded because, at
the time she was testifying, the Crown was only seeking to use
the videotaped statement for the purpose of refreshing her
present memory. At that stage of the voir dire, the Crown was not
seeking to introduce the statement for the proof of the truth of
its contents.
[11] The Crown next argues that the statement could have been
admitted under the principles set out in Khan. Unfortunately, the
evidentiary record is not sufficient to determine whether this
position is sound or not. In Khan, the Supreme Court of Canada
indicated that there are many factors that may be relevant in
determining whether an out-of-court statement of a child is
sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence. These include
matters such as timing, demeanour, the personality of the child,
the intelligence and understanding of the child, and the absence
of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement. As we point
out above, after the Crown first indicated that it was seeking to
introduce the videotaped statement as evidence, there was no
further evidence called on the voir dire. As a result, most of
the factual matters that would be relevant to the issue of
reliability in determining whether the statement could be
admitted under Khan were not canvassed.   We are therefore not
able to say that this statement would necessarily have been
admitted on this basis.
[12] Similarly, we are unable to conclude that on a new trial,
the videotaped statement will necessarily be admitted under the
amendment to s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code, that now permits the
admission of a videotaped statement of a witness under 18 years
of age provided the statement is made within a reasonable time
and the witness, while testifying, adopts the contents of the
videotape. As we have said above, the witness in this case did
not satisfactorily adopt the contents of the videotape in her
evidence. Further, because the videotape was not tendered on the
basis of s. 715.1 at the trial, the defence had no opportunity to
cross-examine or call evidence relating to the applicability of
that section.
[13] Finally, the Crown argued that, in the event we conclude
that the videotaped statement was improperly admitted, this is a
proper case for the application of the curative proviso in s.
686(a)(b)(iii) of the Code. We disagree. In his reasons finding
the appellant guilty, the trial judge used the statement for its
truth and found that it corroborated the unsworn, out-of-court
statements of the complainant. Without the evidence of the older
sister, the only evidence of the offence was that found in the
two unsworn statements of the 3 year old complainant. We are
unable to conclude that the appellant would necessarily have been
convicted on the basis of that evidence alone.
[14] For these reasons the appeal is allowed, the conviction is
quashed and a new trial ordered.</pre></td>
