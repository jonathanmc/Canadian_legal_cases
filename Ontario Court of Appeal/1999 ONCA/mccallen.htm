</pre>
    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   After  a  trial  by  a judge and jury,  the  appellant  was
convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to imprisonment  for  a
term  of two and one-half years.  The appellant seeks a new trial
on the ground that Paisley J., who conducted all of the pre-trial
proceedings in the Ontario Court (General Division) and who  also
presided at the appellant&#146;s trial (the &#147;trial judge&#148;), denied the
appellant  his  right under s. 10(b) of the Canadian  Charter  of
Rights and Freedoms to be represented at his trial by the counsel
of his choice.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant submits that three rulings of the trial judge
made during the course of the pre-trial proceedings individually
and collectively led to the denial of his right under s. 10(b).
First, on November 30, 1995, the trial judge fixed the trial date
for a date on which he knew the appellant&#146;s counsel of choice was
not available (as it turned out, the trial did not proceed on
that date); next, the trial judge initiated and maintained until
after the appellant&#146;s trial the possibility of a contempt
proceeding against the appellant&#146;s counsel of choice; and
finally, because of the possibility of a contempt proceeding the
trial judge refused the appellant&#146;s motions to have his counsel
of choice represent him at his trial.
[3]  For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the
appellant was wrongfully denied the counsel of his choice, that
his right under s. 10(b) of the Charter was breached and that the
appropriate remedy is a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>          November 30, 1995

</pre>
    <pre>[4]    On  November  30,  1995,  the  appellant  made  his  first
appearance in the assignment court in the Ontario Court  (General
Division)  before the trial judge.  The appellant  appeared  with
his  lawyer,  Mark Kerbel, who had represented him  on  the  same
charge at the preliminary hearing and at the pre-trial which  had
been held earlier in the day before another judge.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Mr. Kerbel asked that the case be adjourned until December
15, 1995, to fix a date for trial.  Although Mr. Kerbel had
received a Legal Aid certificate, he told the trial judge that he
did not consider himself retained because of the situation
involving the Legal Aid Plan and the Law Society; he expected
that the retainer issue would be cleared up by December 15.   The
trial judge requested that Mr. Kerbel set a target date for the
trial and Mr. Kerbel said that he would not be available until
the end of March 1996 because he was starting a five-week murder
trial on January 15, 1996, following which he had other trials
scheduled involving accused persons in custody.
[6]  The trial judge stated that the appellant&#146;s trial must be
scheduled for some time within the next three months, and
suggested that the appellant obtain another lawyer.  Mr. Kerbel
told the trial judge that he was the appellant&#146;s counsel of
choice.  Despite this, the trial judge scheduled the trial for
January 31, 1996, with or without counsel, citing the public
interest in seeing serious cases scheduled in a reasonable period
of time.  The trial judge commented:  &#147;This is alleged to have
occurred in October 1994; it is long enough.  It will be tried
within 3 months if I have anything to say about it.  So I am
setting the trial date.&#148;  The trial judge then asked Mr. Kerbel
to assist the appellant and told the appellant that he had an
obligation to find a lawyer who was available to represent him on
January 31, 1996 if he wished to have counsel.
</pre>
    <pre>          January 31, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  On January 31, 1996, the appellant appeared before the trial
judge  with a lawyer, Mary Misener.  Ms. Misener told  the  court
that  she  was  speaking on behalf of Mr.  Kerbel,  and  was  not
herself  retained  by  the appellant.   She  indicated  that  the
appellant  wished to have Mr. Kerbel act for him  and  asked  the
Court  to  adjourn  the  matter to a date  when  Mr.  Kerbel  was
available.   In  response to a question  from  the  trial  judge,
Ms.  Misener  indicated  that she  was  unable  to  act  for  the
appellant as she was eight months pregnant and recovering from an
illness.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Neither Mr. Kerbel nor Ms. Misener had filed the material
required by the Rules of Criminal Procedure in support of a
motion requesting an adjournment of the trial date.  Ms. Misener
explained that Mr. Kerbel believed that he did not have standing
to bring such a motion because the matter had been scheduled with
or without counsel.  She also informed the court that Mr. Kerbel
had now been retained by the appellant.
[9]  The trial judge asked Crown counsel for her position on the
request for an adjournment, and Crown counsel stated that she
opposed it, noting that the Crown witnesses were present and the
Crown was prepared to proceed.  The trial judge then dismissed
the request and ordered the appellant to proceed to trial
immediately with or without counsel.
[10] The trial judge asked Ms. Misener whether the appellant was
aware that Mr. Kerbel would not be present.  Ms. Misener spoke to
the appellant and informed the court that the appellant said that
Mr. Kerbel had told him that the matter would be remanded until
Mr. Kerbel was available.  The trial judge then stated that he
would consider whether he should require Mr. Kerbel to show cause
why he should not be cited for contempt of court for deceiving
his client about what would happen on that date.  Crown counsel
expressly took no position on the issue of contempt.  The trial
judge ordered that the transcripts of the day&#146;s proceedings be
forwarded to the Crown Law Office - Criminal and that someone
from that office review them and assess whether or not Mr. Kerbel
should be required to show cause why he should not be found in
contempt of court.
[11] The trial judge then asked all counsel present in the
courtroom to go to the barristers&#146; lounge to try to find counsel
who would be willing to act as amicus curiae at the appellant&#146;s
trial.  These attempts were unsuccessful.  Eventually it was
determined that there was not a jury panel available to hear the
case on January 31, 1996 and for that reason the matter was
adjourned to set a new trial date.  Subsequently, the next trial
date was scheduled for April 29, 1996.  Mr. Kerbel was available
on that date and it continued to be the appellant&#146;s wish to have
Mr. Kerbel act as his counsel.
</pre>
    <pre>          March 1, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[12]  On  March 1, 1996, Mr. Lindsay of the Crown Law Office  and
Mr.  Kerbel  attended before the trial judge and made submissions
regarding the contempt issue.  Mr. Lindsay discussed two possible
bases  for a finding of contempt:  Mr. Kerbel&#146;s failure to attend
on  January  31,  1996  and Mr. Kerbel&#146;s  failure  to  adequately
protect  his  client  by  either not having  arranged  for  other
counsel to represent his client or by misleading his client as to
what would happen on January 31, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Mr. Lindsay submitted that Mr. Kerbel&#146;s absence from court
was not contempt, as Mr. Kerbel had informed the court on
November 30 that he would not be available on January 31, 1996.
Further, Mr. Lindsay stated that there was no admissible evidence
before the court to support the second possible basis for a
finding of contempt.  In particular, he stated that what Ms.
Misener had reported to the court that the appellant had told her
that Mr. Kerbel had told him was hearsay.  In response, the trial
judge suggested that the appellant might be compelled to give
evidence under oath about what Mr. Kerbel had told him.  Mr.
Lindsay suggested that such an inquiry might intrude into the
solicitor and client privilege and could create a conflict
between the solicitor and his client.
[14] Mr. Lindsay suggested that, bearing in mind that there was
an existing solicitor-client relationship and that it was clear
that the appellant wished Mr. Kerbel to act for him at his trial,
an alternative method of dealing with the issue was to refer it
to the Law Society.  On three occasions, Mr. Lindsay stated that
an innocent explanation of the conversation that had been
reported to the court by Ms. Misener on January 31 could resolve
the matter.  Finally, he suggested that if the issue of contempt
was left open, it be dealt with after the appellant&#146;s trial.
[15] Mr. Kerbel indicated that if the trial judge was considering
compelling the appellant to testify against him, a conflict of
interest would be created.  Mr. Kerbel stated that if he was in a
position of having to deal with a contempt proceeding in which
his client would be a witness against him after the trial, it
would be impossible for him to continue to act for the appellant.
After hearing the submissions of counsel, the trial judge appears
to have determined that the contempt matter, including the
possibility of compelling the appellant to testify about his
conversation with Mr. Kerbel, deserved further consideration and
that he would defer his consideration until after the appellant&#146;s
trial.
</pre>
    <pre>          March 29, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[16]  On  March  29,  1996, Mr. Kerbel  appeared  to  request  an
adjournment  of the appellant&#146;s trial, scheduled  for  April  29,
1996,  because of the unavailability of an important witness  and
to  seek permission to withdraw as the appellant&#146;s counsel if  he
continued  to  be  in a position of conflict.   The  trial  judge
questioned  how  Mr.  Kerbel  could  make  the  request  for   an
adjournment given his declared conflict of interest arising  from
the  possibility  of the contempt proceeding.  Mr.  Kerbel  asked
that the contempt matter be resolved sooner rather than later  to
avoid problems between the appellant and himself and also because
it  was  a  difficult  matter  to  have  hanging  over  his  head
indefinitely.   He  did not agree with Mr. Lindsay&#146;s  suggestion,
made  during the March 1 appearance, that the contempt  issue  be
deferred until after the appellant&#146;s trial.  The trial judge  did
not agree to deal with the contempt matter before the appellant&#146;s
trial and Mr. Kerbel then asked for and was granted permission to
withdraw as counsel for the appellant.  The trial judge adjourned
the  request  to  adjourn  the  appellant&#146;s  trial  so  that  the
appellant could file the required materials.

</pre>
    <pre>          April 16, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[17]  On  April  16,  1996,  the appellant  appeared  with  Ralph
Steinberg  as counsel.  Mr. Steinberg reminded the Court  of  Mr.
Lindsay&#146;s submission on March 1, 1996 that the issue of  contempt
might be resolved if there was an explanation for what Mr. Kerbel
had allegedly told the appellant prior to the appearance in court
on  January 31, 1996.  Mr. Steinberg filed an affidavit sworn  by
the  appellant  after receiving independent  legal  advice,  that
stated   that  the  appellant  had  misspoken  himself   in   his
conversation  with Ms. Misener in the courtroom  on  January  31.
The appellant swore that Mr. Kerbel had explained to him that the
January 31, 1996 trial date had been set with or without counsel,
and  that it would be up to the presiding judge to decide whether
an  adjournment should be granted.  He also stated that he wished
to have Mr. Kerbel reinstated as his counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Mr. Steinberg took the position that since an explanation
had now been offered, the contempt matter should be resolved so
that Mr. Kerbel could act for the appellant.  Mr. Steinberg
invited the trial judge to hear submissions from Mr. Lindsay who
was available in court.  The trial judge refused to hear any
submissions on the contempt matter stating:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have made a decision, and I am not going to hear further
          argument, with respect, after I have made a decision.  The
          decision is not made today.  It was made previously.  Mr. Kerbel
          has withdrawn from the case because of the conflict, and a
          hearing will be held to determine the issues that have already
          been defined after Mr. McCallen&#146;s trial has been completed.  That
          has been decided.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The trial judge then directed that he be seized of all pre-
trial  motions  regarding the case and  the  charge  against  the
appellant was adjourned to April 29, 1996 to schedule a date  for
trial.

</pre>
    <pre>          April 29, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[20]  On  April 29, 1996, Mr. Kerbel appeared with the appellant.
He indicated to the court that, in view of the affidavit that had
been  filed, he no longer considered himself to be in a  position
of conflict with the appellant.  He pointed out that he had acted
for  the  appellant  at  the preliminary  inquiry,  that  he  was
familiar  with  the case and that he had known the appellant  for
many  years.  He said that the appellant had expressed  over  and
over  that  he  wished Mr. Kerbel to act for  him  and  that  the
appellant did not perceive there to be any conflict.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Mr. Kerbel made two requests; the first was that he be
permitted to act on the understanding that there might be some
proceeding relating to the contempt following the appellant&#146;s
trial.  The trial judge refused this request stating:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I am of the view that having expressed the conflict as a
          reason to withdraw, and having been permitted to withdraw, it is
          not appropriate to accept that Mr. Kerbel, of his own motion, can
          return as counsel for this accused.  And accordingly I feel that
          I am obliged to rule that Mr. Kerbel cannot be counsel for this
          accused.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[22]  Mr.  Kerbel  also requested that the court  deal  with  the
contempt  issue  before  the  appellant&#146;s  trial  to  enable  the
appellant to have counsel of his choice and also because from his
personal  perspective it was &#147;hanging over my head unduly.&#148;   The
trial judge also refused this request stating that the issue  had
been determined at an earlier time.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The trial judge adjourned the appellant&#146;s case to May 14,
1996 to fix a trial date, peremptory to the appellant.
</pre>
    <pre>          May 14, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[24]  On May 14, 1996, the appellant appeared with Mr. Steinberg.
Mr.  Steinberg requested an adjournment, explaining that  he  had
made  inquiries from the Legal Aid Plan respecting a transfer  of
the  appellant&#146;s retainer and was still awaiting a response.  The
Crown  agreed to the adjournment.  Mr. Steinberg emphasized  once
again  that  Mr. McCallen &#147;wishes to have Mr. Kerbel act  as  his
counsel.&#148;   The  trial  judge  dismissed  the  request   for   an
adjournment, and fixed the trial date for September 16, 1996.

</pre>
    <pre>          September 13, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[25]  On  September 13, 1996, Mr. Steinberg,  on  behalf  of  the
appellant,  brought a motion to adjourn the trial  scheduled  for
September  16  and  informed the trial judge that  the  appellant
would  be bringing a motion alleging that the appellant had  been
denied  the counsel of his choice.  Mr. Steinberg submitted  that
the  motion  to  adjourn should be heard by another  judge.   The
trial  judge  refused  to disqualify himself  and  dismissed  the
motion for an adjournment.

</pre>
    <pre>          September 16, 1996

</pre>
    <pre>[26] On September 16, 1996, Mr. Steinberg brought a motion asking
the trial judge to rescind his ruling of April 29 that prohibited
Mr.  Kerbel  from  acting as counsel for the  appellant,  and  to
adjourn the trial to permit Mr. Kerbel to come back on the record
and  represent the appellant.  Mr. Steinberg asked to  have  this
motion heard by another judge.  The trial judge refused.</pre>
    <pre>[27] On the motion, Mr. Steinberg argued that the appellant was
denied counsel of his choice because the trial judge erred in
refusing the request, made on April 29, to have Mr. Kerbel act
for the appellant.  The trial judge dismissed the argument and
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I am satisfied it is clear that at the time that Mr. Kerbel
          applied to appear as counsel of record, the issue of his conflict
          was still in existence.  Accordingly, the issue of denial of Mr.
          McCallen&#146;s right to counsel is specifically explained in relation
          to his desire to have Mr. Kerbel, due to the fact there was an
          outstanding conflict of interest which prevented Mr. Kerbel from
          appearing as counsel for Mr. McCallen at this trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[28]  Mr.  Steinberg also argued that the trial judge had  denied
the  appellant&#146;s right to counsel of choice on November 30,  1995
by  ordering that the trial date be set for January 31,  1996,  a
date when Mr. Kerbel was unavailable.  In rejecting this argument
the trial judge referred to a 90-day rule for trying cases in the
General Division and said:</pre>
    <pre>          
               The fact is the accused did have the right to choose any
          lawyer qualified to practise law in the Province of Ontario,
          provided that lawyer was available within the time frame the
          court set down.
          </pre>
    <pre>[29]  A  second motion was then brought to have the  trial  judge
recuse  himself from presiding at the appellant&#146;s  trial  on  the
basis  of reasonable apprehension of bias.  This motion was  also
dismissed, and the trial began.  The appellant was represented by
Mr.  Steinberg, and was convicted and sentenced to two and a half
years in prison.

</pre>
    <pre>          February 17, 1997

</pre>
    <pre>[30]  On  February 17, 1997, over four and one-half months  after
the  conviction and sentencing of the appellant, the trial  judge
held a hearing to decide whether Mr. Kerbel should be required to
show  cause  why  he  should not be found in  contempt.   Neither
Mr.  Kerbel nor counsel on his behalf attended.  Mr. Lindsay made
submissions for the Crown and in the end the trial judge accepted
Mr.  Lindsay&#146;s  submission that the contempt matter  against  Mr.
Kerbel should not proceed.
</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION
</pre>
    <pre>          The Section 10(b) Right

</pre>
    <pre>[31] Section 10(b) of the Charter provides:</pre>
    <pre>          
               10.  Everyone has the right on arrest or detention
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   to  retain  and instruct  counsel
          without  delay  and to be  informed  of  that
          right; ...
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[32]  It is well established that s. 10(b) includes not only  the
right  to  retain counsel but the right to retain the counsel  of
the  accused&#146;s  choice and the right to be  represented  by  that
counsel throughout the proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[33] In Re Regina and Speid (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.),
Dubin J.A. described this as a fundamental right.  At p. 20, he
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The right of an accused to retain counsel of his choice has
          long been recognized at common law as a fundamental right.  It
          has been carried forth as a singular feature of the Legal Aid
          Plan in this province and has been inferentially entrenched in
          the Charter of Rights which guarantees everyone upon arrest or
          detention the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.
          However, although it is a fundamental right and one to be
          zealously protected by the court, it is not an absolute right and
          is subject to reasonable limitations.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[34] There are sound reasons why this right was considered to  be
a  fundamental  component  of the criminal  justice  system  well
before the enactment of the Charter and why it was recognized  as
a  right  deserving of constitutional protection in the  Charter.
The solicitor-client relationship is anchored on the premise that
clients  should be able to have complete trust and confidence  in
the  counsel  who represent their interests.  Clients  must  feel
free  to  disclose  the  most personal,  intimate  and  sometimes
damaging   information   to  their   counsel,   secure   in   the
understanding that the information will be treated in  confidence
and  will be used or not used, within the boundaries of counsels&#146;
ethical  constraints, in the clients&#146; best  interests.   The  law
recognizes  the  uniqueness of this confidential relationship  by
providing   special  protection  from  compelled  disclosure   of
information that is exchanged between clients and their counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In addition, the relationship of counsel and client requires
clients, typically untrained in the law and lacking the skills of
advocates, to entrust the management and conduct of their cases
to the counsel who act on their behalf.  There should be no room
for doubt about counsel&#146;s loyalty and dedication to the client&#146;s
case.  It is human nature that the trust and confidence that are
essential for the relationship to be effective will be promoted
and more readily realized if clients have not only the right to
retain counsel but to retain counsel of their choice.
[36] The reasons why clients may choose one lawyer rather than
another may vary widely and will often turn on personal
preferences or other factors that do not lend themselves to
objective measurement.  Professional reputation and competence
will no doubt be important factors in the choice of counsel, but
it would understate the full nature of the relationship to
suggest that the choice be limited to those considerations.  The
very nature of the right is that the subjective choice of the
client must be respected and protected.  Absent compelling
reasons involving the public interest, the government and the
courts need not be involved in decisions about which counsel
clients may choose to act on their behalf.
[37] In addition to constituting a valuable personal right to
clients, s. 10(b) provides a right that is an important component
in the objective perception of fairness of the criminal justice
system.  Criminal proceedings are adversarial in nature and pit
the accused against the authority of the state.  Without adequate
safeguards the resulting contest may be unfairly weighted in
favour of the state.  The right to have the assistance of counsel
is high on the list of those protections for accused persons
which enable them to fully defend the charges brought against
them.  Including with this fundamental right to counsel, the
additional right to choose one&#146;s own counsel enhances the
objective perception of fairness because it avoids the spectre of
state or court interference in a decision that quite properly
should be the personal decision of the individual whose interests
are at stake and whose interests the counsel will represent.
[38] The corollary to this point, which is central to this case,
is that the perception of fairness will be damaged, and in many
cases severely so, if accused persons are improperly or unfairly
denied the opportunity to be represented by the counsel they
choose.
[39] Although it may be said that in some cases there will not be
any practical difference whether an accused is represented by one
counsel rather than another, nevertheless, the intangible value
to the accused and the symbolic value to the system of criminal
justice of the s. 10(b) right are of fundamental importance and
must be vindicated when breached.
[40] Nevertheless, the right to retain counsel of choice is not
an absolute right; it is obviously limited to those counsel who
are competent to undertake the retainer and are willing to act.
There are two further limitations on the right that are in issue
on this appeal: the first is the requirement that counsel be
available to represent the client within a reasonable period of
time and the second is the requirement that counsel be free of
any disqualifying conflict of interest.
[41] The appellant submits that three rulings of the trial judge
individually and collectively resulted in a denial of
representation by counsel of his choice.  I will deal with each
of these rulings separately.
</pre>
    <pre>          1.   The January 31, 1996 Trial Date

</pre>
    <pre>[42] On November 30, 1995, the trial judge refused to schedule  a
trial  date  at  the  end of March 1996,  when  Mr.  Kerbel,  the
appellant&#146;s  counsel  of  choice,  was  available.   Rather,   he
scheduled  the  trial, with or without counsel, for  January  31,
1996  realizing  that  Mr.  Kerbel  would  not  be  available  to
represent the appellant on that date.</pre>
    <pre>[43] As it turned out, this issue was overtaken by other events.
The trial did not proceed on January 31, 1996; it was adjourned
and eventually proceeded on September 16, 1996.  Although it may
be said that if the trial judge had fixed a trial date at the end
of March 1996, as Mr. Kerbel requested, the appellant would have
been represented by counsel of his choice at that time, the
reason the appellant was not represented by counsel of his choice
at his trial in September 1996 was not the initial scheduling of
the trial for January 31, 1996 but rather was the result of later
events which I discuss below.  It is therefore not necessary to
decide whether any breach of the appellant&#146;s right under s. 10(b)
of the Charter occurred because of the November 30, 1995 ruling
fixing the trial date for January 31, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>[44]  Although that disposes of this issue, the January 31  trial
date  was  the triggering event for what followed and I think  it
useful  to  comment  upon the manner in  which  the  trial  judge
exercised his discretion in setting that date.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The law is clear that the decision to fix a date for trial
is discretionary and that in choosing a date the court must act
judicially and balance a number of factors including the
availability of an accused&#146;s counsel of choice within a
reasonable period of time.  Many of the same factors come into
play in decisions whether to adjourn a trial date in order to
permit an accused&#146;s counsel of choice to be available.  The
emphasis is on the reasonableness of the delay involved in
accommodating the accused&#146;s choice; if the counsel of choice is
not available within a reasonable time, then the rights of the
accused must give way to other considerations and the accused
will be required, if he or she chooses to be represented, to
retain another counsel who is available within a reasonable
period of time: see R. v. Lai, [1991] O.J. No. 725 (Gen. Div.);
Barette v. The Queen (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 189 (S.C.C.) and R.
v. Smith (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Ont. C.A.).
</pre>
    <pre>[46]  In  determining what is a reasonable period  of  time,  the
court  will balance many factors including the reason counsel  is
not available sooner, the previous involvement of the  particular
counsel in the case, the public interest in having criminal cases
disposed of in an expeditious manner, the age and history of  the
case, the availability of judicial resources and the best use  of
courtroom  facilities, the availability of  the  complainant  and
witnesses,  the  availability and use of Crown  counsel  and  law
enforcement  officers and the potential impact of the  scheduling
decisions  on  the rights of an accused under  s.  11(b)  of  the
Charter guaranteeing a trial within a reasonable period of  time.
See Smith, supra, at p. 93; Lai, supra.</pre>
    <pre>[47] There is no formula that can be rigidly applied in balancing
these different factors and what is reasonable in one case may
not be reasonable in another.  Rigid rules defeat the very nature
of the discretionary decision that is required.  However,
guidelines are helpful because they provide a framework within
which decisions can be made and bring a measure of predictability
to scheduling decisions that will assist the various participants
in the process.  It is the trial courts that are in the best
position to assess and balance the circumstances and resources
that are available in a particular region and to develop the
guidelines that make the most sense for that region.  Guidelines
should be used as such and should not be applied in an arbitrary
or inflexible fashion, particularly when a trial date is being
set that will deny an accused person counsel of choice.  See R.
v. Shute (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 354 (N.S.C.A.).
[48] On the appearance before the trial judge on November 30,
1995, it was clear that the appellant&#146;s choice of counsel was Mr.
Kerbel who had acted for him at the preliminary hearing and the
pre-trial.  Because of his schedule Mr. Kerbel was not available
to represent the appellant at trial until the end of March 1996,
four months hence.  The trial judge stated that the trial must be
scheduled within the next three months and fixed the trial date
for January 31, 1996, directing that if the appellant wished
counsel he would have to obtain someone other than Mr. Kerbel.
[49] In my view, this was an unreasonable exercise of the trial
judge&#146;s discretion.  The four-month delay that would have been
necessitated by Mr. Kerbel&#146;s schedule was not unreasonable.  This
was the first time that the appellant had appeared in the Ontario
Court (General Division).  Mr. Kerbel was unavailable because he
would be defending an accused in a previously scheduled murder
case and because he had scheduled other trials for accused
persons in custody during the period up to the end of March.
There was no suggestion of any desire by the appellant or Mr.
Kerbel to delay or frustrate the course of the proceedings; the
Crown did not appear to argue against the delay nor did the Crown
suggest any difficulties with witnesses that would arise if the
trial were scheduled at the end of March; nor could it be
realistically said that scheduling the trial for the end of March
could have any effect on the accused&#146;s rights under s. 11(b) of
the Charter.
[50] The trial judge&#146;s decision appears to have been motivated by
a rigid adherence to what he later referred to as a 90-day rule,
i.e. a trial must be heard within 90 days of the first appearance
in the Ontario Court (General Division).  Counsel on this appeal
were not aware of such a rule and it may be that the trial judge
was rigidly applying a 90-day guideline.
[51] On appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge was
justified in fixing the January 31, 1996 date because Mr. Kerbel
had not yet been retained by the appellant.  I do not agree.  Mr.
Kerbel informed the court on November 30 that because of certain
difficulties with Legal Aid he had not yet been formally
retained.  Mr. Kerbel was agreeable to one of two alternatives:
adjourn the case for two weeks to permit those difficulties to be
cleared or set a trial date at the end of March 1996.  Both
alternatives were reasonable.  It was clear that the accused
wanted Mr. Kerbel to act for him and there was no reason to
expect that Mr. Kerbel would not be retained (in fact he was
retained before the January 31, 1996 appearance).    For these
reasons, in my view, it was not reasonable for the trial judge
simply to fix a trial date of January 31, 1996 and not attempt to
approach the scheduling issue in a co-operative manner so that
the appellant could be given a reasonable opportunity to have Mr.
Kerbel represent him.
</pre>
    <pre>          2.   The Contempt Issue

</pre>
    <pre>[52]  During the appearance on January 31, 1996, the trial  judge
stated that he would consider citing Mr. Kerbel for contempt  and
asked  that someone from the Crown Law Office - Criminal,  assess
whether Mr. Kerbel should be required to show cause why he should
not be found in contempt. The trial judge&#146;s consideration of this
issue  remained pending for over a year, until February 17, 1997,
when he decided not to proceed with a contempt hearing.</pre>
    <pre>[53] The law with respect to contempt is conveniently set out by
Laskin J.A. in R. v. Glasner (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont.
C.A.).  Contempt of court is a common law crime and consists of
acts which obstruct or interfere with the administration of
justice or which tend to do so, and acts which show disrespect
for the court and its processes.  In R. v. Carter, [1993] O.J.
No. 3135 (C.A.), this court acquitted a lawyer of contempt
because it could not find, &#147;that the appellant&#146;s misconduct
caused a serious, real, imminent risk of obstruction of the
administration of justice accompanied by a dishonest intention or
bad faith.&#148;   If a court is in doubt whether conduct complained
of amounts to &#147;contempt&#148; the complaint will fail.  It has also
been said that the &#147;actus reus for the offence of the criminal
contempt must be conduct which causes a serious public injury.&#148;
See U.N.A v. Alberta (Attorney General) (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d)
225, per Cory J. at p. 238.
[54] In Glasner, Laskin J.A. set out the mental requirement for
criminal contempt at p. 244 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In short, the fault requirement for criminal contempt calls
          for deliberate or intentional conduct, or conduct which
          demonstrates indifference, which I take to be akin to
          recklessness.  Nothing short of that will do.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[55]  Contempt, it has often been said, should be used  sparingly
and  only  in  serious  cases.  It  should  be  used  with  great
restraint and only in those circumstances where it is required to
protect  the  rule of law.  See Izuora v. The Queen, [1953]  A.C.
327  (P.C.),  U.N.A.  v. Alberta (Attorney General),  supra,  and
Glasner, supra, at p. 242.</pre>
    <pre>[56] The procedure to be followed for dealing with contempt
matters is discussed by Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. K. (B.) (1995), 102
C.C.C. (3d) 18.  A judge may initiate contempt procedures;
however, unless there are unusual circumstances which require
immediate action, notice should be given to the person involved
that he must show cause why he should not be found in contempt of
court, followed by an adjournment to offer the person an
opportunity to be advised by counsel and, if he chooses, to be
represented by counsel.
[57] In cases where the issue of contempt is raised by a judge
but is not dealt with immediately and notice is given of a
hearing, the best procedure is to refer the matter to another
judge to be tried in the normal way of a criminal non-jury case.
See  McKeown v. The Queen (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 1 per Laskin J.
[58] In my view, the trial judge erred in two respects with
regard to the manner in which he dealt with the issue of the
alleged contempt by Mr. Kerbel.  First, when he received the
submission of Mr. Lindsay on March 1, 1996 that Mr. Kerbel&#146;s
non-attendance could not constitute contempt because Mr. Kerbel
had informed the trial judge that he would not be present on that
date and that there was no admissible evidence that Mr. Kerbel
had misled his client, he should have ended his initiative to
consider whether to institute a contempt proceeding.  Any doubt
about that was removed on April 16, 1996, when Mr. Steinberg
filed the appellant&#146;s affidavit indicating that Mr. Kerbel had in
fact told the appellant that the trial might go ahead on January
31, 1996 and that it was up to the court to decide whether the
case would be adjourned or not.  It was clear from that affidavit
that Mr. Kerbel had not misled the appellant and the appellant
understood that he might have to be tried without the assistance
of counsel.
[59] The trial judge had also raised Mr. Kerbel&#146;s failure to
arrange for another counsel to represent the appellant at the
trial that was scheduled for January 31, 1996 as a possible basis
for a finding of contempt.  Mr. Kerbel had not undertaken to do
so.  On November 30 the trial judge had set January 31 as a date
for trial with or without counsel.  In his affidavit, the
appellant said that he understood from Mr. Kerbel that when he
attended in court on January 31, he might have to proceed with
his trial without counsel.  The appellant made no complaint
against Mr. Kerbel for not arranging for other counsel.  After
the affidavit was filed on April 16, there was no longer any
possible basis for a finding of contempt based on an allegation
that Mr. Kerbel failed to arrange for another counsel to appear
on January 31.
[60] In view of the appellant&#146;s affidavit there was virtually no
chance that Mr. Kerbel would be held in contempt by an
independent and objective judge. This was not a situation that
posed a serious or imminent risk to the administration of
justice. The trial judge should have heeded the admonishment in
the cases that contempt proceedings should be used sparingly,
with great restraint and only in the most serious cases when
necessary to protect the rule of law.  The trial judge, in this
case, should have ended his consideration of the contempt matter
on April 16 at the latest.
[61] The second error the trial judge made with respect to the
contempt issue was delaying his consideration of whether or not
he would require Mr. Kerbel to show cause until after the
appellant&#146;s trial.  On March 1, 1996, the trial judge left
hanging two decisions: his consideration of whether to initiate
contempt proceedings against Mr. Kerbel and his consideration of
whether the appellant would be compelled to testify against Mr.
Kerbel at the contempt proceeding.  Although there was a serious
issue whether the appellant could be compelled to testify about
his conversation with Mr. Kerbel, the predictable result of the
trial judge taking these two positions was that Mr. Kerbel would
have to withdraw as the appellant&#146;s counsel because he faced the
prospect that his client would be called as a witness against him
in a criminal proceeding and would give evidence contradictory to
his evidence.  The unfortunate aspect was that the appellant
repeatedly told the court that Mr. Kerbel was his counsel of
choice and the trial judge&#146;s decision to delay his consideration
of the contempt matter until after the trial had the effect, at
that point, of denying the appellant the benefit of that counsel.
[62] The trial judge was asked on two occasions to deal with the
contempt matter before and not after the trial, so that Mr.
Kerbel could represent the appellant.  On April 29, 1996, after
the appellant&#146;s affidavit had been filed and it was understood
that the trial would not take place for several months, the trial
judge, if he was determined to proceed with the contempt matter,
should have acceded to the request to have the contempt matter
disposed of before the trial.  At that point, there was no
conflict in the expected evidence between the appellant and
Mr. Kerbel, both Mr. Kerbel and the appellant wanted to deal with
the matter so that Mr. Kerbel could act for the appellant at his
trial and whatever justification there had been for delaying the
contempt matter until after the trial no longer existed.
[63] When the trial judge finally came to consider the contempt
matter many months later on February 17, 1997, he followed Mr.
Lindsay&#146;s submission and decided not to proceed.  That was the
correct decision.  There was no reason why that decision could
not have been made shortly after the filing of the appellant&#146;s
affidavit on April 16, 1996 and thereby have avoided denying the
appellant representation by counsel of his choice at trial.
[64] The trial judge&#146;s decision to hold open his consideration of
whether to institute contempt proceedings against Mr. Kerbel
until after the appellant&#146;s trial became the basis upon which the
trial judge refused the motions on April 29, 1996 and September
16, 1996 to have Mr. Kerbel represent the appellant at his trial.
This decision directly contributed to the breach of the
appellant&#146;s right under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
[65] Finally, it is important to note that the trial judge&#146;s
actions resulted in the prospect of a charge of criminal contempt
hanging over Mr. Kerbel&#146;s head for a period of over one year.
That was unfortunate and unnecessary.</pre>
    <pre>          3.   The Refusal of the Motions to Permit Mr. Kerbel to
          Represent the Appellant at his Trial
</pre>
    <pre>[66]  On  March  29, 1996, the trial judge granted  Mr.  Kerbel&#146;s
request  to  be  removed  as counsel on the  record  because  the
appellant might potentially be required to give evidence  against
him  in  a  contempt proceeding.  On April 29,  1996,  after  the
appellant&#146;s affidavit was filed, Mr. Kerbel told the  court  that
he  was  no  longer in a position of conflict and  the  appellant
requested again that Mr. Kerbel be permitted to represent him  at
his trial.</pre>
    <pre>[67] The trial judge refused the request and told the appellant
he would have to find another counsel.  The trial judge appears
to have done so for two reasons:  first, in his view, their
continued to be a potential or actual conflict; and second, in
his view, it was necessary to bring finality to administrative
matters of this sort.  The appellant made the same request before
the start of the trial on September 16, 1996.  The trial judge
again denied the request and proceeded with the trial.
[68] A court should only deny an accused the right to counsel of
choice for compelling reasons.  In Re R. v. Speid, supra, Dubin
J.A. discussed the factors which must be considered before an
accused&#146;s counsel of choice is disqualified.  At pp. 20-21, he
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In assessing the merits of a disqualification order, the
          court must balance the individual&#146;s right to select counsel of
          his own choice, public policy and the public interest in the
          administration of justice and basic principles of fundamental
          fairness.  Such an order should not be made unless there are
          compelling reasons. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[69]  It  seems to me that the requirement for compelling reasons
should  be  the same whether a court is considering an  order  to
remove  a  counsel who has been retained or an order refusing  an
accused the right to retain a particular counsel to act on his or
her  behalf.  Indeed, in normal circumstances the court plays  no
role in approving or permitting a counsel to act on behalf of  an
accused.   It  happens  as a matter of course.   It  is  only  in
exceptional circumstances where there are concerns about  matters
such as a conflict of interest or a lack of competence, that  may
imperil  the  fairness  of a trial or that  might  undermine  the
public  interest in the administration of justice, that  a  court
will  intervene to determine whether a particular counsel may  or
may not act for an accused.</pre>
    <pre>[70] The trial judge refused this request and told the appellant
he would have to find another counsel.  The trial judge appears
to have done so for two reasons: first, in his view, there
continued to be a real, potential or actual conflict and second,
in his view, it was necessary to bring finality to administrative
matters of this sort.  The appellant made the same request again
before the start of the trial on September 16, 1996.  The trial
judge once again denied the request and proceeded with the trial.
[71] The leading case on conflicts of interest is MacDonald
Estate v. Martin (1990), 77 D.L.R. (4th) 249.  In that case, the
Supreme Court of Canada examined the proper test for determining
whether there is a conflict of interest when a lawyer changes
from one law firm to another.  At p. 254, the court noted that
there are three competing values that must be considered:
          </pre>
    <pre>               the concern to maintain the high standards of the legal
          profession and the integrity of our system of justice;
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...
          </pre>
    <pre>               the countervailing value that a litigant
          should  not be deprived of his or her  choice
          of counsel without good cause; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...
          </pre>
    <pre>                  the    desirability   of   permitting
          reasonable mobility in the legal profession.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[72]  The  third principle has no application to this  case.   In
determining  whether there was a disqualifying conflict  in  this
case, it is appropriate to consider the first two factors set out
in MacDonald Estate.</pre>
    <pre>[73] It is also relevant to consider the consent of a client
whose interest is potentially adversely affected by the alleged
conflict1 recognizing however, that the consent of a client must
give way to the public interest and the integrity of the system
of justice when there is a legitimate concern about the
appearance of impropriety arising from a conflict: see Donaldson
Inquest (Re) (1994), 111 D.L.R. (4th) 111 (Ont. Div. Ct.);
Goldberg v. Goldberg (1982), 141 D.L.R. (3d) 133 (Ont. Div. Ct.).
[74] With these principles in mind, I turn to the situation that
existed on April 29, 1996.  Mr. Kerbel and the appellant both
advised the trial judge that they perceived that there was no
conflict of interest.  The appellant&#146;s affidavit apparently
agreed with Mr. Kerbel&#146;s recollection of the conversation that
preceded the appearance in court on January 31, 1996.  The
appellant continued to indicate that he wished Mr. Kerbel to act
for him and Mr. Kerbel was available and willing to do so.  The
appellant had received independent legal advice.  It was Mr.
Kerbel who had raised the conflict issue in the first place.  The
trial judge had heeded his concern and permitted him to withdraw
as counsel on the record.  After the filing of the affidavit Mr.
Kerbel told the court that the concern that led him to withdraw
no longer existed.
[75] It is important to note that the alleged conflict had
nothing to do with any of the evidence to be called at the
appellant&#146;s trial.  The concern, at its highest, had been that
the appellant may have been required to be a witness at a
contempt proceeding against Mr. Kerbel and that his version of
the conversation relating to the January 31, 1996 appearance
might differ from that of Mr. Kerbel.  Presumably it was felt
that this potential difference might undermine the solicitor-
client relationship.  When the appellant&#146;s affidavit was filed,
the potential for difference in evidence disappeared.  Even if
there continued to be a possibility of a contempt proceeding at
which the appellant would be called as a witness against Mr.
Kerbel, I fail to see how, in circumstances in which the
appellant wanted Mr. Kerbel to act for him at his trial and Mr.
Kerbel was content to do so, such a possibility could
detrimentally affect the standards of the legal profession or
undermine the integrity of the administration of justice.
[76] The Crown argued on this appeal that if the appellant was
cross-examined, he might change his evidence, raising again the
spectre of a conflict between the appellant and Mr. Kerbel.
This, in my view,  is pure speculation and falls far short of
being a compelling reason for denying the appellant the counsel
of his choice.  In my view, there was no actual or potential
conflict of interest that justified the trial judge in refusing
the appellant&#146;s request to have Mr. Kerbel act on his behalf.
[77] The trial judge also erred in refusing the request to have
Mr. Kerbel represent the appellant on the basis that the issue
had been decided previously.  The circumstances had changed with
the filing of the appellant&#146;s affidavit which put to rest any
concern about why Mr. Kerbel should not act for the appellant.
The trial judge responded to this critically important new
circumstance by stating that he had decided the issue previously
and refused to hear submissions.  He was wrong in doing so.
[78] For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the trial judge
erred in refusing the motions to have Mr. Kerbel represent the
appellant and in doing so he breached the appellant&#146;s right under
s. 10(b) of the Charter to be represented by the counsel of his
choice.
</pre>
    <pre>          Remedy

</pre>
    <pre>[79] The appellant seeks a new trial to remedy the denial of  his
right to counsel of choice guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter.
The  authority to order a remedy for a breach of the  Charter  is
found  in  s.  24(1) which confers a discretionary power  on  the
court  to provide &#147;such remedy as the court considers appropriate
and just in the circumstances.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[80] As I have set out above, the right to counsel of choice is a
fundamentally important right to the accused and to the system of
criminal justice.  The denial of that right, constitutionally
protected by s. 10(b) of the Charter, is a serious error in law.
In Re R. v. Speid, supra, Dubin J.A. at p. 20 emphasized the
importance of the right and said that it must be &#147;zealously
protected by the Court.&#148;
[81] When the Charter right to counsel of choice has been
violated and an accused has been convicted, the most obvious way
of vindicating and protecting the right is by ordering a new
trial at which the accused may be represented by counsel of
choice.
[82] In determining what is an appropriate remedy for the
violation of the s. 10(b) right the reasoning of the Supreme
Court of Canada in R. v. Tran (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 218 is
instructive.  In that case, the Supreme Court held that the
accused had been denied his right to the assistance of an
interpreter guaranteed by s. 14 of the Charter.  At trial, the
evidence of one witness was only summarized in the accused&#146;s
language rather than translated and an exchange between the trial
judge and the interpreter was not interpreted at all.  Lamer
C.J.C., for the court, held that the breach of the s. 14 right
was a serious error of law and that as a general rule, the
appropriate remedy for breaches of s. 14 of the Charter will be a
new trial or a new hearing of the issue at which the right was
violated.
[83] Significantly, in Tran, there was no evidence of actual
prejudice resulting from the lapses in proper interpretation.
Lamer C.J.C. considered the &#145;no prejudice&#146; issue in context of
his analysis that led to the conclusion that a breach had
occurred.  However, his comments on that issue provide the
background against which he determined that a new trial was the
appropriate remedy.  In  particular, he said the following at p.
261:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... The uncertainty associated with the question of what
          might have happened had the accused received the quality of
          interpretation to which he was entitled under s. 14 of the
          Charter demonstrates that courts must not engage in speculating
          about the utility or non-utility of proper interpretation.  What
          is important is that the appellant was in need of interpreter
          assistance ...</pre>
    <pre>And further, at pp. 261-2:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... For the Court of Appeal to say after the fact that the
          poor interpretation received by the appellant made no difference
          to the outcome of the case is, in my opinion, to engage in the
          kind of second-guessing and speculation which I have suggested is
          inappropriate in determining whether there has been a breach of
          s. 14 of the Charter.  Irrespective of whether the interpreter&#146;s
          evidence actually affected the appellant&#146;s right to full answer
          and defence, something we cannot know with certainty, the
          appellant was entitled under s. 14 to hear fully and
          contemporaneously what was being said on the topic of his weight.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[84]  The conclusion that I draw from Tran, with respect  to  the
issue of remedy, is that because a breach of s. 14 of the Charter
is  a  serious  error  in  law and a violation  of  an  important
constitutional right, that violation will normally be  vindicated
by ordering a new trial or hearing.</pre>
    <pre>[85] Although the Charter right involved in this case is
different from that in Tran, the breach that occurred in this
case was in some ways more serious.  The appellant had repeatedly
requested that Mr. Kerbel be permitted to represent him at his
trial; Mr. Kerbel was prepared to accept the retainer and was
available to appear when the trial was to take place.  The trial
judge&#146;s reason for denying the appellant his counsel of choice
was the very situation he had created: his consideration of the
possibility of a contempt proceeding and his insistence on
leaving that consideration pending until after the appellant&#146;s
trial.  As I have held, he was wrong in doing so.  In my view,
the damage to the appearance of fairness caused by that conduct
is significant and the violation of the right, in these
circumstances, is serious.
[86] The Crown argues that a new trial should only be ordered if
there is actual prejudice in the conduct of the trial resulting
from the denial of the right to be represented by counsel of
choice.  The Crown submits, in this case, that the appellant was
vigorously defended by competent counsel and that there is no
basis for believing that the result would be any different if
there is a new trial at which the appellant is represented by
counsel of his choice.   I disagree that it is necessary to find
actual prejudice before making an order directing a new trial.
[87] There are cases, such as Tran, where the breach itself is
such that, even absent a demonstration of actual prejudice, a new
trial is required to protect and vindicate the right that has
been breached and to ensure the perception of fairness of the
proceeding.  This reasoning is consistent with the rationale that
has been applied in cases in which this court has refused to
apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code,2 and ordered new trials because there has been a
miscarriage of justice resulting from the appearance of
unfairness.
[88] In R. v. Laws (1998) 165 D.L.R. (4th) 301, the appellant had
been improperly excluded from the courtroom during part of his
trial.  There was no proof of prejudice resulting from the
exclusion.  At p. 332, this court said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The perceived fairness of the criminal justice system is its
          most vital characteristic.  Public confidence requires public
          scrutiny wherever possible.  Private trials which exclude the
          accused are antithetical to this core value.  Where the
          circumstances of the exclusion of the accused are such as to
          inflict significant damage on the appearance of justice, the
          question is not whether there is prejudice to the accused.
          Rather, the issue is the harm to the criminal justice system
          itself.  In such cases the court should refuse to apply this
          proviso. [The curative proviso &#150; s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
          Criminal Code.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[89]  This court has also declined to invoke the curative proviso
and has ordered new trials in cases in which there has been undue
interference  in a trial by the trial judge, and the interference
has  seriously impaired the appearance of fairness of the  trial.
In  these situations this court has held that the strength of the
case against the appellant, and inferentially the failure of  the
appellant to demonstrate actual prejudice, is not an answer to an
argument  that  there must be a new trial.   The  effect  of  the
reasoning is that the damage that  is caused to the appearance of
fairness trumps the need to show prejudice.</pre>
    <pre>[90] In R. v. Valley (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont. C.A.),
leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused loc cit., Martin J.A. set out
the test at p. 232:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The ultimate question to be answered is not whether the
          accused was in fact prejudiced by the interventions but whether
          he might reasonably consider that he had not had a fair trial or
          whether a reasonably minded person who had been present
          throughout the trial would consider that the accused had not had
          a fair trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[91]  See  also  R. v. Stewart (1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d)  289  (Ont.
C.A.)  and  R.  v.  Turkeiwicz, Barrow and MacNamara  (1979),  50
C.C.C. (2d) 406 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[92] The same approach was adopted by this court in the context
of a civil case, Baker v. Huchinson et al (1976), 13 O.R. (2d)
591 (C.A.), where Dubin J.A. stated at pp. 596-7:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While it would appear that the plaintiff&#146;s case was tenuous
          at best, the conduct of the trial cannot be dependent on the
          merit of the cause.  Every litigant is entitled to have his case
          fully presented and fairly considered.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[93]  I  do not view this as a case in which it is necessary  for
the appellant to demonstrate prejudice of the sort contended for.
Indeed,  in  most cases of this sort it will be almost impossible
for an appellant to do so unless it can be shown that counsel who
did  represent  an  accused  was incompetent.   The  exercise  of
comparing  how  one  counsel conducted a trial,  in  all  of  the
intricate  detail involved, with how another counsel  might  have
conducted  the  same trial, will be fraught with uncertainty  and
would  involve  the type of second-guessing and speculation  that
Lamer C.J.C. considered inappropriate in Tran.</pre>
    <pre>[94] In any event, a requirement that there be actual prejudice
overlooks the damage that has occurred to the intangible value
that an appellant may place on the right to have counsel of
choice as well as the damage to the appearance of fairness that
results from the denial of that right.
[95] Finally, the Crown argued that a declaratory order or an
award of damages, if any could be established in a civil suit,
would be more appropriate remedies for the breach of the
appellant&#146;s s. 10(b) right.  I disagree.  From the appellant&#146;s
standpoint, civil litigation can be expensive, time-consuming and
uncertain of result.  In many cases it would be unrealistic to
expect a convicted accused whose s. 10(b) right has been breached
to have the resources or the inclination to pursue a separate
civil proceeding.  In those circumstances, the breach would pass
without remedy and the damage to the appearance of fairness and
the integrity of the system would not be vindicated.
[96] In summary, I am satisfied that the breach in this case was
serious, that it damaged the appearance of fairness of the
proceeding against the appellant and that despite the lack of a
evidence of actual prejudice, the appropriate remedy is a new
trial.</pre>
    <pre>     Other Grounds
</pre>
    <pre>[97]  The  appellant also argued that even if  there  was  not  a
breach  of  the appellant&#146;s s. 10(b) right to counsel  of  choice
there  should  be  a  new trial because  the  way  in  which  the
proceedings unfolded compromised the appearance of fairness.   It
is not necessary to address this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[98] The appellant also raised two grounds of appeal with respect
to the charge to the jury.  We did not call upon the Crown to
respond to these grounds and I find no merit in them.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION
</pre>
    <pre>[99] I would therefore allow the appeal and direct that there  be
a new trial.
