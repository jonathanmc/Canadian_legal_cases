    <pre>On appeal from the conviction for second degree murder by a court
composed of R. Thomas J. and a jury on June 26, 1991 and from the
period of parole ineligibility imposed by Thomas J. on June 27,
1991.
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>On Wednesday, August 3, 1988, a young woman was brutally murdered
while she sunbathed on a beach between Burlington and Hamilton.
The appellant was eventually apprehended for this offence and
charged with first degree murder.  The case against him, although
largely circumstantial, was bolstered by admissions he allegedly
made to a number of fellow inmates.  The appellant was found not
guilty of first degree murder on a directed verdict.  The
appellant and the deceased were previously unknown to each other
and the Crown was unable to produce sufficient evidence that the
killing was planned and deliberate.  Further, while parts of the
deceased&#146;s bathing suit had been removed, the expert evidence
suggested that this interference had occurred following death.
The Crown was therefore unable to rely upon first degree murder
as defined in s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>The only real issue on second degree murder was identification.
The jury found the appellant guilty of this offence and Thomas J.
sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment without eligibility
for parole for 24 years.</pre>
    <pre>The principal grounds of appeal from conviction concern the
reasonableness of the verdict and the admission of the evidence
of a jailhouse informant.  The appellant also raises some issues
concerning the adequacy of the charge to the jury as it related
to evidence of consciousness of guilt and the defence of alibi.
The appellant also appeals from the period of parole
ineligibility.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
appeal from conviction and sentence.
THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>               i.   The identification evidence
          
</pre>
    <pre>Francine Côté was killed sometime between 10:15 a.m. and 11:00
a.m. on August 3, 1988 while she was sunbathing on a cot on the
beach.  Sometime after 10:15 a.m., a motorist, Brenda Young, saw
a man standing by the side of the road in the vicinity of the
beach.  After the killing was reported in the press, Ms. Young
contacted the police and provided a description of this man.  The
description fit the appellant in many respects.  In particular,
Ms. Young referred to the person&#146;s very large and distinctive
nose.  She also described the person as wearing &#147;Buddy Holly
glasses&#148;.  In the courtroom, Ms. Young identified the appellant
as the person she saw at the side of the road.</pre>
    <pre>It was open to the jury to find that when the appellant realized
he was a suspect in the killing of Francine Côté, he took
extraordinary measures to hide his eyeglasses.  In fact, they
were never found by the police despite an extensive search of the
jail where the appellant was being held on another homicide.</pre>
    <pre>Something must be said about the &#147;in-dock identification&#148;.
Several days after the killing, the appellant was arrested for
another unrelated homicide, the killing of a Mr. Martin.  At that
time, his picture appeared in the paper.  Ms. Young saw this
picture and recognized the appellant as the person she saw at the
side of the road.  For tactical reasons, the defence did not
attack Ms. Young&#146;s identification on the basis that she
identified the appellant for the first time in the prisoner&#146;s
dock and the Crown accordingly did not lead evidence before the
jury about the other homicide and the appellant&#146;s picture in the
newspaper.</pre>
    <pre>There was no forensic evidence found at the scene or on the
appellant&#146;s person to connect him with the killing.
                </pre>
    <pre>               ii.  Mr. Coull&#146;s evidence
                    </pre>
    <pre>Dale Coull, a resident of Burlington, was a casual acquaintance
of the appellant&#146;s.  He testified in chief that he received a
telephone call from the appellant at approximately 12:45 p.m. on
the day of the murder.  About 20 minutes later, he met the
appellant at the Burlington Mall and drove the appellant to
Hamilton.  On the way to Hamilton, they passed the police
cruisers at the site of the murder.  The appellant was quite
edgy.  Coull stopped near the scene to get gasoline and spoke to
a man who informed him that there had been a murder.  While Coull
was talking to the gas station owner, the appellant suddenly
reached over and started the car and told Coull to get going.
The two men stopped at a tavern for a beer, and then Coull
dropped off the appellant at a restaurant in Hamilton.</pre>
    <pre>In cross-examination, Coull adopted some of his testimony from
the preliminary inquiry to the effect that the appellant called
him at 10:40 a.m. and that he picked him up at the Burlington
Mall at 11:00 a.m.  If this evidence was accurate, it was
doubtful that the appellant could have been the killer, given the
distances involved, if the appellant had no access to motorized
transportation.  On the other hand, there was some evidence that
the appellant owned a car at the time, or that he could have
caught a bus to the mall shortly after the killing.  The
appellant argues that Coull&#146;s evidence on cross-examination
provides an alibi and the trial judge&#146;s treatment of this
evidence forms one of the grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>              iii. Post-offence conduct
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>Three days after the killing, the appellant was seen in a
Burlington tavern carrying a knife hidden in the small of his
back.  The knife was never produced at trial.  However, from its
description, the jury could find that it was capable of
inflicting the wounds to the deceased.  As well, sometime in
early August of 1988, the appellant made an &#147;off the wall&#148;
comment to an acquaintance about how easy it would be to knife
somebody.</pre>
    <pre>After the appellant was charged with the Côté murder, he spoke to
his older brother who asked him where he was on the day of the
killing.  The appellant said that he was at a farm near
Orangeville.  In view of Mr. Coull&#146;s evidence, this statement was
false.  The trial judge left this testimony to the jury as
evidence of consciousness of guilt.  The appellant submits that
there was misdirection in the charge to the jury concerning this
evidence.

                 iv.  The jailhouse informants
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>Four inmates testified about statements allegedly made to them by
the appellant while he was in custody.  Three were called by the
Crown and one by the defence.  The inmates were permitted to
testify under assumed names.  The most important inmate witness
was referred to as John Doe.  He befriended the appellant soon
after he arrived at the Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre,
following his arrest on the Martin killing. Doe testified that
after the appellant was questioned by the police at the detention
centre he asked Doe to hide his eyeglasses.  Doe testified that
the appellant later told him that he had killed the deceased.  He
claimed that the appellant described the location and the manner
of the killing.  Some of the statements attributed to the
appellant by Doe are inconsistent with the physical evidence of
the place and manner of killing.  At trial, the defence argued
that Doe was a police agent and that the statements elicited from
the appellant by him were inadmissible by reason of s. 7 of the
Charter.  The trial judge admitted this evidence.  His ruling
forms one of the principal grounds of appeal.  I will return to
the evidence concerning Doe&#146;s involvement with the police when I
discuss this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Another inmate, T.D., contacted the police after he was released
from custody.  He testified that the appellant made a number of
incriminating remarks to him while they were both incarcerated at
the detention centre.  According to T.D., the appellant admitted
stabbing a woman while she was lying face down on a chaise longue
on the beach strip.  The appellant said that the victim was
wearing a green bathing suit.  The deceased&#146;s bathing suit in
fact was blue.</pre>
    <pre>G.G. was another inmate witness.  He testified that the appellant
asked him to use his connections to try to stop Doe from
testifying against him at the trial.  G.G. claimed that the
appellant admitted to the killing but he did not think that Doe
had the right to &#147;send him up for life.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>The defence called J.S. to testify.  He testified that the
appellant admitted to having strangled the deceased with her
underwear.  This was provably false.  It appears that the defence
called this evidence to demonstrate the unreliability of
jailhouse informant evidence.
THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

</pre>
    <pre>The appellant raises these grounds of appeal:
               1.   Having regard to the frailty
          of the eyewitness identification and the unreliability of the
          jailhouse informant evidence, the verdict is unreasonable.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The trial judge erred in admitting
          the evidence of John Doe.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The trial judge erred in failing to
          leave the defence of alibi to the jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   The trial judge misdirected the
          jury on the post-offence conduct left to the
          jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
          </pre>
    <pre>               5.   The trial judge did not adequately
          instruct the jury on the use to be made of
          the evidence that the appellant had a knife
          in his possession following the killing and
          the evidence of his &#147;off the wall&#148; comment.
          </pre>
    <pre>               6.   The period of parole ineligibility
          was excessive.
          </pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>               1.   The reasonableness of the verdict
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>The test to be applied by an appellate court where it is argued
that the verdict is unreasonable is well established.  In  R. v.
Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at 186, McIntyre J. described the
court&#146;s task in these terms:
                                        The function of the Court of
          Appeal, under s. 613(1)(a)(i) [now s. 686(1)(a)(i)] of the
          Criminal Code, goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence
          to support a conviction. The court must determine on the whole of
          the evidence whether the verdict is one that a properly
          instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have
          rendered. While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute
          its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the
          court must re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the
          effect of the evidence. This process will be the same whether the
          case is based on circumstantial or direct evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>As this passage demonstrates, a court of appeal must to some
extent reweigh the evidence.  Subsequent cases have also made it
clear that the court of appeal has a duty to consider the
reasonableness of the verdict, even where that verdict depends
upon findings of credibility.  Sopinka J. described the appeal
court&#146;s jurisdiction in such cases in R. v. Burke, [1996] 1
S.C.R. 474 at 481-82:
                                        According to this court in R. v. W.
          (R.) (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 134, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, special
          concerns arise in cases such as this where the alleged
          &#147;unreasonableness&#148; of the trial court's decision rests upon the
          trial judge's assessment of credibility. In these cases, the
          court of appeal must bear in mind the advantageous position of a
          trial judge in assessing the credibility of witnesses and the
          accused. As McLachlin J. stated in W. (R.), at p. 131:
          </pre>
    <pre>                         in applying the test [under s.
               686(1)(a)(i)] the court of appeal should show
               great deference to findings of credibility
               made at trial. This Court has repeatedly
               affirmed the importance of taking into
               account the special position of the trier of
               fact on matters of credibility: White v. The
               King, [1947] S.C.R. 268 at p. 272; R. v. M.
               (S.H.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446 at pp. 465-66.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Despite the &quot;special position&quot; of
          the trial court in assessing
          credibility, however, the court of
          appeal retains the power, pursuant to s.
          686(1)(a)(i), to reverse the trial
          court's verdict where the assessment of
          credibility made at trial is not
          supported by the evidence. As McLachlin
          J. stated in W. (R.), at pp. 131-32:
          </pre>
    <pre>                         as a matter of law it remains open
               to an appellate court to overturn a verdict
               based on findings of credibility where, after
               considering all the evidence and having due
               regard to the advantages afforded to the
               trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is
               unreasonable.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Thus, although the appellate court
          must be conscious of the advantages
          enjoyed by the trier of fact, reversal
          for unreasonableness remains available
          under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal
          Code where the &quot;unreasonableness&quot; of the
          verdict rests on a question of
          credibility.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I acknowledge that this is a power which
          an appellate court will exercise sparingly.
          This is not to say that an appellate court
          should shrink from exercising the power when,
          after carrying out its statutory duty, it
          concludes that the conviction rests on shaky
          ground and that it would be unsafe to
          maintain it. In conferring this power on
          appellate courts to be applied only in
          appeals by the accused, it was intended as an
          additional and salutary safeguard against the
          conviction of the innocent.
          
</pre>
    <pre>Particularly since I have concluded that John Doe&#146;s evidence was
properly admitted, I have not been persuaded that the verdict is
unreasonable.  It would be reasonable for the jury to conclude
that the person seen by Ms. Young was associated with the murder.
The movements of other people in the area were accounted for at
trial.  The description given by Ms. Young closely matches the
appellant&#146;s appearance.  The distinctive features noticed by Ms.
Young add strength to the identification.  If Mr. Coull&#146;s
evidence in chief were accepted, and it was open to the jury to
accept it, the appellant was in the Burlington area at the time
and had sufficient time to leave the scene of the killing.  His
unusual behaviour while with Mr. Coull is another piece of
circumstantial evidence.  The evidence of the appellant&#146;s
possession of a knife and his statement in the tavern, on their
own, have little probative value.  However, when combined with
the other circumstantial evidence they tend to bolster the
Crown&#146;s case.</pre>
    <pre>Finally, as I have concluded that the evidence of Doe and the
other inmates was admissible, there was direct evidence of the
appellant&#146;s guilt.  I accept that this kind of evidence is
subject to particular frailties: see R. v. Brooks (1998), 129
C.C.C. (3d) 227 (Ont. C.A.).  With the possible exception of
T.D., each of the inmate witnesses had an obvious motive to
falsely incriminate the appellant in order to obtain favours for
themselves.  Mr. Greenspan also pointed out that several of the
statements attributed to the appellant by the inmates were
inconsistent with the known facts.  As well, the defence was able
to show that much of the information allegedly obtained from the
appellant by the inmate witnesses could have been obtained from
newspaper accounts.  While this evidence must be approached with
extreme care, I cannot say that it should be accorded no weight
whatsoever.</pre>
    <pre>In conclusion, there is a body of evidence, circumstantial and
direct, upon which a reasonable jury acting judicially could
convict.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
          
                 2.   The evidence of John Doe
         </pre>
    <pre>Soon after the appellant entered the Hamilton Wentworth Detention
Centre after his arrest for the Martin homicide, rumours began
circulating that he was responsible for the Côté killing and a
group of inmates threatened the appellant.  The appellant told
Doe that he was innocent, that he had been with Peter Montour at
the time of the killing. Doe convinced the other inmates to leave
the appellant alone, and they became good friends.  One month
after the appellant arrived at the Detention Centre, he was
called off the range by a police officer.  When he returned to
the range, the appellant asked Doe to hide his eyeglasses.  Doe
and another inmate hid the glasses in a shower handle.  The
institution was searched later that day but the glasses were not
found.  Doe then contacted the police to discuss the Côté
homicide.  Thereafter, Doe had a number of conversations with the
investigating officer, Sergeant Crosby.  The appellant argued at
trial that Doe became a police agent and any statements made to
Doe were obtained in violation of the appellant&#146;s rights under s.
7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</pre>
    <pre>Following a voir dire, the trial judge held that Doe was not a
police agent and that the statements were admissible.  The trial
judge made extensive findings of fact that are not challenged on
this appeal.  Mr. Greenspan argues, however, that the legal
effect of the findings is that the appellant&#146;s rights were
violated.  The following summary is based on the trial judge&#146;s
findings.</pre>
    <pre>Doe first met with Sergeant Crosby on September 14, 1988 and told
him that he had information with respect to the Côté and Martin
homicides.  He also claimed to have the appellant&#146;s glasses
hidden away and that the police would not find them.  Doe said he
would not tell the police what the appellant had said about the
homicides, and he wanted an early release from prison.  No
agreement was reached.  It was apparent to Doe that the police
were very interested in the appellant&#146;s glasses.  He also led the
police to believe that he had already had incriminating
conversations with the appellant.  This was not true.  Doe was
&#147;conning&#148; the police.  He saw the appellant as his ticket to
freedom.</pre>
    <pre>The second meeting with Crosby took place on October 4, 1988.
Doe made several demands.  He wanted money, he wanted to be moved
to Vancouver under the Witness Protection Programme, and he
wanted his freedom.  He was most concerned about an outstanding
charge in Georgia for which a confederate was already serving a
five-year sentence.  Crosby made it clear that he could not make
any promises until he knew what Doe had to tell him.  Doe asked
Crosby, &#147;If I was to say he killed the broad, you have enough?&#148;
Crosby said that it would not be enough.  No agreement was
reached, but Crosby promised to look into the Georgia charge.  He
gave no instructions to Doe about contact with the appellant.
Crosby believed that Doe already had the information.</pre>
    <pre>Doe began to talk to the appellant about a number of criminal
schemes to gain his confidence.  By chance, Doe had run into
Peter Montour, the appellant&#146;s supposed alibi for the Côté
killing, as Montour was serving a sentence in the same detention
centre.  He told Doe that he was in prison on the day of the
killing.  After the second meeting with Crosby, Doe confronted
the appellant with his lie about the alibi.  According to Doe, he
was able to use this information to obtain a confession from the
appellant.  Doe &#147;actively elicited information&#148; from the
appellant after this second meeting with Crosby.  It was apparent
to Doe that if he could obtain information totally on his own
from the appellant implicating him in the Côté murder, Doe could
use it for his own benefit.</pre>
    <pre>Crosby met with Doe for a third time on October 17, 1988 at
Millbrook Institution, where Doe had been transferred.  By this
time, Doe had the incriminating information from the appellant.
Doe was upset about the transfer to Millbrook and wanted to be
transferred back to Hamilton-Wentworth.  Crosby arranged for the
transfer and, on October 18, drove Doe back to Hamilton.  Doe
discussed the Martin homicide but refused to talk about the Côté
homicide unless his demands were met.  The police arranged for
Doe to stay in a hotel room with his wife, and to be interviewed
by an official with the Witness Protection Programme.  The
following day, Doe finally decided to tell what he knew about the
Côté killing and Crosby agreed to look into his various demands.
Doe was later transferred to Maplehurst Institution and released
on parole.  However, the extradition on the Georgia charge
proceeded.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge made the following crucial findings concerning
Doe&#146;s relationship with the police:
                                             I accept the evidence of [Doe]
          that he did not have details of the accused's involvement in the
          Cote homicide until after the second meeting with Sergeant Crosby
          which took place on October 4th, 1988.  I am also satisfied that
          the police honestly believed the inmate [Doe] had the information
          when he first spoke to them on September 14th, and later on
          October the 4th.  In fact, [Doe] was conning the police.  He did
          not have the vital information.  But he had set on a course from
          the very beginning to use McInnis for his own benefit.  He
          followed a contrived and carefully thought-out programme to suck
          the information from McInnis.  When the police met with [Doe], I
          am satisfied that [Doe] told the police he had all of the
          information they would need with respect to the Martin and Cote
          homicides to implicate the accused McInnis.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    It is my respectful view that the
          evidence of [Doe] is admissible.  [Doe] was
          not procured by the police.  He was not used
          by the authorities to subvert the accused's
          right to silence.  He was not conscripted by
          the police.  He was acting on his own.  The
          crucial time when the determination must be
          made as to whether [Doe] was an agent of the
          police is the time that he got the
          information.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    [Doe] is a citizen who happened to
          be lodged in the Detention Centre.  The
          investigating officer did not conscript or
          procure [Doe].  [Doe] approached him.  There
          was no deal made, no agreement reached and no
          encouragement provided by Sergeant Crosby.
          He made it clear that he could not entertain
          any demands until he had the information in
          the possession of [Doe].  [Doe] refused to
          discuss the Cote homicide and a game of cat
          and mouse went on.  The investigating officer
          emphatically told the inmate that he could
          make no promises.  However, he did indicate
          at one point that he would look into the
          potential charges in Georgia to see what the
          status was at that particular time.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    [Doe] was on a mission of his own
          long before he met Sergeant Crosby.  He had
          secured the trust and confidence of McInnis
          by his actions during the latter weeks of
          August and early September.  The search for
          the glasses and [Doe&#146;s] assistance to the
          accused provided the catalyst that started
          the inmate [Doe] on his mission.  He decided
          to contact the police and spoke to them.  He
          told them he had the information.  He wanted
          certain demands before he would even discuss
          the Cote homicide.  The police made it clear
          there was no deal.  If he wanted to provide
          the information Sergeant Crosby undertook to
          look into the demands but he had to have the
          information first.  And the key point, and I
          emphasize this, is that Sergeant Crosby
          honestly believed that [Doe] had the
          information.  He did not counsel [Doe] to get
          the information that he did in the exercise
          yard shortly after the second meeting.  [Doe]
          was waiting for his opening and after he
          discovered Montour in the jail and came to
          his own conclusion that the alibi was a
          phony, he confronted the accused head on and
          was able to skillfully, totally on his own,
          without any complicity by the police, obtain
          the vital information.  He did not tell the
          police when he got the information.  He
          remained mum and began his negotiations.
          After he was transferred to Millbrook it was
          then that he began to trust the police and he
          gave informal information, upon the assurance
          that he would be transferred back to Hamilton
          to be with his family.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In the particular circumstances of
          this case, I find that the inmate [Doe] was
          not an agent of the police when he obtained
          the vital information shortly after the
          second interview with the police on
          October 4th, 1988.  On the facts of this
          case, [Doe] was not a police agent and this
          case is outside of the ambit of Hebert.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>This trial took place in June 1991.  Accordingly, the trial judge
had the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.  Hebert concerned the
admissibility of statements made by a detainee to an undercover
police officer.  In the later decision in R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 595, the Supreme Court dealt directly with the
admissibility of statements made to inmates who, like Doe, are
alleged to be acting as state agents.  Notwithstanding that the
trial judge did not have the benefit of Broyles, I am satisfied
that his finding that the appellant&#146;s rights under s. 7 of the
Charter were not breached is consistent with that decision.</pre>
    <pre>In Hebert, the Supreme Court held that the authorities violate a
detainee&#146;s right to silence, as protected by s. 7 of the Charter,
when an undercover police officer, posing as a fellow inmate,
actively elicits information from the detainee.  In Broyles, the
police equipped a private citizen, a friend of the accused, with
a bodypack and had him visit the accused at the jail.  The
accused in Broyles argued that his right to silence was infringed
by this conduct of the state.  Iacobucci J. held that conduct by
a private citizen could infringe a detainee&#146;s right to silence if
the citizen were acting as an agent of the state and if he or she
were to elicit the information from a detainee.  Iacobucci J. set
out tests for determining whether a citizen is acting as an agent
of the state and what type of conduct constitutes elicitation.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge in this case found that Doe actively elicited
information from the appellant.  Thus, in this appeal, only the
agent-of-the-state question is in issue.  Iacobucci J. formulated
the following test for when a citizen may become an agent of the
state for the purposes of s. 7 of the Charter at pp. 607-609:
                                        In every case where the right to
          silence is raised, the threshold question will be: was the person
          who allegedly subverted the right to silence an agent of the
          state? In answering this question one should remember that the
          purpose of the right to silence is to limit the use of the
          coercive power of the state to force an individual to incriminate
          himself or herself; it is not to prevent individuals from
          incriminating themselves per se. Accordingly, if the person to
          whom the impugned remarks is [sic] made is not an agent of the
          state, there will be no violation of the right to silence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               In determining whether or not the
          informer is a state agent, it is appropriate
          to focus on the effect of the relationship
          between the informer and the authorities on
          the particular exchange or contact with the
          accused. A relationship between the informer
          and the state is relevant for the purposes of
          s. 7 only if it affects the circumstances
          surrounding the making of the impugned
          statement. A relationship between the
          informer and the authorities which develops
          after the statement is made, or which in no
          way affects the exchange between the informer
          and the accused, will not make the informer a
          state agent for the purposes of the exchange
          in question. Only if the relationship between
          the informer and the state is such that the
          exchange between the informer and the accused
          is materially different from what it would
          have been had there been no such relationship
          should the informer be considered a state
          agent for the purposes of the exchange. I
          would, accordingly, adopt the following
          simple test: would the exchange between the
          accused and the informer have taken place, in
          the form and manner in which it did take
          place, but for the intervention of the state
          or its agents?
          </pre>
    <pre>               If this test is applied to a
          conversation between a police officer and a
          suspect in custody, it is clear that the
          conversation would not have taken place but
          for the intervention of the officer. If it is
          applied to a conversation with a cellmate who
          has no contact with the authorities until
          after the conversation is concluded, it is
          equally clear that the actions of the
          authorities had no effect on the
          conversation, and that there would be no
          violation of the s. 7 right to silence. If,
          however, the cell mate spoke with the
          authorities before the conversation took
          place, then the question will be whether the
          conversation would have occurred or would
          have taken the same course had the cell mate
          had no contact with the authorities.
          </pre>
    <pre>               I would add that there may be
          circumstances in which the authorities
          encourage informers to elicit statements
          without there being a preexisting
          relationship between the authorities and
          individual informers. For example, the
          authorities may provide an incentive for the
          elicitation of incriminating statements by
          making it known that they will pay for such
          information or that they will charge the
          informer with a less serious offence. The
          question in such cases will be the same:
          would the exchange between the informer and
          the accused have taken place but for the
          inducements of the authorities?  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>On the findings of fact made by the trial judge, Doe was not an
agent of the state.  It is important to note that the
incriminating conversations took place between the second and
third meetings and before Doe was transferred to Millbrook.  The
conversations also took place before any agreement had been
reached with Doe, and at a time that the police believed Doe
already had the information and before Sergeant Crosby arranged
to have Doe returned to Hamilton.  However, most important are
the findings by the trial judge that Doe set about on a course to
find out as much information as possible from the appellant
&#147;totally on his own&#148; and &#147;totally on his own mission&#148;.  Doe had
set out on a course &#147;from the very beginning to use [the
appellant] for his own benefit&#148; and was on a &#147;mission of his own
long before he met Sergeant Crosby&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>In those circumstances, it is apparent that the authorities had
no effect on the conversation.  On the findings made by the trial
judge, the conversations would have occurred or would have taken
the same course had Doe had no contact with Sergeant Crosby.  Doe
was intent on using the appellant for his own purposes and would
have elicited the information from the appellant even if he had
not met with Crosby on October 4th.</pre>
    <pre>This holding is consistent with the recent decision of the
Supreme Court in R. v. M. (M.R.) (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 361.
One of the issues in that case was whether a school vice-
principal was an agent of the state when he conducted a search of
a pupil in the presence of a police officer.  At p. 376, Cory J.,
speaking for the majority of the court, held that the Broyles
test applied:
                                        Applying the test to this case, it
          must be determined whether the search of the appellant would have
          taken place, in the form and in the manner in which it did, but
          for the involvement of the police.  The evidence, in my opinion,
          demonstrates that it would have taken place and was not
          materially different than it would have been if there had been no
          police involvement.  Although Mr. Cadue knew that criminal
          charges might result, the primary motive for the search was the
          enforcement of school discipline, for which he was responsible.
          There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the vice-
          principal initiated the search or conducted it differently
          because of police intervention.  It is thus apparent that the
          vice-principal was not acting as an agent of the police.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>In this case, there is evidence from which the trial judge could
have found that the exchange between the appellant and Doe was
conducted differently because of the police intervention.  I note
in particular the statement by Sergeant Crosby to Doe on October
4, 1988 that a simple admission from the appellant that he killed
Cote was &#147;not enough&#148;.  However, the trial judge found otherwise
and I cannot say that this finding is unreasonable, or that he
otherwise erred in principle in concluding that the appellant&#146;s
rights under s. 7 were not violated.  Accordingly, Doe&#146;s evidence
was properly admitted.

                 3.   The defence of alibi
          
</pre>
    <pre>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to
place the defence of alibi before the jury.  This submission is
based upon the evidence given by Mr. Coull, the acquaintance who
picked the appellant up at the Burlington Mall and drove him to
Hamilton on the date of the murder.  It will be recalled that in
cross-examination, Coull adopted his preliminary inquiry evidence
that he received a telephone call from the appellant at about
10:40 a.m. and picked the appellant up at the mall about twenty
minutes later.  Coull also testified that on the way to Hamilton,
after passing the murder scene, the appellant said that it was
11:00 a.m. and suggested that they stop for a drink at a tavern,
which they did.  This evidence is completely inconsistent with
Coull&#146;s testimony in chief.  Mr. Greenspan argues, however, that
if Coull&#146;s version of events given in cross-examination were
accepted then Coull provides an alibi for the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>In the charge to the jury, the trial judge reviewed Coull&#146;s
evidence on this point extensively.  He did not, however, use the
term &#147;alibi&#148; in relating that evidence to the issues in the case.</pre>
    <pre>In my view, the fact that the trial judge did not refer expressly
to the cross-examination version of Coull&#146;s evidence as an alibi
did not constitute misdirection.  The jury could not have failed
to appreciate the significance of the two different versions
given by Coull and that the cross-examination version narrowed
the appellant&#146;s opportunity to have committed the offence.
Further, strictly speaking, Coull&#146;s evidence did not actually
provide an alibi for the appellant.  On the cross-examination
version of Coull&#146;s evidence, it was unlikely that the appellant
killed the deceased.  It was not, however, impossible if the
appellant did not make the telephone call from the mall, or if he
had access to motorized transportation from the beach to the
mall.  The appellant did not testify and led no other evidence to
support Coull&#146;s cross-examination version of events.</pre>
    <pre>Finally, I have carefully reviewed Coull&#146;s evidence.  To be
charitable, it is confusing.  In re-examination, he agreed that
even at the preliminary inquiry he used the time of 12:45 p.m.
for the time of the call from the appellant.  Coull&#146;s final
position, at the end of cross-examination and reexamination and
questioning by the trial judge, was that he could not recall the
time that he received the telephone call or when he picked up the
appellant.  In the final analysis, he provides very limited
support for the defence theory that the appellant did not have
the opportunity to commit the offence.  In addition, the version
of events based on the theory that the call was made at 10:40
a.m. is inconsistent with other aspects of Coull&#146;s evidence,
which he used to fix the times he testified to in examination-in-
chief, such as the errands he ran in the morning.  Further, Coull
seems to have come to the 10:40 a.m. time based in part on the
appellant telling him that they stopped at the tavern at 11:00
a.m.  However, throughout his testimony Coull maintained that he
passed the police cruisers that were at the scene of the murder
before stopping at the tavern.  The first police officer did not
arrive at the scene, however, until 11:03 a.m.  In my view, it
would not have assisted the appellant for the trial judge to have
characterized some of that evidence expressly as providing an
alibi.

          4.   Post-offence conduct
          [Consciousness of guilt]
          
</pre>
    <pre>The appellant told his brother that he was in Orangeville at the
time of the killing and he told the inmate Doe that he was with
Peter Montour.  Montour was the owner of the restaurant in
Hamilton where Coull dropped off the appellant on the day of the
killing.  The trial judge left both pieces of evidence to the
jury as capable of constituting evidence of consciousness of
guilt.  Mr. Greenspan makes two submissions.  He argues that the
Crown did not prove that these statements were an attempt to
create a false alibi.  Alternatively, he argues that the charge
to the jury on the use to be made of this evidence was
inadequate.</pre>
    <pre>For the post-offence conduct relied upon in this case to give
rise to an inference of guilt it would seem that it is not
necessary that the Crown show that it was an attempt by the
appellant to fabricate an alibi.  Obviously, evidence of a
deliberate attempt to mislead the police and evade prosecution
could give rise to an inference of guilt:  R. v. White, [1998] 2
S.C.R. 72 at 85  However, any lie relating to the offence may be
capable of giving rise to an inference of guilt.  Thus, in R. v.
Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129 at 143, Major J. wrote that:
                                        It is well established that an
          inference of guilt may be drawn from circumstantial evidence such
          as flight from the scene of a crime or the fabrication of lies
          relating to the offence in question.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>In J.H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, J.H.
Chadbourn, ed. Vol II (Toronto:  Little, Brown and Company, 1979)
at §267 the author wrote that &#147;almost any conduct may be open to
this inference.  The kinds of behaviors which may properly
suggest such a cause are beyond enumeration; they are as various
and as changeable as men&#146;s dispositions and emotions.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>There does not seem to have been any objection at trial to the
admission of this evidence on the basis that the Crown could not
show that the appellant was, by these falsehoods, attempting to
fabricate an alibi.  There was sufficient evidence from which a
jury could conclude that the appellant&#146;s statements to his
brother and Doe as to his whereabouts at the time of the killing
were false.  The testimony of Dale Coull placed the appellant in
Burlington at the time of the offence.  The falsity of the
statements could also be inferred from the fact that the
appellant gave conflicting accounts of his whereabouts:  R. v.
Ruddick (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 421 (Ont. C.A.) at 440.</pre>
    <pre>However, the charge to the jury with respect to consciousness of
guilt was not complete.  As pointed out by Martin J.A. in R. v.
Ruddick, at p. 441 it is not every false statement made following
an offence that is capable of constituting evidence of
consciousness of guilt &#147;but only those lies which fairly support
an inference of a consciousness of guilt&#148;.  In the main part of
the charge, the trial judge made this clear for the lie to the
appellant&#146;s brother.  He instructed the jury that only if they
found that the statement was a deliberate lie and was prompted by
a consciousness of guilt could they infer a consciousness of
guilt.  However, the charge to the jury should have directed the
jury to consider any innocent explanation for the post-offence
conduct.  See, for example, R. v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72 at
106-107:
                                        A good deal of the difficulty
          disappears once the discussion of &quot;consciousness of guilt&quot; is
          eliminated from the trial judge's instruction. It is preferable
          simply, in the spirit of Morin, to leave evidence of flight or
          concealment evaluated, but somewhat at large until the final
          stage of putting all the evidence together and seeing if it
          proves the case beyond a reasonable doubt. As previously noted,
          there is a risk that juries might jump too quickly from evidence
          of post-offence conduct to an inference of guilt. However, the
          best way for a trial judge to address that danger is simply to
          make sure that the jury are aware of any other explanations for
          the accused's actions, and that they know they should reserve
          their final judgment about the meaning of the accused's conduct
          until all the evidence has been considered in the normal course
          of their deliberations. Beyond such a cautionary instruction, the
          members of jury should be left to draw whatever inferences they
          choose from the evidence at the end of the day.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>However, the appellant did not testify and no explanation emerges
in the evidence for the lie told to his brother.  In my view, a
more complete direction would not have assisted the appellant in
respect to that falsehood:  R. v. Ruddick, at p. 441.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge did not deal with the lie to Doe in the main
charge.  He dealt with that alleged falsehood only in the
recharge, apparently in response to an objection from Crown
counsel.1  The recharge on consciousness of guilt was as follows:
				               Just out of an abundance of
          caution, I think I should tell you that when I spoke to you about
          consciousness of guilt, and I referred to the statement made by
          the accused according to Charles McInnis, his older brother, to
          the effect that he was up north on the day in question, there was
          also the evidence of [Doe] who said that the accused told him on
          August 9th that he worked that day, that he was innocent and, at
          some point, told him that he had lunch with Peter Montour and had
          business dealings with him.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Now with respect to that evidence,
          first of all, dealing with Charles McInnis,
          if you accept the fact that he said that to
          his brother, that he was up north that day
          looking at a farm, and if you accept the fact
          that that is not true, that he was not up
          north, that he was in Burlington, and if you
          accept the fact, not that you just don't
          believe it but that it was a deliberate lie
          on the part of the accused, a complete
          fabrication on his part, it is open to you to
          infer that he did so out of a consciousness
          of guilt, and that indicates a consciousness
          of guilt.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    You are also entitled to similarly
          use the statement, if you find they were
          made, to [Doe] that he was at work that day
          and later told him that he had lunch in the
          afternoon with Montour at his restaurant.  If
          you were to find that either or both of those
          statements were not true and they were
          deliberate untruths or fabrications on the
          part of the accused, not just that you don't
          accept that evidence but you don't believe &#150;
          you believe he said it but that you don't
          believe it was true, that is not sufficient.
          You have got to then find that he
          deliberately tried to deceive the person to
          whom he was speaking, and that it was a
          complete fabrication.  Then and only then can
          you infer consciousness of guilt.

    <pre>Thus, the trial judge instructed the jury that they had to find
that the statement to Doe was a deliberate falsehood.  He erred,
however, in failing to instruct the jury that these falsehoods
only had probative value as evidence of guilt in the absence of
an innocent explanation.  The lie told to Doe is of a somewhat
different character from the lie told to the appellant&#146;s brother.
An explanation does, in a sense, emerge from the evidence in
Doe&#146;s testimony.  The falsehood to Doe may have been part of the
appellant&#146;s attempt to convince Doe he was not responsible for
the death of Ms. Côté.  In this way, he might have hoped to
enlist Doe&#146;s help in protecting him from retaliation from the
prison population.</pre>
    <pre>It remains to consider the effect of this error.  The Crown
argued that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
resulted and urged the court to dismiss the appeal in accordance
with s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.  In my view, this
error was relatively minor.  Since the appellant did not testify
the reason for the false story to Doe was in one sense
speculative.  The real probative value of Doe&#146;s evidence was not
the falsehood the appellant allegedly gave about his whereabouts,
but that, when Doe confronted him that he knew this to be untrue,
the appellant confessed.  The trial judge gave a lengthy warning
about the risk of relying upon Doe&#146;s evidence.  In my view, no
substantial wrong was occasioned by this error.
                                  
      5.   The charge to the jury concerning the appellant&#146;s 
 	   possession of a knife following the killing
          
</pre>
    <pre>Mr. Greenspan submitted that the evidence concerning the
appellant&#146;s possession of a knife and his statement about the
ease with which someone could be knifed had no probative value
and that the jury should have been so instructed.  Mr. Greenspan
based this submission primarily on the theory that this evidence
really related to the Martin homicide.  However, as indicated,
counsel had agreed that no reference would be made at this trial
to the Martin homicide.  This was a reasonable tactical decision,
and I do not think it is now open to the appellant to argue that
had the jury been aware of the Martin homicide they would have
realized that this evidence related primarily to that killing.</pre>
    <pre>I do agree with Mr. Greenspan that this evidence had only limited
probative value.  In my view, however, the trial judge adequately
dealt with this evidence and the jury would not have given it
undue weight.  This evidence came from two witnesses, Michael
Stuart and Julia Dawkins.  The trial judge reviewed their
evidence in the following manner:
                                             Michael Stuart and Julia
          Dawkins: Michael Stuart's evidence has a limited use but it may
          be probative, depending how you look at it.  Here he is sitting
          in a bar with a man he is acquainted with.  The man appears to be
          in a bit of a trance, that is the sum and substance of his
          evidence.  And right on the day of the homicide, or a day or so
          after, he says that the accused said to him, &quot;How easy it would
          be to knife somebody in this place, particularly if you weren't
          known&quot;.  But he is not really saying it to him.  He is sort of
          saying it at large, as he is looking off in the distance.  What
          do you make of that?  Well, if you accept that evidence and that
          happened and that is what the accused said to him, that is
          evidence that you can use to show that the accused, at the
          relevant time, had thoughts of a random knifing.  But that is for
          you to determine.  It may be nothing more than a musing that only
          takes on some significance after he is charged, if you found it
          happened.  It has limited use, but it may be probative.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    You have Julia Dawkins.  On
          August 6th, she is at a bar, the same bar.
          She is the bartenderess or waitress.  I
          wasn't certain, but in any event, I think she
          was the bartender.  At 9:30 she is off duty
          and she is socializing.  Now this is three
          days after the homicide.  This man has got a
          10 inch knife stuck down the back of his
          pants, under his T shirt.  It is suggested to
          you that it is a rough bar and it is a
          logical reason for carrying this knife, and
          it may be.  But she says he had a knife.  She
          could see it.  It concerned her enough that
          she tried to get her boyfriend to get the
          knife off him.  She told the owner of the
          bar.  The boyfriend lifts up the T shirt and
          there is the knife.  She described it.  Not
          an everyday occurrence, even in the Carlana,
          because you heard evidence from the other
          people that they had never seen any weapons
          there.  It doesn't mean they weren't there,
          but still three days afterwards he has got a
          knife.  It is a piece of circumstantial
          evidence.  By itself it proves nothing, but
          it is proximate in time to the homicide, and
          it is in his possession inside his pants.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    So that, in and around the time of
          the homicide, if you accept Stuart's
          evidence, he is musing about knifing.  On
          August 6th, he has got a knife on his person,
          which later on in the night, is in a
          different location in his pant pocket.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal and
I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.
                                        
		6.   The period of parole ineligibility was excessive.
          
</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge set the period of parole ineligibility at 24
years.  The jury, who did not know about the appellant&#146;s criminal
record or the other killing, recommended that the appellant not
be eligible for parole for 20 years.  The appellant was 53 years
of age at the time of sentencing.  He has a lengthy criminal
record including convictions for crimes of violence both in
Canada and the United States.  He was convicted of rape in 1961
in New Jersey.  In 1979, he was sentenced in Ontario to 10 years
imprisonment for a violent rape.  The appellant was on mandatory
supervision at the time he committed this murder.</pre>
    <pre>The Criminal Code required the trial judge to have regard to the
character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the
circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the
recommendation, if any, of the jury in setting the period of
parole ineligibility.  In considering the character of the
appellant, it was open to the trial judge to take into
consideration that within days of this murder, the appellant
killed another person in circumstances amounting to manslaughter.</pre>
    <pre>The killing of Ms. Côté was a brutal, senseless and unprovoked
act on a completely innocent young woman.  It was cruel and
sadistic.  The trial judge described the appellant as a &#147;vicious
person who can only be described as a psychopath.&#148;  He saw no
hope for rehabilitation of the appellant.  No material was
produced to undermine the correctness of that assessment.</pre>
    <pre>This court&#146;s jurisdiction to interfere with the order made by the
trial judge is limited:  R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227.
I see no basis for interfering with the order.  See R. v. Olsen
(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 355 (Ont. C.A.).
                                        DISPOSITION
          
</pre>
    <pre>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction and from
the period of parole ineligibility.
