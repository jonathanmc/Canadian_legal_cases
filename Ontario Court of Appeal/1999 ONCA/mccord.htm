    <pre>HEARD:         March 22, 1999</pre>
    <pre>               On appeal from the judgment of Cosgrove J. dated
	       June 23, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  main issue in this appeal is whether Justice  Cosgrove
erred  in dismissing the mother&#146;s application for custody without
a trial of an issue.  The corollary issue was whether he erred in
not  referring  the  custody  and access  determinations  to  the
Provincial Court judge hearing the adoption matter.
[2]  In our view, he erred with respect to both matters.  The
effect of Cosgrove J.&#146;s order is to deprive both parents of legal
custody and to leave unresolved the outstanding access issues.
This uncertainty cannot be said to be in the child&#146;s best
interests.  The child is entitled to know who has legal custody
and what access rights she will have to the other parent.
Because of the conflicts in the evidence, the resolution of these
issues requires a trial.  The matters of adoption, custody and
access are integrally related and should be determined together.
Since the Provincial Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear the
adoption issue, it should also hear the other two matters.
[3]  Accordingly, we allow the appeal, set aside paragraphs 3, 4
and 5 of the order of Cosgrove J., and direct that the trial of
the custody and access issues be heard in the Provincial Court.
In the circumstances, there will be no costs.
