    <pre>               Karl Arvai, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 30, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Quinn J. dated September 18th, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We think the appeal fails and must be dismissed.  The appeal
was from the quantum of damages assessed under each of the heads
of general damage, loss of income and the family law claim.  Mr.
Thompson has carefully reviewed the facts of the case and the
evidence with respect to each of these heads of damages.  Having
done so, while we think that the assessment for each of general
damages and the family law claim was high, we cannot say, on the
facts as they have been put to us, that they were grossly
excessive.  We will not interfere.
[2]  As to the claim for loss of wages, we think there was
evidence on which the jury could calculate this loss and arrive
at the figure which they did.  Accordingly, the appeal with
respect to that claim also fails.
[3]  In the result, then, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
