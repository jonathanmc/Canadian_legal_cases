    <pre>[1]  In our opinion the motions judge was correct in finding that
the terms of the policy cannot be stretched to cover the Geen
allegations as set out in her statement of claim.

[2]  The thrust of the liability coverage that is relevant in
this case is the protection of the insureds, the appellants,
against liability for actions which inflict damage to the
property of a third party. We do not think this coverage can be
expanded to reach these circumstances where, at the time of the
occurrence (the appellants' alleged negligent misrepresentation),
the third party, Geen, had no interest in the property said to be
damaged but rather acquired that property thereafter.

[3]  At best, the Geen claim is for compensation for the
insureds' action which caused Ms. Geen to acquire property which
was other than it was represented to be. In our view, this is not
within the liability coverage of this policy.

[4]  The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
