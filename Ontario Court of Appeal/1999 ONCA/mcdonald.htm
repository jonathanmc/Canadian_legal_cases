    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellants took exception to the admission of the
affidavit of Jeffrey Nicholson in support of the motion made
before Flinn J.   His reasons for judgment refer, in two places,
to the fact that the parties had consented to the filing of that
affidavit, and that consent, apparently given pursuant to rule
21.01(2)(a),  would appear to be a complete answer to the
appellants' objection.  In any event, we wish to make it clear
that we place no reliance upon Mr. Nicholson's affidavit beyond
the identification of the pieces of correspondence that are
reproduced as exhibits and the transmittal of those pieces of
correspondence to the persons to whom they are shown to have been
sent.

[2]       The essence of the claim against the defendants in the
action is that copies of the three letters dated September  5th,
1996 sent by the appellants to Mr. Justice McLean were forwarded
to Deputy Judge Taylor with a request for his response, without
statutory authority to do so pursuant to the Courts of Justice
Act.   We respectfully agree with Flinn J. that Mr. Justice
McLean was entitled to make the investigation implicit under
s.33.1(2) of the Act into the complaints made in those letters
and, in doing so, to have a report furnished to him by Deputy
Judge Taylor.  In obtaining that report, it was appropriate for
Mr. Justice McLean, acting in good faith,  to forward to Deputy
Judge Taylor copies of the letters of complaint so that he could
properly respond to them.  We further agree with Flinn J. that
the immunity from liability conferred by s.33.1(21) of the Act
applies to insulate the respondents from the action brought
against them by the appellants.  In addition, and apart entirely
from that subsection, there is no cause of action against the
respondent LeSage for negligence in duties that can be
characterized, at their highest, as public law duties and not
private law duties of care owed to the appellants.

[3]       Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
