    <pre>APPEAL FROM:   Her Honour Judge Hogan
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                


</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the Crown against the 12-month
conditional term of imprisonment imposed by Judge Hogan of the
Ontario Court (Provincial Division) following the respondent&#146;s
conviction, on his guilty plea, to a charge of assault causing
bodily harm.

[2]  It is the position of the Crown that the trial judge erred
in principle:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i) by imposing a conditional sentence where 
	       neither the Crown, nor the respondent, had 
	       submitted that such a disposition was 
	       appropriate, and where counsel for the parties
               had not been given the opportunity to make 
	       submissions in respect to the fitness of such
	       a disposition; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii)  in imposing a conditional sentence
               notwithstanding  her  finding  that  the
               respondent  was a continuing  danger  to
               society.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The Crown submitted that if we find the trial judge erred in
principle, we are entitled to review the fitness of the sentence,
which the Crown contends was unfit, having regard to the findings
of the trial judge, the circumstances surrounding the commission
of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.

[4]  The respondent pleaded guilty to assaulting a television
journalist by punching him in the face and breaking his nose.
This occurred during a fracas which developed in front of the
main entrance to the Courthouse at 361 University Avenue in
Toronto following an attempt by a television cameraman to make a
video tape of a friend of the respondent who, apparently, did not
want him to do so.  Although the respondent entered the fracas as
a peacemaker, his assault of the victim was unprovoked, and was
unwarranted.

[5]  The respondent was almost 19 years old when the offence took
place.  He was six days shy of his twentieth birthday when he was
sentenced.  It is true that the respondent experienced a
difficult childhood, having been placed in 38 foster arrangements
between the ages of 6 and 16.  However, from the evidence led by
the Crown on the sentencing it appears that he has been
associated with groups espousing white supremacist views, and
which advocate group violence as part of their identity.

[6]  As well, at the time of sentencing the respondent had been
convicted of 16 offences, including 8 convictions for assault.
At the time he committed this assault, he was on probation
following his release from prison after serving a sentence for
assault with a weapon.  In addition, at the time of sentencing he
was detained in custody awaiting trial on four charges of
assault, and charges of escaping custody, wilfully promoting
hatred and failing to comply with a recognizance.  He has since
been sentenced to 18 months on the assault charges and the charge
of escaping custody, this sentence having been completed last
month.  He is, at present, detained in custody on the other
charges.

[7]  Dealing with the appellant&#146;s first ground of appeal, it is
significant that in their submissions to the trial judge counsel
for the Crown and the respondent asked her to impose a term of
imprisonment.  The Crown suggested the appropriate term was 18
months, while counsel for the respondent suggested 3 months would
be appropriate.  They each felt that the maximum period of
probation &#150; 3 years &#150; should follow.

[8]  However, the trial judge, on her own, imposed a conditional
sentence.  She did not give counsel the opportunity to make
submissions relative to the fitness of a conditional sentence.
Having come to the opinion that a conditional sentence was in her
opinion an option, she should have asked counsel if they wished
to make submissions.  Indeed, it is our view that she was
required to do so by s.723(1) of the Criminal Code.  In failing
to do so, she erred in principle.

[9]  Although Counsel did not make a joint submission in respect
to sentence, it is our view that the following statement of this
court in R. v. Reid, released march 18, 1999, applies to the
circumstances of this appeal:</pre>
    <pre>          The trial judge erred in ignoring the joint submission
        of the Crown and defence counsel and substituting a conditional
        sentence for that agreed upon without hearing the submissions
        that the Crown was prepared to advance as to why a conditional
        sentence was not appropriate.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Dealing with the appellant&#146;s second ground of appeal, it is
clear from reviewing her reasons as a whole that the trial judge
considered the respondent to be a risk to the safety of the
community.  For example, toward the beginning of her reasons, the
trial judge stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>            In terms of Mr. McFarlane&#146;s propensity to violence, all I
        must do is examine his criminal record; with eight prior
        convictions for assault, clearly this is a young man with a
        propensity for violence.  [Emphasis in original]</pre>
    <pre>[11] Under s.742.1(b) of the Criminal Code, prior to making a
sentence conditional, a trial judge must be satisfied that
&#147;serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the
safety of the community&#148;.  If the safety of the public will be
endangered by a community based sentence, then a conditional
sentence may not be imposed:  R. v. Wismayer (1997), 115 C.C.C.
(3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.).

[12] The trial judge failed to make the finding that was required
by s.742.1(b).  Rather, she entered into an exercise of balancing
whether the respondent would pose a greater danger to the
community if he were to be imprisoned, without treatment, or if
he were to receive a conditional sentence, with treatment.  It is
clear from the judge&#146;s reasons, that in either event the
respondent would represent a danger to the community.
Ultimately, she concluded that &#147;the community will be better
protected with a conditional sentence&#148;. She added her view that
the community will be &#147;at less risk than it might be were Mr.
McFarlane to be released after a jail term of some length&#148;.

[13] That imprisonment might increase the risk of the respondent
endangering the community does not satisfy the prerequisite of
s.742.1(b).  The section does not contemplate differing degrees
of dangerousness, but is clearly intended to remove the
possibility of a conditional sentence once any risk to the safety
of the community is found.  Consequently, the trial judge&#146;s
reasons demonstrate an error in principle with respect to a
fundamental prerequisite of a conditional sentence as mandated by
s.742.1(b).

[14] Having reached the conclusion that the trial judge committed
two errors in principle, this court is entitled to review the
fitness of the sentence imposed.  That review compels the
conclusion, based on the circumstances of the offence and the
circumstances of the offender, that a conditional sentence was
not warranted.  As this court has observed, circumstances
particular to the offence and the offender in cases of personal
violence will often militate against the imposition of a
conditional sentence:  R. v. M.R., [1998] O.J. No. 737.  In our
view, this unprovoked assault committed by an offender who has
exhibited a history of violence clearly calls for denunciation.

[15] Accordingly, leave to appeal the sentence is granted and the
appeal is allowed.  The conditional sentence is to be converted
to a custodial sentence of 12 months, to be served consecutive to
any sentence currently being served.  In all other respects, we
would not interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</pre>
