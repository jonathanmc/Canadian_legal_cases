    <pre>HEARD:         March 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Charron J. dated March 12, 1993.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  At the conclusion of oral argument, the court indicated that
the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.  We deal with
each of the grounds of appeal below.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Jurisdiction to try the case without a jury</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was tried on a charge of first degree murder
by Charron J., without a jury.  The case attracted considerable
notoriety in Ottawa, where the killing took place, and in the
rest of the country.  The appellant and his counsel were
concerned that the appellant could not obtain a fair trial in
Ottawa.  From the appellant&#146;s point of view at trial, however, a
change of venue was not a reasonable alternative and he made no
such application.  The reasons for not seeking a change of venue
need not be detailed.  Suffice it to say that there was evidence
from which the trial judge could conclude that, in the unusual
circumstances, a change of venue would interfere with the
appellant&#146;s right to make full answer and defence.  The remedy
sought at trial by the appellant was a trial before a judge
without a jury.  Charron J. granted that remedy. The appellant
argues, contrary to his counsel's position at trial, that the
trial judge should have granted a change of venue of her own
motion over the objections of both the Crown and defence counsel.
He now complains that she erred in granting the remedy requested
and that she had no jurisdiction to try him without a jury.
[3]  The problem arose because, despite the evidence
demonstrating that the appellant could not receive a fair trial
by an impartial jury, the Crown refused to consent, as required
by s. 473 of the Criminal Code, to a trial by judge alone.  The
trial judge found that although the Crown&#146;s position was that an
impartial jury could be empanelled through the use of traditional
Criminal Code procedures, an informed person viewing the matter
realistically and practically would conclude that the Crown was
seeking a favourable jury, rather than simply an impartial one.
She also found, based on the evidence placed before her, that the
exercise of the Crown&#146;s discretion in refusing to consent to a
trial by judge alone resulted in an infringement of the
appellant&#146;s right to a trial by an independent and impartial
tribunal, as guaranteed by ss. 11(d) and 7 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.  In view of that finding, the trial judge
held that the appellant was entitled to a remedy under s. 24(1)
of the Charter.  The remedy granted was to dispense with the
Crown&#146;s consent under s. 473.
[4]  We have not been persuaded that in the unusual circumstances
of this case, the trial judge erred.  There was evidence upon
which she could find, as she did, that the Crown&#146;s conduct would
infringe the appellant&#146;s rights.  The remedy was one she was
entitled to give.  In R. v. E. (L.) (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 228
(Ont. C.A.), this court held that in narrow circumstances, where
the conduct of the Crown threatens to deprive an accused of his
right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Charter, a trial judge
has the right to override the Crown&#146;s refusal to consent to a
trial by judge alone.  Thus, at p. 241, Finlayson J.A. writing
for the court held:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While I do not believe that the Crown has an unfettered
          right to withhold consent to a re-election under s. 561(1)(c),
          the court cannot review this exercise of statutory discretion
          relating to the mode of trial unless it has been demonstrated on
          the record that there has been an abuse of the court's process
          through oppressive proceedings on the part of the Crown. I would
          think that there would have to be some showing before the trial
          judge that the Crown had exercised its discretion arbitrarily,
          capriciously or for some improper motive so as to invite an
          examination as to whether there was an abuse of process under s.
          7 of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>and at p. 243:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I recognize that a trial judge must have some
          flexibility in ensuring that the prosecution does not
          overreach when asserting Crown prerogatives. &#133; In my
          opinion, based on the authority of Turpin, supra, a
          trial judge can only supplant or ignore the clear
          language of the Code when constitutional considerations
          are engaged. The level of intervention in this case
          required a finding that the conduct of the Crown
          amounted to an abuse of process.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[5]  On the findings made by the trial judge, which were open to
her on the evidence, constitutional considerations were engaged.
Accordingly, the court was properly constituted.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Admissibility of the appellant&#146;s statements to the police</pre>
    <pre>[6]  At the conclusion of the voir dire to determine the
admissibility of the appellant&#146;s statements to the police,
experienced defence counsel conceded that the statements were
admissible, and asked that they all be admitted.  The only
defence raised at trial was insanity.  The appellant did not
testify.  All of the experts, including the defence experts,
relied upon these statements as part of the material forming the
basis for their opinions.  The decision to concede the
admissibility of the statements was obviously an informed one.
There was nothing on the record to suggest any reason why the
trial judge should make any further inquiry:  Park v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 64.  In any event, we see nothing on the record
to suggest that these statements were involuntary.  There is no
merit to the argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that
the appellant&#146;s Charter rights were infringed.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Other possible verdicts</pre>
    <pre>[7]       The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
failing to consider possible verdicts other than insanity and
first degree murder.  At trial, it was, in the words of the trial
judge, &#147;uncontroverted that it [the killing] was planned and
deliberate&#148;.  As indicated, the only defence raised at trial was
insanity and it was equally uncontroverted that the appellant was
suffering from a disease of the mind.  The evidence that this was
a planned and deliberate killing and that the disease of the mind
did not interfere with the appellant&#146;s ability to plan,
deliberate, and form the requisite intent to kill was
overwhelming.  There was simply no air of reality to a verdict of
second degree murder or manslaughter.
          </pre>
    <pre>            Admissibility of the evidence of the deceased&#146;s lawyer</pre>
    <pre>[8]       The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
admitting the evidence of the deceased&#146;s matrimonial lawyer as
solicitor client privilege &#147;might have attached&#148; to her evidence.
This issue was not canvassed at trial as no objection was taken
by any of the parties to the admissibility of this evidence.
There is no merit to this ground of appeal.  Most of the matters
to which Ms. Dartois testified were not privileged.  They were
communications that the deceased passed on to other persons,
including the appellant.
[9]       Many of the other matters to which Ms. Dartois
testified could be proved from other witnesses.  The position of
defence counsel at trial is revealing in that regard.  When Ms.
Dartois began to describe some of the things the deceased told
her about her relationship with the appellant, the trial judge
inquired of defence counsel if he was objecting.  Counsel said
the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Well, we&#146;re not objecting for, I think, a variety of
       reasons.  One, sometimes we know it can be proven otherwise.  In
       any event, it&#146;s fine as far as it goes.  My friend is indicating
       that it&#146;s for state of mind for [the deceased].  I don&#146;t think
       much is going to turn on it.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.  We therefore need not consider the respondent Crown&#146;s
position that the deceased can be deemed to have waived privilege
where it is necessary to prosecute her killer.
          </pre>
    <pre>            Fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant applies to admit fresh evidence.  This
evidence consists of an affidavit of the appellant to which are
attached some excerpts from medical journals.  The import of the
fresh evidence is that after the trial, the appellant was
diagnosed with gallbladder disease.  Once his gallbladder was
removed, five years after the killing, the pain that he had been
experiencing in the upper right quadrant disappeared.  The
appellant argues that based on this fresh evidence, it can now be
established that he was misdiagnosed as having somatic delusional
disorder.  Thus, it is submitted, there now is a basis for
arguing that the cumulative effect of the legitimate pain, the
misdiagnosis, the psychotropic medication and the stigmatization
and humiliation by physicians and by the deceased combined to
trigger a dissociative state and hence automatism.  In the
alternative, the appellant argues that this evidence could be the
basis for a defence of provocation.
[12] In our view, this proposed evidence does not meet the test
for fresh evidence as most recently explained in R. v. Warsing
(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (S.C.C.).  The allegation made by the
appellant for the first time, eight years after the killing, that
he was in a dream or trance-like state at the time of the killing
is incredible.  The appellant was treated and examined by
numerous psychiatrists.  None of them reported any indication
that at the time of the killing the appellant was in a
dissociative state.  Even at this stage, the appellant has not
produced any expert evidence to support this assertion.  The
expert evidence adduced at the trial together with the non-expert
evidence, in particular the appellant&#146;s detailed and coherent
recounting of the murder and the events leading up to it, all
establish beyond doubt that the appellant was not in a
dissociative state.
[13] Similarly, the fresh evidence could not have affected the
verdict in the sense of providing a basis for a provocation
defence.  The appellant submits that the &#147;accusation&#148; by the
deceased that he was mentally ill can now be shown to be false
and thus an insult within the meaning of s. 232 of the Criminal
Code.  The fresh evidence does not suggest that the appellant was
not mentally ill at the time of the killing and in the months
prior to that time.  The evidence to that effect remains
compelling.  The fact that there may now be a physical
explanation for some of the appellant&#146;s symptoms does not detract
from the force of the evidence that the appellant was suffering
from a mental illness.  The appellant&#146;s delusions were not
limited to some pain in the upper right quadrant.  For example,
he claimed that genital herpes had invaded his entire body.  He
claimed to have lesions on parts of his body that were clearly
disease-free.  The psychotropic medication in fact eased his
symptoms of mental illness.  Regrettably, at the time of the
killing the appellant was no longer taking the medication.
[14] Further, there is no air of reality to a provocation
defence.  This was a planned and deliberate killing.  There is
nothing on the record to show that the appellant acted on the
sudden, before there was time for his passion to cool.  Even now,
the appellant does not make that claim in his affidavit.
[15] Accordingly, the application to admit fresh evidence is
dismissed.  The appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre></td>
