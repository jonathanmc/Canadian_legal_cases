    <pre>On appeal from the conviction for first degree murder by a court

</pre>
    <pre>WEILER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, his best friend, James Scott-Coe, and Ken
Brown Jr. were all eighteen years old and in Grade 12 at the same
high school in Wawa.  On November 18, 1994, the three boys got
into a truck and drove together from Wawa to an abandoned gravel
pit a short distance from town.  Only two of the boys, the
appellant McIntosh and Scott-Coe, returned from the pit.  The
third boy, Brown, was pushed off a cliff at the edge of the pit
causing him to fall 116 feet to the water and rocks below.  He
died of hypothermia and asphyxiation.
[2]  After the body was found, at the end of May the following
year, the appellant and Scott-Coe told the police that the
deceased had committed suicide by jumping off the cliff.  The
deceased&#146;s parents did not believe this.  The police asked the
appellant if he would take a polygraph test to help convince the
deceased&#146;s parents that their son had committed suicide.  The
appellant agreed.  On June 14, 1995 the appellant took the test.
Afterwards, the polygraph operator advised the appellant that he
had &#147;failed&#148; the test.  During the interview that followed, the
appellant confessed to the polygraph operator.  He was arrested
and charged with the first degree murder of the deceased.  Scott-
Coe was charged with being an accessory after the fact.
[3]  The main issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or
Scott-Coe who had pushed the deceased off the cliff.  A
subsidiary issue was whether the murder was planned and
deliberate.  The case against the appellant was largely based on
the statements he made following the polygraph test and the eye-
witness evidence of Scott-Coe.  Scott-Coe testified that he had
seen the appellant push the deceased off the cliff.  Scott-Coe
explained his silence about what he had witnessed at the gravel
pit in the months after the deceased&#146;s disappearance by saying
that he had a bad reputation in the town of Wawa.  He said he was
afraid that if he told anyone what had happened he would not be
believed and the blame would fall on him.  Also, despite the fact
that Scott-Coe was larger than the appellant, the appellant had a
second degree black belt in karate and a dark side that
frightened Scott-Coe.
[4]  There was no evidence of any animosity on the part of the
appellant towards Brown.  In his confession to the polygraph
operator, however, the appellant indicated that he had decided to
kill Brown because he was curious about death and wanted to
experience what it felt like to kill someone.  At trial, the
appellant&#146;s position was that his confession should not be
admitted into evidence because it was not a voluntary confession
and it had been obtained in violation of his right to counsel
under section 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.  The trial judge rejected these arguments and the
confession was admitted into evidence.
[5]  The appellant testified that Scott-Coe had committed the
murder.  The appellant explained that Scott-Coe had convinced him
that he, Scott-Coe, would commit suicide if caught for the murder
of the deceased.  The appellant testified that he had agreed to
take the blame for the murder if Scott-Coe would promise to get
some help.  Before taking the polygraph test, the appellant had
already made up his mind to confess to the murder if he was
unable to fool the polygraph operator into believing that Brown
committed suicide.
[6]  As part of its case in chief, the Crown introduced evidence
of a story and a poem written by the appellant.  The trial judge
ruled this evidence admissible on the issue of motive, which was
linked to the issue of identity of the killer.  In its cross-
examination of the appellant, the Crown introduced additional
writings, newspaper clippings and posters from the appellant&#146;s
bedroom.  This entire body of evidence was left to the jury on
the issue of motive and on the issue of planning and deliberation
with respect to the murder.
[7]  The appellant was convicted of first degree murder.  He
appeals his conviction and raises the following issues:</pre>
    <pre>I.   Did the trial judge err in admitting the appellant&#146;s post-
     polygraph confessions?  If not, did the trial judge err in his
     instructions to the jury concerning the polygraph evidence?</pre>
    <pre>II.  Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence of various
     writings, newspaper clippings and posters found in the
     appellant&#146;s room?  If not, did the trial judge err in his
     instructions to the jury on the permissible uses of this
     evidence?</pre>
    <pre>III. Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow the defence to
     show the jury videotaped statements made by Scott-Coe to the
     police prior to the trial, thereby preventing them from comparing
     his demeanour at the time of the statements with his demeanour
     during his testimony at trial?</pre>
    <pre>IV.  Did the trial judge misapply the collateral fact rule to
     exclude evidence that the day before Brown&#146;s death, Scott-Coe and
     Rene Gagne had gone to the pit and stood near its edge, and that
     Scott-Coe had pretended to push her off and then grabbed her,
     saying &#147;Saved your life&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>V.   Did the trial judge give an appropriate caution to the jury
     concerning the danger of  relying on the evidence of Scott-Coe?
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in
relation to the first ground of appeal and order a new trial.
When the appellant went to take the polygraph test he was not a
suspect in the death of Brown.  The purpose of the test was to
convince the deceased&#146;s parents that their son had committed
suicide.  The appellant was told that he did not have to take the
test and that he was free to leave at any time.  The appellant
was also advised that he had the right to counsel, which he
waived.  Once the appellant confessed to the murder of Brown,
however, his status changed.  Had he tried to leave he would have
been detained.  At this point, it was incumbent on the polygraph
operator to tell the appellant that he was detained and why, and
to ask the appellant whether, in light of the change in his
circumstances, he wished to consult counsel.  The polygraph
operator did not do this.  Instead, he asked additional questions
aimed at obtaining incriminating information concerning the
appellant&#146;s state of mind when he committed the crime.  This
information was particularly relevant to the element of first
degree murder that concerns planning and deliberation.  In the
circumstances, the additional questioning violated the
appellant&#146;s rights under s.10 of the Charter; the evidence
obtained affected the fairness of the trial and must be excluded
pursuant to s.24(2).
[9]  My conclusion makes it appropriate to deal first with the
issue of the admissibility of the post-polygraph confessions.
Inasmuch as I have already decided to order a new trial, it is
unnecessary to decide whether a new trial should also be ordered
on the basis of any of the other grounds of appeal, alone or in
combination.  The likelihood that the same issues may arise on a
new trial makes it appropriate, however, for me to consider some
of the other issues raised and to offer guidance in relation to
them.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>I.   THE POST-POLYGRAPH CONFESSIONS</pre>
    <pre>A.   Did the trial judge err in admitting the appellant's post-
     polygraph confessions?</pre>
    <pre>[10] When Brown failed to return home, his parents reported his
disappearance and the O.P.P. carried out an investigation.  The
investigation revealed that the appellant and Scott-Coe were two
of the last people to have seen Brown.  The police questioned
them several times without significant result.  The appellant
gave statements on November 21, 27 and 28, 1994.
[11] In May 1995, Scott-Coe told friends he had been experiencing
nightmares about Brown and the gravel pit.  Under the guise of
investigating the source of his dreams, Scott-Coe led friends to
the pit and &#147;found&#148; Brown&#146;s body.   The friends informed the
police of the discovery.
[12] On May 27, 1995, the police questioned the appellant for the
fourth time and the interview was videotaped.  The appellant made
a statement that did not substantially deviate from the previous
statements he had given.  He denied being at the pit when Brown
died.  On May 31, 1995, the police asked the appellant to answer
more questions and he agreed to do so.  This time the appellant
revealed that both he and Scott-Coe had been present at the pit
when Brown committed suicide by jumping off the cliff.  Scott-Coe
went along with the appellant&#146;s version of events.  Brown&#146;s
parents, however, refused to believe that their son had committed
suicide.  In a sixth conversation on June 1, 1995, the police
asked the appellant whether he would be willing to take a
polygraph test in order to help convince Brown&#146;s parents that
their son had indeed committed suicide.  The appellant agreed to
take the polygraph test.
[13] On June 14, 1995, the appellant met the polygraph operator,
Det. Sgt. Valliere, at a nearby motel, and Valliere administered
the test.  Valliere told the appellant that he did not have to
take the test and that he was free to leave at any time.
Valliere explained to the appellant that neither the results of
the polygraph test nor his opinion about the test were admissible
as evidence.  He said that their conversation was being tape
recorded, however, and that a judge would decide whether what was
said would be admissible.  The appellant indicated that he
understood what Valliere had told him and repeated back in his
own words what Valliere had said.
[14] Initially, Valliere asked some medical questions to
determine the appellant's suitability to take the test, elicited
some personal information to establish the control questions for
the test, took a brief statement on which to test the appellant,
and formulated the test questions with the appellant.  Before
beginning the test proper, he performed a demonstration and
verification test in order to convince the appellant that the
machine worked.  Valliere then conducted the test.  When the test
was complete, Valliere advised the appellant that he was free to
leave, but that he could wait for the results if he so desired.
The appellant chose to wait while Valliere assessed the results
in another room.
[15] When Valliere returned to the room he told the appellant
that he had &#147;failed&#148; the polygraph test, reminded the appellant
of the rights he had been alerted to at the outset of the
interview, and began a post-polygraph interview.  Fifty minutes
into the interview, the appellant confessed to killing Brown and,
after some additional questioning, was arrested by Valliere.  At
Valliere&#146;s request, the appellant repeated his confession to Sgt.
Hutchingame, who had been waiting outside the interview room.
Afterwards, the appellant spoke with duty counsel who advised him
to say nothing more until he had retained counsel.
[16] The appellant was taken to the Wawa O.P.P. detachment where
he spoke to a lawyer in private by telephone.  Later, the
appellant was being watched over in his cell by a police officer,
Const. Gould, who testified that he heard the appellant
spontaneously say: &#147;Why did I do it.  I hurt so many people, my
mom, my dad and my girlfriend.  I did it because I was curious.
I shouldn&#146;t have done it.  I got this thing in my head&#148;.  The
appellant testified at trial that he did not recall this
statement.  He testified that he was emotionally drained,
confused, and in a state of shock at the time.
[17] The appellant was transported from Wawa to the jail in Sault
Ste. Marie, arriving shortly after midnight.  While the appellant
was changing into institutional clothing, according to the
standard admitting procedure, a uniformed correctional services
employee, Anthony Nelli, asked him &#147;if this was all some kind of
mix up&#148;.  The appellant replied, &#147;No, no mistake.  I did kill Ken
Brown&#148;.  He also said that Scott-Coe had just happened to be
there.  Later, during the course of a discussion about the
polygraph test, the appellant said that he figured he could beat
a polygraph test and then said, &#147;I couldn&#146;t keep it inside of me
any longer&#148; and &#147;I had to tell the cops&#148;.  These admissions to
Nelli were overheard by Mark Mei, another uniformed correctional
officer standing four to five feet away.  Mei testified that the
appellant was crying when he was first brought in, but was no
longer crying at the time he made the admissions, although he
still seemed upset or slightly agitated.  At trial, the appellant
testified that he was in a state of shock and did not recall this
incident.
[18] The appellant submits that his confession to the polygraph
operator following the polygraph test ought to have been excluded
by the trial judge on three separate bases:</pre>
    <pre>     1)   the common law requirement that confessions be voluntary,
     2)   sections 10(a) and (b) and s.24(2) of the Charter, and
     3)   the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Béland (1987), 36
          C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).
  </pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant further submits that the additional statements
he made to other persons after his confession to the polygraph
operator were tainted by his confession to the polygraph operator
and should also be excluded.</pre>
    <pre>1)   The common law requirement that confessions be voluntary.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The basis for the common law rule that an accused&#146;s
confession must be voluntary is a concern for reliability and
fairness in the criminal process: R. v. Whittle, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
914 at 931-2, 32 C.R. (4th) 1.  The various aspects of the
confession rule and the underlying jurisprudence are ably
summarized by Hill J. in R v. Alexis (1994), 35 C.R. (4th) 117 at
154-8 (Ont. Gen. Div.), and I will simply highlight them here.
In order to be voluntary, a statement must be the product of the
accused person&#146;s free will; that is, it must result from a choice
on the part of the accused to speak.  The statement must be the
product of an operating mind in the sense that the accused has
some awareness of what is at stake.  Also, the Crown must prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession or incriminating
statement was not made as a result of threats or inducements held
out by a person in authority.  Treatment of the accused by the
police surrounding the taking of the statement, such as the
denial of food, clothing or sleep, may create an atmosphere of
oppression and undermine the accused&#146;s freedom to choose whether
or not to speak, even though no threat or inducement is
communicated verbally.  In such circumstances of oppressiveness,
the statement will also be excluded.  (A recent decision
exemplifying this principle is R. v. Hoilett (1999), 136 C.C.C.
(3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.)).  Finally, the trial judge has a common law
power apart from the voluntariness rules to exclude evidence,
including a confession, to ensure a fair trial: R. v. Harrer
(1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.); R. v. White (1999),
135 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 292 (S.C.C.).
[21]  The determination of whether an accused's statement was
voluntary is largely a question of fact.  The standard used by an
appellate court to review a trial judge&#146;s decision in this regard
is therefore limited to determining whether the trial judge erred
in his assessment of the evidence, failed to consider relevant
circumstances, or failed to apply the correct principles: R. v.
Oikle (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 506 at 523 (N.S.C.A.); R. v. Hatton
(1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 281 at 297-8 (Ont. C.A.).
[22] Insofar as subsequent statements are concerned, there is no
hard and fast rule that  subsequent statements must be ruled
inadmissible merely because a previous statement is inadmissible.
Again, this is a question of fact to be determined after
ascertaining the degree of connection between the two statements:
R. v. Hobbins (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 289 at 293 (S.C.C.).  A
subsequent confession is involuntary if the factors that resulted
in the first confession being involuntary continue to be present
when the second one is made.  If the fact that the first
statement was made was a substantial factor contributing to the
making of the second statement, the second statement will also be
excluded as being tainted: R. v. I. (L.R.) and T.(E.), [1993] 4
S.C.R. 504 at 526.  Consultation with counsel prior to the making
of a subsequent statement, while a factor to consider, does not
necessarily mean that the degree of connection between the
previous statement and the subsequent statement has been severed
sufficiently: R. v. I. (L.R.) and T. (E.), supra, at 305.
[23] Voluntariness has both an objective and a subjective
component.  An accused person&#146;s own timidity or subjective fear
of the police will not suffice to render a statement involuntary,
in the absence of any improper conduct, objectively assessed, on
the part of the police: R. v. Hobbins, supra, at 292.
[24] If an inducement offered by a police officer does not affect
the accused&#146;s decision to speak, the trial judge may find the
accused&#146;s statements to have been voluntary: R. v. Wood (1994),
94 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada refused September 14, 1995.  In R. v. MacNeil
(1995), 138 N.S.R. (2d) 117 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada refused September 14, 1995, the accused
confessed after the police appealed to the accused&#146;s conscience
and religion in an attempt to obtain a confession.  The trial
judge admitted the confession, finding that the accused confessed
because of his need to unburden feelings of remorse and guilt.
[25] Particular phrases or forms of words used by a person in
authority that have been found to constitute an inducement in one
case will not necessarily amount to an inducement in another: R.
v. Hatton, supra; R. v. Reyat (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 210
(B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
refused September 16, 1993.  Rather, each case depends on the
circumstances under which the words were used.
[26] The appellant submits that his statement to the polygraph
operator was involuntary.  He relies, individually and
cumulatively, on circumstances both before and after the
polygraph test in support of this position.  These were the
circumstances before the polygraph test:</pre>
    <pre>· A police officer told the appellant&#146;s mother that her son
  did not need a lawyer because he was not suspected of having done
  anything wrong.</pre>
    <pre>· The polygraph operator told the appellant</pre>
    <pre>  -  that neither the results of the polygraph test, nor the
     opinion of the polygraph operator as to whether the appellant was
     lying, were admissible as evidence in court.
  </pre>
    <pre>  -  that he was there to help him get through the test, and that
     he was not investigating anything but was there simply to
     find out the truth.
  </pre>
    <pre>  -  that the polygraph was infallible.
  </pre>
    <pre>· The appellant was not told before taking the test that there
  would be an interview following the test.</pre>
    <pre>[27] These were the circumstances after the polygraph test:</pre>
    <pre>· The appellant was provided with a short break of eleven
  minutes between the conclusion of the test and the commencement
  of the post-polygraph interview.  The total duration of the pre-
  and post-polygraph procedure was over three and a half hours.</pre>
    <pre>· During the post-polygraph interview, the appellant was
  repeatedly told that he was lying.</pre>
    <pre>· The polygraph operator told the appellant that he could help
  the police by correcting his &#147;mistake&#148; and telling the truth, and
  that there was a lot to be gained by admitting his &#147;mistake&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>· The polygraph operator told the appellant that if he did not
  tell the truth he was &#147;gonna go down&#148; with Scott-Coe and that he
  was &#147;making it worse&#148; by not giving a further statement.</pre>
    <pre>· The polygraph operator continued to state that his role was
  to listen to the appellant and to try to understand the
  appellant.  The polygraph operator also continued to state that
  he was not there to find anybody guilty and that the polygraph
  was infallible.</pre>
    <pre>· The polygraph operator told the appellant: &#147;&#133;if you need
  some help we&#146;ll get you some help&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge found that there was no police conduct &#147;at
any time&#148; that created an atmosphere of oppression so as to
deprive the appellant of his free will to make a choice about
giving a statement.  He also found that there were no
inducements, by means of threats or promises, at any time.
[29] For the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to
decide whether the trial judge erred in holding that there were
no inducements.  At the voir dire into the admissibility of the
statements the appellant testified that he confessed because he
wanted to protect Scott-Coe.  The appellant said that prior to
taking the polygraph test he had made up his mind to confess to
the crime in the event that he failed the test.  The appellant
did not testify that he confessed because of the nature of the
questioning or because of inducements that were made.  On the
contrary, he said that no promises or threats were made to him.
On the appellant&#146;s evidence, the confession was not an
involuntary revelation as a result of police tactics.  Rather, it
was the carrying out of an express intention formulated by the
appellant in advance.  Any inducements offered to the appellant,
therefore, would not have had the effect of persuading the
appellant to confess since he had already made up his mind to do
so in the event that he failed the test.  I will discuss the
admissibility of the appellant&#146;s statements after he confessed to
Valliere at a later point in these reasons.
[30] The appellant also contests the fairness of the polygraph
procedures employed in this case and says that they affected the
voluntariness of the statements.  In R. v. Barton (1993), 81
C.C.C. (3d) 574 at 575 (Ont. C.A.), this court refused to hold
that a statement made after a polygraph test was invariably not a
voluntary statement.  The court also confirmed that voluntariness
is to be decided by the trial judge after examining all the
evidence concerning the circumstances under which the statement
was made.
[31] Again, because of the appellant&#146;s plan to confess in the
event that he failed the polygraph test, it is not, strictly
speaking, necessary to decide this issue.  However, having regard
to the extensive submissions made respecting the procedure
followed in this case and the likelihood that the same procedure
has been followed in many other cases, it is appropriate to deal
with two aspects of the polygraph procedure raised here.</pre>
    <pre>What the appellant was told about the admissibility of the
polygraph test</pre>
    <pre>[32] The trial judge specifically rejected the idea that the
appellant was naïve or unsophisticated.  Rather, he found that
the appellant was of normal intelligence and that he understood
what he was doing.  In his testimony on the voir dire, the
appellant did not say that there was any confusion in his mind
between the polygraph process and the recording that the
polygraph operator made of their conversation.  Given these
circumstances, what the appellant was told about the
admissibility of the polygraph process did not constitute an
inducement and was not unfair as such.
[33] This case can readily be distinguished from R. v. Nugent
(1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 431 (N.S.C.A.), one of the cases on which
the appellant relies in support of his position that the
polygraph procedure was improper.  In that case, the accused was
positively confused by the various cautions that were given to
him, and he was ignored when he asked to speak to counsel so that
the cautions could be explained to him.  In the case at hand, the
appellant indicated on the recording of his statements that he
understood what the polygraph operator was saying and repeated
the caution in his own words.  At trial, the appellant did not
allege any misunderstanding or confusion in this regard.
[34] I note that the appellant&#146;s factum in Barton, supra, which
was filed on this appeal, indicates that the polygraph operator
in that case explained that he would be taking notes throughout
the test, in case he was required to attend in court and testify
about the test.  The appellant indicated at the time that he
understood what the polygraph operator told him.  Also, the
appellant did not testify on the voir dire.  Although the
polygraph procedure was contested in that case, the court did not
comment on these particular circumstances surrounding the
procedure; however, the appellant&#146;s statement was admitted.  As
long as the accused understands that what he says throughout the
test is being recorded and may be admissible as evidence against
him, even though the results of the polygraph test are not
admissible as evidence against the appellant, this aspect of the
polygraph procedure does not in itself render a confession
involuntary.</pre>
    <pre>What the appellant was not told about the post-polygraph
interview</pre>
    <pre>[35] The appellant submits that the police did not explicitly
inform the appellant what would happen if he failed the test and
suggests that this omission was unfair.  (I note that both the
polygraph procedure form and the polygraph background information
pamphlet provided to the appellant were made exhibits at the
appellant&#146;s trial.)
[36] The appellant's factum in Barton, supra, also alleged that
the trial judge in that case erred in determining the
voluntariness of the appellant&#146;s statement because:

    The information pamphlet which the appellant read prior to
    the test did not inform the appellant what would happen if he
    failed the test and simply described the post test interview as a
    discussion of the result wherein the technician would provide his
    opinion.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Although the court in Barton, supra, did not specifically
address this argument in its reasons, the court noted that the
appellant was given a brochure describing the test as consisting
of three separate phases: the &#147;pre-test&#148; interview, the &#147;in-test&#148;
phase, and the &#147;post-test&#148; interview.  The court stated at 574:

    The document explains the meaning of these terms and, in
    particular, that the third portion of the test would be an
    interview in which &#147;the polygraphist will discuss the results of
    the &#145;In-test&#146; and provide you with his/her opinion&#148;.
          
[38] The court in Barton, supra, concluded at 575 that polygraph
procedures should be given the closest scrutiny to ensure that
statements are truly voluntary, &#147;[b]ut this is not to say that
particular procedures should be prohibited as invariably leading
to statements which are not voluntary&#148;.  From this, one may
deduce that the failure to inform the appellant as to what would
happen if the appellant failed the test was not, of itself,
unfair so as to make the statement involuntary.  If the failure
to inform had been unfair, the court would have said so.
[39] In the case at hand, the appellant submits that he was not
provided with the brochure given to the accused in Barton, supra,
at the time of the initial caution and waiver of his s.10(b)
rights.  However, the appellant did not testify that this lack of
information about the post-test interview had any effect on him
or prejudiced him in any way.  The appellant was certainly aware,
after completing the test, that he would be provided with the
polygraph operator&#146;s opinion, and he waited for it voluntarily.
At no time during the post-polygraph interview did the appellant
ask the polygraph operator to stop questioning him, nor did he
express any discomfort or make a request with which the operator
did not comply.
[40] Unlike in Nugent, supra, the polygraph test in this case was
not used simply as a tool to extract a statement from the
appellant.  The appellant was not confronted with questions
pointing to his guilt in Brown&#146;s death until after he confessed.
The trial judge found that the police never suspected that the
appellant had killed Brown, and that they in fact had no
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant had
committed a criminal offence or that Brown had died as a result
of foul play.
[41] At trial, the appellant did not testify that he was
subjected to any oppressive circumstances.  No experts gave
evidence of emotional disintegration by the accused caused by
questioning during the post-polygraph interview, as in R. v.
Amyot (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 312 (Que. C.A.), another decision on
which the appellant relies.  Inasmuch as the appellant testified
that he had made up his mind in advance to confess to the crime
in the event that he &#147;failed&#148; the polygraph test, the appellant
must have contemplated having some conversation with the
polygraph operator after the polygraph test.
[42] The polygraph procedures that I have discussed were not
unfair and, in the circumstances, did not affect the
voluntariness of the appellant&#146;s statements.</pre>
    <pre>2)   Section 10(a) and (b) of the Charter</pre>
    <pre>[43] Once an accused person is detained, ss.10(a) and (b) of the
Charter give the accused the right to be promptly informed of the
reason for the detention, to be informed of the right to retain
and instruct counsel, and to exercise the right to counsel
without delay.
[44] The appellant submits that his status changed at the
beginning of the post-polygraph interview, and that Valliere&#146;s
reminder of the appellant&#146;s rights at this time was inadequate.
[45] The trial judge found as a fact that the appellant was not a
suspect when he went to take the polygraph test, and that he was
aware of this.  At the outset the appellant was told several
times by Valliere that he did not have to take the test, that he
could leave, and that the doors were not locked.  Notwithstanding
this, the appellant was fully informed of his right to remain
silent, and to retain and instruct counsel.  After the polygraph
test, the appellant was given the option to leave and he chose to
stay.  The appellant was left alone in the unlocked motel room
while the polygraph operator scored the test.  By the time he
returned to the room, the polygraph operator believed that the
appellant had not told him the whole truth.  At that point he
told the appellant:

      Caleb I want you to listen to me carefully here and then not
      say anything until I&#146;m finished talking ah you failed your test;
      there&#146;s no doubt in my mind right now that you&#146;re not telling me
      the complete truth about what went on out there and that is a
      fact but before you say anything further if there is anything
      criminal I also want to remind you of your rights that you don&#146;t
      have to say anything to me whatever you say may be given in
      evidence and you do have a right to speak to a lawyer.  All that
      stuff we talked about before that still applies do you understand
      that?</pre>
    <pre>      McIntosh: Hm hm</pre>
    <pre>[46] The polygraph operator then initiated the post-polygraph
interview.  I do not accept the appellant&#146;s argument that
Valliere was obliged to give the appellant his full s.10 rights
when he began the post-polygraph interview.  I agree with the
trial judge that the appellant was not detained at that stage.
The trial judge found that although Valliere was of the opinion
that the appellant had lied to him he did not consider him to be
a suspect in Brown&#146;s murder until he confessed.
[47] The appellant&#146;s status changed with these questions and
answers:

          Valliere: What were you looking at what
	  did you see did you push him?
          McIntosh:  Yeah.
          Valliere: Kick push.
          McIntosh : No no pushed him did you ever
          find fingerprints on his jacket on the back
          of it and I know it&#146;s hard for you to sit
          here does he&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[48] After this exchange, the polygraph operator continued to
question the appellant, eliciting evidence from him concerning
his motive and intent to kill.  He asked, &#147;&#133; What was going
through your mind was it something directed specifically at Ken
[Brown]&#133;.?  What was the reason?&#148;.  The appellant replied that
his act was not specifically directed at Brown, that it could
have been anyone, and that it could have been directed at Scott-
Coe, his best friend.  It was just his curiosity that peaked.  He
knew exactly what he was doing and why.  After receiving the
appellant&#146;s answers, Valliere stated: &#147;Okay I&#146;ve got to remind
you of your rights again&#148;.  The appellant replied that he knew
them.  Valliere continued to question the appellant as to his
state of mind when he committed the murder.  Only after a further
series of incriminating answers covering seven pages in the
transcript were obtained did Valliere tell the appellant he was
under arrest for first degree murder.
[49] Valliere&#146;s reminder of the appellant&#146;s &#147;rights&#148; was too late
and too little.  Once the appellant confessed to pushing Brown
over the edge of the gravel pit, the initial police position that
the appellant was not a suspect changed.  This change required a
fresh concern for the appellant&#146;s s.10 rights.  The appellant was
no longer free to leave and would have been detained had he tried
to do so.  Valliere did not tell the appellant that his status
had changed and that he was now being detained on a charge of
murder.  Consequently, the appellant&#146;s rights under s.10(a) of
the Charter were violated.  The purpose of Valliere&#146;s questioning
also changed.  It was now aimed at obtaining incriminating
statements from the appellant concerning his state of mind when
he pushed Brown.  In R. v. Evans (1991), 4 C.R. (4th) 144 at 163,
63 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), the Court held that the police must
re-advise a suspect of his or her right to counsel where there is
a &#147;fundamental and discrete change in the purpose of the
investigation, one involving&#133;. a significantly more serious
offence than that contemplated at the time of the warning&#148;.
Here, on the trial judge&#146;s findings, the appellant was not
suspected of any offence until he confessed.  The appellant&#146;s
change in jeopardy presented a renewed opportunity for the
appellant to retain and consult counsel.  Consequently, Valliere
ought to have repeated the s.10(b) Charter right to counsel.
[50] Although the appellant appeared to waive his rights by
telling Valliere that he knew them, the appellant&#146;s waiver of his
right to counsel was not a meaningful one in the circumstances.
In order for the waiver to be meaningful it would have been
necessary to ensure that the appellant was fully aware of the
potential jeopardy he faced; namely, that he was detained for
Brown&#146;s murder.  It would further have been necessary to re-
advise him of his right to counsel.  A person can only exercise
the s.10(b) right to counsel in a meaningful way if the person
knows the extent of his or her jeopardy: R. v. Black, [1989] 2
S.C.R. 138, 70 C.R. (3d) 97.   It follows that the appellant&#146;s
earlier waivers of his right to counsel prior to and after the
polygraph examination would also not be meaningful waivers
because at that stage the appellant was not considered to be a
murder suspect.  The evidence obtained following the violation of
the appellant&#146;s s.10 rights was conscripted evidence.
[51] The change in the appellant&#146;s status during the post-
polygraph interview differentiates this case from Barton, supra.
In Barton, from the time of the initial police contact until
Barton failed the polygraph test and confessed in the post-
polygraph interview, the police investigation was an arson
investigation.  Barton was explicitly told that he was a suspect
prior to the polygraph test.  As a result, the s.10(a) context
for the s.10(b) waiver in that case did not change throughout the
investigation and was not an issue on the appeal.  The trial
judge held that the principles in Barton were applicable to this
case and that the appellant&#146;s Charter rights were not violated.
The trial judge did not consider whether the appellant&#146;s status
changed during Valliere&#146;s questioning in coming to his conclusion
and, as a result, he erred.
[52] Had there not been a violation of the appellant&#146;s Charter
rights, it is not clear to me that the appellant would have made
the further admissions he did.  These further admissions clearly
went to the level of culpability of the appellant in committing
the crime and were important evidence regarding the planning and
deliberation element of the charge of first degree murder.  The
one issue in this case on which the jury requested further
instructions was the difference between first and second degree
murder.
[53] Because the appellant&#146;s s.10 Charter rights were violated, I
would exclude the evidence obtained by Valliere following their
violation pursuant to s.24(2).  The violation would affect the
fairness of  the appellant&#146;s trial: R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R.
173, 92 C.C.C. (3d) 289; R. v. Pozniak, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 310, 92
C.C.C. (3d) 472; R. v. Harper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 343, 92 C.C.C.
(3d) 423.</pre>
    <pre>Statements after the confession to Valliere</pre>
    <pre>[54]  I must now address the further issue raised by the
appellant; namely, whether the excluded portion of the
appellant&#146;s confession should result in the exclusion of his
subsequent statements in whole or in part.
[55] There are three statements.  The statement to Hutchingame
made at the request of Valliere at the motel, the comments to
Gould at the lockup in Wawa a few hours later, and the statement
to the jail attendants in Sault Ste. Marie.
[56] The test for determining whether a subsequent statement is
inadmissible because of a prior involuntary confession is set
forth by Sopinka J. in R. v. I.(L.R.) and T.(E.), supra, at 526:

     &#133; a subsequent confession would be involuntary if either the
     tainting features which disqualified the first confession
     continued to be present, or if the fact that the first statement
     was made was a substantial factor contributing to the making of
     the second statement.</pre>
    <pre>[57] In I.(L.R.) and T.(E.), supra, the appellant E.T. gave an
initial statement to the police that was subsequently excluded at
trial.  The day after, E.T. spoke to counsel and then called the
police officer because he wished to add something to his
statement of the day before.  The police officer questioned E.T.
concerning aspects of his statement the day before and referred
continuously to information given by E.T. in the first statement.
The Supreme Court held that the second statement was inadmissible
at common law.  As E.T. was a young offender, the second
statement could also have been excluded under the exclusionary
language of s.56 of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1.
Had it been necessary, the court would have excluded the
statements under s.24(2) of the Charter.
[58] Section 24(2) has two parts.  First, the court must conclude
that a Charter right has been infringed.  Second, the court must
be of the opinion that the admission of the evidence obtained in
violation of the Charter right would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  In order to determine whether the
administration of justice would be brought into disrepute, the
court considers the three sets of factors articulated in R. v.
Collins [1987], 1 S.C.R. 265.  They are: (1) the fairness of the
trial; (2) the seriousness of the violation; and (3) the effect
of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice.
[59] Where an accused person makes a statement that is later
excluded at trial and the Crown seeks to tender real evidence,
such as a gun, that was discovered after the accused&#146;s statement,
a causal connection between the statement and the real evidence
must ordinarily be established before the court will embark on an
analysis of whether the administration of justice would be
brought into disrepute by admitting the real evidence.  See R. v.
Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607 at 663; and R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 13 at 69-71.  Where, however, other statements are made
subsequent to a statement that has been excluded as having been
obtained in violation of a Charter right, it is not necessary to
establish a causal link between them before embarking on an
analysis of the Collins factors: I.(L.R.) and T.(E.), supra, at
529-30.  The present state of the law has been concisely summed
up by Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Caputo (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(Ont. C.A.) at 14:

       Ordinarily, if there is a temporal connection between the
       violation and the obtaining of the evidence then this is
       sufficient to trigger s.24(2) and the court will proceed to
       determine whether the admission of the evidence would bring the
       administration of justice into disrepute.</pre>
    <pre>[60] In this case, I have found a Charter violation of a portion
of the statement to Valliere.  There is a close temporal
connection between the statement to Valliere and the subsequent
statements of the appellant.  The determination as to whether the
subsequent statements should be excluded should therefore be made
having regard to whether the administration of justice would be
brought into disrepute.  It is at this stage that the presence of
a causative relationship may be relevant: I.(L.R.) and T.(E.),
supra, at 530.
[61] In considering the first Collins factor, the fairness of the
trial, the court will first have to determine if the subsequent
statements were compelled or conscripted.  As stated by Cory J.
in R. v. Stillman, supra, at 655:

      &#133; when an accused, in violation of his Charter rights, is
      compelled to incriminate himself at the behest of the state by
      means of a statement &#133; It is the compelled statements &#133; obtained
      in violation of Charter rights which may render a trial unfair.</pre>
    <pre>[62] If, on the other hand, the subsequent statements are found
to be non-compelled or conscriptive, their admission will not
affect the fairness of the trial and the court must consider
their admissibility under the other two sets of Collins factors.
[63] In making its determination as to whether or not the
subsequent statements are compelled or conscriptive, the court
will want to consider the manner in which they were obtained:
Stillman, supra, at 668.  This consideration cannot take place in
isolation but must encompass the relation of the subsequent
statements to the earlier excluded statements.  Furthermore, even
if the evidence is conscriptive, its admission will not affect
the fairness of the trial if the evidence would inevitably have
been discovered or if it was discovered from an independent
source: Feeney, supra, at 64.  Clearly, the existence of a causal
connection is, at this stage of the analysis under s.24(2), a
relevant consideration.  It may be helpful, therefore, to
articulate some of the factors that assist a court in determining
whether there has been a causal connection.
[64] Cases that deal with the common law confessions rule are
helpful at this stage of the analysis because, under this rule,
the court is also concerned with whether the statement was
compelled or conscripted and with whether it would be fair to
admit the evidence.  Moreover, as stated by Rosenberg J.A. in
Caputo, supra, at 13, the question of whether a subsequent
statement is &#147;tainted&#148; is, in effect, a test of causation.  I
return therefore to the decision in I.(L.R.) and T.(E.), supra,
which dealt with whether the subsequent statements by the young
offender were tainted.  A helpful summary of the principles
contained in the decision of Sopinka J. is found in the
dissenting decision of McLachlin J. in R. v. B.G. (1999), 174
D.L.R. (4th) 301, 135 C.C.C. (3d) 303 at 329-30 (S.C.C.):

       On the first branch of the test, Sopinka J. held that &#145;a
       subsequent confession would be involuntary if &#133; the tainting
       features which disqualified the first confession continued to be
       present&#146;.  Sopinka J. identified the following as potentially
       &#145;tainting features&#146;: the time span between the statements,
       advertence to the previous statement during questioning; the
       discovery of additional incriminating evidence subsequent to the
       first statement; the presence of the same police officers at both
       interrogations; and other similarities between the two
       circumstances (R. v. I. (L.R.) and T. (E.), supra, at 526).  On
       the second branch of the test, more apposite here, Sopinka J.
       stated that &#145;a subsequent confession would be involuntary &#133; if
       the fact that the first statement was made was a substantial
       factor contributing to the making of the second statement&#146;.  This
       might occur where the fact of the first statement produces a
       &#145;strong urge to explain away incriminating matters in a prior
       statement&#146; (p. 527); or the second statement was a &#145;continuation
       of the first&#146; (p. 531); or where, in light of the first
       statement, &#145;the rationale for further restraint in self-
       incrimination was gone&#146; (p. 532). &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>The factors mentioned by McLachlin J. all relate to the question
of causation.
</pre>
    <pre>[65] In B.G., supra, the accused was referred to a psychiatrist
pursuant to a court ordered assessment to determine his fitness
to stand trial and for a determination of whether his mental
state at the time of the alleged offence was such that he could
not be held criminally responsible for it.  The psychiatrist
asked the accused to explain a statement he had made to the
police a year earlier in which he admitted to engaging in various
acts of a sexual nature with his young cousin.  At trial, the
first statement to the police was found to be inadmissible.  The
accused testified and denied committing the offence.  The Crown
sought to challenge the accused&#146;s credibility using the statement
he had made to the psychiatrist.  Ordinarily, such statements are
protected under s.672.21 of the Criminal Code and cannot be used
against an accused.  An exception exists with respect to
credibility under s.672.21(3)(f).  The majority of the court held
that the confessions rule excluded the statement to the
psychiatrist because it resulted directly from the confrontation
of the accused with his previous involuntary statement by the
psychiatrist.  No additional information was obtained.  The
majority concluded that, since the second statement existed only
because of the first, it should be excluded as a derived
confession; the majority found it unnecessary to consider whether
the tainting factors respecting the statement to the police
continued to exist when the statement to the psychiatrist was
made.  (In view of its decision, the majority also found it
unnecessary to decide whether the psychiatrist was a person in
authority.)  The decision in B.G., supra, reaffirms the
proposition that if the first confession to the police is
inadmissible, the second statement will also be inadmissible if
the degree of connection between the two statements is sufficient
that the second would not exist but for the first statement
having been made.
[66] In B.G., supra, the majority held that certain aspects of
the common law confessions rule had been constitutionalized in
s.7 of the Charter.  A confession that was inadmissible at common
law could not be introduced indirectly without affecting the
right to silence and the principle against self-incrimination and
the majority gave the same interpretation to s.672.21(3)(f) of
the Criminal Code.  Inasmuch as B.G., supra, holds that certain
aspects of the confessions rule have been constitutionalized in
s.7, the comments of the Supreme Court in R. v. Liew (1999), 137
C.C.C. (3d) 353 are instructive, recognizing, of course, the
different context.  There, the Court was concerned with whether
there had been a violation of a detainee&#146;s right to remain silent
under s.7 of the Charter by an undercover police agent.  The
Court looked at two factors in relation to causation.  The two
factors are the nature of the exchange and the nature of the
relationship between the accused and the police.  In determining
the nature of the exchange, the Court considered who initiated
the exchange; who directed the conversation; whether the
conversation was redirected by the police agent or whether the
police agent merely picked up the flow of the conversation;
whether the police agent&#146;s questions requested specific
information or were general in nature.  In determining the nature
of the relationship, the Court considered whether the
relationship was one of trust; whether the detainee was under any
obligation or vulnerable to the police agent; and whether the
police agent manipulated the detainee to bring about a state in
which the detainee was more likely to talk.  These factors are
not intended to be exhaustive: R. v. Liew, supra, at 369-70.
[67] There are some obvious similarities as well as differences
between the cases that I have discussed to the case at hand.  The
trial judge, in the case at hand, having held that the
appellant&#146;s initial confession should be admitted in its
entirety, had no need to address the question of whether the
subsequent statements were tainted or were derived from the
portion of the confession to Valliere that I have excluded.  The
admissibility of the subsequent statements requires both a
determination of factual issues as well as the exercise of the
trial judge&#146;s discretion pursuant to s.24(2).  I would not
presume to make this determination in advance of the rehearing.</pre>
    <pre>3)   The rule in R. v. Béland, supra</pre>
    <pre>[68] In the case at hand, the trial judge directed that the
appellant's four post-polygraph statements be edited to remove
all references to the polygraph.  The next day, however, as the
trial before the jury was about to commence, both Crown and
defence counsel advised the trial judge that editing was not
feasible.  The explanation was that &#147;the fact of the polygraph is
an integral part of the unfolding of the narrative&#148; leading up to
the confession to the polygraph operator.  As a result, the jury
heard all of Valliere&#146;s evidence concerning the polygraph testing
procedures, his opinion as to its general reliability, his
opinion that the appellant &#147;failed&#148; the test, his charts
containing the appellant&#146;s scores, and the entire audiotape of
his discussions with the appellant before, during and after the
test.
[69] The Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s judgment in Béland, supra,
precludes the admission of the results of a polygraph test and
the opinion of the polygraph operator to support or cast doubt on
the credibility of a witness.  Further to this rule, the
appellant submits that, because the polygraph test itself could
not be introduced into evidence, the statements made subsequent
to it must also be excluded.  The appellant submits that the
subsequent statements were inextricably connected to the
polygraph test itself because of the failure of the police to
clearly separate the test phase from the post-polygraph
interview.
[70] I disagree.  The polygraph test and the opinion of the
polygraph operator were not introduced for the truth of what was
said during the polygraph test.  They were introduced merely as
background.  More importantly, the defence position was that the
appellant lied to the polygraph operator in order to protect
Scott-Coe.  For this reason, there was no prejudice to the
appellant by the admission of the evidence that he &#147;failed&#148; the
polygraph.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury
     concerning the polygraph evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[71] The appellant submits that the trial judge&#146;s charge to the
jury concerning the nature of the polygraph test as background
evidence was inadequate.  The evidence was admitted  to give
context to the statement to the polygraph operator.  The trial
judge gave clear instructions to the jury on this point.  He told
the jury that a polygraph machine is not always accurate and that
it does nothing more than measure physiological responses.  Also,
he told the jury that a polygraph machine does not reveal why
someone is having such a physiological response, or whether the
response is caused by a lie.  There was no objection on the part
of the defence to this charge at trial.  For these reasons, I
would not give effect to this argument.</pre>
    <pre>II.  EVIDENCE FOUND IN THE APPELLANT&#146;S ROOM</pre>
    <pre>[72] During the Crown&#146;s case in chief, a voir dire was conducted
to determine the admissibility of a number of writings and
newspaper clippings found in the appellant&#146;s room.  The trial
judge balanced the probative value of the evidence against its
prejudicial effect and admitted two items: a short story entitled
&#147;Dreadful Youth&#148; and a poem entitled &#147;I am the dark side of
light&#148;.  The trial judge held that the story and the poem were
admissible as evidence tending to show motive for the killing,
and to show that the identity of the killer was the appellant as
he had originally indicated in his confession, rather than Scott-
Coe.
[73] The evidence from the appellant&#146;s bedroom admitted on the
third voir dire included a collection of poetry found in a
shoebox entitled &#147;Poetry of the Damned&#148; and several versions of a
poem entitled &#147;Do You&#148;.  One version of the poem contained the
following series of questions and answers: &#147;Do you hear death?- I
do./ Do you see death?- I do./ Do you feel death?- I do./ Do you
speak death?- I do./ Do you give death?&#133;I do./ Well who are you?-
I don&#146;t know&#148;.  The evidence also included newspaper articles
about murders, and commercially-produced posters depicting: (i) a
mask or face being pulled by four chains, (ii) a figure whose
intestines are attached to another figure, and (iii) a man with a
knife standing over a naked man.
[74] Counsel for the appellant also argues that the trial judge
erred in admitting the poem and the story after the first voir
dire and the other materials found in the appellant&#146;s room
following the third voir dire.  In my view, it is preferable that
the determination of the admissibility of that evidence be left
to the trial judge on the new trial.  I should not be taken as
having approved of the admission of any of this evidence.  Much
will depend on the dynamics in the new trial.
[75] At the first trial, the poem and the story were admitted
against the backdrop of the appellant&#146;s statements to Valliere
and the other officers.  I have held that a substantial portion
of the statement to Valliere is inadmissible and have left it for
the trial judge on the new trial to determine the admissibility
of the other statements.  The relevance of the story and the poem
will turn on whether the appellant&#146;s confession is linked to
them, with particular attention to the application of this
court&#146;s decisions in R. v. Malone (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 34.  The
admission of this evidence also requires a delicate balancing of
probative value against prejudicial effect.  In balancing the
probative value against the prejudicial effect of the evidence,
the fact that these two items represented only a very small part
of the appellant&#146;s writings for school and otherwise cannot be
overlooked.
[76] I should, in any event, not be taken as agreeing with the
reasons of the trial judge for admitting the evidence on either
the first or third voir dire.  For example, in the course of his
reasons for admitting the story on the first voir dire, the trial
judge said the following:

       I find that this article is relevant to motive.  It is also
       relevant to the accused&#146;s state of mind, and consciousness of the
       issue of whether or not the police had evidence about the crime.
       [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[77] I find some difficulty in understanding the relevancy of the
story to the appellant&#146;s &#147;consciousness of the issue of whether
or not the police had evidence about the crime&#148;.
[78] In relation to the other material from the appellant&#146;s
bedroom that was admitted following the third voir dire, the
appellant put his character in issue and also led evidence as to
the contents of Scott-Coe&#146;s room.  If the appellant were to use a
different strategy at the new trial, the case for admitting the
contents of the appellant&#146;s room would be much weaker.  As a
result, I am of the opinion that it is best that the relevance of
the evidence and the balancing of the probative value of the
evidence versus its prejudicial effect be undertaken in the
context of the new trial.
Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury regarding
this body of evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[79] In view of my comments in the preceding section, it is not
necessary to address the issue.</pre>
    <pre>III.      DID THE TRIAL JUDGE ERR IN REFUSING TO ALLOW THE
DEFENCE TO SHOW THE JURY VIDEOTAPED STATEMENTS MADE BY SCOTT-COE?</pre>
    <pre>[80] Scott-Coe made five statements to the police concerning the
disappearance and death of Brown, one written and four recorded
on videotape.  At trial, Scott-Coe admitted that his first four
statements were false.  In these statements, he at first denied
any involvement in Brown&#146;s death, and then claimed to have
witnessed Brown commit suicide.  In his fifth statement, Scott-
Coe said he saw the appellant push Brown off the cliff.  The
defence position was that this was a lie.  Scott-Coe also
testified at trial that he saw the appellant push Brown off the
cliff.
[81] The defence sought to play the three videotaped statements
in which Scott-Coe had admittedly lied, pursuant to s.10 of the
Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.  This section allows a
witness to be cross-examined with respect to previous statements
that have been recorded on videotape.  The section provides that
the content of a previous statement may be put to a witness as a
prior inconsistent statement.  The previous statement is not
admissible for the truth of its contents but only to impeach the
credibility of the witness.  If it is intended to contradict the
witness, the witness&#146; attention must be called to those parts of
the statement that are to be used for the purpose of
contradicting the witness.  In the alternative, the defence
sought to introduce the tapes as part of the appellant&#146;s case so
that the jury might observe the demeanour of Scott-Coe on three
occasions when he admitted to having lied to the police about the
case.  The trial judge dismissed the motion.
[82] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by not
allowing the defence to show the prior inconsistent statements
contained on the videotapes to the jury, either during cross-
examination or as original demonstrative evidence during the case
for the defence.  In R. v. Proverbs, (1983) 9 C.C.C. (3d) 249
(Ont. C.A.), Dubin J.A. stated at 262:

      &#133; A trial judge is not obliged to permit an unlimited cross-
      examination where there is no need for it, and where there would
      be no practical result in allowing it to continue. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[83] As a result, Dubin J.A. held that the trial judge had not
erred in refusing to allow the defence, as part of its cross-
examination of a police officer, to show a secret videotape that
had been made of the officer speaking to his partner, when the
defence had already cross-examined the officer on it.  The trial
judge held, however, that if the defence wanted to show the
videotape to the jury it could only do so as part of the defence
and Dubin J.A. thought he was also correct in this opinion.  It
follows that, in this case, the trial judge did not err in
refusing to allow the defence to show the videotapes of Scott-
Coe&#146;s statements to the police during cross-examination.  The
submission of the appellant that the defence should have been
allowed to play the videotapes as demonstrative evidence during
the case for the defence does not appear to have been raised at
trial.  Had it been raised, it would appear that the defence
should have been allowed to show the videotapes as part of its
case.
[84] It does not appear that the appellant was prejudiced by the
trial judge&#146;s refusal to allow the tapes to be played.  For one,
the defence put portions of Scott-Coe&#146;s prior statements to him
in cross-examination, pointing out in each instance that the
prior statements were lies, and Scott-Coe admitted that his first
four prior statements were lies. Also, one of the trial judge&#146;s
concerns was that he might have to allow the Crown to play Scott-
Coe&#146;s fifth statement, which was consistent with Scott-Coe&#146;s
testimony at trial, out of fairness and to rehabilitate the
witness.  Any benefit to the defence stemming from the playing of
statements one to four would likely have been neutralized if this
had happened.  While the appellant contends that the fifth
statement would have remained inadmissible it seems to me that,
in order to give the jury a complete picture, the fifth statement
would also have had to have been played.</pre>
    <pre>IV.  DID THE TRIAL JUDGE MISAPPLY THE COLLATERAL FACT RULE TO
     EXCLUDE RENE GAGNE&#146;S EVIDENCE?</pre>
    <pre>[85] On November 17, 1994, the day before Brown&#146;s death, Rene
Gagne went to the gravel pit with several friends, including the
appellant and Scott-Coe.  As she stood near the edge of the pit,
Scott-Coe grabbed her and shook her saying, &#147;Saved your life&#148;,
and this scared Gagne.  Furthermore, Gagne saw Scott-Coe perform
a similar action with another girl, Cindy Tremblay.
[86] When the defence cross-examined Scott-Coe about this
incident during the Crown&#146;s case, he admitted having gone to the
pit on November 17 but denied that he pretended to push anyone
off the cliff.  The defence sought to call Ms. Gagne at trial,
and a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of her
evidence.  The Crown took the position that her evidence was
inadmissible under the collateral fact rule.  The effect of this
rule is that, subject to certain exceptions, a party is not
entitled to introduce extrinsic evidence to contradict the
testimony of the opposing party&#146;s witness unless that extrinsic
evidence is relevant to some issue beyond merely contradicting
the witness.  This rule applies even where one of the core issues
in the case at trial is the credibility of a witness: Regina v.
B.(A.R.) (1999), 41 O.R. (3d) 361 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada refused June 17, 1999.
[87] The trial judge agreed with the Crown position that Gagne&#146;s
evidence went solely to the credibility of Scott-Coe and should
not be admitted.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
erred by excluding Gagne&#146;s evidence.  The respondent concedes
that the evidence should have been admitted.  The proposed
evidence was not directed solely to impeaching Scott-Coe&#146;s
credibility.  Rather, it was circumstantial evidence that the
defence could rely on to support its position that the identity
of the person who killed Brown was Scott-Coe and not the
appellant.  Because Gagne&#146;s evidence was independently admissible
on this question of identity, it was not collateral.  The defence
was entitled to attack the character of Scott-Coe and to adduce
evidence going to his propensity, motive, and opportunity to kill
Brown.</pre>
    <pre>V.   DID THE TRIAL JUDGE GIVE AN APPROPRIATE CAUTION CONCERNING
     SCOTT-COE&#146;S EVIDENCE?</pre>
    <pre>[88] Scott-Coe was initially charged with first-degree murder.
By the time of the appellant&#146;s trial, the charge against Scott-
Coe had been reduced to being an accessory after the fact.  Scott-
Coe testified as a Crown witness while the charges against him
remained outstanding.  At common law, an accessory after the fact
was regarded as an accomplice: R. v. Riezebos (1975), 26 C.C.C.
(2d) 1 at 8-11 (Ont. C.A.).  Inasmuch as Scott-Coe&#146;s charges were
unresolved at the time he testified against the appellant, the
respondent concedes that the trial judge had a duty to warn the
jury about the dangers of accepting his evidence.
[89] The trial judge gave the jury the standard Vetrovec caution
about the dangers of convicting the appellant solely on Scott-
Coe&#146;s evidence.  However, the appellant submits that he did not
alert the jury to the special dangers associated with the
testimony of an accomplice whose charges remain unresolved.
[90] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed the
members of the jury that:

       &#133; you should consider that Mr. Coe was charged with first
       degree murder, and that he is still to be tried on a charge of
       being an accessory after the fact.  So you should bear in mind
       that he may have an interest of his own to serve by giving
       evidence implicating the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[91] In addition, the trial judge's instructions to the jury
contained aspects on how they were to treat the evidence of Scott-
Coe.  These aspects included:</pre>
    <pre>· A review of the defence position that Scott-Coe had killed
  Brown and that Scott-Coe&#146;s evidence was not to be believed;</pre>
    <pre>· A review of the evidence of Scott-Coe, in which the trial
  judge clearly pointed out to the jury that the first degree
  murder charge against Scott-Coe had been reduced or withdrawn,
  and that Scott-Coe had thought about the possibility of being re-
  charged with first degree murder if the jury did not believe him;
  and</pre>
    <pre>· A Vetrovec warning, mentioned above, including the
  instruction that Scott-Coe&#146;s evidence must be &#147;scrutinised with
  great care&#148;, that it was dangerous to rely on his evidence unless
  there was some support for it, and that the jury should consider
  the evidence concerning Scott-Coe&#146;s credibility before accepting
  his testimony.</pre>
    <pre>[92] The trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury, taken as a whole,
adequately alerted the jury to the dangers of relying on Scott-
Coe&#146;s evidence.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[93] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal and order a
new trial.  I would exclude the portion of the appellant&#146;s post-
polygraph statements to the polygraph operator, Det. Sgt.
Valliere, and to Sgt. Hutchingame, after the appellant said he
pushed Brown over the edge of the gravel pit.  This is because
these statements were obtained in an unfair manner and the
appellant&#146;s s.10 Charter rights were violated.
