    <pre>On Appeal from Cavarzan J. with a jury dated April 7, 1995.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>A.   OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant Robert McKnight was convicted by a jury of the
second-degree murder of his wife Janet. The trial judge, Cavarzan
J., imposed a period of parole ineligibility of 17 years. The
appellant appeals the parole ineligibility period.
[2]  McKnight murdered his wife in their bedroom with a 10-inch
serrated bread knife in the morning of January 10, 1994. The
attack lasted 10 to 15 minutes. The victim sustained numerous
injuries and had over 50 defensive wounds on her hands and
forearms.
[3]  The appellant&#146;s defence at trial was that he was not
criminally responsible under s.16 of the Criminal Code. All of
the expert witnesses agreed that at the time of the offence the
appellant suffered from major depression. Even the Crown&#146;s expert
acknowledged that the appellant likely would not have killed his
wife but for his depression, schizoid personality and
hypochondriacal fears.
[4]  The appellant was acquitted of first-degree murder but
convicted of second-degree murder. He spent 15 months in pre-
trial and pre-sentence custody. At the time of the offence, the
appellant was 52 years old and had been married to Janet McKnight
for 20 years. He has both a law degree and a medical degree. From
1985 until the date of the murder, he had his own medical
practice in Hamilton specializing in rehabilitating persons
injured in car accidents. He has no previous criminal record and
after the offence he expressed deep remorse for what he had done.
[5]  The jury recommended that the appellant serve 20 years of
his sentence before being eligible for parole. Defence counsel
recommended a parole ineligibility period of 10 years and Crown
counsel supported the 20 year period recommended by the jury. The
trial judge imposed 17 years.
[6]  The appellant appeals the period of parole ineligibility on
three grounds:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i)       The trial judge erred in principle by over-
               emphasizing the importance of denunciation and diminishing the
               appellant&#146;s potential for rehabilitation.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (ii)  The trial judge erred in principle
               by   misapprehending   the   psychiatric
               evidence  and by failing to give  enough
               weight to the mitigating aspects of that
               evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (iii)      The  trial  judge  imposed  a
               period of parole ineligibility that  was
               outside an acceptable range.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In my view, the trial judge did not commit either of the
errors in principle alleged by the appellant. He did, however,
impose a period of parole ineligibility that I consider
unreasonable. In my view, the appropriate range in this case was
12 to 15 years. I would impose a period of parole ineligibility
at the upper end of that range and, therefore, I would reduce the
period imposed by the trial judge from 17 years to 14 years.</pre>
    <pre>B.   APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Section 745.4 of the Criminal Code (s.744 at the time the
appellant was sentenced) gives the trial judge discretion to
increase the period of parole ineligibility from the minimum 10
years up to 25 years and requires the trial judge in exercising
that discretion to take into account the following four
considerations:
·    the character of the offender
·    the nature of the offence
·    the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence; and
·    any recommendation made by the jury under s.745.2 of the Code.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In assessing these considerations and in deciding whether to
increase the period of parole ineligibility, all of the
objectives of sentencing are relevant. In R. v. Shropshire1 the
Supreme Court of Canada held that the British Columbia Court of
Appeal had erred by isolating denunciation and future
dangerousness as the only relevant criteria. Iacobucci J. wrote
at pp. 203:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The only difference in terms of punishment between first and
          second degree murder is the duration of parole ineligibility.
          This clearly indicated that parole ineligibility is part of the
          &#147;punishment&#148; and thereby forms an important element of sentencing
          policy. As such, it must be concerned with deterrence, whether
          general or specific. The jurisprudence of this court is clear
          that deterrence is a well-established objective of sentencing
          policy. In R. v. Lyons (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p. 22&#133;, La
          Forest J. held:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In a rational system of sentencing,
               the respective importance of prevention,
               deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation
               will vary according to the nature of the
               crime and the circumstances of the offender.
               No  one would suggest that any of  these
               functional considerations should be excluded
               from the legitimate purview of legislative or
               judicial decisions regarding sentencing.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Section 744 must be concerned with  all
          of  the  factors  cited in Lyons.  In  R.  v.
          Luxton  (1990),  58  C.C.C.  (3d)  449&#133;,  the
          importance   of  structuring   sentences   to
          take  into  account  the  individual  accused
          and  the  particular  crime  was  emphasized.
          This   is  also  a  factor  that  any   order
          made   pursuant  to  s.744  ought   to   take
          into consideration.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Iacobucci J. also rejected the notion that the period of
parole ineligibility should only be increased in unusual
circumstances2:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [A]s a general rule, the period of parole ineligibility
          shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination
          of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in
          s.744, the offender should wait a longer period before having his
          suitability to be released into the general public assessed. To
          this end, an extension of the period of parole ineligibility
          would not be &#147;unusual&#148;, although it may well be that, in the
          median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be
          awarded.</pre>
    <pre>[11] With these principles in mind, I will briefly review the
relevant facts.</pre>
    <pre>C.   RELEVANT FACTS
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  The Offender and the Victim</pre>
    <pre>[12] Janet McKnight and the appellant met in 1963 and married a
decade later. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to
have children. When she died, Janet McKnight was a tenured
professor at the McMaster University School of Nursing. Over the
years, she had gained international acclaim, lecturing at such
diverse places as the United Arab Emirates and Chile. She had
been scheduled to lecture in Australia on February 2, 1994. Her
secretary described Janet as a kind, caring and compassionate
person with a wonderful sense of humour.
[13] The appellant was called to the Bar of the Law Society in
1967. He went back to school to study medicine and graduated from
McMaster University&#146;s medical school in 1977. In 1983, he was
certified by the College of Physicians and Surgeons as a
specialist in rehabilitation medicine. From 1985 until the
offence, he carried on his own practice rehabilitating accident
victims.
[14] The appellant testified that at first his marriage was a
&#147;good relationship&#148; but because of their separate careers he and
his wife had grown apart by 1986. He sought companionship
elsewhere by placing personal ads in local papers. Between 1986
and 1993, he carried on clandestine relationships with three
women. He showered these three women with gifts worth more than
$60,000. The first two relationships were non-sexual; the
appellant admitted that he fell in love with the third woman and
remained obsessed with her even though he ended the relationship
after he discovered she was seeing another man.
[15] On June 15, 1992, shortly after ending this relationship,
the appellant attempted to strangle his wife in the car inside
the garage of their home. That afternoon, the appellant&#146;s
secretary telephoned Janet McKnight to say that the appellant was
very depressed and that she should come and get him. Janet did
so, they drove home and parked the car in the garage. The
appellant then closed the garage door. He and his wife went into
the house for a few minutes and then returned to the car. As he
got into the car, the appellant decided to end his life and his
wife&#146;s because of problems in his medical practice and what he
considered to be &#147;the imminent disaster of a collapsed practice,
public censure and loss of face and standing&#148;. He began to choke
Janet. She, however, managed to press the garage door button and
sound the horn. Neighbours responded and the appellant was
eventually subdued. He was taken to St. Joseph&#146;s Hospital where
he stayed overnight. While at the hospital, he confessed to Janet
that he planned to kill both of them and their cats. The
following day he was taken to McMaster University Medical Centre
where he stayed for about a month.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  The Appellant&#146;s History of Depression</pre>
    <pre>[16] At trial, the appellant testified to his personal struggle
with depression. The earliest incident occurred in 1982 when he
was a medical student. Because he had lost some weight and muscle
tone, he feared that he had contracted amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Three doctors assured him that he did not have
ALS but he remained unconvinced and was depressed for three to
four weeks. In the spring of 1992 he became depressed after a
complaint about his practice from a professional colleague. He
did not sleep well, lost weight and was always tired.
[17] After his attempt to choke his wife, the treatment team at
McMaster initially diagnosed the incident as a brief psychotic
episode, not the result of a major depression. For the first two
weeks of his stay at the McMaster hospital, the appellant was
considered a suicide risk. Gradually his condition improved. When
he was discharged on July 17, 1992, Dr. Gaind, the supervisor of
the treatment team, gave a discharge diagnosis of major
depression with psychotic features. In Dr. Gaind&#146;s view, these
psychotic features were grounded in fears of professional
misconduct, which appeared to have no basis in reality. Dr. Gaind
testified that these fears escalated to delusional beliefs of
financial ruin, public humiliation and loss of respect in the
community. Dr. Gaind described these delusional beliefs as
nihilistic. He also suggested that the extension of these
nihilistic beliefs to Janet McKnight was consistent with
psychotic features and episodes of depression.
[18] After the appellant was released from McMaster Hospital, Dr.
Gaind referred him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Buie, who met with the
appellant nine times over the next year and one-half. Dr. Buie
concurred with Dr. Gaind&#146;s diagnosis of depression but could not
find any evidence of psychosis. He saw the appellant&#146;s health
concerns not as a delusional but as hypochondriacal fears
consistent with depression.
[19] The appellant felt better between August 1992 and August
1993 but his health concerns re-surfaced in the late summer of
1993. Successively, he believed that he was suffering from heart
disease, colon cancer and ALS. A complaint about him from a
chiropractor to the Ontario Medical Association exacerbated his
depression. Dr. Buie testified that the appellant was an anxious
man, inclined to exaggerate fears and dangers. He suggested that
the appellant&#146;s fears were a product of a perfectionist and
obsessive personality.
[20] The appellant showed signs of stress and depression when Dr.
Buie saw him on December 13, 1993. Dr. Buie prescribed an anti-
depressant, feeling that the appellant&#146;s depression would worsen
if not treated. The appellant said that he felt depressed over
the Christmas holidays in 1993. He testified that he nonetheless
tried to appear as normal as possible at Christmas, which he
spent with his wife and her family. After Christmas, he and Janet
McKnight went to New York City for four or five days. In the two
weeks before the murder, the appellant was seen smiling, waving
to his neighbours and shoveling snow with Janet. He seemed to be
in reasonable spirits. Dr. Gaind described this behaviour as
&#147;smiling depression&#148;, the desire and ability of a person not to
be seen to be depressed but to maintain a fairly normal façade
despite subjective feelings of depression.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  The Week Before the Murder</pre>
    <pre>[21] On January 3, 1994, the appellant returned to work. He
testified that he continued to be depressed for the next week.
His wife knew that he was depressed and commented to him about
it.
[22] The appellant testified that by January 4th he entertained
thoughts of suicide, although he told Dr. Buie otherwise. On
January 3rd or 4th he obtained prescriptions for 60 tablets of
phenobarb, a lethal dosage. On January 8th, he took more steps to
prepare for his suicide. He obtained 30 tablets of lorazepan and
purchased a rope at Canadian Tire. On January 9th, the day before
the murder, he drove around aimlessly, then went to his office,
took all his personal papers from his briefcase and left the
briefcase by the back door. He and wife had supper together but
later that evening he practiced making nooses with a shoelace and
necktie. He had no thoughts of harming his wife that day.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)  The Murder &#150; January 10, 1994</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant testified that he awoke at 6:30 a.m. on
January 10, 1994 with the same thoughts and fears he had on June
15, 1992 when he first tried to kill his wife. He went downstairs
to the kitchen, took a 10-inch serrated bread knife, and while
his wife was still asleep, put the knife under the foot of the
bed. He said that he was uncertain whether he would use it. For
the next 10 to 20 minutes he tried to fall back asleep. Then the
alarm went off and Janet McKnight got up and went to the
bathroom. The appellant got out of bed and waited in the middle
of the room. When Janet came out of the bathroom, the appellant
grabbed her around the neck and tried to choke her. During the
struggle which then took place, the appellant took the knife and
repeatedly stabbed his wife. The attack lasted 10 to 15 minutes.
Janet McKnight pleaded for her life. She asked whether he wanted
her dead because she had become overweight or because he had a
girlfriend. He replied no. No other words were spoken.
[24] Janet suffered numerous injuries, mainly to her arms, hands,
neck, shoulders and face. She had nine or more deep wounds on her
right shoulder and over 50 defensive wounds on her hands and
forearms.
[25] The appellant testified that throughout his attack on his
wife he was thinking about the tragedy about to befall them. He
thought of the allegations against him in front of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons and his outstanding debts. He said that
he had no feeling at the time and only later did he think that he
might have done something wrong.
[26] After the attack he put down the knife and sat at the top of
the staircase. Several hours later, believing the police would
soon arrive, he decided to hang himself. He did not think he had
time to go to his car to get the rope he had purchased from
Canadian Tire. Instead he took a pair of shoelaces, tied them
together and tied the laces around a column. With his knees bent
he stood on a side table and put the noose around his neck. When
the appellant did not arrive for work, his secretary became
concerned. Eventually she called the police who went inside the
appellant&#146;s home around noon. The police found the appellant with
the noose around his neck. They cut the laces and helped him down
from the table. The appellant was taken to the Hamilton Civic
Hospital where he was described as being almost catatonic. He
testified that at the time he was heartbroken over what he had
done and felt terrible.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (e)  The Expert Evidence of the Appellant&#146;s Mental State</pre>
    <pre>[27] The defence called two experts, Dr. John Bradford, the
clinical director of the Royal Ottawa Hospital and Dr. Brian
Butler. Dr. Andrew Malcolm testified for the Crown.
[28] The appellant was transferred to the Royal Ottawa Hospital
under an order to assess his fitness to stand trial. In Dr.
Bradford&#146;s opinion, the appellant had been suffering from major
depression with psychotic features since before January 10, 1994.
He disagreed that the appellant&#146;s trip to New York City with his
wife after Christmas was inconsistent with a diagnosis of
depression. Dr. Bradford explained that at times people mask
their depression and present themselves to psychiatrists and
physicians as reasonable people when in fact they are severely
depressed. The staff at the Royal Ottawa Hospital recommended
that the appellant was medically fit to stand trial.
[29] Dr. Butler met with the appellant twice. In his opinion, on
January 10, 1994 &#147;the appellant was suffering from major
depressive episode, severe in nature with psychotic features&#148;. He
also showed signed of schizoid and obsessional personality. Dr.
Butler concluded that the appellant&#146;s depression moved from mild
to moderate and then became severe at the time of the murder and
afterwards.
[30] Dr. Malcolm met with the appellant three times in early
1995. Dr. Malcolm accepted that the appellant suffered from
depression from December 1993 to January 10, 1994 but he viewed
the real issue as the severity of the depression. He agreed with
Dr. Butler that the appellant&#146;s depression was mild to moderate
before January 10, 1994 and became severe after the offence.
However, in Dr. Malcolm&#146;s opinion, the appellant&#146;s conduct at
Christmas and his trip to New York City showed that he was not
overwhelmingly depressed just before the murder.
[31] Dr. Malcolm thought that the appellant was probably good at
concealing his feelings other than depression, which explained
why Janet McKnight did not sense any danger and so did nothing to
protect herself before she was killed. Dr. Malcolm also rejected
the notion that this was a murder suicide. In his opinion, the
stabbing was an act of &#147;exquisite and relentless hostility
towards a particular person&#148;. Although the appellant thought of
suicide, he was in a state of rage and fully aware that he wanted
to kill his wife.
[32] Nonetheless, Dr. Malcolm concluded that the appellant had a
disease of the mind, consisting of recurrent major depressive
disorder, a schizoid personality disorder and hypochondriacal
fears. Dr. Malcolm acknowledged that without this disease of the
mind, the appellant probably would not have killed his wife. He
testified:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Now, I am quite willing to say without this disease of the
          mind of the various elements I have mentioned already in this
          examination, he probably would not have committed this act.
          Without the depression, without the schizoid personality, without
          the hypochondriasis &#150; as well the dysthymia is also the
          depression &#150; without all those things he wouldn&#146;t have done this.
          I agree with that absolutely.</pre>
    <pre>[33] I now turn to the grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>D.   GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[34] The period of parole ineligibility imposed by a trial judge
in the exercise of the judge&#146;s discretion is an element of the
sentence for second-degree murder. The period imposed by the
trial judge is therefore entitled to deference on appeal. An
appellate court should interfere only if the trial judge erred in
principle or imposed a period of parole ineligibility that was
unreasonable because it was outside an acceptable range.
          </pre>
    <pre>          First Submission:  The trial judge erred in principle
          by over-emphasizing denunciation and diminishing the
          appellant&#146;s potential for rehabilitation.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The appellant submits that the trial judge made an error in
principle because he over-emphasized denunciation and did not
give enough weight to the appellant&#146;s potential for
rehabilitation. Both denunciation and rehabilitation are relevant
factors in fixing the period of parole ineligibility. Moreover,
this court has held that over-emphasizing a relevant factor or
failing to give enough weight to a relevant factor may amount to
an error in principle3. This does not mean, however, that an
appellate court is justified in interfering with a trial judge&#146;s
exercise of discretion merely because it would have given
different weight or emphasis to a factor relevant to the
sentence. To suggest that a trial judge commits an error in
principle because in an appellate court&#146;s opinion the trial judge
gave too much weight to one relevant factor or not enough weight
to another is to abandon deference altogether. The weighing of
relevant factors,  the balancing process is what the exercise of
discretion is all about4. To maintain deference to the trial
judge&#146;s exercise of discretion, the weighing or balancing of
relevant factors must be assessed against the reasonableness
standard of review. Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not
giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his or
her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere
with the sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in
principle.
[36] In imposing a period of parole ineligibility above the
minimum, the trial judge relied heavily on denunciation of the
appellant and his crime; he gave far less weight to the
appellant&#146;s potential for rehabilitation. In weighing these two
factors in my opinion, the trial judge did not exercise his
discretion unreasonably. Admittedly, the trial judge relied on
the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Brown5,
which was disapproved of by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Shropshire. Referring to Brown, Cavarzan J. wrote:  &#147;It has been
said that it surely must be under the heading of denunciation of
the offender and the crime that the justification must lie for
the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility in excess of
ten years&#133;&#148;.
[37] Although all sentencing objectives are relevant to the
determination of the period of parole ineligibility, depending on
the facts of the case, the trial judge is entitled to give
different weight to the various objectives. On the facts of this
case, the trial judge was reasonably entitled to emphasize
denunciation in the way that he did.
[38] In considering the appellant&#146;s potential for rehabilitation,
Cavarzan J. held:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An additional consideration under &#147;the character of the
          offender&#148; factor in s.744 of the Code is the rehabilitation
          potential of the offender. In a case such as this, however, where
          the minimum sentence is life imprisonment with a period of parole
          ineligibility of ten years, this consideration cannot have the
          same scope that it would have in other sentencing situations.</pre>
    <pre>[39] His words mirror the observation of Morden A.C.J.O. speaking
for this court in R. v. A. (T.S.)6:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; I think that under the &#147;character of the offender&#148; factor
          in s.744 of the Code, the rehabilitation potential of the
          offender cannot be excluded from consideration. I recognize,
          however, that in the setting of a sentence of life imprisonment
          with a minimum period of parole ineligibility of ten years, this
          factor cannot have the same scope that it would have in other
          sentencing situations.</pre>
    <pre>The words of Morden A.C.J.O., which were applied by Cavarzan J.,
reflect the common sense notion that the statutory 10 year
minimum period of parole ineligibility for second-degree murder
limits the weight that can be accorded to the appellant&#146;s
prospects of rehabilitation.</pre>
    <pre>[40] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Second Submission: The trial judge erred in principle by
          misapprehending the psychiatric evidence and by failing to give
          enough weight to the mitigating aspects of that evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[41] The appellant submits that the trial misapprehended the
psychiatric evidence and thus failed to use it as a mitigating
factor in fixing the period of parole ineligibility. In support
of this submission, the appellant relies on the following passage
from the trial judge&#146;s reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A further aggravating factor is the breach of trust involved
          in representing to your wife, to her family, and to her friends
          that all was well in the marriage. The deception practised on
          your wife and on the psychiatrists who undertook to help you, fed
          the false sense of security evidently felt by your wife in the
          days preceding the fatal attack and was instrumental in exposing
          her to such an attack. She had every right to feel safe and
          secure in the bedroom of the house she shared with you.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The appellant acknowledges that his attack on his wife was a
breach of trust and properly considered as an aggravating factor.
The appellant argues, however, that the way the trial judge
characterized his behaviour in the days before the murder was not
supported by the evidence.
[43] This argument fails for three reasons. First, the trial
judge&#146;s reasons show that he appreciated the psychiatric
evidence, which he succinctly and accurately summarized as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The unanimous opinion of the psychiatrists who testified at
          the behest of both the Crown and the defence, was that you were
          suffering a bout of major depression when you killed your wife on
          January 10, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>[44] Second, ample evidence was led at trial for Cavarzan J. to
reasonably conclude that despite the previous attempt on her
life, Janet McKnight was lulled into a sense of security by the
appellant&#146;s seemingly contented attitude in the weeks before the
murder. The appellant&#146;s attitude contributed to his wife&#146;s
vulnerability. Moreover, the trial judge&#146;s finding that the
appellant led his wife to believe &#147;all was well in the marriage&#148;
is not at odds with the psychiatric evidence concerning the
appellant&#146;s depression.
[45] Finally, the trial judge expressly stated that in fixing the
period of parole ineligibility, he considered the &#147;relevant
medical and psychiatric evidence&#148;. I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Third Submission:  17 years parole ineligibility is outside
          an acceptable range.</pre>
    <pre>[46] The aggravating features of this crime and the circumstances
surrounding its commission fully justified an increase in the
period of parole ineligibility. These aggravating features
included:  the appellant had made a previous attempt to kill his
wife; during the marriage he carried on clandestine relationships
with three other women; in the weeks preceding the offence he led
his wife to believe that &#147;all was well in the marriage&#148;; he
murdered Janet McKnight in the trial judge&#146;s words &#147;with savage
brutality&#148; when she was least suspecting, having just woken up;
the killing was a breach of trust and showed elements of planning
and deliberation; after the murder, the appellant did not try to
get help but instead faked an attempted suicide.
[47] On the other side of the scale, the appellant can point to
several features about his character and his circumstances that
mitigate any increase in parole ineligibility. These mitigating
features include:  he had no previous criminal record; he had
contributed to society by practicing medicine and helping to
rehabilitate accident victims; when the crime occurred he was
severely depressed and even the Crown&#146;s expert Dr. Malcolm
conceded that but for his depression, the appellant would likely
not have killed his wife;  he expressed deep and genuine remorse
for what he did; he has positive potential for rehabilitation; he
was 53 years old when sentenced and with a 17-year period of
parole ineligibility would not be eligible for parole until he
was 69.
[48] Taking into account all of these aggravating and mitigating
features, in my opinion, a 17-year period of parole ineligibility
falls outside a reasonable range. No two cases are the same but
similar cases from this province of brutal second-degree murders
of an unarmed wife or girlfriend suggest a range of 12 to 15
years.
[49] In R. v. McMaster7, the appellant stabbed his girlfriend
while she was sleeping. The trial judge imposed a 12-year period
of parole ineligibility, which was upheld by this court. In R. v.
Munroe8, the appellant strangled his wife after becoming
overwrought with anger during an argument. During the marriage,
he had exhibited a previous pattern of violence and emotional
abuse extending over several years. The jury made no
recommendation on the period of parole ineligibility. The trial
judge imposed 12 years, which was upheld on appeal.
[50] In contrast, in R. v. Muir9, the accused murdered his wife
by shooting her when she was asleep. He had no criminal record,
had not previously abused his wife during the marriage and was
remorseful. The jury had not recommended an increase in parole
ineligibility beyond the mandatory 10 years. The trial judge
imposed 12 years. Although a case of spousal homicide, this court
reduced the period to 10 years finding no justification for the
increase.
[51] In R. v. McCormack10, a particularly helpful case on the
facts, this court used Munroe as a guide in imposing a 12-year
period of parole ineligibility. In McCormack, the accused&#146;s
killing of his wife was brutal and unprovoked. He had a lengthy
history of inflicting verbal and physical abuse on his wife. He
also had a criminal record. Although most of the offences were
unrelated, a few years before the murder, he was convicted of
assaulting his wife and a year before the murder, he had chased
his wife with a knife and was convicted of carrying a concealed
weapon. Eight jurors declined to make any recommendation on
parole ineligibility but the other four jurors recommended the
maximum period, 25 years. The trial judge imposed 14 years
observing: &#147;[I]t is that vulnerability and the betrayal of that
trust which sets wife murder apart from other forms of murder. It
is itself an exceptional circumstance which justifies the
increase of the period of parole ineligibility&#148;. On appeal, the
majority of a panel of this court reduced the period to 12 years
concluding that &#147;it was an error in principle for the trial judge
to hold that wife murder is in itself an exceptional circumstance
justifying an increase in the period of parole ineligibility&#148;.
[52] Other relevant Ontario cases include R. v. Barry11 in which
the accused brutally killed his girlfriend. She suffered 62 stab
wounds to her head, chest, abdomen, back, right arm and hands.
She was unarmed and many of the wounds were defensive. The</pre>
    <pre>accused also superficially wounded himself to try to give
credence to his story of being attacked by the victim. He had no
previous criminal record but posed some risk of re-offending.
Nine jurors recommended 10 years parole ineligibility and three
recommended 15 years. The trial judge, Watt J., imposed a 12-year
period, which was upheld by this court.</pre>
    <pre>[53] In R. v. Parmar12, the accused stabbed his girlfriend to
death in her house, after locking her children outside. He had a
previous conviction for domestic assault. The trial judge imposed
a 15-year period of parole ineligibility, the period recommended
by the jury. Finally, in R. v. Morrow13, the accused murdered his
common law spouse by cutting her throat in front of their 2 ½
year old son. The accused had a criminal record, which included a
conviction for assault causing bodily harm to his son when the
boy was four months old. The jury recommended a 20-year period of
parole ineligibility. The trial judge imposed 15 years.
[54] The trial judge in the case before us did not refer to any
of this case law, and in fairness to him, several of the cases
were decided around or just after the time that he sentenced the
appellant. My survey of  recent Ontario case law suggests a
reasonable range of 12 to 15 years parole ineligibility for the
appellant. I would fix his period of parole ineligibility at the
upper end of that range, at 14 years.
[55] The jury recommended a 20-year period of parole
ineligibility and the jury&#146;s recommendation must be considered in
fixing the appropriate period. Nonetheless the jury&#146;s
recommendation need not be slavishly followed. As Watt J. pointed
out in R. v. Barry:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is difficult to gauge with any accuracy the weight that
          should be attributed to a jury recommendation regarding parole
          ineligibility. In one sense, it might be said to represent the
          community view upon the issue. To so hold, however, as it appears
          to me, is somewhat to overstate the case. They are given no
          guidance on the precedents concerning the appropriate range. They
          are simply told the numbers. They are not required at least to
          endeavour to achieve unanimity. It is, as it was in this case,
          but a brief, somewhat informal exercise, after they have been
          earlier told that sentence forms no part of their responsibility
          in determining liability, and then thereafter told it is but a
          recommendation. They receive no further evidence concerning, for
          example, the likelihood of recidivism, future danger to society
          or other matters which might logically bear upon the issue other
          than what they can recall was given at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[56] Here the jury recommended a significant increase in the
period of parole ineligibility. In that sense, I would give
effect to the jury&#146;s recommendation. However, although this was
horrible and brutal killing of a kind and decent woman, I think a
period of 20 years or even 17 years is excessive. Setting parole
ineligibility at 14 years does not mean that the appellant will
automatically be released from prison after serving this time.
The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder
of his wife. After he has served 14 years, the parole authorities
will assess whether he should remain in custody.</pre>
    <pre>E.   CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[57] I would grant leave to appeal the period of parole
ineligibility. I would allow the appeal and reduce the period of
parole ineligibility to 14 years.

    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O. (DISSENTING):</pre>
    <pre>[58] The appellant, Robert McKnight, was convicted by the verdict
of a jury of second degree murder in the killing of his wife,
Janet McKnight. The jury that found him guilty made a parole
ineligibility recommendation pursuant to section 74314 of the
Criminal Code, recommending a period of 20 years parole
ineligibility. After hearing the submissions from the appellant
and the Crown, the trial judge, Cavarzan J., sentenced the
appellant to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for
17 years. The appellant appeals against his sentence.

FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[59] Counsel submitted an agreed statement of facts for
consideration of this appeal.
[60] The appellant and the deceased were married for over 20
years. They did not have any children. At the time of the
offence, the appellant was 52 years old, and a member of good
standing in the Law Society of Upper Canada. He was also a
licensed physician, and he had his own medical practice in
Hamilton, Ontario, focusing on musculo-skeletal injuries arising
from motor vehicle accidents. The deceased was a tenured nursing
professor at the McMaster University School of Nursing.
</pre>
    <pre>[61] On January 10, 1994 at approximately 6:30 a.m., while the
deceased was sleeping, the appellant went downstairs to their
kitchen, where he retrieved a 10-inch serrated bread knife. The
appellant returned to the bedroom, placed the knife under the
foot of the bed, and got back into bed. The appellant lay in bed
beside his sleeping wife for approximately 10 - 20 minutes, at
which point the alarm went off.
[62] The deceased woke up and went into the bathroom. As the
deceased came out of the bathroom, the appellant grabbed her
around the neck and began to choke her. He then took the knife
that he had stored behind the bed and repeatedly stabbed the
deceased.
[63] The attack lasted ten to fifteen minutes. During the attack,
Janet McKnight begged for her life. She asked the appellant why
he was attacking her. Specifically, she asked whether he wanted
her dead because she had grown overweight, or because he had a
girlfriend, to which the appellant replied no. No other words
were apparently spoken.
[64] The deceased suffered numerous injuries, primarily to her
arms, hands, neck, shoulders and face. She had over 50 defensive
wounds on her hands and forearms, and over 50 superficial wounds
to both of her shoulders. There were more than 20 wounds around
the back of her neck. The deceased lost most of her blood from a
deep incised wound at the front of her neck.  The evidence
indicated that for at least part of the attack, the appellant had
incapacitated the deceased by straddling her back.
[65] Following the attack, the appellant put down the knife and
left the bedroom. He sat at the top of the staircase outside the
bedroom. Several hours later, feeling that the arrival of the
police was imminent, the appellant allegedly decided to hang
himself. He removed a pair of shoelaces from a pair of athletic
shoes and tied them together to form a noose.
[66] The appellant's secretary became concerned when the
appellant did not arrive at work. She called her husband, who
went to the McKnight's home at approximately 9:45 a.m., and
knocked at their door, but did not receive a response. The police
were then called. Upon entering the McKnights&#146; home at
approximately noon, the police found the appellant with the noose
around his neck. The police cut the shoelaces and helped the
appellant down from the table. The police asked the appellant if
he had done something to his wife, and he indicated that he had.
[67] The appellant was charged with first degree murder. He
pleaded not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.
Specifically, the appellant claimed that he suffered from
depression and other psychotic features which prevented him from
appreciating the nature and quality of his actions in killing his
wife, and that he did not understand at the time of the attack
that what he was doing was wrong. A great deal of evidence was
led at trial regarding the appellant's mental state before,
during and after he killed his wife.
[68] The appellant had experienced episodes of mental illness
prior to the fatal attack on his wife. He experienced episodes of
depression, often accompanied by unfounded concerns about his
health. In 1982, while he was in medical school, the appellant
became convinced that he was suffering from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Despite assurances from three physicians that he
did not have ALS, the appellant remained unconvinced, and he was
depressed for three to four weeks.
[69] In 1992, the appellant was experiencing significant pressure
at work. He became depressed and was unable to keep pace with his
medial practice. His poor work performance worsened his state of
depression. During the afternoon of June 15, 1992, the
appellant's secretary called Janet McKnight and told her that the
appellant was very depressed. Janet McKnight attended at the
appellant's office, and they agreed that he would seek treatment.
They returned home so that the appellant could collect his
wallet.
[70] While the appellant and his wife were seated in the car in
their garage, the appellant reached over and began to choke her.
She managed to press the garage door button and sounded the horn.
Neighbours responded, and the appellant was subdued and then
taken to hospital. While at the hospital, the appellant admitted
that he was attempting to kill both Janet and himself. The
appellant had felt that, in order to protect Janet and him from
what he considered was the imminent collapse of his practice,
public censure and a loss of face and standing, he had decided
that the only course of action was to end both of their lives.
[71] The appellant remained in hospital for approximately one
month. His diagnosis upon discharge was major depression with
psychotic features. The appellant was referred to a psychiatrist,
Dr. Buie, for ongoing outpatient therapy. The appellant saw Dr.
Buie nine times over the next year and a half.
[72] The appellant's mental condition generally improved between
the summers of 1992 and 1993, except for a brief relapse in the
fall of 1992 which was primarily attributable to the appellant's
ceasing to take his medication.
[73] In August 1993, the appellant became concerned about a
complaint that had been filed against him with the Ontario
Medical Association. The appellant also began to develop further
concerns regarding his health. Despite tests which indicated that
these medical concerns were unfounded, the appellant continued to
worry about his health.
[74] In November 1993, the appellant again became convinced that
he was suffering from ALS. Once again, medical tests failed to
assuage these fears. In December, 1993 the appellant also lost
money in stocks and his real estate properties were depreciating
in value. Once again, the appellant fell behind in his work.
[75] The appellant saw Dr. Buie on December 13 and 21, 1993, and
January 4, 1994. While Dr. Buie found that the appellant was
exhibiting signs of depression and stress, he did not find any
evidence of delusions or signs of psychosis during those
sessions. He prescribed the appellant an anti-depressant, Paxil.
The appellant spent Christmas with his wife and her family.
Following Christmas, the appellant and his wife took a brief
holiday in New York. While the appellant testified that he felt
depressed throughout this time, he appeared quite normal to
friends, family, colleagues and neighbours.
[76] The appellant told Dr. Buie during their January 4, 1994
session that he did not have any suicidal thoughts. However, the
appellant testified that he began entertaining thoughts of
suicide around that time. He testified that he took various steps
to prepare for his suicide. He obtained prescriptions for drugs
with the thought of overdosing. He also purchased a rope at
Canadian Tire.
[77] The appellant testified that he awoke on the morning of
January 10, 1994 with the same thoughts and fears that he had
experienced on June 15, 1992, when he first attempted to kill his
wife. He decided that, in order to avoid their imminent financial
and personal ruination, they would both have to die.
</pre>
    <pre>[78] The appellant testified that throughout his attack on the
deceased, he was &quot;thinking about the tragedy that was going to
befall&quot; them. The appellant testified that he had no feeling at
the time, and that it only came to him later, while sitting on
the stairs, that he might have done something wrong. The
appellant also testified that he attempted to kill himself by
hanging. However, the rope that he had purchased for that purpose
was in his car, and he felt that he did not have time to retrieve
it before the police came. He therefore made a noose out of
shoelaces. He tied the laces around a column and, with his knees
bent, stood on a side table and put the noose around his neck.
Shortly thereafter the police entered the McKnight home and found
the appellant.
[79] Defence counsel called two expert medical witnesses at
trial. Dr. John Bradford treated the appellant following his
arrival at the Royal Ottawa Hospital on January 28, 1994. Dr.
Bradford testified that, in his opinion, the appellant had been
suffering from major depression with psychotic features since
before January 10, 1994. Dr. Bradford testified that the
appellant's psychotic features, particularly his feelings of
despair and hopelessness, produced thoughts of extended suicide:
a distorted but altruistic frame of mind in which a person feels
that the only way to protect a loved one from misery is to kill
him or her. Dr. Bradford's opinion was that, although the
appellant could appreciate the physical nature and consequences
of his actions on the morning of January 10, 1994, the appellant
was not able to consider the views of the community, nor did he
have the capacity to realize that his actions were wrong.
[80] Dr. Brian Butler met with the appellant on January 24, 1994
and February 9, 1995. Dr. Butler testified that, in his opinion,
&quot;the appellant was suffering from major depressive episode,
severe in nature with psychotic features&quot; on January 10, 1994.
Dr. Butler testified that the account of the killing given by the
accused was &quot;absolutely consistent with a man who is severely
mentally ill, with a severe state of depression and impairment in
his rational thinking processes&quot;. Dr. Butler gave the opinion
that, at the time of the killing, the appellant could not
&quot;address the wrongfulness of his conduct even though in the
general sense in his entire life he has always been pro social
and would recognize the wrongfulness of such conduct&quot;.
[81] The Crown also called an expert medical witness. Dr. Andrew
Malcolm interviewed the appellant on three occasions, February 26
and 28, 1995, and March 11, 1995. While Dr. Malcolm testified
that the appellant suffered from recurrent major depressive
disorder, along with schizoid personality and hypochondriachal
traits, it was his opinion that the appellant's disorder did not
have psychotic features. Dr. Malcolm gave the opinion that, at
the time of the killing, the appellant &quot;was fully aware that he
wanted to kill his wife, and possibly himself. He knew to do both
of these things would be both morally and legally wrong&quot;.
[82] The trial lasted 25 days. On March 24, 1995 the jury
returned a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder, but
guilty of second degree murder. The trial judge, Cavarzan J.,
then asked the jury, pursuant to s. 743 of the Criminal Code, if
they wished to make a recommendation regarding a period of parole
ineligibility for the appellant. After brief deliberations, the
jury returned with a recommendation of 20 years parole
ineligibility. On April 7, 1995, after hearing counsels&#146;
submissions regarding sentencing, Cavarzan J. sentenced the
appellant to life imprisonment, without eligibility for parole
for 17 years.</pre>
    <pre>Relevant Legislation</pre>
    <pre>[83] The relevant portions of the Criminal Code that were in
effect at the time of the appellant's sentencing are as follows.</pre>
    <pre>          74215.     Subject to s. 742.1, the sentence
          to be pronounced against a person who is to
          be sentenced to imprisonment for life shall
          be
          

</pre>
    <pre>                              .....
                                

</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  in respect of a person who has been
          convicted of second degree murder, that he be
          sentenced to imprisonment for life without
          eligibility for parole until he has served at
          least ten years of his life sentence or such
          greater number of years, not being more than
          twenty-five years, as has been substituted
          therefore pursuant to section 744;
          

</pre>
    <pre>          74316.     Subject to section 743.1, where a
          jury finds an accused guilty of second degree
          murder, the judge presiding at the trial
          shall, before discharging the jury, put to
          them the following question:
          

</pre>
    <pre>               You have found the accused guilty of
               second degree murder and the law
               requires that I now pronounce a sentence
               of imprisonment for life against the
               accused. Do you wish to make any
               recommendation with respect to the
               number of years that the accused must
               serve before the accused is eligible for
               release on parole?  You are not required
               to make any recommendation but if you
               do, your recommendation will be
               considered by me when I am determining
               whether I should substitute for the ten
               year period, which the law would
               otherwise require the accused to serve
               before the accused is eligible to be
               considered for release on parole, a
               number of years that is more than ten
               but not more than twenty-five.
               </pre>
    <pre>          74417.     Subject to section 744.1, at the
          time of the sentencing under paragraph 742(b)
          of an offender who is convicted of second
          degree murder, the judge who presided at the
          trial of the offender or, if that judge is
          unable to do so, any judge of the same court
          may, having regard to the character of the
          offender, the nature of the offence and the
          circumstances surrounding its commission, and
          to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant
          to section 743, by order, substitute for ten
          years a number of years of imprisonment
          (being more than ten but not more than twenty-
          five), without eligibility for parole, as the
          judge deems fit in the circumstances.
          

</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[84] It is a well-settled principle of law that appellate courts
are to allow sentencing judges deference. This deference equally
applies to decisions regarding parole ineligibility:  see R. v.
Shropshire (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.); R. v. M.(C.A.)
(1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327) (S.C.C.). In both cases, the Supreme
Court of Canada emphasized the importance of giving the trial
judge an element of discretion in deciding upon an appropriate
period of parole ineligibility. In Shropshire, the Supreme Court
identified the objective of s. 744 as &quot;to give the trial judge an
element of discretion in sentencing to reflect the fact that
within second degree murder there is both a range of seriousness
and varying degrees of moral culpability&quot; (p. 205). Hence, an
appellate court must afford a trial judge a wide discretion in
reviewing the period of parole ineligibility imposed, as stated
at p. 210:
          The formulation of a sentencing order is a
          profoundly subjective process; the trial
          judge has the advantage of having seen and
          heard all of the witnesses whereas the
          appellate court can only base itself upon a
          written record. A variation in the sentence
          should only be made if the Court of Appeal is
          convinced it is not fit. That is to say, that
          it has found the sentence to be clearly
          unreasonable.
          


</pre>
    <pre>[85] In M.(C.A.) (at p. 374), Lamer C.J.C., writing for the
Court, enumerated the &quot;profound functional justifications&quot; for
this deferential standard of review, including the following:
     [1]  (a)  where a trial was held, the trial judge has the
          advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime;
          </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  even in cases where a guilty plea was entered, and no
          trial held, the trial judge still has the advantage of
          being able to directly assess the sentencing
          submissions of both the Crown and the offender;
          </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  the unique qualifications of experience that trial
          judges have from &quot;having served on the front lines of
          our criminal justice system&quot;; and
          </pre>
    <pre>     (d)  the trial judge's relationship with the community that
          has suffered the consequences of the crime, resulting
          in a strong sense of what sentences would be &quot;just and
          appropriate&quot; for the protection of that community.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[86] An appellate court should not interfere with the period of
parole ineligibility imposed by the sentencing judge unless the
sentence imposed is &#147;clearly unreasonable&#148; (Shropshire, p.210).
In R. v. Rezaie, (1996) 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), Laskin
J.A. explained what the Supreme Court meant by &#147;clearly
unreasonable&#148; at p.103:
[1]</pre>
    <pre>          These two decisions [Shropshire and M.(C.A.)]
          demonstrate that an appellate court may
          interfere with a trial judge&#146;s sentencing
          discretion in only two kinds of cases. First,
          an appellate court may interfere if the
          sentencing judge commits an &#147;error in
          principle&#148;. Error in principle is a familiar
          basis for reviewing the exercise of judicial
          discretion. It connotes, at least, failing to
          take into account a relevant factor, taking
          into account an irrelevant factor, failing to
          give sufficient weight to relevant factors,
          overemphasizing relevant factors and, more
          generally, it includes an error of law. ¼
          

</pre>
    <pre>          Second, although the trial judge does not
          commit an error in principle, an appellate
          court may still interfere if the sentence is
          outside an &#147;acceptable range&#148;. The Supreme
          Court has used a variety of phrases to convey
          this point:  an appellate court cannot
          interfere unless the sentence is &#147;clearly
          unreasonable&#148;, &#147;clearly or manifestly
          excessive&#148;, &#147;clearly excessive or
          inadequate&#148;, &#147;demonstrably unfit&#148; or a
          &#147;substantial and marked departure&#148;. ¼
          
</pre>
    <pre>[87] The appellant submits that, in sentencing the appellant to a
period of 17 years parole ineligibility, the sentencing judge
committed three errors in principle. First, the appellant claims
that the sentencing judge overemphasized the importance of
denunciation and gave insufficient weight to the appellant&#146;s
prospects for rehabilitation, in imposing sentence. Second, the
appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in considering
elements of planning and deliberation as an aggravating factor.
Third, according to the appellant, the sentencing judge
misapprehended the psychiatric evidence given at trial regarding
the appellant, and failed to give sufficient weight to the
mitigating aspects of that evidence. The appellant also submits
that the period of parole ineligibility imposed by the sentencing
judge, 17 years, is outside the acceptable range of sentence.

</pre>
    <pre>(i)  Consideration of denunciation and potential for
rehabilitation
</pre>
    <pre>[88] At the beginning of his reasons for sentence, the sentencing
judge set out the factors that he was required to consider in
determining the appellant&#146;s period of parole ineligibility:
     Section 744 provides that in exercising that
     discretion, I must consider the character of the
     offender, the nature of the offence and the
     circumstances surrounding its commission, and the
     jury's recommendation.
     </pre>
    <pre>This approach to s. 744 is consistent with the wording of the
provision. It is also consistent with Iacobucci J.&#146;s analysis in
Shropshire, although the sentencing judge did not have the
benefit of the Supreme Court's reasoning in Shropshire, which was
released after the appellant's sentencing. At p. 201 in
Shropshire, Iacobucci J. stated:
</pre>
    <pre>          The factors to be considered in fixing an
          extended period of parole ineligibility are:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (1)  the character of the offender;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  the nature of the offence; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)the circumstances surrounding the
          commission of the offence;
          </pre>
    <pre>          all bearing in mind the discretionary power
          conferred on the trial judge.18
          
</pre>
    <pre>[89] The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in his
application of this approach, by giving insufficient weight to
appellant&#146;s prospects for rehabilitation and, in turn,
overemphasizing denunciation. He submits that the sentencing
judge overemphasized the need for denunciation due to his
reliance on the British Columbia Court of Appeal&#146;s decision in R.
v Brown (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 394. The appellant claims that
Brown was overturned by the Supreme Court&#146;s decision in
Shropshire, and that the sentencing judge, in relying on Brown,
erred in principle. The appellant relies on the following
passages from the reasons for sentence, in which Cavarzan J.
quotes extensively from Brown19:
     The questions which the sentencing judge should ask and
     should answer are the following:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Having regard to the factors set out in s. 744 of
          the Code, does society&#146;s expression of
          repudiation, that is, denunciation, for the
          particular crime by the particular accused,
          carrying with it that repudiation&#146;s concomitants
          of individual and general deterrence, require that
          in addition to the repudiation and denunciation
          involved in the imposition of a sentence of life
          imprisonment coupled with a period of parole
          ineligibility of 10 years, a further period of
          parole ineligibility must be added on to the 10-
          year period in order for the sentence to be
          commensurate with the gravity of the offence?  If
          so, how much longer should that period be?
          </pre>
    <pre>     [R. v. Brown, [supra] at 407]
     </pre>
    <pre>                               ..¼
                                </pre>
    <pre>     It has been said that it surely must be under the
     heading of denunciation of the offender and the crime
     that the justification of must lie for the imposition
     of a period of parole ineligibility in excess of ten
     years:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Sections 743 and 744 of the Code provide that
          after a jury verdict of second degree murder the
          trial judge will ask the jury for their
          recommendation about the period of parole
          ineligibility, and that if a recommendation is
          made the trial judge must have regard to it,
          though he need not necessarily follow it, in
          setting the period of parole ineligibility¼[T]hose
          provisions indicate and confirm that the principal
          purpose of the setting of a period of parole
          ineligibility of more than 10 years is
          denunciation of the offender and the crime because
          the jury&#146;s recommendation must be seen as
          reflecting society&#146;s view and it is in order to
          reflect society&#146;s view that denunciation is a
          sentencing factor at all.
          </pre>
    <pre>     [R. v. Brown, [supra] at 408]
     
</pre>
    <pre>[90] The sentencing judge very well may not have referred to
these passages from Brown, supra, had he the benefit of the
Supreme Court&#146;s decision in Shropshire. However, I find that the
sentencing judge&#146;s reference to Brown does not constitute an
error in principle for the following reasons.


</pre>
    <pre>[91] First, Iacobucci J. made clear in Shropshire that
denunciation of the crime committed is a relevant consideration
in a section 744 analysis, stating (at p. 202) that
&#147;'denunciation' can fall within the statutory criterion of the
&#145;nature of the offence&#146;&quot;. In Shropshire, the Supreme Court found
that the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal had
erred in their consideration of denunciation, not because they
considered denunciation as a relevant factor, but because they
considered it to the exclusion of other s. 744 criteria (at p.
201-202):
     By elevating &#147;denunciation&#148; and &#147;assessment of future
     dangerousness&#148; as the only criteria by which extended
     periods of parole ineligibility can be determined, the
     majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal has,
     in effect, judicially amended the clear statutory
     language.[Emphasis added.]
     </pre>
    <pre>A reading of the reasons for sentence in the present case as a
whole makes it clear that the sentencing judge, while considering
denunciation as a factor, also considered all of the other
factors relevant under s. 744, including the nature of the
offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission, and the
character of the offender, including his prospects for
rehabilitation.

</pre>
    <pre>[92] Furthermore, determining the period of parole ineligibility
under s. 744, like all sentencing, is a fact-sensitive process,
and the relative emphasis that a sentencing judge will place upon
the various criteria considered in sentencing will therefore vary
depending on the circumstances of the case. In Shropshire,
Iacobucci J. underscored this point (at p. 203) by referring to
the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. Lyons (1987), 37
C.C.C. (3d) 1:
     In R. v. Lyons [supra] at p. 22, La Forest J. held:
     </pre>
    <pre>          In a rational system of sentencing, the respective
          importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution
          and rehabilitation will vary according to the
          nature of the crime and the circumstances of the
          offender. No one would suggest that any of these
          functional considerations should be excluded from
          the legitimate purview of legislative or judicial
          decisions regarding sentencing.
          </pre>
    <pre>     Section 744 must be concerned with all of the factors
     cited in Lyons. In R. v. Luxton (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d)
     449 ¼ the importance of structuring sentences to take
     into account the individual accused and the particular
     crime was emphasized. This is also a factor that any
     order made pursuant to s. 744 ought to take into
     consideration.
     
</pre>
    <pre>I therefore agree with Laskin J.A.&#146;s statement (at paragraph 35
of his reasons) that appellate courts must afford a sentencing
judge the discretion to weigh the relevant sentencing factors as
he or she sees fit in the circumstances of a particular case.</pre>
    <pre>[93] Finally, I believe that it is important to note the context
in which the sentencing judge referred to Brown in his reasons
for sentence. The sentencing judge relied on Brown&#146;s holding that
&#147;an additional period of ineligibility should not be ordered
except in exceptional circumstances&#148;. In Shropshire, Iacobucci J.
rejected this threshold for having a period of parole
ineligibility in excess of ten years as being too high (at p.
204). To the extent that the sentencing judge believed that Brown
precluded him from imposing a period of parole ineligibility of
more than ten years unless he found the case to be &#147;unusual&#148;, the
sentencing judge&#146;s reliance on Brown would have benefited the
appellant. In the end, the sentencing judge concluded that there
were &#147;substantial and convincing reasons&#148; for imposing a longer
period of parole ineligibility. However, I find that he did so
only after a thorough review and consideration of all of the
factors of the appellant&#146;s case.
[94] The appellant submits that the sentencing judge did not give
sufficient weight to the appellant&#146;s prospects for
rehabilitation. I do not accept this submission. In his reasons
for sentence, the sentencing judge said:
     An additional consideration under the &#147;character of the
     offender&#148; factor in s. 744 of the Code is the
     rehabilitation potential of the offender. In a case
     such as this, however, where the minimum sentence is
     life imprisonment with a period of parole ineligibility
     of ten years, this consideration cannot have the same
     scope that it would have in other sentencing
     situations.
     </pre>
    <pre>     In this regard I recognize and have taken into
     consideration the absence of a prior criminal record,
     your candid admissions made at trial about prior non-
     criminal misconduct, and your expressions of remorse
     over your conduct.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[95] I find that the sentencing judge&#146;s approach to considering
the appellant&#146;s prospects for  rehabilitation, as outlined in the
first paragraph of the above excerpt, discloses no error in
principle. In effect, the sentencing judge is saying that
rehabilitation is relevant in a s. 744 analysis, although the ten-
year minimum parole ineligibility limits the extent to which an
appellant&#146;s &#147;positive&#148; rehabilitative prospects can be
considered. This analysis mirrors the reasoning of Morden
A.C.J.O., in R. v. A. (T.S.), a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, released February 23, 1995, leave to appeal to
S.C.C. refused November 16, 1995 (at p.13):
     With respect, I think that under the &#147;character of the
     offender&#148; factor in s. 744 of the Code, the
     rehabilitation potential of the offender cannot be
     excluded from consideration. I recognize, however, that
     in the setting of a sentence of life imprisonment with
     a minimum period of parole ineligibility of ten years,
     this factor cannot have the same scope it would have in
     other sentencing situations.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[96] Morden A.C.J.O.&#146;s finding that the minimum period of parole
ineligibility lessens the scope for consideration that may be
placed upon an accused&#146;s good prospects for rehabilitation is
consistent with the following statement from R. v. Ly (1992), 72
C.C.C. (3d) 57 (at p. 61) (Man. C.A.),which was cited approvingly
in both M.(C.A.) (at p. 361) and Shropshire (at p. 202):
     Parliament&#146;s purpose in adding a minimum period of
     parole ineligibility to a life sentence [for second
     degree murder] was, in my view, twofold. It was to
     deter and denounce the crime.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[97] In addition, I find that, in the second paragraph of the
above excerpt, the sentencing judge specifically turns his mind
to the rehabilitative prospects of the appellant, taking into
consideration the absence of prior criminal record,  the
appellant&#146;s candid admissions at trial about prior misconduct,
and the appellant&#146;s remorse.
[98] I therefore see no merit to this ground of appeal.
[1]  (ii) Planning and Deliberation
</pre>
    <pre>[99] In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge said:
     The record in this case discloses elements of planning
     and deliberation. This is an aggravating circumstance
     which adds to the gravity of the offence.
     </pre>
    <pre>The appellant submits that, in doing so, the sentencing judge, in
effect, implicitly rejected the jury&#146;s verdict that the appellant
was not guilty of first degree murder and, as such erred in
principle.

</pre>
    <pre>[100]     I do not agree. In my opinion, the sentencing judge was
correct in considering this aspect of the crime, as it falls
under the statutory criterion of &#147;the circumstances of the
commission of the offence&quot;. Once again, I adopt Morden A.C.J.O.&#146;s
analysis in R. v. A. (T.S.), supra, (at p. 9):
     In determining the gravity of the offence, it is proper
     for the sentencing judge to consider the planning and
     deliberation aspects of the evidence as relevant
     evidence of the &#147;nature of the offence and the
     circumstances surrounding its commission&#148; and many
     courts have done so:  R. v. S.B.S. (1990), 44 O.A.C.
     326 (C.A.); R. v. Johnston, Ont. C.A., June 25, 1991;
     R. v. Young (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont.C.A.); R.
     v. Chaudhary (No.2) (1988), 31 O.A.C. 243 (C.A.); R. v.
     Able (1993), 65 O.A.C. 37 (C.A.); and R. v. Kulba
     (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 349 (Man.C.A.)
     </pre>
    <pre>     It would make no sense and, indeed, would distort the
     facts, if courts could consider a whole range of
     aggravating circumstances under s. 744 but not, because
     they are elements of first degree murder, those which
     indicate planning and deliberation.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[101]     I would also note that, earlier in his reasons for
sentence, the sentencing judge specifically directed himself that
he &#147;should not apply a period of parole ineligibility so as to
implicitly reject the finding  of the jury that the crime did not
fall within the category of first degree murder&#148;. The appellant
does not dispute that the record did indeed disclose elements of
planning and deliberation. The sentencing judge properly
considered these factors along with all of the other factors
relevant under s. 744.
[102]     This ground of appeal must also fail.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)     Psychiatric Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[103]     The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred
by misapprehending the psychiatric evidence in this case. He
further submits that the sentencing judge failed to give
sufficient weight to the mitigating aspects of this evidence. The
Crown submits that the appellant&#146;s argument on this ground really
amounts to an attack on the jury&#146;s verdict.
[104]     The appellant points to the following passage in the
sentencing judge&#146;s reasons:
     A further aggravating factor is the breach of trust
     involved in representing to your wife, to her family,
     and to her friends that all was well in the marriage.
     The deception practised on your wife and on the
     psychiatrists who undertook to help you, fed the false
     sense of security evidently felt by your wife in the
     days preceding the fatal attack and was instrumental in
     exposing her to such an attack. She had every right to
     feel safe and secure in the bedroom of the house she
     shared with you.
</pre>
    <pre>The appellant claims that, in this passage, the sentencing judge
is implying that &#147;the appellant&#146;s appearance of relative well-
being at Christmas, 1993 and on the trip to New York in January,
1994 were a deliberate attempt to deceive his wife in order to
facilitate the fatal attack&#148;, a finding that is not supported by
the evidence.
</pre>
    <pre>[105]     I do not agree with the appellant&#146;s interpretation of
the sentencing judge&#146;s reasons. The sentencing judge did not
state that the appellant had deceived his wife and others in
order to facilitate his attack on her. Rather, the sentencing
judge correctly concluded that the appellant&#146;s tendency to mask
his depression, and other problems, allowed the victim to have a
&#147;false&#148; sense of security, which was suddenly and violently
dispelled on the morning she was murdered. In my opinion, there
was sufficient evidence to support his finding, including the
following:
     [1]  (a)  The appellant testified that he saw his psychiatrist,
          Dr. Buie, on December 13 and 21, 1993. By that time, he was
          convinced that he was suffering from ALS, his finances were in
          trouble, and he was unable to keep up with his usual workload.
     (b)  However, according to various friends and family,
          he appeared to be fine at a family Christmas
          gathering, and he and the deceased appeared to
          enjoy a post-Christmas holiday trip to New York.
     (c)  The appellant testified that, by January 4, 1994,
          he was entertaining thoughts of suicide. In fact,
          he began to take steps toward committing suicide.
          On January 3 or 4, 1994, he collected two
          prescriptions for the purpose of a drug overdose.
          On January 8 he obtained more prescription drugs
          and purchased a rope at Canadian Tire.
     (d)  However, other witnesses and evidence indicated
          that, at that time, the appellant appeared to be
          fine. On January 8, 1994, just two days before the
          murder, the deceased sent the following email to
          her secretary, indicating that all was well at
          home:
               After we did the driveway AGAIN last night,
               we had a wonderful homemade stew, thanks to
               the pressure cooker. Bob [the appellant] even
               thought ahead and stopped on his way home to
               pick up some wine, and strawberries for
               dessert.
     (e)  On January 9, 1994, the night before her murder,
          the deceased sent another &#147;happy&#148; email to her
          secretary, saying that she had enjoyed a &#147;great
          day &#150; no shovelling&#148;. The deceased also spoke to
          her sister on the telephone that night, who
          testified that the deceased seemed fine and at
          ease.</pre>
    <pre>[106]     The sentencing judge was also entitled to consider that
the appellant had deceived, or at least withheld information
from, his psychiatrist, Dr. Buie. Dr. Buie testified that he
found that the appellant was not communicative during their
psychotherapy sessions. In addition, the appellant admitted in
his testimony that, during his January 4, 1994 session, he
deliberately misinformed Dr. Buie that he and the deceased had
enjoyed sexual relations during their trip to New York. This led
Dr. Buie to conclude that the anti-depressant medication he had
prescribed for the appellant was working.
[107]     The sentencing judge gave considerable attention to the
evidence of the appellant&#146;s psychiatric condition throughout his
reasons for sentence. In the beginning of his reasons, under the
heading &#147;The Character of the Offender&#148;, the sentencing judge
said:
</pre>
    <pre>     You have a well-documented history of psychiatric
     disorder attributable largely, according to the medical
     opinions tendered in evidence, to hereditary factors.
     Your mother suffered from depression for which she was
     hospitalized and for which she was treated with
     Electroconvulsive therapy. A paternal uncle and aunt
     also suffered from depression. The unanimous opinion of
     the psychiatrists who testified at the behest of both
     the Crown and the defence, was that you were suffering
     a bout of major depression when you killed your wife on
     January 10, 1994.
</pre>
    <pre>     This condition was diagnosed on or about June 15, 1992,
     when you attacked and attempted to kill your wife by
     manual strangulation. You received psychiatric
     attention on June 15, 1992, following which you were
     admitted and treated in a hospital setting for one
     month. You were released from hospital and thereafter
     continued being observed and treated by a private
     psychiatrist until the date of the second attack on
     your wife on January 10, 1994. Indeed, on the very
     morning when the attack occurred, you had failed to
     attend an 8:00 a.m. appointment with your psychiatrist.
</pre>
    <pre>     After your release from hospital in July of 1992, you
     resumed your practice as a physiatrist. While in
     hospital and after your release, you and your wife
     received joint counselling concerning the importance of
     you continuing with your prescribed medication and
     concerning the signs to look for which would indicate
     the onset of any further bout of depression.
</pre>
    <pre>     Following your arrest on January 10, 1994, you were
     twice committed to the Royal Ottawa Hospital for
     psychiatric assessment and treatment. You received
     Electroconvulsive therapy on your second admission,
     which treatments continued until the eve of trial and
     permitted the Royal Ottawa Hospital to certify you to
     be fit to stand trial.
</pre>
    <pre>The appellant does not take issue with any of these findings, as
they accurately reflect the evidence presented at trial.
</pre>
    <pre>[108]     Later in his reasons, under the heading, &#147;The Nature of
the Offence and the Circumstances Surrounding the Commission of
the Offence&#148;, Cavarzan J. stated:
     The defence of not criminally responsible by reason of
     mental disorder was not accepted by the jury. That
     defence rested on the opinion of psychiatrists who
     testified that you suffered major depression with
     psychotic features, the principal psychotic feature
     being delusions which led you to believe at the time
     you killed your wife that the act was not morally
     wrong. That psychiatric opinion advanced the view that
     your act was an extended suicide, and that the killing
     was altruistic and intended to spare the victim the
     pain and humiliation of your impending professional,
     financial and social ruin. In rejecting this defence
     the jury did not accept that the killing was an
     extended suicide. Furthermore, as already noted, the
     jury did not accept that you genuinely attempted to
     commit suicide. A substantial period of time, perhaps
     several hours, elapsed between the time of the killing
     and 12:30 p.m., which was approximately the time when
     the police entered and found you.</pre>
    <pre>[109]     Finally, after imposing the 17-year period of parole
ineligibility, the sentencing judge once again referred to the
appellant's psychiatric history:
     [1]  Because of your psychiatric history, I am recommending that
     appropriate assessment, treatment and counselling be made
     available to you.</pre>
    <pre>[110]     In my opinion, this review of the sentencing judge&#146;s
consideration of the psychiatric evidence discloses no error in
principle. The sentencing judge accurately summarized and
considered the psychiatric evidence which was not in dispute,
including the medical experts' unanimous diagnosis that the
appellant was suffering a bout of major depression at the time of
the killing.
[111]     The sentencing judge does not specifically refer to the
Crown's psychiatric evidence, i.e. the appellant&#146;s major
depression, as a mitigating factor. However, it is implicit in
his reasons that Cavarzan J. gave ample consideration the nature
and impact of the psychiatric evidence in sentencing the
appellant. Cavarzan J. referred to the appellant's &quot;well-
documented history of psychiatric disorder&quot; and that &quot;the
unanimous opinion of the psychiatrists who testified at the
behest of both the Crown and defence was that you [the appellant]
were suffering a bout of major depression when you killed your
wife on January 10, 1994.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[1]  [112]     I therefore see no merit to this ground of appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>(iv) The appropriate range of sentence</pre>
    <pre>[113]     Finally, the appellant submits that the 17-year period
of parole ineligibility imposed by the sentencing judge is unduly
long, and outside the range of sentences that have been imposed
in similar sentences. In support of this argument, counsel for
the appellant referred this court to sentences in a number of
cases involving the second degree murder of a spouse. The period
of parole ineligibility in these cases range from the statutory
minimum, ten years, to 20 years.
[114]     While the 17-year period of parole ineligibility
imposed in this case is at that &#147;high end of the spectrum&#148;, this
alone, however, is not sufficient reason to justify interference
by an appellate court:  see R. v. MacDonnell (1997) 114 C.C.C.
(3d) 436, where Sopinka J., writing for the majority of the
Supreme Court, noted (at 451) &#147;that in both Shropshire and
M.(C.A.), two recent, unanimous decisions, this Court refused on
the basis of deference to reduce sentences that were clearly at
the high end of the spectrum.&#148;
[115]     As the following passage from R. v. M. (C.A.) at p. 375
demonstrates, the threshold at which an appellate court should
intervene is a high one:
     Appellate courts, of course, serve an important
     function in reviewing and minimizing the disparity of
     sentences imposed by sentencing judges for similar
     offenders and similar offences committed throughout
     Canada [cites omitted]. But in exercising this role,
     courts of appeal must still exercise a margin of
     deference before intervening in the specialized
     discretion that Parliament has explicitly vested in
     sentencing judges. It has been repeatedly stressed that
     there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a
     particular crime [cites omitted]. Sentencing is an
     inherently individualized process, and the search for a
     single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and
     a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise
     of academic abstraction. As well, sentences for a
     particular offence should be expected to vary to some
     degree across various communities  and regions in this
     country, as the &#147;just and appropriate&#148; mix of accepted
     sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current
     conditions of and in the particular community where the
     crime occurred. For these reasons, consistent with the
     general standard of review we articulated in
     Shropshire, I believe that a court of appeal should
     only intervene to minimize the disparity of sentences
     where the sentence imposed by the trial judge is in
     substantial and marked departure from the sentences
     customarily imposed for similar offenders committing
     similar crimes.</pre>
    <pre>[116]     I note that there are many distinguishing features
between some of these cases and the present case. In many of
these cases, the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of second
degree murder, and this was no doubt considered a mitigating
factor. In addition, in several cases, there was no jury
recommendation regarding the period of parole ineligibility, or
the jury recommended a period of parole ineligibility that was
lower than the 20 years recommended by the jury in this case.
While the sentencing judge was not bound by the 20-year
recommendation made by the jury, he was bound by ss. 744 and 743
of the Criminal Code to consider this recommendation in
sentencing the appellant.
[117]     In the present case, the trial judge gave very specific
reasons for imposing the period of parole ineligibility that he
did, including the following:
     (a)       there were elements of planning and
               deliberation in the killing;
     (b)  the appellant's breach of trust involved in
          deceiving his wife, family and psychiatrists into
          thinking that all was well within the marriage;
     (c)  the false sense of security that the wife felt,
          due to this deception, which made her particularly
          vulnerable to attack; and
     (d)  the circumstances of the killing, which the
          sentencing judge described in his reasons for
          sentence as  &#147;one of appalling and unspeakable
          cruelty&#148;.

</pre>
    <pre>[118]     The appellant concedes that the fact that his &quot;attack
on his wife was a breach of trust&quot; is properly considered an
aggravating factor. The appellant and his wife had been married
for twenty years, and she was described as the appellant's &quot;only
friend&quot;. The appellant attacked his wife while she was in their
bedroom, having just awakened. He choked her and stabbed her
repeatedly. When she begged him to stop, and asked him why he was
doing this to her, he offered her no explanation.
[119]     I do not find that the period of parole ineligibility
imposed by the sentencing judge was outside the appropriate range
of sentence.
</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[120]     The sentencing judge presided over a 25-day trial,
which involved evidence from 57 witnesses. Like the jury, he
heard live testimony from various expert medical witnesses, and
also heard from the appellant himself. He was therefore in a
better position than this court to appreciate all aspects of this
case. The sentencing judge did not err in his analysis or
application of s. 744 of the Criminal Code. He correctly
identified and considered all of the relevant criteria in
deciding that a sentence of 17 years parole ineligibility was fit
in the circumstances of this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[121]     In conclusion, I would grant leave to appeal the
sentence, but dismiss the appeal.
