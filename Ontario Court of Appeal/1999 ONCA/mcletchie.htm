    <pre>COUNSEL:       Lorne Sabsay, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               F. Richard Connolly, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         August 17, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Newton J. dated July 30,
1998 and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Newton J. dated
August 14, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was found guilty in the Ontario Court of
Justice (Provincial Division) by Newton J. of a number of
offences arising out of an incident involving the complainant.
They consisted of pointing a firearm, assault with a weapon,
threatening death, possession of a restricted and unregistered
weapon, careless storage of a firearm and possession of property
obtained by crime.  He was sentenced to a total of 20 months in
prison.  He appeals conviction and sentence.
[2]  The trial judge gave full reasons for accepting the
testimony of the complainant and rejecting that of the
respondent.  Counsel on appeal takes issue with the following
statement in the trial judge&#146;s reasons respecting the appellant&#146;s
evidence and submits that the transcript does not indicate any
inconsistencies of substance.
          </pre>
    <pre>               However, I did find that there were inconsistencies in his
          evidence, both with respect to the phone and the amount and
          circumstances of his conduct and contact with Ms. Sterling.  In
          the circumstances of this case, these inconsistencies were
          significant, and I reject his evidence.  I neither believe the
          evidence of the accused, nor am I left in a state of reasonable
          doubt by it.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our opinion, the trial judge was justified on this record
in making this observation.  There were inconsistencies in the
appellant&#146;s evidence as to where and under what circumstances he
had been in contact with the complainant.  The issue was central
to his defence that it had been the complainant who was harassing
him by telephone and that he had been at pains to avoid having
anything to do with her.
[4]  There were no further objections to the reasons convicting
the appellant.   Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is
dismissed.
[5]  As to sentence, the appellant is eligible to be released on
September 25, 1999.  He received a sentence of 20 months with
respect to Count 2 &#150; assault with a weapon &#150; and all the other
sentences were concurrent with that sentence.  He served 8 months
of pre-trial custody.  The most aggravating feature of the
assault with a weapon is that it was with a handgun and that the
handgun was loaded.  In addition to that, the appellant was on
probation for having assaulted the same complainant and was under
an order prohibiting him from having any contact with her.
[6]  In the circumstances, we do not feel that the trial judge
made an error in principle in imposing the sentences that she
did.  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the
appeal is dismissed.
