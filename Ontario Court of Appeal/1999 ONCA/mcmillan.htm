    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. CALVIN
               MCMILLAN (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        OSBORNE A.C.J.O., WEILER and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Jeanine E. Le Roy
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Michael Bernstein
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         July 7, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the disposition of Her Honour Judge K. McGowan
dated February 23, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant pled guilty to the offence of choking.  Two
other offences, assault with a weapon and uttering death threats
were withdrawn.  However, the facts pertaining to those offences
and, of course, the offence of choking were read into the record
in support of the appellant&#146;s guilty plea.
[2]  The appellant is the husband of the complainant.  There is
no doubt that the offence to which the appellant pled guilty was
serious, involving as it did an attack by the intoxicated
appellant upon his wife.  At trial, the Crown sought a 6 month
custodial, non-conditional sentence.
[3]  The defence submitted that the sentence to be imposed ought
to be conditional sentence.  The trial judge accepted neither
position.  Instead, she sentenced the appellant to imprisonment
for 18 months plus 2 years probation on terms that we need not
set out.
[4]  In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge referred to
this court&#146;s judgment in R. v. Wismayer.  The trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; but in cases such as this, where the need to denounce the
          offence and to protect society is as great as it is today, in my
          view a conditional sentence should only be granted in the most
          exceptional circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In limiting access to a conditional sentence in cases such
as this to those involving the &#147;most exceptional circumstances&#148;,
we think that the trial judge erred.  In addition, in our view,
the trial judge over-emphasized general deterrence and in doing
so failed to take into appropriate account a number of undisputed
mitigating factors, including:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)  the appellant has no criminal record;
(b)  the appellant immediately accepted full moral responsibility
     for his conduct;
(c)  the appellant, having recognized that his excessive
     consumption of alcohol led to his criminal conduct, stopped
     drinking;
(d)  having ceased to consume alcohol, the appellant joined
     Alcoholics Anonymous;  and
(e)  the appellant pled guilty to the offence of choking at the 
     first opportunity.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In our view, in all of the circumstances of this case, we
think that our intervention is warranted.  We would grant leave,
allow the appeal, and in place of the custodial sentence of 18
months, we would substitute a custodial but conditional sentence
of 12 months on the conditions filed, which include a restriction
on the appellant&#146;s liberty through a form of house arrest.</pre></td>
