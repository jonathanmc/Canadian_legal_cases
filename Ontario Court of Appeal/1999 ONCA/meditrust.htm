    <pre>On appeal from the order made by Madam Justice Molloy dated
October 13, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the October 13, 1998 order of Molloy
J. (the &#147;motions judge&#148;) striking out the appellant&#146;s claim
against certain individual respondents pursuant to motions
brought under Rule 21 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure.
[2]  The appellant carries on business as a mail-order pharmacy
in Canada.  It has commenced an action seeking damages from the
respondents arising from their alleged participation in a
conspiracy to destroy or injure the appellant as a competitor in
the retail pharmacy industry.  The appellant has also alleged
that the respondents have committed numerous other intentional
torts against it, namely unlawful interference with economic
interests and infliction of economic harm, intentional
interference with contractual relations, misleading advertising,
injurious falsehood and intimidation.
[3]  In October 1997, the respondents moved to strike all or part
of the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 25.11 and in the
alternative, sought particulars of the pleading.  In an
endorsement dated February 23, 1998, the motions judge ordered
that certain paragraphs be struck without leave to amend and
further ordered that certain particulars be provided with respect
to other paragraphs.  Given the large number of changes, she
considered that the appropriate disposition was to strike out the
statement of claim in its entirety with leave to deliver a fresh
or amended statement of claim.
[4]  Following the delivery of the amended statement of claim,
numerous respondents again brought motions, seeking the dismissal
of the action pursuant to Rule 21.
[5]  In a second endorsement dated October 13, 1998, the motions
judge ruled that the claims against the individual defendants
Bloom, Konviser, Anderson, Mallon, Fevang and Hirsch (the
&#147;individual respondents&#148;) be struck out without leave to amend.
In reaching her conclusion, the motions judge purported to rely
on the decision of this court in ScotiaMcLeod Inc. v. Peoples
Jewellers Ltd. (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 481.
[6]  The issue with respect to the individual respondents is
whether corporate officers, directors and employees may be held
liable for torts committed by them in the course of their
employment.  A second issue relating only to the respondent
Hirsch will be dealt with separately at the end of these reasons.
[7]  In ScotiaMcLeod, a purchaser of debentures sued a firm of
underwriters and a law firm after the debentures proved to be
worthless.  The defendants brought third-party proceedings
against the company financed by the transaction (Peoples
Jewellers) and two of its senior officers, Gill and Irving
Gerstein.  Nine other members of the company&#146;s board of directors
were also named in the third-party claim.  Specific allegations
of negligent misrepresentation were pleaded against the two
senior officers.  No such allegations were made against the other
directors.  Instead the claim against them was simply for
contribution and indemnity.
[8]  On a motion brought under Rule 21, the third-party claim was
dismissed as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action.  On
appeal, this court upheld the dismissal of the third-party claim
against the nine directors but permitted the claim to proceed
against Gill and Irving Gerstein.  The issue before the court was
clearly stated at p. 490 where Finlayson J.A., for the court,
wrote:
               To my thinking, the appellants' pleadings seek to hold the
          directors vicariously liable for the negligence of the
          corporation, Peoples, on whose board the directors sit.
                    The cause of action pleaded against
          the respondent directors is predicated on
          personal liability arising out of the actions
          of Peoples.</pre>
    <pre>     In the court&#146;s view, the claim could not
succeed against the directors in the absence
of an allegation of negligence against them
for their personal actions, not only actions
of the company for which they were the
directing minds.  Finlayson J. A. also wrote
(at p. 494):
                    As I have set out above, the relief claimed against the
          directors other than Gill and Irving Gerstein is restricted to
          contribution and indemnity.  Such a claim cannot succeed without
          an allegation of negligence.
And at p. 495:
               &#133;[I]t is obvious from the argument of appellants' counsel
          that the claim against the directors other than Gill and Irving
          Gerstein is not based on any personal involvement on the part of
          any of these directors.  No attempt was made to single out their
          activities as individuals.  The claim against them is founded on
          a theory of liability which does not exist in law.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The court, however, allowed the claim to proceed against
Gill and Irving Gerstein on the basis they were identified in the
pleadings as having been personally involved in the alleged
misrepresentations.  Finlayson J.A. further stated (at p. 495):
               Gill and Irving Gerstein are placed in a different position
          by reason of being the two most senior executive officers of
          Peoples.  It is alleged against them that they were directly and
          personally involved in the marketing of the debentures and that
          they were involved in making certain representations personally
          which were relied upon by the appellants.  The appellants have
          also made an allegation of negligent misrepresentation against
          both of them personally.
                    While the authorities make clear
          that officers of corporations who are the
          directing minds of the corporation have the
          same identity of interest as the directors
          and thus the same immunity to suit, I am not
          prepared to dismiss the action against Gill
          and Irving Gerstein at this stage. The
          threshold of sustainability of pleadings is
          very low.  Although I am of the view that the
          appellants are attempting to stretch the
          envelope of available jurisprudence to
          encompass the acts of Gill and Irving
          Gerstein, an action should not be dismissed
          at this stage simply because it is novel in
          law.</pre>
    <pre>[10] In effect, this court in ScotiaMcLeod held that an action in
tort could proceed against the officers, directors and employees
of a corporation provided their personal involvement in the
alleged tort was specifically pleaded.
[11] The issue of the liability of corporate officers, directors
and employees for torts committed by them in the course of their
employment was more recently considered by this court in ADGA
Systems International Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd. et al. (1999), 43 O.R.
(3d) 101, released subsequent to the decision under appeal.
[12] In ADGA, the plaintiff sued the corporate defendant, its
sole director, and two senior employees, claiming that they had
raided the plaintiff&#146;s staff and thereby caused economic damages.
The action was framed in tort (inducing breach of contract,
interfering with economic interests, inducing breaches of
fiduciary duty).  The individual defendants succeeded in having
the action summarily dismissed against them on the basis that
they could not be held liable for actions taken in the best
interests of the corporation.  This court reversed this decision
and allowed the claims against the individual defendants to
proceed.
[13] Carthy J.A., for the court, reviewed the case law from
Canadian and American jurisdictions and stated (at p. 107):
                    The consistent line of authority in Canada holds simply
          that, in all events, officers, directors and employees of
          corporations are responsible for their tortious conduct even
          though that conduct was directed in a bona fide manner to the
          best interests of the company, always subject to the Said v. Butt
          [[1920] 3 K.B. 497] exception. [The Said v. Butt exception does
          not permit a claim for inducement of breach of contract to
          proceed against a corporate officer or employee where a claim for
          breach of contract lies against the corporation.]</pre>
    <pre>[14] Carthy J.A. further stated (at p. 109):
                    These Canadian authorities at the appellate level
          confirm clearly that employees, officers and directors will be
          held personally liable for tortious conduct causing physical
          injury, property damage, or a nuisance even when their actions
          are pursuant to their duties to the corporation.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Finally, Carthy J.A. alluded to the passage in ScotiaMcLeod
which is often quoted as suggesting some limitation on the
liability of directors and officers.  Finlayson J.A. wrote (at p.
491):
               Absent allegations which fit within the categories described
          above [allegations of fraud, deceit, dishonesty or want of
          authority], officers or employees of limited companies are
          protected from personal liability unless it can be shown that
          their actions are themselves tortious or exhibit a separate
          identity or interest from that of the company so as to make the
          act or conduct complained of their own.</pre>
    <pre>     Carthy J.A. commented on this passage as
follows (at p. 112):
                    The operative portion of this paragraph is the final
          sentence which confirms that, where properly pleaded, officers or
          employees can be liable for tortious conduct even when acting in
          the course  of duty.  That this is clearly the intent of what was
          being stated is evidenced by the conclusion that the action
          should proceed against two defendants; against whom negligent
          conduct had been properly pleaded.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In ADGA, Carthy J.A. simply relied upon the principles
previously enunciated by Finlayson J.A. in ScotiaMcLeod.  Both
decisions stand for the proposition that a claim in tort may
proceed against directors, officers and employees of corporations
for acts performed in the course of their duties, provided that
(1) the allegations of their personal tortious conduct are
properly pleaded and (2) the limited exception in Said v. Butt
does not apply.
[17] In her first endorsement dated February 23, 1998, the
motions judge said at p.6 of her reasons:
               This is not a situation in which vague allegations of
          conspiracy have been made without any factual basis whatsoever.
          Rather, there are extensive references in the pleadings to
          specific actions undertaken, including references in some cases
          to the dates and some of the individuals and groups directly
          involved.  There is enough information provided to satisfy me
          that the plaintiff is not asserting a wild hypothesis with no air
          of reality or that this is nothing more than a fishing
          expedition.  The plaintiff has some, but not all, of the
          information it needs to set out all of the elements of the
          conspiracy plea.  In these circumstances, and given the nature of
          the cause of action and the allegations made, I consider it to be
          in the interests of justice to allow the plaintiff to proceed at
          least to the discovery stage.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The amended statement of claim expressly alleges that the
individual respondents carried out and participated in
specifically pleaded tortious acts with the intent necessary for
a court to find personal liability if the allegations are
established at trial.  The constituent elements of the tort of
conspiracy have been properly pleaded and it has also been
alleged with particularity that the individual respondents, in
pursuing the object of destroying the appellant, breached the
Competition Act and committed intentional torts.
[19] On a motion brought pursuant to Rule 21, the court must
accept the facts pleaded as true and the pleadings must be read
generously with reasonable allowance for inadequacies relating to
drafting deficiencies.  See Nash v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d)
1 at 6.
[20] For the above reasons, the claim should be allowed to
proceed against the individual respondents.
[21] There is another issue that must be addressed which relates
only to the respondent Hirsch.  In her first endorsement, the
motions judge struck out, without leave to amend, the paragraphs
in the statement of claim dealing with an issue of bias with
respect to certain discipline proceedings against a Meditrust
pharmacist.  In her second endorsement, the motions judge
concluded that paragraph 112 of the amended statement of claim
was simply a rehashing of the allegations which she had ordered
struck from the previous pleading.
[22] The issue relating to the discipline proceedings was dealt
with by the motions judge in her first endorsement.  No appeal
was taken from that decision.  In paragraph 112 of the amended
statement of claim, the appellant is seeking to re-litigate the
issue.  It is precluded from doing so, and the paragraph was
correctly struck out without leave to amend.
[23] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, subject to the above
exception respecting Hirsch, and the order striking out the
amended statement of claim against the individual respondents is
set aside.  The appellant is entitled to its costs of this
appeal.  Success being divided as between the appellant and the
respondent Hirsch, I would make no order as to costs as between
these two parties.
