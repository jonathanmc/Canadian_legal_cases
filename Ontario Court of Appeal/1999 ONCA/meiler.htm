    <pre>On appeal from conviction and sentence by Sills J. with a jury
dated March 18, 1997 and April 25, 1997 respectively.</pre>
    <pre>
O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals against his conviction by Sills J.
with a jury for second degree murder and against the order that
he be ineligible for parole for a period of 12 years. The
appellant also appeals against the sentence of 10 years
concurrent imposed for a conviction for attempted murder.
[2]  The main grounds of appeal against the conviction relate to
the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury on the applicability of two
sections of the Criminal Code: s. 222(5), which sets out the
circumstances in which homicide is culpable, and s. 229(c), the
unlawful object murder section, both in the context of a theory
of liability in which the shot that killed the deceased was
unintentionally discharged.
[3]  For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the appeal
against conviction and both of the appeals against sentence.</pre>
    <pre>     FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On April 21, 1996, the appellant shot and killed Nick Biuk.
The events leading up to the fatal shooting resulted from
matrimonial problems between the appellant and his wife Dianne
Meiler.
[5]  The couple had lived together since 1988, had two children
and were married in 1994. Shortly afterwards, the marriage soured
and in February 1996, the appellant moved out of the family home.
After the separation the appellant suspected that his wife had
been dating Biuk, whom the appellant had known as a casual friend
for three years. The appellant was bothered by the prospect of
his wife seeing another man. However, after making inquiries of
his wife and his brother-in-law, he became satisfied that his
wife was not involved with Biuk.
[6]  Four days before the shooting, the appellant&#146;s wife told him
that she was seeing a man named Dan on what she described as a
casual basis. The appellant believed the relationship was more
serious than his wife was indicating.
[7]  This view was confirmed, in the appellant&#146;s mind, later on
the same day when one of his daughters told him that Dan had
stayed over at his wife&#146;s house and that the two children really
liked Dan. The appellant believed the person referred to by his
wife and daughter was Dan Roach, whom she had known as a friend
many years before but who only recently had re-entered her life.
[8]  At this point the appellant became convinced that his wife
had been continually lying to him about her relationship with
Roach and he began thinking about killing Roach and committing
suicide. Two days later, on April 19, he told a friend that he
felt like getting his gun and doing something to Roach and then
taking his own life.
[9]  On April 21, the day of the shooting, the appellant, who had
weekend custody of his two children, had arranged to drop the
children off at the home of his wife&#146;s sister, Patti Skrinjaric,
and her husband Vlad Skrinjaric. From there it was planned that
Ms. Meiler and the Skrinjarics were to take the two children to
the circus.
[10] When dropping the children off at the Skrinjaric home, the
appellant spoke to his wife and asked her to return to him and to
stop seeing Roach. She said she could not do that. Vlad
Skrinjaric testified that before the appellant left he said, &#147;I
guess I know what I am going to do. I am going to kill Dan
[Roach] and Dianne [his wife].&#148;  As he was leaving the Skrinjaric
home, the appellant saw Roach and Biuk arrive in Biuk&#146;s truck. In
his evidence, the appellant said that on seeing the two men going
to the Skrinjaric house he became devastated, shocked and angry.
[11] The appellant then drove to his former residence, got his
late father&#146;s shotgun from his workshop and cut it down in size.
Shortly afterwards, he took the gun and drove back to the
Skrinjaric house. No one appeared to be home so he drove around
the neighbourhood several times, each time returning to see
whether the Skrinjarics and his children had returned.
[12] Eventually he saw that the Skrinjarics&#146; van was back in the
driveway and then saw Roach driving his wife&#146;s car. He followed
the car and saw it go to the Skrinjaric driveway. He saw his wife
and Roach get out of the car and walk towards the backyard
through a gate at the side of the house. The Skrinjarics, along
with Biuk, Roach and Ms. Meiler, were preparing for a barbecue in
the backyard.
[13] The appellant drove his truck into the driveway and
accidentally crashed into the back of his wife&#146;s car. He got out
of his truck carrying the shotgun, which was loaded. As he headed
towards the gate that led to the backyard, he cocked the gun and
put his finger on the trigger. The appellant&#146;s evidence was that
he intended to kill Roach and then to kill himself.
[14] There is a dispute in the evidence about what happened next.
What is not in dispute is that very shortly after the appellant
left his truck, the gun that he was carrying was discharged and
Biuk who by then was standing byhe gate leading from the backyard
was fatally shot.
[15] Patti Skrinjaric testified that she was in the backyard when
she heard a crash. She ran down the side of the house towards the
roadway. The appellant was charging towards her with something in
his hand and knocked her into the hedge. She looked towards the
gate and saw the appellant in one motion raise his arm and a gun
shot went off. Immediately after, she saw her husband on the
ground wrestling with the appellant.
[16] Vlad Skrinjaric testified that he was also in the backyard
when he heard a loud bang coming from the direction of the front
of the house. He followed his wife who ran down the side of the
house towards the road and on reaching the driveway he saw the
appellant heading towards her. The appellant ran by Patti
Skrinjaric and shoved her into the hedge. As Vlad Skrinjaric ran
towards the appellant, he saw a blue flame by the appellant&#146;s
side. He then jumped on the appellant, wrestled him to the ground
and in the ensuing struggle took the gun away from him. The
appellant got up and ran away.
[17] The appellant testified that as he approached the gate he
elbowed Patti Skrinjaric into the hedge and that he then walked
past Vlad Skrinjaric. Biuk came through the gate from the
backyard and walked towards him. As this was occurring, Vlad
Skrinjaric jumped on the appellant from behind, sending him
flying into Biuk between the fence and the garage wall. A
struggle followed for two to three seconds; the appellant was
whipped backwards. Biuk was bent over, pushed up against the
wall, and the gun went off.  The apellant said he was afraid and
ran away.
[18] The appellant testified that his intention was to get behind
the gate to get to Roach. He said he did not anticipate or think
about meeting any resistance by anyone. In describing the
discharge of the gun, the appellant did not use the words
unintentional or accidental. However, the import of his evidence
is clearly that he did not intend to shoot Biuk and that the gun
was discharged accidentally in the course of the struggle that
resulted when Vlad Skrinjaric jumped him from behind.
[19] Biuk died from a single gunshot wound to the abdomen.
[20] The appellant was charged with attempting to murder both his
wife and Roach and the second degree murder of Biuk. At the start
of the trial the appellant pled guilty to the charge of
attempting to murder Roach and not guilty to the charge in
respect of his wife. He attempted to plead guilty to manslaughter
for Biuk&#146;s death but the Crown would not accept that plea.
[21] The jury found the appellant guilty of second degree murder
and not guilty of the attempted murder of his wife.</pre>
    <pre>     ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[22] I will deal with the grounds of appeal in four sections:
          1.        The application of s. 222(5);
2.        The application of s. 229(c);
3.        The mens rea for s. 229(a)(i) and (ii); and
4.        The audibility of the charge.</pre>
    <pre>     1. The application of s. 222(5)
</pre>
    <pre>[23] Culpable homicide is defined in s. 222(5) which provides in
part as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               222. (5) A person commits culpable homicide when he causes
          the death of a human being,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  by means of an unlawful act &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
Section 222(4) provides that culpable homicide is murder or
manslaughter or infanticide.
</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge instructed the jury that the act of the
appellant in shooting Biuk constituted an unlawful act within the
meaning of the section. He then instructed that the killing of
Biuk was culpable homicide. Although the trial judge did not
specifically deal with the issue of causation, it is implicit in
this instruction that he was directing the jury that the
appellant&#146;s unlawful act &#147;caused&#148; the death of Biuk within the
meaning of s. 222(5)(a). The trial judge therefore left the jury
with the alternatives of finding the appellant guilty of either
murder or manslaughter but not with the option of finding the
appellant not guilty of any offence.
[25] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing
to instruct the jury that if they found or had a reasonable doubt
that the gun was unintentionally discharged, it was open to them
to find that the appellant had not committed culpable homicide
and that the proper verdict in the circumstances was a complete
acquittal.
[26] This argument was not advanced at trial. To the contrary,
the appellant, who was represented by competent counsel, accepted
that his actions, viewed in their most favourable light,
constituted the offence of manslaughter.
[27] Even if the jury found or had a reasonable doubt that the
gun was unintentionally discharged, it is beyond dispute that the
appellant&#146;s acts leading up to death of Buik were unlawful acts
within the meaning of this section. He was carrying a loaded,
cocked gun with his finger on the trigger for the purpose of
killing Roach. He pled guilty to attempted murder. The fact that
the gun may have been unintentionally discharged does not render
lawful what was otherwise an unlawful course of conduct.
[28] However, the appellant argues that it was open to the jury
to find that his acts did not cause Biuk&#146;s death within the
meaning of s. 222(5); rather he argues that the intervening act,
Vlad Skrinjaric jumping on his back and causing the gun to
discharge the fatal shot, was the cause of the death. The
appellant now submits that the failure to leave this issue of
causation with the jury constitutes a reversible error
necessitating a new trial.
[29] I disagree. In R. v. Smithers, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, the
Supreme Court of Canada set out the test for causation for
culpable homicide under s. 205(5) [now s. 222(5) of the Criminal
Code]. Writing for the court, Dickson J. said the following at p.
519:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The second sub-question raised is whether there was evidence
          on the basis of which the jury was entitled to find that it had
          been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused
          the death. In answer to this question it may shortly be said that
          there was a very substantial body of evidence, both expert and
          lay, before the jury indicating that the kick was at least a
          contributing cause of death, outside the de minimis range, and
          that is all that the Crown was required to establish. It is
          immaterial that the death was in part caused by a malfunctioning
          epiglottis to which malfunction the appellant may, or may not,
          have contributed. No question of remoteness or of incorrect
          treatment arises in this case. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[30] Clearly there can be more than one cause of a death. The
test in Smithers does not restrict the test for causation to the
most proximate, the primary or the only cause of death. It simply
requires that the act in issue be at least a contributing cause.
[31] I am satisfied that those acts of the appellant that were
not in dispute went well beyond the contributing cause
requirement set out in Smithers. The appellant was physically
linked to the discharge of the gun. He brought it to the scene,
loaded it, cocked it, put his finger on the trigger and was
holding it at the time it was discharged. There can be no doubt
that but for the appellant&#146;s acts Biuk would not have been
fatally shot. His acts were a contributing cause of the death.
[32] In my view, the trial judge was correct in instructing the
jury that the appellant committed culpable homicide and that the
only possible verdicts were second degree murder and
manslaughter. I see no merit in this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     2. The application of s. 229(c)</pre>
    <pre>          The charge and recharge
</pre>
    <pre>[33] Section 229(c) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               229. Culpable homicide is murder
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  where a person, for an unlawful
          object, does anything that he knows or ought
          to know is likely to cause death, and thereby
          causes death to a human being notwithstanding
          that he desires to effect this object without
          causing death or bodily harm to any human
          being.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[34] I will set out an overview of those parts of the trial
judge&#146;s charge and recharge that relate to s. 229(c). In doing
so, I am drawing together a number of separate instructions and,
for ease of analysis, I am setting them out in abbreviated, and
in some instances, point form.
[35] In the main charge the trial judge instructed the jury that,
depending on the factual determinations made by them, there were
three possible bases upon which the culpable homicide would
constitute murder:
     (a)       Section 229(a)(i) &#150; if the jury found that the
          appellant meant to kill Biuk;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)       Section 229(a)(ii) &#150; if the jury found that the
          appellant meant to cause Biuk bodily harm knowing that it was
          likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)       Section 229(c) &#150; if the jury found that the appellant:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (i)  for an unlawful object (killing Roach);
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii) did anything (pointing and shooting the gun at
               Biuk);
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     knowing that it was likely to cause the death of
               someone notwithstanding he did not desire to cause death or
               bodily harm; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iv) thereby caused the death of Biuk.
</pre>
    <pre>[36] The trial judge instructed the jury that if they were not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did point
and shoot the gun at Biuk they should find the appellant not
guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Further on in the
charge, the trial judge in effect repeated this instruction when
he told the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt that the
death of Biuk occurred accidentally or unintentionally, then the
appellant should be found not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. Thus, it was clear that the trial judge was
instructing that s. 229(c) only applied to an intentional
shooting.
[37] I question whether this instruction was necessary. If the
jury found that the appellant intentionally pointed and shot the
gun at Biuk, in this case at virtually point blank range, it
seems inevitable that they would have found the appellant guilty
of murder under either s. 229(a)(i) or (ii). The additional
instruction under s. 229(c) added nothing and simply required the
jury to consider a further, albeit unnecessary, theory of
liability for murder. Having said that,  however, I see no
prejudice to the appellant as a result of this instruction.
[38] The Crown objected to the limited scope of the charge on s.
229(c), arguing that the instruction should have included a
theory of liability based upon a finding by the jury that the
shot that killed Biuk was unintentionally discharged. The defence
did not object. The trial judge then recharged the jury on s.
229(c) on the following basis:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant would be guilty of murder under s. 229(c) if
          the jury found that the appellant:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  for an unlawful object (killing
               Roach or his wife1);
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  did anything (carrying a loaded,
               cocked gun with his finger on the
               trigger);
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  that he knew was likely to cause
               the death of a human being;2
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  caused the death of Biuk,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (e) whether or not the gun was
               accidentally discharged.
</pre>
    <pre>[39] It will be seen that the significant difference in the
recharge is that the acts of the appellant that form the basis
for the offence under s. 229(c) do not include &#147;pointing and
shooting the gun at Biuk,&#148; but rather are limited to &#147;carrying a
loaded, cocked gun with his finger on the trigger.&#148;  In addition,
the recharge specifically included the clarifying comment
&#147;whether or not the gun was accidentally discharged.&#148;
[40] By way of introduction to the analysis that follows, I point
out that the cases make it clear that s. 229(c) may apply to
circumstances in which there has been an unintentional killing:
R. v. Tennant and Nacarrato (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 687 (C.A.); and
R. v. Vasil, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 469. A subjective intent to kill or
even harm the deceased is not a required element under s. 229(c).</pre>
    <pre>          Section 229(c) &#150; the actus reus
</pre>
    <pre>[41] The first requirement for the offence of murder under s.
229(c) is that there be a homicide that is culpable pursuant to
s. 222(5). For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the
homicide in this case was culpable. Turning then to s. 229(c),
the actus reus requirement is that the offender &#147;does anything &#133;
and thereby causes the death of a human being.&#148;  The language of
the section does not require that the act of the offender be
itself unlawful although because it causes death it will almost
inevitably be a dangerous act and will usually be unlawful. See
Vasil, supra, at p. 482.
[42] Section 229(c) requires that the act or acts of the offender
&#147;causes death to a human being.&#148;  In my view, the test for
causation created by this language is the same as the test in s.
222(5), which I discussed above. I say this for two reasons.
First, the language used to describe the requirement in the two
sections is virtually identical. In s. 222(5) the phrase used is
&#147;causes the death of a human being.&#148;  The difference between the
two is that s. 229(c) does not have the word &#147;the&#148; before the
word &#147;death&#148; and it uses the preposition &#147;of&#148; rather than &#147;to.&#148;
I can see no possible significance to these differences and, in
my view, the rule of statutory interpretation that says that the
same words should be interpreted as having the same meaning is
applicable. See R. Sullivan, ed., Driedger on the Construction of
Statutes, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at p. 163.
[43] Further, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Harbottle [1993] 3 S.C.R. 306 lends considerable support to
this conclusion. In Harbottle, the court was dealing with the
issue of causation in the context of s. 214(5) of the Criminal
Code [now s. 231(5)], one of the subsections providing the
circumstances in which murder is first degree murder. The
relevant part of the section reads as follows: &#147;murder is first
degree murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by
that person while committing or attempting to commit &#133;(a list of
enumerated offences).&#148;  The Crown argued that the phrase &#147;when
the death is caused by that person&#148; had the same meaning as the
words &#147;causes the death of a human being&#148; found in what is now s.
222(5). Cory J., writing for the court, disagreed and held that
there should be a more restrictive test of substantial cause
under s. 214(5). His reasoning is set out at p. 323:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    At the outset, it is important to remember that when s.
          214(5) comes into play it is in essence a sentencing provision&#133;.
          An accused found guilty of second degree murder will receive a
          mandatory life sentence. What the jury must then determine is
          whether such aggravating circumstances exist that they justify
          ineligibility for parole for a quarter of a century. It is at
          this point that the requirement of causation set out in s. 214(5)
          comes into play. The gravity of the crime and the severity of the
          sentence both indicate that a substantial and high degree of
          blameworthiness above and beyond that of murder, must be
          established in order to convict an accused of first degree
          murder. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Accordingly, I suggest a
          restrictive test of substantial cause should
          be applied under s. 214(5). That test will
          take into account the consequences of a
          conviction, the present wording of the
          section, its history and its aim to protect
          society from the most heinous murderers.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
And further, at p. 324, he referred with apparent approval to the
test in Smithers, supra, as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Under s. 214(5), the actions of the accused
          must form an essential, substantial and
          integral part of the killing of a victim.
          Obviously, this requirement is much higher
          than that described in Smithers v. The Queen
          [citation omitted], which dealt with the
          offence of manslaughter. There it was held at
          p. 519 that sufficient causation existed
          where the actions of the accused were &#147;a
          contributing cause of death, outside the de
          minimis range&#148;. That case demonstrates the
          distinctions in the degree of causation
          required for the different homicide offences.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[44] Although Harbottle does not specifically say that the
causation test for murder under s. 229 is the same as that set
out in Smithers, the reasoning in Harbottle leads towards that
conclusion. The court held that the more restrictive test of
substantial cause reflects a higher degree of blameworthiness for
first degree murder than for murder, thereby implying that there
is a less restrictive causation test for murder that is not first
degree. Further, the court made the obvious point that the
substantial cause test is higher than the contributing cause test
in Smithers. There is no authority that holds that there is an
intermediate causation test for s. 229 lying somewhere between
substantial cause and contributing cause. Indeed, the prospect of
formulating and articulating a third test would involve drawing
some rather fine and probably artificial distinctions.
[45] For these reasons, I am of the view that the causation test
laid down in Smithers is the proper test under s. 229 and in
particular under s. 229(c). As I said above, I am satisfied that
the acts of the appellant, even accepting an unintentional
discharge of the gun, go well beyond meeting that requirement.
[46] In the recharge, the trial judge described the causation
requirement under s. 229(c) in the words of the section. He did
not elaborate. There was no objection. This was an appropriate
instruction because the only possible conclusion was that the
undisputed acts of the appellant caused the death of Biuk within
the meaning of s. 229(c).</pre>
    <pre>          Section 229(c) &#150; the mens rea
</pre>
    <pre>[47] The remaining issues regarding the application of s. 229(c)
concern the mental elements required for &#147;unlawful object
murder.&#148;  There are two.
[48] First, the acts of the offender that caused the death must
have been done for the purpose of an &#147;unlawful object.&#148;  It is
well established that s. 229(c) contemplates some act or conduct
by the offender done to bring about some further unlawful object
other than the injury that he causes the death. Put another way,
the unlawful object must be a different object than the assault
upon the deceased that gives rise to the charge under s. 229(c):
Tennant and Naccarato, supra; Vasil, supra.
[49] Further, the unlawful object must be an object of conduct
that, if prosecuted fully, would amount to a serious crime, that
is an indictable offence requiring mens rea: Vasil, supra, at p.
490.
[50] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in leaving
s. 229(c) with the jury because the evidence disclosed only a
single unlawful act or a series of unlawful acts with but one
general unlawful object, to kill Dan Roach. The appellant submits
that there was no evidence of a further unlawful object and for
that reason the section did not apply to the facts of this case.
[51] This submission is premised on a flawed understanding of the
section. Section 229(c) does not require two unlawful objects. In
particular, it does not require an intent or object to assault or
kill the deceased. Indeed, as I point out above, if such an
object or purpose is present, the case will almost invariably
come within either s. 229(a)(i) or (ii) and it would be
unnecessary to consider s. 229(c) as a basis for liability.
Section 229(c) applies notwithstanding that the offender may not
wish to cause injury or death to any one. The requirement of a
further or other unlawful object does not mean that the offender
must have more than one object; it simply requires that there be
an unlawful object other than the assault on the deceased for
which object the offender did the act or acts that caused the
death.
[52] The trial judge instructed the jury that the appellant&#146;s
intent to kill Roach was an unlawful object; about that there can
be no dispute. The trial judge further instructed that it was a
requirement of the section that the jury be satisfied that the
appellant&#146;s acts of carrying a loaded, cocked gun with his finger
on the trigger must have been done for the purpose of that
unlawful object. It was clear from this instruction that in order
for the jury to convict they must have found that the acts of the
appellant were done for the unlawful object, killing Roach, and
that this was a different object than causing harm or death to
Biuk. In my view, this was a proper instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[53] The second mens rea requirement in s. 229(c) is that the
offender knows that the act or acts that are done for the purpose
of the unlawful object are likely to cause death, notwithstanding
he desires to effect his object without causing death or bodily
harm to any human being.3  This creates a requirement for the
subjective foresight of death by the offender.4
[54] The question is whether, in the context of an unintentional
death, the subjective foresight element of s. 229(c) requires an
offender to not only foresee that death is likely to result from
the acts that were done for the unlawful object but also to
foresee other circumstances or events that result in the death
occurring.
</pre>
    <pre>[55] In his recharge, the trial judge instructed the jury as
follows:
               I am going to instruct you that you must be satisfied beyond
          a reasonable doubt that Mr. Meiler&#146;s conduct, that is the
          unlawful act, carrying a loaded gun, cocked with his finger on
          the trigger, that Mr. Meiler&#146;s conduct in that regard was such
          that he actually knew in all the circumstances that he was likely
          to cause death and does cause death and whether or not the gun
          was accidentally discharged in those circumstances is guilty of
          murder. [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[56] The effect of this instruction is that the requirement for
the appellant&#146;s subjective foresight was limited to a finding by
the jury that he knew that his acts of carrying a loaded, cocked
gun with his finger on the trigger were likely to cause death.
Under this instruction it was not necessary that the jury find
that the appellant had foreseen any additional events or
circumstances that contributed to causing the death.
[57] The question then becomes whether the trial judge erred in
failing to instruct the jury that in order to convict under s.
229(c) it was also necessary to find that the appellant also had
the foresight that someone would attempt to intervene, and in the
ensuing struggle, the gun would be discharged, killing someone
other than Roach.</pre>
    <pre>[58] In my view, s. 229(c) does not require that an offender
foresee the precise situation or all of the events that result in
the death. It is sufficient if the offender has the subjective
foresight that the acts done for the unlawful object are likely
to cause death and those acts are sufficiently linked to the
death to have caused the death within the meaning of the section.
The ordinary meaning of the section requires nothing more. For
ease of reference I will set out s. 229(c) again:
          </pre>
    <pre>               229. Culpable homicide is murder
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  where a person, for an unlawful
          object, does anything that he knows or ought
          to know is likely to cause death, and thereby
          causes death to a human being notwithstanding
          that he desires to effect this object without
          causing death or bodily harm to any human
          being.
</pre>
    <pre>[59] The requirement in s. 229(c) that the offender &#147;knows [his
conduct] is likely to cause death&#148; relates back to the &#147;does
anything&#148; element of the section, which in turn is modified by
two additional requirements: &#147;the anything&#148; must be done for an
unlawful object and it must cause death. To interpret the section
to require an offender to foresee more than &#147;the anything&#148; that
meets these two requirements would read into the section a
meaning that goes beyond its clear wording.
[60] In Martineau, supra, Lamer C.J. discussed the rationale
underlying the principle that subjective foresight of death is
required before a person is labelled and punished as a murderer.
At p. 646, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The essential role of requiring subjective foresight of
          death in the context of murder is to maintain a proportionality
          between the stigma and punishment attached to a murder conviction
          and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          That special mental element gives rise to the
          moral blameworthiness that justifies the
          stigma and punishment attaching to a murder
          conviction.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[61] The moral blameworthiness of an offender who does certain
acts for an unlawful object knowing that those acts are likely to
cause death to someone other than the subject of the unlawful
object is no less serious because the offender does not foresee
the very situation or the precise circumstances that ultimately
lead to that death. It seems to me that the moral blameworthiness
at which s. 229(c) is directed results from the decision of an
offender to pursue the unlawful object notwithstanding he knows
that his acts in doing so will likely cause a death and those
same acts do in fact cause a death. An interpretation requiring
subjective foresight of the precise manner in which the death is
caused would, in my view, unduly restrict the application of the
section.
[62] This reasoning is consistent with the decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Hughes, [1942] S.C.R. 517 at p.
522, where the court considered a predecessor to s. 229(c). Sir
Lyman P. Duff, C.J., speaking for the court, said:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In his judgment, delivered on behalf of the majority of
          the Court, in Graves v. The King [(1913), 9 D.L.R. 589 at p. 597,
          21 Can. C.C. 44 at p. 55, 47 S.C.R. 568 at p. 583], Anglin J. (as
          he then was) says:-- &#147;For the purposes of this appeal I assume
          that under this provision it was not necessary, in order to bring
          the charge of culpable homicide within it, that the jury should
          have found that the acts of the defendants were such as they knew
          or should have known were likely to cause the very acts to be
          done or the precise situation to arise which in fact resulted in
          the homicide, or to cause the death of the person who was killed,
          but that it would suffice if the jury had found that the accused
          did an act which they knew or should have known would be likely
          to induce the doing of anything or to bring about any situation
          likely to cause the death of some person &#150; the person killed or
          any other person.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    I think this passage ought to be
          accepted as stating the law as it is, not
          merely as it is assumed to be.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[63] Therefore,  I am satisfied that it was not necessary for the
trial judge to instruct the jury that in order to convict under
s. 229(c) they must find that the appellant foresaw anything in
addition to the fact that in carrying the loaded gun, cocked with
his finger on the trigger, he was likely to cause the death of
some  person &#150; the person killed or any other person.
[64] For all of the above reasons, I see no error in the trial
judge&#146;s charge on the application of s. 229(c).</pre>
    <pre>     3.  Mens Rea &#150; s. 229(a)(i) and (ii)
</pre>
    <pre>[65] The appellant raises a number of arguments about the manner
in which the trial judge explained the requirements for mens rea
under ss. 229(a)(i) and (ii). I am satisfied that a fair reading
of the charge, the recharge and the answers to the questions from
the jury, taken together, disclose no error.
[66] I will specifically address only one of the arguments raised
by the appellant in connection with the charge on s. 229(a)(i).
The jury&#146;s last question to the trial judge asked for help with
the distinction between murder and manslaughter and with the
&#147;question of accident as it related to your definition of &#133;
second degree murder.&#148;  The trial judge began his answer by
reading again s. 229(a)(i) and (ii) and said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          accused intentionally shot Nick Biuk, he is guilty of murder. If
          you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
          intentionally shot Nick Biuk, you should then consider whether
          the unintended discharge of the firearm is murder or
          manslaughter. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[67] The reference to &#147;intentionally shot,&#148; rather than to &#147;meant
to cause death&#148; under s. 229(a)(i) or &#147;meant to cause bodily harm
knowing it was likely to cause death&#148; under s. 229(a)(ii) is,
technically,  not correct. However, in the circumstances of this
charge, I see no possibility that the jury would have been misled
about the mens rea requirement under either s. 229(a)(i) or (ii).
On at least four occasions in the charge and recharge and in
answer to a specific question about the required intent for each
of these sections, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury
on the required mental elements. Moreover, the discharge of the
gun by the appellant at the deceased was at close range. There
can be no doubt that if the jury found as a fact that the
appellant intentionally shot the deceased, they would inevitably
conclude that he had the required state of mind under either
s. 229(a)(i) or (ii).
[68] The appellant makes two further arguments about the charge
on s. 229(a)(ii). First, he argues that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the mens rea requirement of s.
229(a)(ii) was met &#147;if bodily harm was the natural consequence of
Michael Meiler&#146;s conduct.&#148;  The appellant takes the quoted
passage out of context. The trial judge&#146;s full statement was, &#147;if
bodily harm was a natural consequence of Michael Meiler&#146;s
conduct, you are entitled to find bodily harm was intended.&#148;  The
charge made it clear that this inference was open but not
required and that in order to convict under s. 229(a)(ii) it was
essential that the jury be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the appellant meant to cause bodily harm together with the
other elements set out in the section. I see no merit in this
submission.
[69] Second, the appellant argues that on two occasions when the
trial judge was referring to s. 229(a)(ii) he failed to mention
the requirement &#147;that he knew was likely to cause death.&#148;  On
four other occasions, including in answer to a question from the
jury seeking assistance on the intent requirement, the trial
judge specifically referred to this requirement. Moreover, the
trial judge read s. 229(a)(ii) to the jury on three separate
occasions and on the jury&#146;s request provided them with a copy of
the section. There is no possibility that the jury was not fully
aware of this requirement in s. 229(a)(ii).
[70] Taken as a whole, I am satisfied that the charge fully and
fairly set out the mens rea requirements for both ss. 229(a)(i)
and (ii). I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     4.  Audibility of the Charge
</pre>
    <pre>[71] At the outset of the appeal the appellant sought leave to
introduce fresh evidence to show that the jury may not have heard
the entire charge because of faulty acoustics in the courtroom
and because the judge was not wearing a lapel microphone.
[72] With the agreement of both counsel, the court admitted the
fresh evidence together with responding material filed by the
Crown.
[73] After reviewing all of the fresh evidence, I am not
persuaded that the jury had any difficulty in hearing the trial
judge&#146;s charge. Experienced defence counsel who did not hesitate
to object to portions of the charge did not suggest that he, the
appellant or the jury were having any difficulty hearing what the
trial judge was saying.
[74] Moreover, the jury, who asked a number of questions of the
trial judge seeking clarification of certain parts of the charge,
did not raise any concerns that they were having difficulty in
this regard.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE
</pre>
    <pre>[75] The trial judge imposed a 12-year period of parole
ineligibility on the conviction for second degree and sentenced
the appellant to a term of 10 years concurrent on the attempted
murder of Dan Roach. In my view, both sentences are fit and
reflect no error in principle. The trial judge properly
considered that elements of planning and deliberation were
present and that the offences occurred in the context of a
domestic dispute. The appellant served one year of pre-trial
custody which, pursuant to s. 746(a) of the Criminal Code, will
be taken into account in calculating the period of parole
ineligibility.
[76] I would therefore dismiss the appeal against conviction. I
would grant leave to appeal for the appeals against sentence but
dismiss each of those appeals.




Released: May 6, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>_______________________________
1  The trial judge added the killing of the appellant&#146;s wife as a
possible additional unlawful object in the recharge.  Because  it
is accepted that the appellant&#146;s purpose of killing Dan Roach was
an  unlawful  object  nothing  turns  on  the  inclusion  of  the
appellant&#146;s wife in the recharge.
2  The trial judge did not include in his recharge the qualifying
phrase  &#147;notwithstanding that he desires  to  effect  his  object
without  causing death or bodily harm to any human being.&#148;   This
omission  could have only accrued to the benefit of the appellant
and  no issue was raised with respect to this in the argument  in
this appeal.
3  It  is  settled  that  the  human being  referred  to  in  the
concluding &#147;notwithstanding&#148; clause in s. 229(c) does not include
any  person  who  may  be  the subject of the  intended  unlawful
object.  See Tennant and Naccarato, supra, at p. 701.
4  In  R.  v.  Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633 at pp. 648-49,  the
Supreme  Court  held  that  the  objective  foresight  basis  for
liability  set out in s. 229(c) violated ss. 7 and 11(d)  of  the
Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms and should therefore  be
read  out  of the section.   As a result, the objective foresight
basis  for liability was quite properly not left to the  jury  in
this case.</pre></td>
