    <pre>[1]  This is an application for bail pending appeal from
conviction.  The convictions result from two trials.  The first
conviction was entered by Roberts J. for aggravated assault on
April 1, 1998.  The applicant has not yet been sentenced for that
offence.  The second conviction was entered by McLean J. for
attempted murder on June 22, 1998.  In January 1999, the Attorney
General consented to the bringing of a dangerous offender
application in relation to the attempted murder conviction.  That
application is to be heard on September 21, 1999.
[2]  The circumstances of the two convictions are unusual.  Both
convictions relate to the same act, striking the complainant on
the head with a piece of concrete on March 7, 1997.  The
applicant has been in custody since that date.  He has never
sought a review of the detention order nor asked either trial
judge to exercise his jurisdiction under s. 523(2) of the
Criminal Code.
[3]  The principal ground of appeal from the conviction before
McLean J. concerns the dismissal of the special plea of autrefois
convict.  Mr. Kelly properly concedes that this represents a
highly arguable ground of appeal.
[4]  I am also satisfied that the applicant will surrender into
custody prior to the sentencing proceedings in accordance with
any order I might make.
[5]  I have, however, not been persuaded that this is a proper
case for release on bail pending appeal at this time.  As stated
in Re Morris and the Queen (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 242 (Ont.
C.A.), while I have jurisdiction to make such an order, the
circumstances in which that jurisdiction will be exercised are
rare.  In the course of the oral submissions, I expressed my
concern about the delay in proceeding to sentence before Roberts
J. and in bringing the dangerous offender application before
McLean J.  That delay in the circumstances of this case is not,
however, sufficient to justify release at this point by a judge
of the Court of Appeal given the features of this case that I
will detail below.  In addition, as I understand counsel's
submissions, the delay in sentencing before Roberts J. has been
at the request of both Crown and defence and that much of the
delay before McLean J. arises from adjournments sought by both
parties, the fact that the trial judge is from out of town and,
perhaps, due to the complexity of the proceedings.
[6]  The reasons that cause me to find that this is not a proper
case for release pending appeal prior to sentencing and that
release is contrary to the public interest are the following.
[7]  I have been presented with conflicting expert reports as to
the applicant&#146;s dangerousness and the likelihood of re-offending.
Drs. Bloom and McDonald opine that the applicant represents a
significant risk to the community and have diagnosed him as
suffering from a serious sexual deviance&#151;paraphilia-sexual
sadism.  They were pessimistic about the applicant&#146;s amenability
to treatment.  Counsel for the applicant has pointed out some of
the weaknesses in the strength of that opinion, most importantly
that this 49-year-old man has no prior criminal record.
[8]  The applicant relies upon the opinion of Dr. Federoff.  It
would appear that Dr. Federoff has established a better rapport
with the applicant and he is prepared to offer him treatment in
the community.  It is his opinion that with proper reporting
conditions and monitoring by him, the applicant does not
represent a danger to the public.  Unfortunately, I have only a
very brief affidavit from Dr. Federoff and one page of a multi-
page draft preliminary report.  He does not indicate what that
monitoring or treatment would be.
[9]  On this record, I am unable to determine that the applicant
does not represent a danger to the public or that he will not re-
offend.  It seems to me that the opinions of all three experts
need to be tested by cross-examination.  Since the applicant has
not pursued his bail remedies in the trial court and since no
sentencing proceedings have occurred, that full exploration of
the opinions has not occurred.  The applicant bears the burden of
establishing his entitlement to release and therefore I must find
against him on this aspect of the public interest ground.
[10] I also must take into account the nature of the offence.
The applicant and the Crown take very different views of the
seriousness of the offence.  There is no dispute that,
fortunately, the physical injuries to the victim were not
permanent.  However, the parties differ as to whether the
applicant released the victim or she was able to free herself.
This is an important fact and without the opinion of either trial
judge it is a matter I am unable to resolve on this record.  The
same must be said of the applicant&#146;s writings.  The applicant
says they are acts of fiction and that he was physically unable
to carry out some of the more gruesome acts described.  The Crown
casts these writings in a more sinister vein and relies upon the
expert opinions.  The second jury verdict would tend to add some
support to the Crown theory.
[11] For these reasons, and notwithstanding my concern about the
delay, the application for bail is dismissed.  I should make it
clear that an important consideration is that the dangerous
offender matter will be heard in September.  If there should be
further delay, it may be, depending on the explanation for that
delay, that the public interest would shift more in favour of the
applicant.
[12] Counsel for the applicant has asked me to expedite the
hearing of the appeals.  In the course of the oral argument I
suggested to both counsel that they might explore whether the
autrefois convict ground of appeal could be dealt with separately
and expeditiously on a simplified record.  It may be that this is
not feasible, but, if so advised, counsel may wish to make an
appointment with Doherty J.A. to deal with that issue and the
question of expediting the appeals.
[13] Accordingly, the application for release pending appeal
prior to sentencing is dismissed.  This order is made without
prejudice to the applicant renewing his application once sentence
has been imposed.  The question of expediting the appeal should
be pursued before Doherty J.A.</pre></td>
