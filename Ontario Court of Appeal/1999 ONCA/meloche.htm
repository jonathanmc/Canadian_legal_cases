Meloche v. Hotel Dieu Grace Hospital/Villa Marie (1998) 61 O.T.C. 26
(Gen. Div.)</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  September 21, 1993, the plaintiff/respondent, a 24-year
old  male soft-contact lens wearer, experienced pain in his right
eye.  He was unable to sleep that night, or the following  night,
and  on  the morning of September 23, 1993, presented himself  at
the  Emergency  Department of the Hotel Dieu Grace Hospital/Villa
Marie  in Windsor. The attending doctor diagnosed an abrasion  or
scratch  on  the  cornea  and prescribed  a  mild  dosage  of  an
antibotic, administered externally in drops, with instructions to
return in 24 hours. The pain increased and late that evening  the
respondent  attended  another  hospital  emergency  room  at  the
Metropolitan General Hospital, where the same diagnosis was given
by  Dr.  Frank, with instructions to return to the Hotel Dieu  in
the  morning. When he did so, the attending doctor diagnosed  not
only  the  abrasion, but also a corneal ulcer &#150; clinical evidence
that  there  was  an  infection in the eye.  He  was  immediately
referred to an ophthalmologist, the respondent Doctor Deans,  who
saw  no corneal ulcer and treated him again for the abrasion with
instructions  to return in 24 hours. When he did  return  to  Dr.
Deans  a  corneal  ulcer  was  evident  and  the  respondent  was
immediately hospitalized and put on a much more intensive  dosage
of  antibiotic.  He lost the sight of his right eye,  and  waited
approximately three and one-half years for a corneal  transplant,
which  restored  his vision, with some residual  limitations  and
discomfort.
[2]  Damages were settled at an undisclosed amount and after a
trial of the liability issue. Both Dr. Deans and Dr. Frank, the
attending physician at the Metropolitan General Hospital on the
evening of September 23, 1993, were found liable.
[3]  Dr. Frank does not appeal the finding of the trial judge
that he failed to meet the required standard of care expected of
an emergency physician, but does appeal the finding that his
conduct was a cause of the plaintiff&#146;s damages. Dr. Deans appeals
both the finding of a failure to meet the standard of care of an
ophthalmologist and against the finding of causation.
[4]  The evidence indicates that abrasions to the cornea are
quite common and generally heal within 24 hours when treated with
a mild dosage of an antibiotic such as ciloxan, applied
externally in drops. Abrasions are identifiable visually and can
form an opening in the skin of the cornea for the entry of
organisms that can lead to infection. In the present case the
organism was pseudomonas. The infection itself is not clinically
identifiable until it forms an ulcer which can be seen with the
aid of a magnifying lamp, called a slit lamp. Once an ulcer is
seen the indicated treatment is a much intensified application of
the antibiotic and, in this case, hospitalization in order to
assist in its administration to the patient.</pre>
    <pre>A MORE DETAILED REVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Dr. Favot saw the respondent in the emergency department  of
the  Hotel  Dieu Hospital on the morning of September  23,  1993,
identified two corneal abrasions, and saw nothing further through
use  of  a  slit  lamp.  He treated the respondent  with  a  mild
antibiotic, had a patch put on the eye, and told him to return in
24 hours. The medical evidence of the plaintiff and defendant was
that  Dr.  Favot  met  the  standard of  care  applicable  to  an
emergency room physician and the claim against him was dismissed.
[6]  Mr. Meloche was very upset by the increasing pain during the
day of September 23, 1993, and at about 11:00 p.m. went to the
Metropolitan Hospital to obtain a second opinion. Dr. Frank, the
attending physician, did not have a slit lamp available in the
emergency department. He examined the eye visually, identified
one abrasion, and treated the eye with the same antibiotic that
had been prescribed by Dr. Favot. Dr. Frank repatched the eye and
told the respondent to return to the Hotel Dieu Hospital in the
morning.
[7]  Dr. Frank did not appeal the finding that he fell below the
expected standard of care and it is therefore unnecessary for me
to analyze the trial judge&#146;s reasoning on that issue. However, in
fairness to Dr. Frank, I would observe that one aspect of the
trial judge&#146;s finding is very questionable.
[8]  At paragraph 15 of the reasons the trial judge says:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Frank did not make observations of the plaintiff&#146;s right
          eye and compare his observations with those of Dr. Favot. Dr.
          Frank relied on the diagnosis of Dr. Favot, which diagnosis later
          proved to be wrong. I would find, therefore, that Dr. Peter
          Frank&#146;s care of the plaintiff did not meet the standard required
          in 1993.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   There  was no evidence to suggest that it was  Dr.  Frank&#146;s
duty  as  an  emergency physician at 11:00 p.m. to seek  out  the
medical record created by Dr. Favot at another hospital. Nor  was
Dr.  Favot&#146;s  diagnosis proved to be wrong in terms of  what  was
clinically  observable.  However, there  was  a  dispute  in  the
evidence  as to whether Dr. Frank realized that a second  opinion
was  being sought (as the plaintiff claimed), or thought  he  was
dealing  with  a  patient who simply wanted a  wet  patch  to  be
replaced (as Dr. Frank claimed). The trial judge appears to  have
preferred  the  evidence of the patient  and,  viewed  from  that
perspective, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding
against Dr. Frank.
[10] On the morning of September 24, 1993, Mr. Meloche attended
at the Hotel Dieu Hospital and was seen by Dr. Meyer. Dr. Meyer
was not called as a witness and the only evidence emanating from
him is the notes made on the emergency record, filed under the
provisions of the Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.5.  Those notes
indicate an abrasion and an ulcer and the discharge diagnosis is
&#147;corneal ulcer/iritis/ + abrasion&#148;. Having seen signs of an ulcer
he sent the patient directly across the street to Dr. Deans&#146;
office for immediate consultation by an ophthalmologist.
[11] Dr. Dean saw Mr. Meloche immediately and upon examination
saw no clinical evidence of infection or corneal ulcer. As a
precaution against infection he prescribed a somewhat increased
dosage of the antibiotic ciloxan, with instructions to see him
within 24 hours or earlier if the condition worsened.
[12] On September 25, 1993, Dr. Deans saw Mr. Meloche in the
early morning and found evidence of a whitish infiltrate in the
anterior chamber of the cornea, indicating that the plaintiff was
suffering from a corneal ulcer. He was then admitted to the
hospital for more intensive treatment.
[13] The reasons of the trial judge in concluding that Dr. Deans&#146;
conduct fell below the expected standard are flawed in several
respects. At paragraph 21 he states:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Dr. Deans&#146; notes of the September 24, 1993, examination
          (exhibit 1-Tab C-1) do not exceed 20 words. The  only written
          reference to the history are three letters at the top of the note
          &#145;S.C.L.&#146; (soft contact lens). Dr. Deans testified that the
          plaintiff related the history of his illness to him but it was
          not recorded. The history and the examination according to Dr.
          Deans took five to 10 minutes. It is difficult to conceive a
          thorough history, examination and diagnosis in five to 10
          minutes.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  There was no evidence as to the time necessary  to  take  a
history  and make this examination. The examination itself  is  a
visual one through a slit lamp and both Dr. Deans and Mr. Meloche
testified that the history was taken. In Mr. Meloche&#146;s  words  &#147;I
went  over  exactly what happened from day 1.&#148;  The  trial  judge
then states at paragraph 21:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Deans did not examine Dr. Favot&#146;s observations of
          September 23, 1993. This documentation was located across the
          street from Dr. Deans&#146; office.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  As indicated earlier, there was no evidence to suggest that
it  was  medical  practice  to secure  the  notes  of  a  general
practitioner who has given earlier treatment. Dr. Deans  was  the
specialist  and,  no matter what the notes or  reports  of  other
doctors  might  indicate,  he was bound  to  rely  upon  his  own
experience  and  judgment in making this visual examination.  The
same  criticism  was made of Dr. Deans&#146; failure  to  examine  Dr.
Meyer&#146;s records.
[16] At paragraph 24 of his reasons the trial judge continues:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Dr. Deans&#146; diagnosis of September 24, 1993 was corneal
          abrasion. Dr. Deans however, did not treat the plaintiff for an
          abrasion but an infection. Dr. Deans prescribed ciloxan which was
          used for infection. Dr. Deans knew in 1993 that corneal ulcers
          were a frequent complication of corneal abrasions with soft
          contact lens users. If Dr. Deans suspected an infection, would it
          not have been prudent, given the plaintiff was a contact lens
          user, to do the tests that were done September 25, 1993 to
          confirm or discount the suspicion.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The evidence of Dr. Deans was that he prescribed the dosage
of  ciloxan that was greater than normal because the problem  had
persisted  for  24  hours and he wanted  to  avoid  the  possible
development of an infection. It was the evidence of Dr. Burt, the
expert called by the defendants, that doctors would typically see
2,000  cases of abrasion and only one that led to a corneal ulcer
and  that  it  is  not  good practice to be overly  intensive  in
treatment  of an abrasion. As to the last sentence of  the  above
quotation the evidence was that the testing done on September 25,
1993,  was  precisely the same as done on September 24,  1993,  &#150;
observation through a slit lamp.
[18] However, quite independently of these observations which I
have criticized, the trial judge concludes at paragraph 25: &#147;I
would find, on a balance of probabilities, that Dr. Meyer&#146;s
diagnosis of September 24, 1993 was correct and Dr. Deans&#146;
diagnosis of the same date was not.&#148;
[19] It is thus the trial judge&#146;s fundamental finding that Dr.
Deans failed to observe what was readily observable on September
24, 1993, and that this is established through the emergency
record notes of Dr. Meyer. The filing of records pursuant to the
Evidence Act, supra, at p.5, is beneficial both to the medical
profession and the administration of the courts, but it is
troubling where, as here, such evidence is cryptic and goes
directly to the integrity of Dr. Deans diagnosis. If called as a
witness, Dr. Meyer may have explained the brief notations so as
to permit a more informed assessment of whether Dr. Deans in fact
failed to see what Dr. Meyer had seen. In any event, the evidence
was before the court, either party might have called Dr. Meyer,
and it was open to the trial judge to make the finding he did.
[20] I would therefore not disturb the finding that Dr. Deans
failed to meet the requisite standard of conduct on September 24
and that the proper diagnosis was delayed for 24 hours. It is on
that basis that I will now turn to the issue of causation.</pre>
    <pre>CAUSATION</pre>
    <pre>[21] The issue is whether the delay in diagnosing the presence of
an  infection  through the identification of  the  corneal  ulcer
contributed  to the injuries suffered by Mr. Meloche.  The  trial
judge&#146;s  analysis  is very brief. He refers to Snell  v.  Farrell
(1990),  72 D.L.R. (4th) 289 (S.C.C.), where Sopinka J.  reasoned
that in certain circumstances where scientific proof of causation
is  lacking  the  trial judge may take a &#147;robust  and  pragmatic&#148;
approach to the facts.
[22] The trial judge then concludes at paragraph 29 of his
reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The issue then, in this case, is whether this court can
          draw an inference that the negligence of the defendants, Drs.
          Frank and Deans, caused or contributed to the plaintiff&#146;s damage.
          I have no hesitation in drawing such an inference from the facts
          of this case. In my opinion, Dr. Peter Frank&#146;s failure to refer
          the plaintiff to an ophthalmologist on September 23, 1993 and Dr.
          Robin Deans&#146; failure to treat the plaintiff&#146;s corneal ulcer on
          the morning of September 24, 1993, contributed to the plaintiff&#146;s
          injury. Dr. Burt testified as follows:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.   &#133;So, my question is &#150; if, if, if
               you didn&#146;t feel that doctor Deans did such a
               good job with what he did, is it possible
               that Mr. Meloche would have been left with a
               more significant scar then he did have such
               as, for example, the one that&#146;s shown in
               EXHIBIT 18?
               </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   That&#146;s possible.
               </pre>
    <pre>                     Q.   Yes, And, is it also possible
               than   that   given  the  virulence   of
               pseudomonas if it had been utilized in a
               greater dosage on the 24th then  it  was
               that  is siloxane that the size  of  the
               scar would have been smaller?
               </pre>
    <pre>                     A.   Well, you&#146;re talking about  a
               difference  of perhaps a  half  a  dozen
               drops. But, you know &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>                     Q.    We&#146;re not talking about  the
               difference  between half a dozen  drops.
               We&#146;re talking about the introduction  of
               what  you described as a loading up dose
               as  opposed  to the utilization  of  one
               drop  per hour as doctor Deans testified
               that  he  prescribed.  And  during  that
               critical period when the disease  entity
               is  first  being attacked with something
               that  has  any effect in respect  of  it
               would  it not make a difference to  load
               up as you described it?
               </pre>
    <pre>                     A.    It&#146;s  possible. But  then  I
               could  say  to you, well, if that&#146;s  the
               case then perhaps in those situations we
               should have injected the drugs and  used
               the  other  drugs that he did  as  well.
               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[23]  The final answer is somewhat ambiguous, but probably refers
to  the  doctor&#146;s earlier evidence to the effect that it  is  not
good  medical practice to overuse antibiotics where they are  not
specifically  required  for  the  clinically  observed   aliment.
However, the more important error of the trial judge is in taking
this excerpt out of context and relating causation of vision loss
to the size of the scar.
[24] In the portion of the cross-examination immediately
preceding these questions, counsel made the following inquiry
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          Q. &#133;So what I want to do is direct that same question to you in
          terms of causation. And if I can try to help you, the, the
          question as I see it in terms of causation is &#150; would it have
          made a difference? So what I want to ask you is putting aside
          your views as to what the appropriate dosage of siloxane was on
          the 24th when doctor Deans first saw Mr. Meloche, is it not true
          that a more potent dose of siloxane on the 24th could very
          possibly have resulted in a better outcome for Mr. Meloche?</pre>
    <pre>and Dr. Burt answered,
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Well, there&#146;s several aspects to that I&#146;d  address.
          First of all, if we go back to the nature of the disease. It was
          going to produce scar. It did produce scar and a little scar is
          often times just as bad as a lot of scars. So, if we&#146;re talking
          about his visual outcome, it&#146;s hard for me to imagine that those
          few extra drops in the first few hours on that day when he did
          not have an ulcer significantly contributed to the visual end
          result. In addition, I would say that when those very same orders
          were prescribed the following day, the day he admitted him plus
          other drops in association with it, the following day after that
          he was worse. So, you know, we can&#146;t, I think that&#146;s conjectural.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[25] In his examination-in-chief Dr. Burt stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   I want you to comment on the result because we&#146;re in a
          case here where it&#146;s obvious Mr. Meloche did or Meloche did
          experience the loss of vision and then required a corneal
          transplant. This is about some years later. And what do you, what
          is your opinion of that result in the case of in this case?
          </pre>
    <pre>                A.    Pseudomonas is perhaps  the  most
          feared  organism in the eye in terms  of  the
          damage  it  can  cause and  the  severity  of
          visual   loss.   And,   it    causes   severe
          disturbance to the cornea. Often times it can
          go  onto  to perforating the cornea.  A  hole
          opens  up  in it because it&#146;s only a  half  a
          millimetre  thick  and  that  kind  of  gross
          infection  I  showed  you  in  that   picture
          destroys the entire cornea sickness[sic]. The
          cornea can rupture. The infection gets in the
          eye  and you can lose the eye from widespread
          infection  inside the eye. So, I  guess  what
          I&#146;m  saying is this is a very serious problem
          with  a  wide  ranging number of sequelae  in
          spite  of  all  of the best  therapy  we  can
          throw.  In this particular and let me say  in
          addition   to   that  that  when  pseudomonas
          infects  the eye once the part of  the  apple
          below  the  epithelium,  the  saran  wrap  is
          damaged,  you  have scarring. So,  basically,
          I&#146;m  saying to you if you get an ulcer  there
          will  be  a scar. And if you have a  scar  if
          it&#146;s  in the centre of cornea impeding vision
          through  that  clear  window  you  will  have
          decreased vision. So, invariably, there  will
          be  a  scar. And with pseudomonas it&#146;s  often
          very  severe. I have never treated a  culture
          prove pseudomonas case that did not result in
          some  scarring and if it&#146;s in the  centre  of
          the   cornea   loss  of  vision   under   any
          circumstances. No matter how early  I  caught
          them.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[26]  At  a later stage in the examination-in-chief, the evidence
with respect to causation was as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   I understand the standard. We addressed that earlier
          with His Honour. But we&#146;re simply looking at the issue of
          the[sic] whether there was a contribution. And, and you have said
          is there any other thing you want to say as to why you were of
          that view?
          </pre>
    <pre>                A.    Well,  the  first issue  is  that
          you&#146;re  dealing with an infection that  is  a
          very potent serious infection and I think  in
          spite of anything at all that we might do  in
          many  of  these as I&#146;ve said before  it  goes
          onto  a  serious problem. And it&#146;s very  hard
          for  me  to  imagine  that some  intermittent
          patching   for   pain  as   was   recommended
          contributed  in  any way to the  end  result.
          Scarring  was inevitable when that  infection
          became established and the degree of scarring
          would[sic]  is variable and often  very  very
          severe.  And  in  this particular  patient  I
          might  tell you that the scarring we saw  and
          the  end result compared to patients  I  have
          seen    with   pseudomonas   infection    was
          excellent, a very good result. I mean not for
          the  patient. He, obviously, had lost vision.
          But many of these infections perhaps most  of
          them in spite of anything at all we throw  at
          them looked more like that picture. So it&#146;s a
          serious  problem.  It, and the  potential  is
          there.  And  I can&#146;t believe that  putting  a
          patch on intermittently to relieve some  pain
          had  any  significant effect on that ultimate
          outcome.</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Dr. Burt&#146;s evidence was consistent throughout to the effect
that  any  scar in the center of the cornea would lead to  visual
impairment  and  the ultimate necessity of a corneal  transplant.
There  was no need for the trial judge to accept the evidence  of
Dr.  Burt but, in my view, the excerpt he chose dealing with  the
size  of  the scar does not diminish or detract from the evidence
of Dr. Burt directed to the issue of causation.
[28] Most significantly, the trial judge makes no reference to
the evidence from the plaintiff&#146;s expert on this subject. Dr.
Tokarewicz, an ophthalmologist, submitted a report to counsel for
Mr. Meloche and it was subsequently filed in evidence pursuant to
the Evidence Act. The report is not critical of the defendant
doctors but does not deal with the issue of delay in treatment.
Following receipt of that report counsel for Mr. Meloche wrote
the doctor with a follow-up inquiry reading
          </pre>
    <pre>               We would ask for you to provide us with a further report
          specifically addressing the following issues:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   Would the appropriate administration of ciloxan commencing
          during the morning of September 23, 1993 (when Mr. Meloche saw
          the first emergency physician, Dr. Favot, which was 24 hours
          prior to seeing Dr. Deans and 48 hours prior to being admitted),
          probably have resulted in the organisms causing less damage?
          2.   What are the preferable dosage and frequency of
          administration of ciloxan?</pre>
    <pre>[29]   This letter together with the response were also filed  in
evidence. The response reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In reply to your first question; Ciloxan used in
          conjunctivitis, as recommended by Alcon, is used one to two drops
          into the infected eye every two hours for two days and then two
          drops every four hours for five days thereafter. In a corneal
          ulcer on the first day two drops to be used in the eye every
          fifteen minutes for the first six hours then every thirty
          minutes. On the second day, two drops every hour. On the
          following days two drops every four hours. These are the
          instructions on the packet that comes with the drops inside.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Through the &#147;retrospectascope&#148; one could
          say  that  perhaps this may have altered  the
          course  of the infection if Ciloxan had  been
          used  as  a primary agent. One must  remember
          that this however is totally conjectural.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The real question for the trial judge was whether these  two
medical opinions left any room to make a finding of causation  on
a  balance of probabilities through the application of a  &#147;robust
and pragmatic&#148; approach as referred to by Sopinka J. in Snell  v.
Farrell, supra, at p.8. In that case, an operation on the eye was
continued with knowledge that a haemorrhage had appeared  in  the
eye. The loss of sight was caused by blood deprivation in the eye
and the medical specialists called at trial could not attribute a
cause among competent alternatives including the continuation  of
the operation despite the haemorrhage.
[31] At p. 297 of Snell v. Farrell, supra, at p. 8, Sopinka J.
grappled with the decision of the House of Lords in McGhee v.
National Coal Board [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1, (H.L. (S.C.)) which
appeared to hold that the onus to disprove causation shifts to
the defendant in certain circumstances. Sopinka J. notes the
concern that the traditional approach to causation may in certain
types of cases deprive a probable victim of tortious conduct of
relief, particularly in medical malpractice cases where the
physician is usually in a better position to know the cause of
the injury than the patient. He notes that McGhee was subjected
to careful examination by the House of Lords in Wilsher v. Essex
Area Health Authority, [1988] 2 W.L.R. 557 (H.L.(E)) where Lord
Bridge reaffirmed the principle that the burden of proving
causation rested on the plaintiff and explained the McGhee
decision &#147;as promoting a robust and pragmatic approach to the
facts to enable an inference of negligence to be drawn even
though medical or scientific expertise cannot arrive at a
definitive conclusion.&#148;
[32] After examining a number of cases Sopinka J. concludes at
p.301:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    These references speak of the shifting of the secondary
          or evidential burden of proof or the burden of adducing evidence.
          I find it preferable to explain the process without using the
          term secondary or evidential burden. It is not strictly accurate
          to speak of the burden shifting to the defendant when what is
          meant is that evidence adduced by the plaintiff may result in an
          inference being drawn adverse to the defendant. Whether an
          inference is or is not drawn is a matter of weighing evidence.
          The defendant runs the risk of an adverse inference in the
          absence of evidence to the contrary. This is sometimes referred
          to as imposing on the defendant a provisional or tactical burden:
          see Cross, op. Cit., at p.129. In my opinion, this is not a true
          burden of proof, and use of an additional label to describe what
          is an ordinary step in the fact-finding process is unwarranted.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      The   legal  or  ultimate  burden
          remains  with  the  plaintiff,  but  in   the
          absence  of evidence to the contrary  adduced
          by  the  defendant, an inference of causation
          may be drawn, although positive or scientific
          proof  of causation has not been adduced.  If
          some  evidence to the contrary is adduced  by
          the defendant, the trial judge is entitled to
          take   account  of  Lord  Mansfield&#146;s  famous
          precept. This is, I believe, what Lord Bridge
          had in mind in Wilsher when he referred to  a
          &#147;robust  and  pragmatic  approach  to  the  &#133;
          facts&#148; (p.569).</pre>
    <pre>[33] And then at pp.305-306:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The appellant was present during the operation and was
          in a better position to observe what occurred. Furthermore, he
          was able to interpret from a medical standpoint what he saw. In
          addition, by continuing the operation which has been found to
          constitute negligence, he made it impossible for the respondent
          or anyone else to detect the bleeding which is alleged to have
          caused the injury. In these circumstances, it was open to the
          trial judge to draw the inference that the injury was caused by
          the retrobulbar bleeding. There was no evidence to rebut this
          inference. The fact that testing the eye for hardness did not
          disclose bleeding is insufficient for this purpose. If there was
          any rebutting evidence, it was weak, and it was open to the trial
          judge to find causation, applying the principles to which I have
          referred.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     I  am confident that had the trial
          judge  not  stated that &#147;I cannot  go  beyond
          this  since neither doctor did and  I  should
          not  speculate&#148;,  he  would  have  drawn  the
          necessary inference. In stating the above, he
          failed to appreciate that it is not essential
          to have a positive medical opinion to support
          a  finding of causation. Furthermore,  it  is
          not speculation but the application of common
          sense  to  draw such an inference  where,  as
          here,   the  circumstances,  other   than   a
          positive medical opinion, permit.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  As  I read Sopinka J., he is saying that there is  room  in
some  cases, where medical evidence of probability is not  likely
available, for a trial judge to be more than usually assertive in
concluding  on a common sense basis that cause led to effect.  It
is,   in   effect,  a  generosity  afforded  to  the  victim   in
circumstances  where,  through no fault  of  the  plaintiff,  the
probable  cause  is  not susceptible of proof  on  a  balance  of
probabilities.
[35] Lankenau Estate v. Dutton (1991), 79 D.L.R. (4th) 705
(B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1991] 3 S.C.R. provides an
example of the application of Snell v. Farrell, supra, at p. 8,
to facts which are somewhat closer to those before this court in
that it concerned the timing of a diagnosis. The plaintiff
underwent a heart operation during the course of which a
congenital displacement of her spine was aggravated and she
suffered paralysis. The displacement of the vertebrae was not
noticed for some period of time at which point traction was used
to move the vertebrae to its approximate original position and
relieve the pressure on the spinal cord. The medical experts
could not say whether traction applied at the earlier time when
the displacement should have been discovered would or would not
have assured the plaintiff any restoration of function.
[36] After reviewing the judgment of Sopinka J. in Snell v.
Farrell, supra, at p. 8, Southin J.A. stated at p. 717:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Here, we know what caused the paralysis &#150; it was
          compression of the spinal cord. What we do not know with
          certainty was whether the breach of duty, i.e., the failure of
          timely diagnosis, made even partial recovery impossible. To put
          it another way, what we do not know with certainty is whether if
          there had been no breach of duty she would have had some
          recovery.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In my opinion, this is a case for a
          robust  and pragmatic approach to the  facts.
          It  is  not  possible for anyone  to  do  any
          controlled  experiment to find out  how  much
          traction applied at what time to a patient in
          this condition can cause a reversal, in whole
          or in part, of the paralysis.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  a practical sense, it is  much
          more  difficult to determine what would  have
          happened  if  something which ought  to  have
          been done but was not done had been done than
          it is to determine the effect of the doing of
          something which ought not to have been done.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     To  say that a plaintiff,  in  the
          circumstances of a case such as this, has the
          burden of showing that, if there had been  no
          breach  of  duty, she could  and  would  have
          received effective, in the sense of relieving
          the  pressure, treatment, before 1715 on June
          12th   rather  than  before  the   time   the
          appellant  says  she  could  and  would  have
          received  such treatment, namely 1800  hours,
          seems  to me to be importing into the concept
          of  the  legal burden of proof a  requirement
          that  a  plaintiff demonstrate scientifically
          that which is incapable of scientific proof.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     If  there  had been no  breach  of
          duty, her recovery even in part was bound  to
          be  a  near-run  thing. But, in  my  opinion,
          there  was and is sufficient evidence  for  a
          finding that she would not have been in  such
          a hopeless condition.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Returning to Snell v. Farrell, supra, at p. 8,  Sopinka  J.
gave  anxious consideration to whether the traditional  causation
approach  of imposing an onus upon the plaintiff should give  way
in  malpractice cases, at least, to a requirement that those  who
have  knowledge  of  the  allegations  be  required  to  disprove
causation. He was concerned that plaintiffs in malpractice  cases
may  be  deprived  of  compensation  because  they  cannot  prove
causation where it, in fact, exists. In the course of rejecting a
move  in  that  direction, as indicated in  the  excerpts  quoted
above, he stated at p. 299:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Adoption of either of the proposed alternatives would
          have the effect of compensating plaintiffs where a substantial
          connection between the injury and the defendant&#146;s conduct is
          absent. Reversing the burden of proof may be justified where two
          defendants negligently fire in the direction of the plaintiff and
          then by their tortious conduct destroy the means of proof at his
          disposal. In such a case it is clear that the injury was not
          caused by neutral conduct. It is quite a different matter to
          compensate a plaintiff by reversing the burden of proof for an
          injury that may very well be due to factors unconnected to the
          defendant and not the fault of anyone. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[38]  The  judgment  as  a  whole  created  a  new  frontier  for
plaintiffs  in  circumstances where the  causal  relationship  is
uncertain. However, it would be an unjustified extension of  that
principle  to  permit speculation in factual circumstances  where
the  evidence on both sides is that the injury was not the  fault
of  anyone.  There  is no lack of evidence  in  this  case.  Both
plaintiffs and defendants witnesses have asserted that  it  would
be  speculative  to  associate the delay in  diagnosis  with  the
result.  The infection came from an unknown source,  it  was  not
identifiable  until  the ulcer was seen, and  any  ulcer  in  the
center of the cornea leads to vision impairment and the resultant
injury.  There was no room for common sense between the two  book
ends of medical evidence refuting causation. The trial judge  was
not filling in a void with common sense pragmatism. He was rather
challenging the medical opinions with one of his own. He pulled a
small  concession out of the evidence of Dr. Burt, failed to  put
that  concession into the context of the medical  evidence  as  a
whole  and then erroneously concluded that the size of  the  scar
was  related to the ultimate injury. In my view, the trial  judge
far  exceeded the bounds set by Snell and Farrell and should have
concluded on all the evidence that the plaintiff&#146;s action  failed
for want of proof of causation on a balance of probabilities.
[39] While the findings were specifically directed to Dr. Deans,
the conclusion in these reasons applies equally to Dr. Franks. I
would therefore set aside the judgment below and dismiss the
action, in the circumstances without costs here or below.
