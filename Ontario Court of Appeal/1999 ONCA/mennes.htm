            OF CANADA on behalf of the Correctional Service of

    <pre>COUNSEL:    Emile Mennes,

    <pre>HEARD:      November 23, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Madam Justice Rose Boyko dated
April 14, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal from the decision of Boyko J. dismissing
an  application  for habeas corpus.  We need not  decide  whether
Boyko  J. was correct in finding that there had been no violation
of  ss.  39  &#150; 44 of the Corrections and Conditional Release  Act
S.C. 1992, c. 20.  As for the fresh evidence, it is not clear  on
this  record whether Mr. Beck&#146;s health concerns have been brought
to  the  attention of the authorities.  However,  we  agree  with
Boyko J. that habeas corpus was not available, the appellant  not
having  shown  that there has been a significant  deprivation  of
liberty  as explained in R. v. Miller (1985), 23 C.C.C.  (3d)  97
(S.C.C.) at 118.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s remedy, if any, must be at the Federal
Court.  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
