COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. OMAR MERINO

    <pre>HEARD:         May 10, 1999

On appeal from the conviction on December 11, 1997, imposed by
Hamilton J., sitting with a jury, and from the sentence imposed
by Hamilton J. on January 13, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, the trial judge did not err in failing to put
the alternative defence of honest but mistaken belief to the
jury.  There was no air of reality to this defence given the
contradictory versions presented of what occurred.  The jury&#146;s
acceptance of the complainant&#146;s evidence demonstrates that a
defence of honest but mistaken belief had no air of reality.
Defence counsel was, moreover, specifically asked about honest
but mistaken belief, but stated that he wanted the defence
restricted to strict consent.
[2]  It was open to the jury to have a reasonable doubt about the
assault and forcible confinement charges and yet be persuaded
that a sexual assault had occurred.  The charges were
sufficiently distinct that it was not unreasonable for the jury
to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a sexual assault
had occurred.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
                                                                 </pre>
