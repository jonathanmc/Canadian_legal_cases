    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice

    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>                                  I
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of the first degree murder  of
Brenda Murray.  He appeals.
[2]  In his oral submissions, counsel limited the appeal to three
grounds:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  did the trial judge err in refusing to permit the appellant
  to challenge for cause based on pre-trial publicity?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  did the trial judge err in admitting out-of-court statements
  made by the deceased?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  did the trial judge err in failing to caution the jury
  against the improper use of the evidence of threats made by the
  appellant against the deceased?</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[3]   I  would reject the first and third arguments made  by  the
appellant.  Although I agree with the appellant&#146;s contention that
the deceased&#146;s out-of-court statements were inadmissible, I would
apply the curative proviso and dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>                                
                                  II</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  appellant  and Ms. Murray had been  in  a  common  law
relationship for about 12 years before they separated in  January
1993.  They had two children, John (aged 10) and Megan (aged  8).
After the separation, which was at Ms. Murray&#146;s instigation,  the
relationship  between the appellant and Ms.  Murray  became  very
acrimonious.  A bitter custody dispute developed.
[5]  The appellant was awarded interim custody of the two
children in January 1993.  Ms. Murray retained counsel to move to
vary that order.  Her initial efforts to do so failed, however,
the court did appoint an independent lawyer for the children.  In
February 1993, the appellant caused Ms. Murray to be charged with
threatening her son John.  During her trial, Ms. Murray gave
evidence that the appellant had threatened her on January 21,
1993 and again on February 5, 1993.  This testimony was
eventually admitted on the appellant&#146;s trial.  The bitter custody
dispute was ongoing when Ms. Murray was killed on April 7, 1993.
[6]  On the evening of April 7, 1993, the appellant and his son
from a previous marriage, Troy (aged 16), went to Ms. Murray&#146;s
residence.  The appellant asked her to go to a local donut shop
so that they could discuss their problems.  Ms. Murray was
reluctant to go because she was afraid of the appellant, but
eventually decided that she would go to the donut shop as it was
a public place.  She took her daughter from a previous marriage
Brianne (aged 12), with her.
[7]  The appellant and Ms. Murray sat at one table and the two
children sat at another.  There was considerable evidence of the
comings and goings of Troy and the appellant.  This evidence
figured into the Crown&#146;s allegation that the murder was planned
and deliberate. After a long discussion, Ms. Murray, who was
visibly upset, stood up indicating that she was going to leave.
The appellant was heard to say &#147;well fuck you then bitch.&#148;  Ms.
Murray was then shot three times.  The forensic evidence
indicated that the first shot hit Ms. Murray in the neck, the
second shot hit her in the back and the third shot hit her in the
back of the head.  The same evidence suggested that Ms. Murray
was hit with the second shot before she had fallen to the ground
after being struck with the first shot.  All three shots were
fired in rapid succession.
[8]  Immediately after the shots were fired, the appellant left
the donut shop.  He drove Troy back to their home and spent the
night driving around by himself and sitting in a combine in a
field on his farm.  He surrendered to the police at about 2:00
p.m. the next day and gave them the gun used to kill Ms. Murray.
[9]  It was the Crown&#146;s position that the appellant had decided
to kill Ms. Murray to prevent her from getting custody of the
children or any financial settlement as a result of the marriage
breakdown.  According to the Crown, the appellant was even
prepared to go to jail for killing Ms. Murray but thought that he
would be convicted of manslaughter and would be released from
jail after several years.
[10] The Crown contended that the appellant fired all three shots
that struck Ms. Murray.  The appellant, who testified, admitted
that he fired the second and third shots.  He claimed that his
son Troy fired the first shot and that he then grabbed the gun
from Troy, stood over Ms. Murray, and fired the second and third
shots.  He said that he did so to &#147;protect Troy&#148; in the belief
that the other people in the donut shop did not see Troy fire the
first shot but would see him fire the second and third shots.
The appellant said that he had no idea that Troy had a gun or
that he intended to shoot Ms. Murray.  The appellant also
testified that he &#147;knew&#148; that Ms. Murray was dead when he stood
over her and fired the second and third shots into her.  The
appellant indicated on cross-examination that it only took &#147;a
split second&#148; to grab the gun from Troy, approach Ms. Murray,
determine that she was already dead, decide to fire the shots to
protect Troy, and fire the shots.
[11] There was very strong direct evidence that the appellant
fired all three shots.  Troy testified that his father fired all
the shots.  According to him, he and his father had formulated a
plan earlier that evening to kill Ms. Murray.  The appellant said
that he would give Troy a signal (a request for cigarettes) after
which Troy was to go to the farm and retrieve the appellant&#146;s
handgun.  Troy testified that he received that signal from his
father, left the donut shop, drove to the farm, got the gun,
drove back to the donut shop and went inside leaving the gun in
the truck.  A short time later, the appellant then went out to
the truck.  There was evidence from other customers in the donut
shop confirming Troy&#146;s evidence that he left the donut shop and
that his father went out to the truck shortly after his return.
[12] Troy denied firing any of the shots, although on his
evidence he was in the immediate vicinity when the shots were
fired.  Troy&#146;s initial statements to the police denied any plan
to kill Ms. Murray.  He insisted that the murder was justified
because she had threatened the children.  Troy said he was afraid
when he made these statements.   The trial judge gave a
&#147;Vetrovec&#148; warning concerning Troy&#146;s evidence.
[13] Brianne Murray who was sitting with Troy confirmed that Troy
left the donut shop and drove away.  She also confirmed that
after he returned, the appellant went out to the truck and then
returned to the donut shop.  She testified that she saw the
appellant shoot her mother.  On her version, Troy was near the
door of the donut shop when the shots were fired.
[14] John Klunder, a college student, was in the donut shop with
a friend.  He was an independent witness with no connection to
any of the parties.  He said that about 11:30 p.m. Ms. Murray got
up to leave.  He heard the appellant say &#147;well fuck you then
bitch&#148;, saw him pull a gun from his jacket, aim and fire.  Ms.
Murray fell to the ground.  Mr. Klunder was looking at Ms. Murray
when she fell and he was about 5 or 6 feet from the appellant.
Mr. Klunder looked away and heard two more shots.  There was
about a second between each shot.  The appellant looked at Mr.
Klunder and walked out of the donut shop.  Troy was already at
the truck.
[15] Robert Dietrich, Mr. Klunder&#146;s friend, was sitting with him
in the donut shop.  He heard the appellant and Ms. Murray arguing
over custody matters.  He saw the appellant leave the donut shop
briefly and then return.  The appellant was angry.  Mr. Dietrich
heard Ms. Murray indicate that she was leaving.  As Ms. Murray
got up, Mr. Dietrich heard a loud bang.  Ms. Murray fell to the
ground.  Mr. Dietrich saw the appellant holding the gun, saw a
flash and heard two more shots.  According to Mr. Dietrich, Troy
was not in the immediate vicinity when the shots were fired.
[16] In addition to the strong direct evidence identifying the
appellant as the person who fired all three shots, the Crown
relied on a substantial body of circumstantial evidence to
confirm the appellant&#146;s identity as the shooter, establish that
he intended to kill Ms. Murray, and establish that the murder was
planned and deliberate.
[17] The Crown led evidence that after their separation the
appellant had made numerous statements to various persons to the
effect that he wanted Ms. Murray dead and would kill her even if
he had to go to jail for some time.  No less than eight witnesses
gave evidence of threats made by the appellant.  These included a
friend, employees, a business associate, three of the appellant&#146;s
children and his former wife, Sharon Merz.  The appellant
admitted making comments suggesting that he would not care if Ms.
Murray was killed, but indicated that he was simply blowing off
steam and did not mean the comments.  He denied making most of
the threats attributed to him.
[18] Troy, John, and a third son by a previous marriage, Konrad
testified that their father made threats against Ms. Murray in
the course of suggesting that he and the children should devise a
plan to kill Ms. Murray.  According to Troy, the appellant
discussed many plans to kill Ms. Murray in the presence of Troy
and Konrad.  One involved driving Ms. Murray&#146;s car off the road.
Konrad recalled a conversation in which his father planned to
kill Ms. Murray while dressed in a Halloween costume so no one
would recognize him.  John testified that his father told Troy,
Konrad and him that Ms. Murray was planning to kill their sister
Megan and John.  The appellant said he wanted to kill Ms. Murray
and discussed with the children the possibility of cutting off
her car and killing her.  He told his children to come up with
plans to kill Ms. Murray.
[19] The Crown also led evidence of two specific death threats
which Ms. Murray had said were made against her by the appellant.
The first occurred on January 31, 1993 and the second on February
5th of that year.  The evidence of these two threats came from
two sources.  First, the Crown led evidence of testimony given by
Ms. Murray in her own defence to the threatening charge brought
against her.  During cross-examination, Ms. Murray testified that
she was threatened on January 31st and February 5th by the
appellant.  The Crown also led evidence from a friend of Ms.
Murray and from Ms. Murray&#146;s lawyer of conversations they had
with Ms. Murray in which she indicated she had been threatened on
those two days by the appellant.  At trial, counsel for the
appellant objected to the admissibility of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior
testimony and the evidence of her friend and her lawyer.  The
trial judge admitted the evidence for the truth of its contents.
Counsel for the appellant renews his objection to the
admissibility of that evidence on this appeal.
[20] Sharon Merz, the appellant&#146;s former wife, testified that the
appellant called her at about 3:00 p.m. on the day of the
shooting.  He asked her to take care of the young children in the
event that anything happened to him and said he wanted to get rid
of Ms. Murray.  Sharon Merz said that she received a second phone
call about 10:30 that evening in which the appellant again asked
her to take care of the children and said he was &#147;thinking of
doing it.&#148;  Ms. Merz did not disclose this information to the
police when first questioned.  The appellant acknowledged that he
spoke to his former wife on the day of the homicide, but said
that he spoke to her only about a G.S.T. return.
[21] Troy Merz gave direct evidence of the plan leading to the
death of Ms. Murray.  It was his evidence that earlier on the
same day, the appellant told him that they would get Ms. Murray
to go out for a coffee with them.  Once in the coffee shop, the
appellant would ask Troy to get him some cigarettes.  This was to
be the signal that Troy should leave the restaurant, go to the
farm and retrieve the appellant&#146;s handgun.  Troy was to return to
the restaurant, leaving the hand gun in the truck.  Troy
indicated that he did not believe that the appellant was serious
about this plan.  The appellant had discussed many other plans to
kill Ms. Murray with Troy and had taken no action on any of those
plans.  As far as Troy knew, there was no plan to see Ms. Murray
that evening.
[22] Things turned out differently than Troy had expected.  He
and his father did see Ms. Murray that evening and, according to
Troy, the appellant set the plan in motion by giving Troy the
signal when the appellant and Ms. Murray were in the donut shop.
Troy followed the plan, got the gun and left it in the truck.
The appellant then retrieved the gun, returned to the coffee shop
and shot Ms. Murray just as he had planned earlier that day.
[23] The Crown also relied on evidence that the appellant tried
to hire someone to kill his son Troy while the appellant was in
custody awaiting trial.  Mr. B.* met the appellant while both
were in custody at the Waterloo Detention Centre.  According to
Mr. B., the appellant told him at some point that his son was
going to testify against him on his murder trial.  The appellant
said that without the son&#146;s testimony, he would be convicted of
manslaughter at worst.  The appellant inquired as to whether
there might be some way to &#147;eliminate&#148; his son.  Mr. B. and the
appellant discussed the cost of &#147;eliminating&#148; Troy ($20,000.00).
Mr. B. decided that the appellant was serious about getting rid
of the son and contacted the police, according to him, because of
his concern for Troy&#146;s safety.
[24] The police had Mr. B. arrange a meeting between the
appellant and a &#147;hitman.&#148;  The hitman was in fact an undercover
police officer.  When the undercover officer and the appellant
met their conversation was recorded.  The recording was before
the jury and it was open to the interpretation that the appellant
was prepared to pay $20,000.00 to have his son murdered so that
he could not testify against him.
[25] The appellant acknowledged the conversation with the
undercover police officer.  He said, however, that he knew that
he was being &#147;set up and wanted to expose the police and their
dishonest tactics.&#148;  About two days after the conversation with
the undercover officer, the appellant went to the authorities in
the jail and reported that Mr. B. had approached him with the
idea of killing his son.  The appellant also said that a &#147;hitman&#148;
had been sent to see him by Mr. B., but that he had told that man
that he was not interested in having his son killed.  The
undercover police officer was sent back to the jail some two or
three days after their first conversation, but the appellant
refused to see him.
[26] Mr. B. had an extensive criminal record and there was reason
to believe that he stood to gain from testimony implicating the
appellant.  The trial judge gave a very strong &#147;Vetrovec&#148; warning
in respect of his evidence.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                 III</pre>
    <pre>Did the trial judge err in refusing to permit a challenge for
cause based on pre-trial publicity?</pre>
    <pre>[27] The homicide occurred on April 7, 1993.  The trial commenced
in  early  February 1995, almost two years later.  The  appellant
sought to challenge for cause on two grounds.  First he contended
that  the  pre-trial publicity created a realistic potential  for
prejudice  and,  second,  he  argued  that  the  nature  of   the
allegation, murder in the context of a domestic dispute, raised a
realistic  possibility of prejudice.  The  trial  judge  rejected
both  submissions.  On appeal, the appellant relies only  on  the
contention that the pre-trial publicity warranted a challenge for
cause.
[28]  The  evidence of the pre-trial publicity  consisted  of  12
articles  in  a newspaper called the New Hamburg Independent,  14
articles  from  the Kitchener-Waterloo Record and  a  very  brief
television news clip shown on the local television station on the
night  of  April 10, 1993.  The television news clip  was  of  no
consequence  and  was  not  relied on by  the  appellant  in  his
submissions in this court.
[29] The appellant led no evidence of the circulation of either
newspaper in the area from which the jury pool was selected.
While I think the court can take judicial notice that the
Kitchener-Waterloo Record is widely distributed in that Judicial
District, I do not think that judicial notice can be taken of the
circulation of the New Hamburg Independent.  New Hamburg is
apparently a small hamlet within the judicial district.  In my
view, it cannot be assumed that any of the prospective jurors
came from that hamlet or that any of them were exposed to the New
Hamburg Independent.
[30] All but three of the 26 newspaper articles relied on by the
appellant were published more than a year before the trial.  Only
one appeared in the six months prior to trial.  That article
appeared in the Kitchener-Waterloo Record on January 7, 1995.  It
was a brief factual report of the refusal of a defence request
for an adjournment of the trial.  The article also indicated that
the appellant was charged with the murder and had been in custody
since April 7, 1993.
[31] In reviewing a trial judge&#146;s decision refusing to permit a
challenge for cause, this court does not simply decide whether it
would have permitted the challenge.  Rather, the court must
determine whether the trial judge&#146;s decision demonstrates an
error in principle or otherwise resulted in a miscarriage of
justice:  R. v. Parks (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324 at 335-36 (C.A.),
leave to appeal refused [1994] 1 S.C.R. x;  R. v. Barnes,
released September 13, 1999 at para. 30 (Ont. C.A.).
[32] The trial judge provided careful and thorough reasons for
his decision.  Those reasons reveal a full appreciation of the
relevant principles.  The trial judge acknowledged the
presumption that jurors will obey their oath of impartiality and
then said:
          </pre>
    <pre>     &#133; To displace that presumption the applicant must satisfy
     the burden of showing there is an air of reality to the
     application or a realistic potential for existence of partiality.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The trial judge accurately identified R. v. Sherratt, [1991]
1  S.C.R.  509 as the pertinent governing authority.  In Sherratt
at  pp. 535-37 L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J., for the majority, described the
threshold  question  as whether the publicity  could  potentially
have   the   effect   of   destroying  the  prospective   jurors&#146;
indifference  between the Crown and the accused.   In  addressing
that  threshold  question, L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. indicated  that  the
extent,  age and content of the pre-trial publicity were relevant
considerations.    She   observed  that  media   coverage   which
misrepresented  the  facts, referred to prejudicial  facts  which
would  not  or  could not be adduced into evidence  at  trial  or
advanced opinions as to the accused&#146;s guilt were potentially more
prejudicial  than  coverage which did not display  any  of  these
features.
[34] The trial judge considered the factors identified in R. v.
Sherratt, supra.  He observed that the extent of the newspaper
coverage was not unusual and that almost all of it had appeared
more than a year before the trial date.  I agree with both
observations.  The articles which appeared in the year prior to
the trial were basically factual reports of the court proceedings
relating to the charges.  One article which appeared in August
1994 did refer to the fact that the appellant had been charged
with counselling the murder of his son and did refer briefly to
the facts underlying the murder charge. I think it is farfetched
to suggest that prospective jurors would remember, much less be
prejudiced by the contents of these articles.
[35] In his submissions, counsel for the appellant took issue
with the trial judge&#146;s characterization of the newspaper reports
as &#147;mostly factual.&#148;  There is some merit to this submission as
it relates to some of the articles which appeared in the days
immediately following the homicide.  These articles did refer to
the long and troubled relationship between the appellant and Ms.
Murray.  An article appearing on April 10, 1993 in the Kitchener-
Waterloo Record canvassed in some detail the allegations that the
appellant and Ms. Murray had made against each other in the court
documents filed in connection with the custody dispute.  These
allegations referred to acts of violence by the appellant,
threats by him against Ms. Murray, and disreputable conduct by
him towards his children.  The articles also made reference to
allegations against Ms. Murray that cast her in a very bad light.
[36] This April 10, 1993 article referred to potentially
prejudicial material which could not be placed in evidence at the
appellant&#146;s trial.  As such, it was the kind of pre-trial
publicity which L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. cautioned against in R. v.
Sherratt.  That article provides the only real cause for concern
in this case.  The long passage of time between its publication
and the trial (almost two years), however, provided an adequate
antidote against any realistic possibility of prejudice to the
appellant flowing from the publication of the article.  Standing
alone, as I think it did here, the article did not require that
the appellant be allowed to challenge for cause.  It was open to
the trial judge to conclude on the entirety of the evidence
placed before him that as of the date of trial, there was no
realistic possibility that prospective jurors would be prejudiced
by the pre-trial publicity.
[37] Counsel for the appellant also argued that the newspaper
coverage implied that the appellant was guilty of murdering his
former wife.  Certainly, none of the articles advanced that
opinion expressly, nor do I think it was implied in any of the
articles.  The articles identified the appellant as the
deceased&#146;s husband and they also repeatedly referred to the case
as one involving domestic violence.  It must, however, be borne
in mind that it was everyone&#146;s position at trial that this was a
case of domestic violence in the sense that Ms. Murray&#146;s death
was directly linked to her ongoing custody dispute with the
appellant.  Any jury was selected to hear this case was going to
hear much about the domestic background to this homicide.  I
cannot accept that prospective jurors would be prejudiced against
the appellant by dated newspaper reports which referred to the
domestic nature of the homicide.  Even if those reports lived on
in some part of a prospective juror&#146;s distant memory, it is
unrealistic to suggest that a juror hearing the evidence to be
adduced in this case would harken back to those reports and be
prejudiced by them in determining his or her verdict.
[38] The trial judge did not err in refusing to allow counsel to
challenge for cause on the basis of pre-trial publicity.</pre>
    <pre>The admissibility of statements made by the deceased</pre>
    <pre>[39]  The  trial judge was asked to rule on the admissibility  of
evidence  of several statements made by the deceased.  The  Crown
argued  that  some were admissible as evidence of the  deceased&#146;s
state  of  mind,  which was in turn admissible as  circumstantial
evidence of facts in issue.  The Crown also argued that  some  of
the  deceased&#146;s statements were admissible for the truth of their
contents  under  the  principled exception to  the  hearsay  rule
developed  in cases like R. v. Smith (1992), 75 C.C.C.  (3d)  257
(S.C.C.).   As with his ruling on the challenge for cause  issue,
the  trial judge delivered careful and thoughtful reasons on  the
admissibility of the evidence tendered by the Crown.  He admitted
some  of  the  statements  allegedly made  by  the  deceased  and
excluded others.
[40] On appeal, counsel does not challenge the admissibility of
the statements that the trial judge held were admissible as
evidence of the deceased&#146;s state of mind.  I will not, therefore,
summarize that evidence.  The appellant does submit, however,
that the trial judge erred in admitting statements made by the
deceased for their truth as exceptions to the rule against
hearsay evidence.  It is the appellant&#146;s submission that the
statements did not have sufficient indicia of reliability to
warrant their admissibility.
[41] The contested statements came from three sources:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  The  deceased&#146;s  testimony at her  trial  on  a  charge  of
  threatening her son John in May 1993.  In cross-examination, the
  deceased testified that she was threatened by the appellant at a
  donut shop on January 31, 1993 and again outside a drug store on
  February 5, 1993.  The trial judge allowed the Crown to read the
  relevant parts of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior testimony to the jury.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  A friend of the deceased testified that the deceased told
  her on January 31, 1993 about the threat at the donut shop.
  According to this witness, the deceased said that she believed
  that the threat was genuine.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The deceased&#146;s lawyer in the family law proceedings
  testified that she spoke with the deceased on February 5, 1993
  and the deceased told her about the February 5th threat.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[42] The argument in this court centered on the admissibility  of
the   deceased&#146;s  testimony  at  her  previous  trial.   In  that
testimony, the deceased indicated that she met with the appellant
at  a donut shop on January 31st to discuss custody matters.  She
said  that he had appeared conciliatory in arranging the meeting,
but when the meeting occurred he had a totally different attitude
and  that  he  &#147;threatened to kill me.&#148;  In  her  testimony,  the
deceased also described a chance meeting of the appellant outside
a pharmacy on February 5, 1993.  He asked her if she was going to
try  to  get  custody of the children and she said that  she  was
going  to  do  so but would do so through the courts.   She  then
testified:
          </pre>
    <pre>    He [the appellant] grabbed Johnny by the scruff of his neck
    with his coat, and he held him up to me and he said, tell your
    mother what you think of her, and he said, if you get custody of
    these kids, you&#146;ll be dead.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  The  principled approach to hearsay evidence has  been  the
subject of several decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada.   In
R. v. Hawkins (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 155, the court said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Under this reformed framework, a hearsay statement will be
    admissible for the truth of its contents if it meets the separate
    requirements of &#147;necessity&#148; and &#147;reliability.&#148;  These two
    requirements serve to minimize the evidentiary dangers normally
    associated with the evidence of an out-of-court declarant, namely
    the absence of an oath or affirmation, the inability of the trier
    of fact to assess the demeanour of the declarant, and the lack of
    contemporaneous cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  After pointing out that necessity and reliability  must  be
assessed  in the context of the circumstances of each  case,  the
court went on to describe the reliability inquiry in these terms,
at p. 157:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The criterion of reliability is concerned with threshold
    reliability, not ultimate reliability.  The function of the trial
    judge is limited to determining whether the particular hearsay
    statement exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability so as to
    afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the
    truth of the statement.  More specifically, the judge must
    identify the specific hearsay dangers raised by the statement and
    then determine whether the facts surrounding the utterance of the
    statement offer sufficient circumstantial guarantees of
    trustworthiness to compensate for those dangers.  The ultimate
    reliability of the statement, and the weight to be attached to
    it, remain determinations for the trier of fact.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  In  Hawkins, the court ultimately concluded  that  evidence
given by a witness at a preliminary inquiry into the very charges
faced  by  the  accused  at  trial was sufficiently  reliable  to
warrant  its  admission  under the principled  exception  to  the
hearsay  rule.   The  court specifically  declined  to  determine
whether  testimony  given  at a prior  proceeding  other  than  a
preliminary  inquiry into the charges could meet the  reliability
criterion (pp.160-61).
[46] Ms. Murray was obviously not available to testify at the
appellant&#146;s trial.  Consequently, her previous testimony
concerning the threats made against her by the appellant met the
necessity criterion.
[47] In holding that the evidence also met the reliability
requirement, the trial judge referred to the following:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>the evidence was given under oath;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>an accurate record of her evidence was available;
the evidence was tested by cross-examination in the presence
of the accused albeit not by counsel for the accused;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>some of the assertions in the deceased&#146;s testimony could be
&#147;confirmed by other evidence&#148;;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>while the issues on the previous proceeding were not
identical to those on the appellant&#146;s murder trial, the events
that were the subject of the deceased&#146;s evidence were the same
events that were relevant in the murder proceeding.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[48] In deciding to admit Ms. Murray&#146;s prior testimony, the trial
judge  referred to Ms. Murray&#146;s motives to testify  falsely.   He
decided,  however, that those motives were not such as to  render
the  evidence  unreliable  for the purposes  of  determining  its
admissibility  under  the principled of  exception  to  the  rule
against hearsay.
[49] In reviewing a trial judge&#146;s decision to admit evidence
under the principled exception to the hearsay rule, this court,
absent manifest error, must accept the findings of fact made by
the trial judge on which the ruling is predicated.  The court
must, however, apply a correctness standard to the ultimate
question of whether the trial judge properly applied the criteria
relevant to the admissibility of the evidence to the facts as
found by the trial judge:  R. v. Hawkins, supra, at 160.
[50] With respect to the trial judge, whose reasons demonstrate a
careful consideration of the admissibility of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior
testimony, I cannot agree with his ruling.  I think he erred in
using confirmatory evidence from other witnesses to bolster the
reliability of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior testimony.  While there is some
authority to support that approach, eg. R. v. Khan (1990), 59
C.C.C. (3d) 92 at 106 (S.C.C.), more recent authority is to the
contrary:  R. v. Hawkins, supra, at 160;  R. v. Smith, supra, at
270;  R. v. Conway (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 414 (Ont.
C.A.);  R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 509-510 (Ont.
C.A.).
[51] The reliability inquiry, when made in the context of
determining the admissibility of a hearsay statement, looks to
those factors surrounding the making of the statement which tend
to diminish the risks associated with the admission of out-of-
court statements.  Evidence from other witnesses which is
consistent with the substance of an out-of-court statement is not
a circumstance surrounding the making of that statement and
cannot generally be seen as diminishing the risks associated with
the admission of hearsay evidence.1  If, however, the
circumstances of the taking of the statement provide sufficient
indicia of reliability to admit the statement, then the evidence
from the other witnesses can certainly be considered by the trier
of fact in determining the ultimate reliability of the out-of-
court statement.
[52] Even if the trial judge had not looked to the evidence of
other witnesses in considering the admissibility of Ms. Murray&#146;s
prior testimony, I would still hold that it should not have been
admitted.  Her testimony was not subject to cross-examination by
the appellant or his counsel.  I do not think that cross-
examination by Crown counsel provides an adequate substitute for
cross-examination by the appellant.  This is particularly so
where the cross-examination by Crown counsel occurs in the
context of a trial involving an entirely different allegation.
The Crown&#146;s concerns in prosecuting Ms. Murray on the charge of
threatening her son would be very different from the appellant&#146;s
concerns were he to have had the opportunity to cross-examine her
on the threats allegedly made by him.  Furthermore, Ms. Murray&#146;s
evidence of the threats the appellant made against her was
collateral to the main issue in her trial.  It does not appear
that she was even questioned on these threats during her
examination-in-chief.  She gave the evidence for the first time
during cross-examination.
[53] Ms. Murray&#146;s motives to testify falsely at her trial should
also have been given more weight in determining the admissibility
of her prior testimony.  The absence of any motive to fabricate
can buttress the reliability of an out-of-court statement:  R. v.
Khan, supra, at 106;  R. v. Tat, supra, at 512.  Similarly, the
existence of a strong motive to testify falsely can undermine the
reliability of an out-of-court statement.  Ms. Murray had two
motives to testify falsely about threats made by the appellant.
Firstly, she was attempting to secure an acquittal on the
threatening charge and it was in her interest to throw blame on
her accuser.  Secondly, and I think more importantly, she was
engaged in a bitter custody dispute with the appellant.  It would
serve her purposes in that dispute to paint as black a picture as
she could of the appellant.  Given those motives, I would think
that it would be very hard for a trier of fact to make any kind
of informed assessment of the truth of Ms. Murray&#146;s allegations
absent any cross-examination of her by the target of those
allegations.
[54] The unavailability of Ms. Murray for cross-examination was
also an important factor which weighed against the admissibility
of her statement.  In Hawkins, supra, the court put some emphasis
on the fact that the witness who made the out-of-court statement
was available to testify if the accused chose to call her as a
witness.  The appellant, of course, had no such option in this
case.
[55] When the factors relevant to the reliability of Ms. Murray&#146;s
previous testimony are assessed, there is little other than the
fact that the testimony was given under oath to support its
inherent reliability.  There are several factors, however, which
undermine the reliability of that testimony.  The evidence of Ms.
Murray&#146;s prior testimony should not have been admitted.
[56] The admissibility of the testimony of Ms. Murray&#146;s friend
and her lawyer that Ms. Murray had told them about the threats
made by the appellant stands on weaker ground than Ms. Murray&#146;s
testimony.  There were virtually no indicia of reliability to be
found in the circumstances surrounding the making of those
statements.  Indeed, I do not understand the Crown to argue that
the statements of the friend or the lawyer should have been
admitted if the prior testimony of Ms. Murray was excluded.  I
think that the evidence of the friend and the lawyer should have
been excluded.  I will consider the effect of this error on the
verdict after I address the third ground of appeal advanced on
behalf of the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s failure to give a limiting instruction as to
the evidence of the threats made by the appellant against Ms.
Murray.</pre>
    <pre>[57]  Counsel for the appellant submits that the evidence of  the
threats  made  by  the appellant against Ms. Murray  amounted  to
evidence  of  bad  character.  He submits that  the  trial  judge
should  have  told the jury that they could not infer  from  that
evidence  that the appellant was a violent person and, therefore,
had  murdered Ms. Murray.  The appellant submits that  the  usual
limiting  instruction given when evidence of prior  bad  acts  is
adduced  was necessary even though the prior bad acts constituted
threats against the deceased.
[58] In oral argument, counsel for the appellant, very much to
his credit, drew the court&#146;s attention to R. v. Jackson (1980),
57 C.C.C. (2d) 154 (Ont. C.A.). Jackson is directly against the
appellant.  In Jackson, the accused was charged with murdering
his wife.  The Crown led evidence from the deceased&#146;s mother of
two occasions on which Jackson had threatened to kill the
deceased.  Martin J.A., for the court, held that the evidence was
properly admitted as evidence of motive.  He further held, at p.
168:
          </pre>
    <pre>    We are also of the view that where evidence of threats
    against the victim [emphasis in the original] are admissible on
    the issue of motive, there is no requirement that the trial judge
    should direct the jury that they are not to infer from the
    threats that the accused is a person who, from his criminal
    character or conduct, is likely to have committed the crime with
    which he is charged.  Evidence of motive is a circumstance to be
    considered along with all the other circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[59] I agree with the view expressed in Jackson.  The evidence of
the  threats made by the appellant was evidence of motive  which,
in  turn,  constituted circumstantial evidence  of  identity  and
intent.   I  see  no  reason to warn the jury against  using  the
evidence to infer propensity and hence to infer that the  accused
committed  the crime when the more direct and powerful  inference
to  be  drawn from that evidence is that the accused had a motive
to kill Ms. Murray.  The trial judge properly instructed the jury
as  to  how  they  could  use evidence of motive.   The  limiting
instruction normally given when evidence of prior bad acts by the
accused  is  placed before the jury would make no  sense  in  the
context  of evidence of motive.  An instruction like that  called
for by the appellant could only serve to confuse the jury.</pre>
    <pre>The application of the proviso</pre>
    <pre>[60]  Having  concluded  that the trial judge  erred  in  law  in
admitting  the prior testimony of the deceased and her statements
to  her friend and her lawyer, I must determine whether the Crown
has established that those errors did not result in a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The harmless error standard set
by  s.  686(1)(b)(iii) is a high one.  The Crown must  show  that
there  is  no reasonable possibility that the verdict would  have
been  different had the error in law not been made:  R. v.  Bevan
(1993),  82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 at 328-330 (S.C.C.);  R. v.  S.(P.L.)
(1991),  64  C.C.C.  (3d)  193 at 200 (S.C.C.).   In  determining
whether  the  Crown has met that standard, it is  appropriate  to
consider facts found by the jury as long as those facts were  not
tainted  by  the  legal  errors made at trial:   R.  v.  Haughton
(1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 99 at 107 (S.C.C.).
[61] The appellant argues that the admission of the threats made
to Ms. Murray was a serious prejudicial error.  Counsel points
out that there was no other evidence of any direct threats
passing between the appellant and the deceased, although he
acknowledges there was an abundance of evidence of threats
against Ms. Murray made by the appellant to third parties.  He
submits that in admitting the evidence, the trial judge
recognized its significant probative value.  He argues that the
Crown cannot now successfully suggest that the evidence did not
have the probative value which the Crown relied on in urging its
admissibility upon the trial judge.
[62] The evidence supporting the Crown&#146;s contention that the
appellant fired all three shots that struck Ms. Murray was quite
simply overwhelming.  The only evidence to the contrary came from
the appellant.  His version of the events is incredible.  It
defies belief that the appellant could in the &#147;split second&#148;
between the first and second shots take the gun from Troy, decide
that Ms. Murray was dead, decide to protect his son by firing two
more shots into Ms. Murray and then fire those shots.  This
evidence is made even more incredible in light of the appellant&#146;s
assertion that he had no idea that Troy had a gun and no
expectation that Troy would shoot Ms. Murray as she was leaving
the donut shop.
[63] No jury, acting reasonably on this evidence, could have any
doubt that the appellant fired all three fatal shots.  Once the
jury reached that conclusion, as I think it inevitably would
have, there could be no doubt in the circumstances of this case
that the appellant intended the obvious and inevitable result of
his actions &#150; the death of Ms. Murray.  Leaving aside the
improperly admitted evidence of threats made to Ms. Murray, I
have no doubt that on any reasonable view of the evidence, a jury
would have concluded that Ms. Murray was murdered and the
appellant was the murderer.
[64] The evidence in support of the Crown&#146;s case that the murder
was a planned and deliberate one was also formidable.  The trial
judge instructed the jury that they could consider the following
evidence on the question of planning and deliberation:
</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Troy&#146;s evidence of the formulation of the plan and its
  execution;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Sharon Merz&#146;s evidence of the conversations with her former
  husband and in particular the conversation at around 10:30 p.m.
  that night in which he indicated he was &#147;thinking of doing it&#148;;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  threats made against Ms. Murray by the appellant to Mr.
  Brunet, a farm hand, a few days before April 7th;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the evidence of the children as to other plans formulated by
  the appellant to kill Ms. Murray;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the appellant&#146;s attendance at Ms. Murray&#146;s home on the
  afternoon of the day of the murder.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[65]  In  the  course of reviewing the evidence of  planning  and
deliberation,  the  trial  judge also  reviewed  the  appellant&#146;s
evidence and his position with respect to the evidence relied  on
by  the  Crown in support of its contention that the  murder  was
planned  and deliberate.  The trial judge&#146;s instructions on  this
evidence were extensive and well balanced.</pre>
    <pre>[66]  In reviewing the evidence which was relevant to the  issues
of  planning and deliberation, the trial judge did not direct the
jury  to  the  evidence of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior  testimony  or  the
threats  allegedly made on January 31st  and April 5,  1993.   He
did, however, review the evidence of those threats in some detail
in his instructions.  After doing so, he told the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If you find that some or all of those remarks
          were  made,  I want  you  to  understand  the
          limited use that can  be made of  them.  They
          are not evidence of planning and deliberation.
          They are not direct evidence of  intention to
          kill on the night of April 7, 1993.
          </pre>
    <pre>          They  may  be  of  assistance  to you only in
          determining  whether it is more  likely  that
          the  accused had the required intent on April
          7,  1993.   You may be of the view that  they
          show   a   consistency  of  hostile  attitude
          towards  Brenda such that it assists  you  in
          determining  whether  he  had  the   required
          intent  on the night in question.  As I  say,
          they may have that use. It is for you to say.
          They  may only be used, even in that  limited
          way,  if you are satisfied that that  is  the
          only  reasonable inference to be  drawn  from
          those  remarks, if indeed you find they  were
          made.</pre>
    <pre>[67] As I read the instructions, the trial judge did not tell the
jury  that  Ms.  Murray&#146;s prior testimony was admissible  on  the
question of whether the appellant had planned and deliberated the
murder.   Instead,  he told the jury that the evidence  could  be
considered only on the question of the appellant&#146;s intent.
[68] The improper admission of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior testimony had
no impact on the jury&#146;s determination that the murder was planned
and deliberate.  As indicated above, I am satisfied that entirely
apart from the evidence of threats to Ms. Murray on January 31st
and February 5, 1993, a reasonable jury would inevitably have
concluded that the appellant shot and killed Ms. Murray and that
he intended to do so.  Consequently, I am satisfied that the
admission of Ms. Murray&#146;s prior testimony and the evidence of her
friend and her lawyer caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                  V.</pre>
    <pre>[69] I would dismiss the appeal.
