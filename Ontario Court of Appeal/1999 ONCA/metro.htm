    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of O&#146;Brien, Rosenberg and Campbell
JJ. dated August 5, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>KREVER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is brought, with leave, from a decision of the
Divisional Court by the appellant boards, the respondent board
and the intervener associations. In that decision, the majority
held that the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (the
OMERS Board) committed a jurisdictional error in qualifying the
exercise by the appellant boards</pre>
    <pre>(the Employers) of various options concerning the disposition of
certain excess pension funds by obtaining the consent of the
intervener associations (the collective bargaining agents).  The
Employees&#146; appeal is limited to the issue whether the Divisional
Court erred when, in remitting the matter to the OMERS Board, it
permitted that Board to require the Employers and the collective
bargaining agents to engage in negotiations as a preliminary step
to the attempt by the OMERS Board to reach agreement with the
Employers with respect to the disposition of the excess pension
funds.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The applicants before the Divisional Court are various
police services boards and municipalities which, as the
Employers, employ police officers and fire fighters.  The
respondent in the Divisional Court, the OMERS Board, administers
and manages a fund to which pension funds were contributed.  The
Board is a statutory board vested with the authority and
obligation to manage and administer the Ontario Municipal
Employees Retirement System by the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement Systems Act, R.S.O. 1990, C.O.29.  The interveners are
police associations that represent police officers (the
employees) for the purpose of collective bargaining.
[3]  The historical and immediately relevant facts are fully
recited in the dissenting reasons for judgment of Rosenberg J.
For present purposes, it is sufficient to refer to the facts in
the summary that follows.  The purpose of the fund administered
by the OMERS Board is to finance pension benefits for members of
OMERS, including the employees.  OMERS offers two categories of
pension benefits to its members, namely, basic benefits, which
are specified in the OMERS Regulations and supplementary
benefits, which employees may receive if their employers enter
into supplementary agreements with OMERS under the Regulations.
At various times the Employers entered into various Supplementary
Agreements with OMERS for a Supplementary Benefit for the
employees.  This Supplementary Benefit enabled employees who were
within ten years of normal retirement age to retire on full
pension after thirty years of service.
[4]  For the most part, the Supplementary Agreements arose
through collective bargaining either as a result of negotiation
or arbitration awards.  The excess money involved in this
litigation originated with contributions made under Supplementary
Agreements only by the Employers.  Although, as required by the
Act, these contributions were deposited into the OMERS fund and
commingled with money from other employees and employers, they
were accounted for separately.  The Employers were responsible
for any unfunded liability including experience deficiencies.
[5]  Amendments to the OMERS Regulation were made in 1983.
Changes to the OMERS basic plan reduced liabilities under the
Supplementary Agreements with the result that excess employee
contributions were returned to or credited to the benefit of
employees.  Where the entire contribution had been made by the
Employers, the Employers received a refund of the surplus.
[6]  Again in January 1987, changes to the OMERS plan reduced the
liabilities under the Supplementary Agreements bringing about
excess funds in many of the accounts.  The OMERS Board wrote to
the Employers informing them of the excess and giving four
options for its use.  Although, on this occasion, the employees
were notified, their consent was not required before the
Employers could select an option.
[7]  The current dispute arises out of an amendment made by
Ontario Regulation 775/91, made under the OMERS Act, by which the
Supplementary Benefit became part of the basic benefits.  Both
the Employers and the employees contribute equally to the basic
plan.  The moneys that had been contributed under the
Supplementary Agreements, which are the moneys in issue, are no
longer necessary to fund the benefits but remain in the fund and
amount to more than $140 million.
[8]  It is common ground that fundamental to the resolution of
the dispute is the language of Clause 7 of the Supplementary
Agreements which reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subject to the provisions of applicable federal and
          provincial rules and regulations, upon determination at any date
          by actuarial valuation that the value of the assets of the
          [Supplementary] Plan is in excess of the amount then required to
          satisfy, or to provide for, all plan liabilities with respect to
          the covered members and their beneficiaries accrued to such date,
          such excess may be used to reduce the employer portion of plan
          contributions otherwise required under the [Supplementary] Plan
          or may be used or applied in such other manner as the Board and
          the employer shall mutually agree.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The impugned decision of the OMERS Board was that the excess
portion of the fund should remain in the fund and that the
Employers could choose from five options for the treatment of the
excess but only with the agreement of the employees&#146; collective
bargaining agents.  The optional uses of the money made available
to the Employers were the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1)   to offset other costs, such as the costs of Type I
          Supplementary Optional Service or NRA Conversion;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2)   to offset the basic plan
          contributions of members (i.e. employees&#146;
          contribution holiday);
          </pre>
    <pre>               3)   to offset the basic plan
          contributions of employers (i.e. employers&#146;
          contribution holiday);
          </pre>
    <pre>               4)   to be left on account with OMERS to
          pay for any future permanent partial
          disability benefits (if this was part of the
          particular Type III Agreement);
          </pre>
    <pre>               5)   to be left on account in
          anticipation of possible OMERS supplementary
          benefits, yet to be introduced (eg.
          anticipated downsizing, early retirement or
          other benefits).</pre>
    <pre>[10] In challenging the decision of the OMERS Board in the
Divisional Court, the Employers submitted that they were entitled
to receive a refund of the money in issue on the basis of
contract, implied contract or resulting trust or that the money
should be applied by way of an Employers&#146; contribution holiday
and that the OMERS Board lacked the jurisdiction to require the
employees&#146; consent to the available dispositions.
[11] The Divisional Court was unanimous in holding that the
appropriate standard of review was qualified correctness and that
the moneys in issue were subject to the legislative scheme and
the Supplementary Agreements and were not the subject of any
express, implied or resulting trust in favour of the Employers
alone.  The majority (Campbell and O&#146;Brien JJ.) held that the
decision of the OMERS Board was incorrect because it was beyond
the power of the Board &#147;to require bargaining unit approval
before OMERS makes its own agreement with the employer under cl.
7 of the agreement.&#148;  They held that the Board had no right to
fetter its discretion by putting entirely out of its hands the
process of reaching an agreement with the employer and that its
obligation to attempt, in good faith, to reach direct agreement
with the employers was an obligation that it could not decline or
delegate to the &#147;bargaining units.&#148;  Accordingly, the majority
set aside the condition requiring approval and remitted the
matter to the OMERS Board with the observation that it was open
to the Board to require employers and the &#147;bargaining units&#148; to
engage in negotiations as a preliminary step to its attempt to
reach agreement with the employers.  I assume that in referring
throughout to &#147;bargaining units&#148; the majority meant to say
&#147;bargaining agents.&#148;  In dissenting, Rosenberg J. held that s. 8
of the Regulations under the Pension Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c.P.8, required the consent of the employees or their bargaining
agents.  &#147;The provision for agreement&#148;, he held, &#147;is therefore
merely a recitation of the law and is not beyond the powers of
OMERS.&#148;
[12] I agree with the result arrived at by Rosenberg J. in his
dissenting decision but my judgment does not rest on the
provisions of the Pensions Benefits Act or the regulations made
under it.  In my view of the matter, it is not necessary to
determine in this case whether these provisions apply to excess
funds in one account, as opposed to a surplus in the fund.
[13] The first issue to be decided is that of the applicable
standard of review for the decision of the OMERS Board.  It is to
be observed that the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement
Systems Act contains no privative clause.  It also contains no
right of appeal from decisions of the OMERS Board.  The purpose
of the Act is to make provision for pensions for employees after
their retirement.  Although the statutory board has a limited
role in the creation of policy, it has much experience in
managing and administering very large pension funds, justifying
the recognition of expertise in this field.  Another factor, of
particular significance in the circumstances, is that the
governing clause of the supplementary agreements confers a
discretion on the OMERS Board, a fact that is common ground among
the parties.  For convenience, I again reproduce clause 7:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subject to the provisions of applicable federal and
          provincial rules and regulations, upon determination at any date
          by actuarial valuation that the value of the assets of the
          [Supplementary] Plan is in excess of the amount then required to
          satisfy, or to provide for, all plan liabilities with respect to
          the covered members and their beneficiaries accrued to such date,
          such excess may be used to reduce the employer portion of plan
          contributions otherwise required under the [Supplementary] Plan
          or may be used or applied in such other manner as the Board and
          the employer shall mutually agree. [emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[14] The Divisional Court, it will be recalled, held that the
decision of the OMERS Board was to be reviewed on the basis of a
correctness test.  It is my opinion that, in so holding, it
erred.  In its recent judgment (July 9, 1999) in Baker v. Canada
(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the Supreme Court of
Canada revisited the subject of standard of review in judicial
review of administrative decision-making under the heading, &#147;The
Approach to Review of Discretionary Decision-Making&#148; and, in so
doing, has given welcome guidance in cases of this kind.  Writing
for a unanimous court L&#146;Heureux-Dubé said that, in approaching
judicial review of administrative discretion, one must take into
account this well-known &#147;pragmatic and functional&#148; approach to
judicial review just articulated in U.E.S., Local 298 v.
Bibeault, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048.

</pre>
    <pre>[15] In paragraph 53 of her reasons she said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Administrative law has traditionally approached the review
          of decisions classified as discretionary separately from those
          seen as involving the interpretation of rules of law.  The rule
          has been that decisions classified as discretionary may only be
          reviewed on limited grounds such as the bad faith of decision-
          makers, the exercise of discretion for an improper purpose, and
          the use of irrelevant considerations:  see, for example, Maple
          Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Government of Canada, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2, at
          pp. 7-8;  Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994]
          1 S.C.R. 231.  A general doctrine of &#147;unreasonableness&#148; has also
          sometimes been applied to discretionary decisions:  Associated
          Provincial Picture Houses, Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation, [1948]
          1 K.B. 223 (C.A.).  In my opinion, these doctrines incorporate
          two central ideas &#150; that discretionary decisions, like all other
          administrative decisions, must be made within the bounds of the
          jurisdiction conferred by the statute, but that considerable
          deference will be given to decision-makers by courts in reviewing
          the exercise of that discretion and determining the scope of the
          decision-maker&#146;s jurisdiction.  These doctrines recognize that it
          is the intention of a legislature, when using statutory language
          that confers broad choices on administrative agencies, that
          courts should not lightly interfere with such decisions, and
          should give considerable respect to decision-makers when
          reviewing the manner in which discretion was exercised.  However,
          discretion must still be exercised in a manner that is within a
          reasonable interpretation of the margin of manouevre contemplated
          by the legislature, in accordance with the principles of the rule
          of law (Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121), in line with
          general principles of administrative law governing the exercise
          of discretion, and consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights
          and Freedoms (Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1
          S.C.R. 1038).
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[16] She added the following at paragraph 56:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Incorporating judicial review of decisions that involve
          considerable discretion into pragmatic and functional analysis
          for errors of law should not be seen as reducing the level of
          deference given to decisions of a highly discretionary nature.
          In fact, deferential standards of review may give substantial
          leeway to the discretionary decision-maker in determining the
          &#147;proper purposes&#148; or &#147;relevant considerations&#148; involved in making
          a given determination.  The pragmatic and functional approach can
          take into account the fact that the more discretion that is left
          to a decision-maker, the more reluctant courts should be to
          interfere with the manner in which decision-makers have made
          choices among various options.  However, though discretionary
          decisions will generally be given considerable respect, that
          discretion must be exercised in accordance with the boundaries
          imposed in the statute, the principles of the rule of law, the
          principles of administrative law, the fundamental values of
          Canadian society, and the principles of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[17] L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. then proceeded to examine the factors
involved in the pragmatic and functional approach which she
listed as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  the presence or absence of a privative clause;</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  the expertise of the decision-maker;</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  the purpose of the provision in particular and of the
Act as a whole;  and</pre>
    <pre>     (4)  the nature of the problem in question, especially
whether its relates to determination of law or facts.</pre>
    <pre>[18] She concluded her discussion of the relevant factors as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               These factors must be balanced to arrive at the appropriate
          standard of review.  I conclude that considerable deference
          should be accorded to immigration officers exercising the powers
          conferred by the legislation, given the fact-specific nature of
          the inquiry, its role within the statutory scheme as an
          exception, the fact that the decision-maker is the Minister, and
          the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language.
          Yet the absence of a privative clause, the explicit contemplation
          of judicial review by the Federal Court &#150; Trial Division and the
          Federal Court of Appeal in certain circumstances, and the
          individual rather than polycentric nature of the decision, also
          suggest that the standard should not be as deferential as &#147;patent
          unreasonableness&#148;.  I conclude, weighing all these factors, that
          the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Earlier in these reasons, I described the enumerated factors
as they relate to the circumstances in this appeal.  Applying the
analysis in the Baker case, they lead me to the conclusion that
the standard of review is neither that of correctness nor patent
unreasonableness but rather the intermediate standard of
reasonableness simpliciter.
[20] With that standard of review in mind, the question to be
determined is whether the decision of the OMERS Board is
reasonable.  I preface my answer to that question by expressing
agreement with the Divisional Court&#146;s conclusion that the money
in question is not the subject of any express, implied or
resulting trust in favour of the Employers alone.  Nor is there
any justification for implying any contractual obligation to pay
the funds to the Employers.  On the other hand, the majority&#146;s
description of the decision of the OMERS Board as a fettering of
its discretion and a delegation of its obligation is, in my
opinion, a mischaracterization of that decision.
[21] The Employers agree that the benefit provided through the
supplementary agreements arose almost entirely through collective
bargaining.  I agree with Rosenberg J. that, as a result, it
should be assumed that &#147;the cost of these benefits was considered
in the overall compensation package at the time of
implementation.&#148;  The benefits may reasonably be thought of as
present wages postponed or deferred.  Thus to say that the
employees have entirely no interest in the application of these
funds would be unrealistic.  What the Board&#146;s decision amounts to
is a statement that it is prepared to agree to any of the options
which, given to employees&#146; interest in the proceeds, it knows is
acceptable to the employees.  That this is not a fettering of
discretion or a delegation of responsibility is reflected by the
position of the Board before this court on the question of the
disposition of the funds if it should turn out that none of the
options finds favour with the employees.  In that eventuality,
the Board says, in its factum, the Employers &#147;will be asked to
agree that the monies in issue be used to benefit both the
employees and the employers equally, subject to applicable tax
and pension laws.&#148;  This resolution seems reasonable to me and I
would so describe the Board&#146;s decision which, therefore, is
entitled to judicial deference.
[22]
I would dismiss the appeal of the Employers, allow the appeals of
the OMERS Board and the Interveners, set aside the judgment of
the Divisional Court and dismiss the application to it of the
Employers.  The appellants, the OMERS Board and the Interveners
are entitled to the costs before the Divisional Court and this
court as of one appeal, including the costs of the motion for
leave to appeal.
