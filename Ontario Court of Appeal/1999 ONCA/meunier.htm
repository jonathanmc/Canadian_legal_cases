    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice J. S. Spence dated
January 18, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants were vendors under an agreement of purchase
and sale of commercial and residential property (the
&quot;agreement&quot;). The respondents are solicitors who acted for the
appellants with respect to the agreement. The purchaser under the
agreement refused to close the transaction and the appellants
ultimately sold the property to others at a loss. The appellants
brought this action against the respondents alleging negligence.
[2]  The trial judge held that the respondents&#146; conduct fell
below the appropriate standard of care but that it was the
purchaser&#146;s breach of the agreement in refusing to close the
transaction that caused the loss to the appellants. The trial
judge therefore dismissed the appellants&#146; action against the
respondents and granted judgment against the corporate purchaser
in a separate action tried at the same time. The personal action
against the principal of the corporate purchaser was dismissed.
[3]  It was common ground between the parties at trial that the
charter of the corporate purchaser was revived solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and that the corporation had no
resources to meet any judgment. No appeal is taken from the
judgment against the corporate purchaser or its principal and
they are not represented on this appeal.
[4]  The appellants appeal from the dismissal of their action
against the respondents. They submit that the trial judge erred
in finding that there was no causal connection between the
solicitors&#146; breach of duty and the loss that the appellants
suffered.
[5]  The appellants agree with the trial judge&#146;s reasoning on
liability that, if the purchaser breached the agreement by
refusing to close the transaction, it necessarily follows that
the appellants have suffered no damages as a result of any action
on the part of the respondents. Even if the solicitors&#146; conduct
fell below the appropriate standard of care, the loss suffered by
the appellants would be caused by the purchaser's breach of the
agreement and not the negligence of the law firm. If, on the
other hand, the appellants were in breach of the agreement and
that breach was caused by the negligence of the respondents then
the respondents would be liable.
[6]  The trial judge held that the respondents acted below the
appropriate standard of care by failing to put the appellants in
a position to close the transaction in that: a) they failed to
prepare an affidavit as to residence as required under the Income
Tax Act; and b) they failed to obtain the purchaser&#146;s covenant to
provide an assignment of rents. The failure to prepare the
affidavit was quickly remedied and is not in issue on this
appeal. The appeal turns on whether the respondents' failure to
obtain the purchaser's covenant to provide an assignment of rents
constitutes conduct falling below the appropriate standard of
care.
[7]  At all material times, it was clear to the appellants and to
the respondents that the appellants were not in a position to
discharge the encumbrances on the property and that they had to
find a purchaser of the first vendor-take-back mortgage which was
to be given under the agreement. The respondents therefore caused
the appellants to include the following clause in the agreement:
          </pre>
    <pre>               5. (a)    The within Agreement of Purchase and Sale is
          conditional upon the Vendors arranging a satisfactory Agreement
          to Purchase the first mortgage referred to above.  Unless the
          Vendors waive this condition by notice in writing delivered to
          the Purchaser, not later than 12:00 noon, Friday, October 9th,
          1981 this Agreement of Purchase and Sale shall be null and void
          and all monies paid by the Purchaser shall be returned forthwith
          to it without deduction and neither party shall have any claims
          against the other in respect of this Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  As it turned out, no purchaser of the first mortgage had
been found by October 9, 1981. The appellants, acting against the
respondents&#146; advice, waived this condition. They later found a
purchaser for the mortgage, Canada Life. As a condition of the
purchase of the mortgage, Canada Life required an assignment of
rents. The purchaser ultimately refused to provide this
assignment. The trial judge held that the purchasers were not
obliged under the terms of the agreement to provide any
assignment of rents. He held, however, that the purchaser was not
allowed to rely on the requirement for an assignment of rents as
a basis for not completing the transaction because the purchaser
failed to indicate its position on this matter to the vendors&#146;
solicitors in a timely fashion.
[9]  The trial judge further held that if the appellants had not
waived clause 5(a), any offer to purchase the mortgage that they
later obtained would have been subject to the scrutiny and
approval of the purchaser and the problem which arose in this
case essentially would not have arisen.
[10] It is not necessary to decide whether the trial judge was
correct in finding that the purchaser had breached the agreement.
It is my view that the appellants&#146; waiver of clause 5(a) absolves
the respondent of any responsibility with respect to what later
transpired with the assignment of rents. While the trial judge
was in error when he found that in the absence of a waiver of
clause 5(a) any subsequent agreement would have been subject to
the scrutiny of the purchaser, he was nonetheless correct in
finding that this clause effectively protected the appellants. It
did so in the following manner.
[11] Clause 5(a) ensured that the appellants could get out of the
transaction if they did not obtain a satisfactory purchaser for
the first mortgage. Hence, had the offer to purchase the mortgage
been obtained from Canada Life before October 9, the purchaser
could have been contacted to ensure that it would agree to give
the required assignment of rents. If it did not agree, the
transaction would have been aborted. Had it agreed, no problem
would have arisen. By waiving clause 5(a), the appellants no
longer had the option to get out of the transaction. It follows
that the appellants assumed the risk that the purchaser might
refuse to meet conditions imposed by any purchaser of the first
mortgage and that, as a consequence, they would not be able to
remove the encumbrances against the property.  In essence, the
appellants assumed the risk for the very situation that arose.
[12] Consequently, I see no reason to interfere with the result.
[13] It is also important to note that the appellants made a
tactical decision to sue the corporate purchaser and its
principal. This action was successfully pursued to judgment. As
noted earlier, this judgment against the corporate purchaser,
which is not under appeal, effectively precludes any finding of
liability against the respondents in negligence.
[14] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
