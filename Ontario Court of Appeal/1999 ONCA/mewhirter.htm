COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)  -and-  KEVIN
               MEWHIRTER (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, WEILER and CHARRON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Glen F. Jennings, for the appellant
               Gary Trotter, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 6, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hamilton J. dated October 16, 1998
upholding the conviction by Babe J. dated April 30, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellant was found guilty under s.253(b) of the
Criminal Code of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol
concentration exceeding 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. On
appeal, the conviction was affirmed.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant now seeks leave to appeal and, if leave is
granted, appeals from that decision on a question of law alone.
In particular, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
in finding that the police officer subjectively had reasonable
grounds to believe that the appellant had consumed alcohol and
driven within the preceding two hours. The summary conviction
appeal judge, it is submitted, made a similar error.
[3]  The question of whether it was open to the trial judge to
draw the inference that the police officer had a subjective
belief is, at best, a question of mixed fact and law.
[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is refused.
