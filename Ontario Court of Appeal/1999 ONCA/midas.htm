On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Ground
                                             dated July 15, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The appellants (defendants) bring a motion under Rule 59.06(1)
for an order amending this court&#146;s order dated May 6, 1999.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The respondent (plaintiff) sued the defendants for goods sold and
delivered in connection with a franchise operation.  The
defendants acknowledged delivery and the value of the goods but
alleged misrepresentations giving rise to a defence by way of
equitable set-off.  The defendants also counterclaimed relying on
the same alleged misrepresentations.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The plaintiff brought a motion for summary judgment.  Ground J.
concluded that there were triable issues with respect to two of
the three alleged misrepresentations advanced by the defendants,
but that there was no evidence connecting the plaintiff to any
alleged misrepresentation involving the pro forma operating
statements.  He further held that the two misrepresentations
could be advanced only by way of counterclaim and not by way of
the defence of equitable set-off.  Consequently, Ground J.
granted judgment in favour of the plaintiff on its claim and
indicated that the counterclaim could proceed &#147;except &#133; in
respect of the alleged representations by the plaintiff arising
out of the pro forma operating statements regarding the
Georgetown shop.&#148;
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The defendants appealed challenging only Ground J.&#146;s
determination that the triable issues could be advanced only by
way of counterclaim and not as a defence by way of equitable set-
off.  The defendants took no issue with his finding that there
was no triable issue in respect of the pro forma operating
statements or the limit his judgment placed on the counterclaim.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>This court allowed the appeal holding that the alleged
misrepresentations which Ground J. had found raised triable
issues could be advanced either by way of counterclaim or as a
defence by way of equitable set-off.  This court set aside the
order granting summary judgment and indicated:
          </pre>
    <pre>         The trial of the action shall proceed on the sole issue of
     the defence of equitable set-off.  The counterclaim remains
     extant.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The court&#146;s brief endorsement made no reference to the alleged
misrepresentation with respect to which Ground J. had found there
to be no triable issue.  That finding was not challenged on
appeal and was not in issue before this court.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>After some negotiation the parties settled on the terms of an
order.  The preamble to that order read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               THIS APPEAL, made from a motion for summary judgment heard
          by Mr. Justice Ground of the Ontario Court (General Division) on
          July 8, 1998 and with reasons released on July 15, 1998, granting
          judgment to the respondent on its motion for summary judgment
          against the appellants for the sum of $149,199.85, inclusive of
          principal and interest thereon from October 18, 1997 to July 15,
          1998 at the rate of Royal Bank prime plus 3% without prejudice to
          the right of the appellants to proceed with the counterclaim in
          the action as it relates to limited to allegations of
          misrepresentation concerning resale value of the franchise and of
          exclusive territory for the franchise, and granting costs of the
          motion to the respondents, fixed at $4,500.00, was heard on May
          6, 1999.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The operative terms of the order set aside the summary judgment
on the claim, provided that the action would proceed only on the
defence of equitable set-off and that the defendants&#146;
counterclaim could proceed.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>Shortly after the order was agreed upon, counsel for the
appellant became aware of this court&#146;s judgment in V.K. Mason
Construction Ltd. v. Canadian General Insurance Company Group
Ltd. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 618.  On his reading of this judgment,
Ground J.&#146;s determination that there was no triable issue on the
alleged misrepresentation relating to the pro forma operating
statements could not bind the parties at trial.  Counsel seeks an
amendment to the order making it clear that all alleged
misrepresentations may be raised at trial as long as they relate
to the defence of equitable set-off or the counterclaim.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>Counsel for the respondent rejects this interpretation of V.K.
Mason, supra, and asks that the order be amended to make it clear
that with respect to the defence of equitable set-off and the
counterclaim, the defendants can raise only the two
misrepresentations which Ground J. found to raise triable issues.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The relevant part of Rule 59.06(1) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An order that &#133; requires amendment in any particular on
          which the court did not adjudicate may be amended on a motion in
          the proceedings.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The issue raised on this motion was not adjudicated upon at the
appeal because it was not raised in the notice of appeal and was
never mentioned on the argument of the appeal.  Counsel for the
defendants having become aware of authority which, in his view,
affects the order of Ground J. relating to the scope of the
counterclaim, seeks to put that part of Ground J.&#146;s judgment in
issue now for the first time.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>We do not think that Rule 59.06(1) was intended to permit counsel
to inject new issues into an appeal after an order has been made
and to rely on those issues to support an amendment to the order
of the court.  Ground J.&#146;s determination that the defendants
could not raise the alleged misrepresentation relating to the pro
forma operating statements was never an issue in this court and
the operative part of this court&#146;s order should make no reference
one way or the other to that part of the judgment of Ground J.
This court&#146;s order neither affirms nor vacates that part of his
judgment.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The order of this court dated May 6, 1999 and entered on June 29,
1999 will stand. In so holding, we make no comment on what
avenues, if any, may be open to the defendants should they wish
to place evidence of the alleged misrepresentations concerning
the pro forma operating statements before the trial court.
                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>The defendants brought this motion but both parties eventually
sought to amend the order they had agreed upon.  In those
circumstances costs of the motion should be in the cause.
                                                                 </pre>
