COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

    <pre>HEARD:         April 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Kozak J., dated March 30, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                                
                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant plead guilty to two counts of trafficking in
cocaine. The quantity of cocaine in the two counts was 13.5
ounces. There was a joint submission of a conditional sentence
which the trial judge declined to give effect to. He stated that
the amount of cocaine involved was large, that cocaine is a hard
drug and the appellant was either a large retailer or a small
wholesaler because of the quantities involved.
[2]  In rejecting the joint submission, the trial judge stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The extent of the trafficking offences in this particular
          case call for a deterrent sentence which can only be imposed by a
          term of incarceration. The integrity of the judicial system and
          the perception of the public as to the administration of justice
          would be called into question if a conditional sentence were to
          be granted in the circumstances of this case.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  It is trite law that a joint submission is not binding on
the trial judge. In this case, he gave reasons declining to give
effect to the submission and those reasons reveal no error in
principle.
[4]  Before leaving this case, we would comment that the sentence
for trafficking for this amount of cocaine would normally call
for a penitentiary term. By imposing a term of incarceration of
20 months, the trial judge gave adequate consideration to the
mitigating circumstances of the particular offence and the
offender and his plea of guilty to these particular offences.
[5]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is
dismissed.</pre>
