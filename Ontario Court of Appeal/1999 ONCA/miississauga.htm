    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice A. D. K. MacKenzie
dated January 7, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal from the judgment of MacKenzie J. involves the
proper interpretation of the City of Mississauga zoning by-law.
While the City sought various forms of relief in its application,
the only issues dealt with by the motions judge, and that are
before this court, concern the number of dwelling units in the
respondent&#146;s house at 1168 Stavebank Road and the effect on the
premises of the zoning by-law and Ontario Regulation 384/94 under
the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P.13.  For the reasons that
follow, we are of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge made these findings of fact that are not
disputed on this appeal with respect to the respondent&#146;s house at
1168 Stavebank Road
               i.   Prior to 1953, the house was converted from a single
          dwelling unit to a double dwelling unit.
               ii.  Sometime between July of 1987 (when
          the house was purchased by the respondent and
          her late husband) and November 1990, two
          additional units were added to the building.
               iii. A fifth unit, known as the &#147;loft&#148;,
          was added sometime during the summer of 1995.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The significance of the dates referred to in these findings
is the following.  The City zoning by-law did not come into force
until 1953.  At that time, s. 39 of the by-law designated the
respondent&#146;s property as R1, meaning a &#147;one-family detached
dwelling unit&#148;.  The City does not dispute that since the
building had two dwelling units at that time, this was a lawful
use.1  On November 12, 1990, the City enacted s. 1821 of the
zoning by-law.  The appellant&#146;s property comes within that
section and its designation is now &#147;R1-Section 1821&#148;.  Section
1821 sets certain &#147;performance standards&#148;, such as the minimum
total width of the side yards of the lots.  We will set out the
provisions of this section below.
[4]  The respondent has never applied for a building permit to
authorize renovation of the house into four units.  Furthermore,
she has never applied for a minor variance or amendment to the
zoning by-law.  As a result of a complaint from a neighbour, the
City began an investigation into the property and discovered the
five dwelling units.</pre>
    <pre>THE LEGISLATION</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The following parts of the City&#146;s zoning by-law require some
consideration:

               33.  Notwithstanding anything in this By-law, any large
          dwelling that was in existence on the 10th day of April, 1953,
          may be converted into 2 or more housekeeping units within the
          exterior walls that were in existence on the 10th day of April,
          1953, and in accordance with the following regulations:
               (a)  the minimum floor area of each such
               housekeeping unit in an &quot;R1&quot; zone is 102m2;
          </pre>
    <pre>          39.  In &quot;R1&quot;, &quot;R2&quot;, &quot;R3&quot;, &quot;R4&quot; and &quot;R4(12)&quot; zones:
               (1)  Any person may:
                    (a)  erect or use a one-family
                    detached dwelling on a lot;
                    </pre>
    <pre>          1821.     Notwithstanding their &quot;R1&quot; zoning, the lands delineated
          as &quot;R1 &#150; Section 1821&quot; on Schedule &quot;B&quot; of this By-law shall only
               be used in compliance with the &quot;R1&quot; zone provisions contained in
               this By-law except that:
               (1)  the minimum total width of the side yards of every lot other
                    than a corner lot shall be:
                    (a)  20% of the lot width for a one storey dwelling unit;
                    (b)  27% of the lot width for a dwelling unit exceeding one
                    storey in whole or in part; provided however that the side
                    yards shall have a minimum width of 1.8 m plus an additional 
		    0.61 m for each storey, or portion thereof, above one storey;
               (2)  notwithstanding subsection 2(19) of this By-law the maximum
                    dwelling unit height shall be:
                    (a)  9.0 m as measured from established grade to the highest
                         ridge of a sloped roof for all lots less than 22.5 m in width;
                    (b)  9.5 m as measured from established grade to the highest
                         ridge of a sloped roof for all lots equal to or greater than
                         22.5 m in width;
                    (c)  7.5 m as measured from established grade to the top of a
                         parapet of a flat roof;
               (3)  the distance between established grade and the lower edge of
                    the eaves of any dwelling unit shall not exceed 6.4 m;
               (4)  the total gross floor area of all dwelling units or parts
                    thereof on each lot shall not exceed 190 m2 plus 0.20 times the
                    lot area;
               (5)  for the purposes of this section, &quot;GROSS FLOOR AREA&quot; means
                    the aggregate of the areas of each storey measured between the
                    exterior faces of the exterior walls including the garage or any
                    part of the dwelling unit used for the parking of motor vehicles;
               (6)  notwithstanding any provision of this By-law to the contrary
                    any dwelling unit in existence on or before the day this section
                    comes into force (1990 Nov. 12), any dwelling unit for which a
                    building permit has been issued on or before the day this section
                    comes into force, or any dwelling unit for which a site
                    development plan has been approved and for which a building
                    permit application has been made on or before the day this
                    section comes into force are considered to be in compliance with
                    the zone provisions contained in this section.  [Emphasis added.]
                    
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The respondent also relied upon O.Reg. 384/94 made under the
Planning Act.  This regulation, entitled &#147;Apartments in Houses&#148;,
provides in s. 7(2) that &#147;no planning document&#148;, which would
include a zoning by-law, &#147;shall require that a residential unit
in a house containing two residential units exceed the habitable
floor area set out in&#148; a table accompanying the regulation.  The
floor area in that table is less than minimum floor area
specified in s. 33 of the zoning by-law.  The units in the
respondent&#146;s house, while not in conformity with s. 33, do meet
the requirements of s. 7(2) of the Regulation.</pre>
    <pre>THE MOTIONS JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The motions judge held that the term &#147;dwelling unit&#148; in s.
1821(6) of the zoning by-law could not be confined to a single
family dwelling.  He held that the four &#147;dwelling units&#148; in the
respondent&#146;s house as of November 12, 1990 were deemed to comply
with all of the provisions of the by-law.  The key part of the
motion judge&#146;s reasons is in the following paragraph:
               I have not been referred by counsel as to the definition of
          &#147;dwelling unit&#148; for purposes of section 1821 or, indeed, for the
          rest of the provisions of the by-law dealing with R1 uses.  In
          the result, I find that the words &#147;dwelling unit&#148; as used in
          subsection 6 of 1821 cannot be construed so as to encompass a
          &#147;one-family detached dwelling on a lot&#148; as referred to in section
          39(1)(a) of the By-law.  I further find that the four dwelling
          units in the subject dwelling unit were in situ as of the
          operative date, being the 12th of November, 1990, and, having
          been used for residential purposes at the material time, they are
          in compliance with the zoning provisions contained in section
          1821.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[8]  As to the fifth, or &#147;loft&#148;, unit, the motions judge held
that since this unit did not exist on November 12, 1990, it was
not protected by s. 1826(1).  The motions judge rejected the
respondent&#146;s argument, that this unit was protected by the
Apartments in Houses regulation.  There was no cross-appeal but,
at the hearing of the appeal, counsel, in oral argument, sought
leave to appeal from this holding under rule 61.07(3).  This rule
precludes the hearing of a cross-appeal where a respondent has
not delivered a notice of cross-appeal, except with leave of the
court hearing the appeal.  Since there was no material before the
court justifying an extension of time we refused to grant leave.</pre>
    <pre>THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Counsel for the appellant submits that the motions judge did
not properly interpret s. 1821(6).  He submits that s. 1821(6)
protects existing dwelling units only in respect of the new
requirements imposed in s. 1821(1) to (5) and does not validate
previous illegal uses of the property.
[10] Counsel for the respondent made two different arguments for
upholding the result of the motions judge&#146;s judgment.  First, he
supports the motions judge&#146;s interpretation of s. 1821(6).  In
the alternative, he argues that the combined effect of s. 33 of
the by-law and s. 7 of the Apartments in Houses regulations
allows for at least four units in the house.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>               1.   Interpretation of s. 1821 of the zoning by-law</pre>
    <pre>[11] In our view, the motions judge erred in his interpretation
of s. 1821.  His error is in the emphasized portion of the
reasons for judgment set out above.  By its terms, s. 1821(6)
deems residential units to be in compliance &#147;with the zone
provisions contained in this section&#148;.  This is consistent with
the general theory of zoning that prior legal uses not be
rendered illegal by subsequent changes in zoning, a theory also
given statutory recognition in s. 34(9) of the Planning Act.
See:  I. W. Rogers, Canadian Law of Plannning and Zoning,
(Scarborough: Carswell, 1973) §5.91 (loose leaf).  The zone
provisions set out in s. 1821 deal with such things as new
standards for side yards.  Section 1821(6) does not purport to
validate all prior illegal uses of the lands zoned &#147;R1-Section
1821&#148;.  Accordingly, subject to the respondent&#146;s alternative
argument, the appeal must succeed.
               2.   The combined effect of s. 33 of the Zoning By-law and
          s. 7 of O.Reg. 384/94</pre>
    <pre>[12] Section 33 provides that any &#147;large dwelling&#148; that was in
existence on April 10, 1953 may be converted into two or more
housekeeping units within the exterior walls that were in
existence on April 10, 1953, provided that the floor area of each
unit meets certain minimum requirements.  There is no definition
of &#147;large dwelling&#148; but the appellant concedes that the
respondent&#146;s home would fit this description.  There are a number
of reasons, however, why s. 33 has no application.  First, none
of the four units meets the minimum floor area requirements, and
so none of the four units can be permitted under s. 33.  Second,
the exterior wall in relation to at least one of the units has
been altered since 1953 and so, at most, s. 33 would authorize
only three of the four units.
[13] In our view, the Apartments in Houses regulation is of no
assistance to the respondent.  Section 7 of that regulation, in
effect, waives the minimum floor area requirements, such as those
in s. 33, for a &#147;house containing two residential units&#148;.  This
house contains four units, not two, and therefore s. 7 does not
apply.  In an ingenious submission, counsel for the respondent
argued that s. 7 applies because this is a semi-detached house.
On this theory, each half of the semi-detached house is a &#147;house
containing two residential units&#148;.  Therefore, each half of the
semi-detached house could contain two residential units for a
total of four units, provided each unit met the minimum floor
area requirements in s. 7 of the regulation.  This argument
cannot succeed.  The motions judge considered this argument in
relation to the fifth, or &#147;loft&#148;, unit.  He held that this was
not a semi-detached house and that the regulation did not apply.
We agree with his conclusion.  This was a single-family dwelling
that had been converted into four (or five) units.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[14] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and there will be a
declaration that a maximum of two residential dwelling units are
allowed at 1168 Stavebank Road, Mississauga.  MacKenzie J. made
no order for costs of the motion and we would make no order for
costs of the appeal.
