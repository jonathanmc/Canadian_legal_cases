    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Fleury J. dated September 1, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The order of Fleury J. of September 1, 1998, made on the
application of William Miller (the husband) is set aside, the
order of Forestell J. of October 3, 1997 awarding final custody
of the two children to Doris Miller (the wife) is re-instated,
the husband is ordered to return the two children to the custody
of the wife and the husband&#146;s application is dismissed with
costs.  The husband is also ordered to pay the costs of the wife
of this appeal.
[2]  The reasons for this disposition may be stated briefly.
[3]  The husband is American, the wife Canadian.  They met in
November 1989 in Canada.  Their first child, Hope, was born on
September 30, 1990 and the second, Faith, on August 4, 1995.
They were married August 22, 1993 in the United States and
separated in November 1994 at which time they were living in
Cambria, New York.
[4]  In brief, custody proceedings were brought by the husband in
New York state in March 1995 and by the wife in Ontario in
November 1995.  Both parties attorned to both jurisdictions.
Interim and final custody orders were made by both jurisdictions.
There has been disobedience to such orders by both parties.
[5]  An interim custody order in favour of the wife was made by
Forestell J. on February 12, 1997 with respect to Hope.  The
recital in the order states that the husband did not appear
although properly served.
[6]  A final order for custody of both children was made by
Forestell J. on October 3, 1997.  Again, the recitals indicate
that the husband did not appear although properly served.
[7]  The first interim order in New York, in March 1995, was for
joint custody, with a requirement that Hope live in the
matrimonial home in New York state.  Neither party was to remove
her residence from Niagara County.  The wife&#146;s visits to her
relatives in Canada were limited to ten hours and were not to be
overnight.  This order was varied in many respects over the next
three years.
[8]  The custody proceedings in New York State were heard in
September and December 1997 and February 1998.  In the result,
the husband was granted sole custody of both children by order of
His Honour Judge Paul Crapsi, a judge of the Family Court of the
state of New York in March 1998.  That order requires that the
children be kept in New York state.
[9]  Late in the spring of 1998, the husband moved in Ontario for
an order setting aside the order of Forestell J. of October 3,
1997.  In addition, he asked for an order under the Children&#146;s
Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.12, s. 41(1) recognizing the
order of His Honour Judge Crapsi awarding sole custody to the
husband.  In order to expedite proceedings, a motion for this
latter relief was brought on before Matheson J. in Welland,
Ontario on August 7, 1998.  Judgment was reserved and by reasons
delivered August 10, 1998 the motion was dismissed with costs
fixed at $500 to be paid by the husband within 30 days.
[10] By notice of application dated August 12, 1998, the husband
applied for precisely the same relief that was asked for and
denied by Matheson J.  In support of the application were filed
the affidavits of the husband sworn April 16, 1998 and May 8,
1998, the same materials that were before Matheson J.   It is not
clear when the application was served on the wife.  She was on
holidays during most of the latter part of August.  In any event,
her then solicitor launched a motion for security for costs but
did not file any material in response to  that of the husband or
take steps to cross-examine him.
[11] On August 28, 1998, with the assistance of others, the
husband gained access to the wife&#146;s home in St. Catharines,
assaulted her and abducted the children.  He took the children
across the border to New York state and from there flew to North
Carolina where they remain in violation of both the order of
Judge Crapsi and the order of Forestell J.
[12] On the return of the husband&#146;s application before Fleury J.
on September 1, 1998, the court was advised of this latest
development.  Counsel for the wife asked that the proceedings be
adjourned in order to afford the wife an opportunity to respond.
Her counsel as well asked for an order staying all proceedings
pending a return of the children to the custody of their mother.
[13] In the result, the application for recognition of the order
of Judge Crapsi awarding sole custody of the children to the
husband was granted, the order of Forestell J. of October 3, 1997
was set aside and the motion for security for costs was adjourned
sine die.
[14] The application judge in his reasons said that he was being
asked by the husband to accelerate the application process in the
best interests of the children and it was argued that the request
for an adjournment was yet another dilatory technique aimed at
perpetuating the situation.
[15] In the result, the application judge treated the husband&#146;s
application as urgent and the wife&#146;s request as a delaying
tactic.  That, with respect, was looking through the wrong end of
the telescope.  There was no urgency in the husband&#146;s proceeding.
He had taken the children; he had accomplished, in fact, what he
could not achieve at law.  The wife asked for an opportunity to
put her case before the court.  In the circumstances, there was
no reason not to give her that opportunity.
[16] Nor was there any need to set aside the order of Forestell
J. of October 3, 1997.  That step was taken on the court&#146;s
initiative.  Doing so may have regularized the situation in an
administrative manner, but in the circumstances, it could be
taken as an indication of approval of the abduction.  It was not
an occasion for such a signal from the court.
[17] Turning to the merits, there are two main reasons for
setting aside the order of the court below.  The first is s.
41(1) of the Children&#146;s Law Reform Act.  The trial judge found
that he had no choice but to recognize the validity of the
foreign judgment, relying on Gillespie v. Gillespie, (1992) 43
R.F.L. (3d) 84 (Ont. C.A.).  In Gillespie, the jurisdictional
contest was between New Zealand and Ontario.  There was a custody
order in New Zealand but none in Ontario.  In our view, s. 41(1)
presupposes that there is no domestic order to the contrary.  The
order of Forestell J. of October 3, 1997 was such a domestic
order to the contrary.  Accordingly, s. 41(1) could not apply.
[18] The second reason for setting aside the order of September
1, 1998 concerns the appropriate response of the court to the
abduction of the children.  The application judge found that
&#147;what complicates matters in this situation, however, is the fact
that we have two potential contemnors&#148;.  He went on to deal with
the wife&#146;s disobedience with respect to the New York court orders
regarding custody of the children.
[19] Whatever rights the husband may have had by reason of the
orders of Judge Crapsi or otherwise, he had no right either to
assault his wife or to abduct the children.  In our view, his
conduct should have been condemned by the application judge in
the strongest possible terms. Whatever the faults of the wife,
the husband had to be made aware that his objectives could not be
achieved by violence or other unlawful conduct.  To consider his
application in the circumstances, was to approbate his conduct.
The application should have been rejected out of hand.
[20] The application judge expressed his &#147;most sincere hope that
upon learning of the outcome of these proceedings the father will
return to the Niagara Falls area and will allow the children to
visit with their mother&#148;.  That hope has not been realized.
[21] In our view, the application judge should have refused to
consider the application of the husband until the children were
returned to the custody of their mother.  In our opinion that is
still the appropriate position of the court.  We have been asked
in addition to direct a full hearing of the custody question.  As
the parties are entirely free to request such a hearing, we see
no reason why we should order one.</pre>
