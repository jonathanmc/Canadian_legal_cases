    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Madame Justice Low dated November
17, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was seriously in default under a lease of the
premises and the landlord purported to terminate the lease and
took possession of the premises.
[2]  After some delay, the applicant commenced an application for
relief from forfeiture which was settled by way of Minutes of
Settlement.  Shortly thereafter, the landlord moved for a
declaration that the Minutes of Settlement had been breached,
that the lease was terminated, and other relief.
[3]  The hearing proceeded on the basis of affidavits without
cross-examination.  There was no request for the trial of an
issue.  The motions judge found that the appellant had breached
the Minutes of Settlement &quot;virtually immediately after they were
signed&quot;.  She particularly referred to the provisions of
paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12 and Schedule &quot;A&quot; of the Minutes
of Settlement.
[4]  In our view, the evidence and the inferences to be drawn
therefrom amply supported the findings of the motions judge with
respect to the breaches of the Minutes of Settlement.  There is
no basis to interfere with her conclusion that the purchase and
sale transaction is void and with her conclusion to dismiss the
cross-motion of the appellant.
[5]  The position of the appellant on appeal was that the trial
judge should not have made these findings on the basis of
conflicting evidence.  In view of the tactical decision to
proceed on the material in its present form, we are not prepared
to entertain this submission.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs, including
the costs of the December 18, 1998 motion before Weiler J.A.</pre></td>
