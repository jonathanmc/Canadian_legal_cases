    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice N. D.
McRae dated February 26, 1997</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant Arnold Minors sued The Toronto Sun Publishing
Corporation (&#147;The Sun&#148;) and a number of individual reporters for
defamation in relation to twenty-eight articles, cartoons, or
editorials published by The Sun in October and November, 1994. At
all relevant times, Minors was an organizational and training
consultant on equity issues. He worked mainly for governments and
non-profit organizations. He also served as a commissioner on the
Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners.
[2]  The publications which the appellant alleges were defamatory
relate to three topics: (1) the assertion that Minors told a
group of Crown Attorneys during a training seminar which
concerned racism that the Holocaust was not a racist act, (2) the
assertion that Minors walked past a police officer in distress
without offering any assistance during the &#147;Albert Moses
incident&#148; and (3) the assertion that Minors called the
Metropolitan Toronto police an occupying army.
[3]  The trial was held before McRae J. without a jury. After
twenty-one days of hearing, the trial judge dismissed the action.
He found that the publications correctly stated the facts and
constituted fair comment on those facts. He also held that Minors
had failed to prove malice on the part of any of the defendants.
The appellant appeals on several grounds.
[4]  The appellant&#146;s first and main contention is that the trial
judge erred in failing to find the respondent liable for the
publication of articles that created the false innuendo that he
is anti-Semitic.
[5]  The appellant&#146;s position at trial was that he had never
stated that the Holocaust was not a racist act during the course
of seminars delivered to a number of Crown attorneys. The trial
judge noted in his reasons that this was the most contentious
issue at trial and that more than half the evidence at trial was
led with respect to this crucial question. The trial judge held
that this question was easily resolved because the defence had
&#147;proven beyond question that Minors did say that the Holocaust
was not racist.&#148;
[6]  The appellant, in his factum, argues that the trial judge
erred in finding that Minors had in fact stated that the
Holocaust was not a racist act as published by the respondent in
several of the impugned articles. However, this ground of appeal
was not pursued in oral argument and the appeal was argued on the
basis that this finding of fact would not be overturned by this
court.
[7]  In our view, counsel for the appellant was correct in
adopting this position. The trial judge's finding on this issue
was amply supported by the evidence. It follows from this finding
of fact that no liability can arise from the publication of the
appellant&#146;s statement about the Holocaust.
[8]  The appellant argues nonetheless that the reporting by The
Sun conveyed the innuendo that Minors is anti-Semitic and that,
consequently, it was incumbent upon The Sun at trial not only to
prove that Minors had in fact made the Holocaust remark but also
to prove the truth of this innuendo. It is submitted that the
innuendo arose from the repeated publication of the fact that
Minors had said that the Holocaust was not a racist act and from
two references to the appellant&#146;s &#147;anti-Semitic teachings&#148; in the
impugned publications.
[9]  This argument was raised at trial as an alternative basis
for liability with respect to the publications concerning the
Holocaust remark. The trial judge was of the view that the
argument was &#147;without merit.&#148; He stated that &#147;the words quoted
have a meaning which is plain and obvious in themselves&#148; and that
&#147;Minors knew as early as March 1994 that his limited definition
of racism was hurtful, not only to the Jewish community but also
to others.&#148;
[10] Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
in law in not giving effect to this alternative argument.
[11] In our view, the trial judge made no error in principle and
was correct in his conclusion on this issue. This is not a case
where words have been quoted out of their reasonable context
thereby creating a false and defamatory innuendo. The appellant's
statements about the Holocaust were accurately reproduced in
their proper context. The Sun cannot be held responsible for any
inference a reader might draw from an accurately reported fact.
We agree with the trial judge that, on the facts of this case,
this argument is without merit.
[12] We are also of the view that the trial judge&#146;s conclusions
with respect to the other impugned publications are supported by
the evidence. All of the publications are defensible either as
statements that are substantially true or as fair comment on
those true facts. Given those conclusions, it was not incumbent
upon the trial judge to sort out which publications consisted of
fact and which consisted of comment.
[13] Finally, we see no error in the trial judge&#146;s findings on
the issue of malice. He properly exercised his discretion in
admitting some of The Sun's earlier publications on this issue
and in excluding others for lack of relevance. His finding that
there was no malice is entirely supported by the evidence.
[14] Consequently, we are of the view that the appeal cannot
succeed. The appellant has not satisfied us that the trial judge
made any material error in principle. In our view, his
conclusions are based on findings of fact that are amply
supported by the evidence. There is no basis for appellate
intervention. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
