    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal of a wrongful dismissal award raises these main</pre>
    <pre>issues: first, does a long-term employee's deliberate refusal to</pre>
    <pre>report for work, even for a single day, give an employer cause</pre>
    <pre>for dismissal; second, does the finding of a Board of Referees</pre>
    <pre>under the Employment Insurance Act1 that an employee lost his job</pre>
    <pre>&quot;by reason of his own misconduct&quot; prevent the employee from</pre>
    <pre>maintaining an action for wrongful dismissal;  third, should</pre>
    <pre>courts calculate the period of reasonable notice to which an</pre>
    <pre>employee is entitled if dismissed without cause by using the rule</pre>
    <pre>of thumb that one year's service equals one month's notice, and</pre>
    <pre>has this court established an upper limit of 12 months notice for</pre>
    <pre>all non-managerial or non-supervisory employees?

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent Timothy Minott worked in the maintenance</pre>
    <pre>department of the appellant O'Shanter Development Company Ltd.</pre>
    <pre>for eleven years.  He was a good worker and a loyal employee.</pre>
    <pre>Until the last week of his employment in November 1990, O'Shanter</pre>
    <pre>had no reason to complain about him.  In that last week, however,</pre>
    <pre>because of a minor dispute with his supervisor, Minott took two</pre>
    <pre>days off without permission.  He was suspended for two days.</pre>
    <pre>When he did not show up for work on the day following his</pre>
    <pre>suspension, he was fired.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Minott applied for unemployment insurance benefits.  A Board</pre>
    <pre>of Referees found that Minott's misconduct disqualified him from</pre>
    <pre>receiving benefits for three weeks.  He then sued O'Shanter for</pre>
    <pre>damages for wrongful dismissal.  At the beginning of trial,</pre>
    <pre>O'Shanter moved to dismiss the action on the ground of issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel, arguing that the finding of the Board of Referees</pre>
    <pre>conclusively determined that Minott had been fired for cause.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge, Molloy J., dismissed the motion.  After a one</pre>
    <pre>day trial she concluded that Minott had been wrongfully</pre>
    <pre>dismissed.  She awarded him damages of $40,537.47, equivalent to</pre>
    <pre>13 months salary.  O'Shanter appeals on three grounds:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  Minott's misconduct gave O'Shanter cause to fire him.</pre>
    <pre>          Therefore the trial judge erred in concluding that</pre>
    <pre>          Minott had been wrongfully dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  The trial judge should have applied this court's</pre>
    <pre>          judgment in Rasanen v. Rosemount Instruments Ltd.2  and</pre>
    <pre>          dismissed Minott's claim on the basis of issue</pre>
    <pre>          estoppel.</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  The trial judge's award was excessive and was arrived</pre>
    <pre>          at by applying incorrect principles.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  I would not give effect to any of these arguments.  I would</pre>
    <pre>therefore dismiss O'Shanter's appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>The First Issue:    Did the Trial Judge Err in Concluding that
                    Minott had been Wrongfully Dismissed?



</pre>
    <pre>[5]  To put the relevant facts in context, I will discuss this</pre>
    <pre>issue first, although the question of issue estoppel logically</pre>
    <pre>precedes it. O'Shanter owns and manages apartment buildings. In</pre>
    <pre>1990, it managed about 3200 residential units. To maintain and</pre>
    <pre>repair the units, O'Shanter had its own maintenance department.</pre>
    <pre>Minott worked in that department doing repair work, which</pre>
    <pre>included masonry and plastering. He was hired in 1979 and fired</pre>
    <pre>on November 14, 1990, at age 43.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  During his eleven years of employment, work was assigned to</pre>
    <pre>Minott daily by a maintenance co-ordinator, Ria Ramjatten. He was</pre>
    <pre>given a work order by Ramjatten, went to the work site and did</pre>
    <pre>the repairs, usually with little or no supervision. In July 1989,</pre>
    <pre>Bill Scott became the manager of O'Shanter's maintenance</pre>
    <pre>department and, therefore, Minott's supervisor. Scott claimed</pre>
    <pre>that he believed in progressive discipline, including counselling</pre>
    <pre>and oral and written warnings over an extended period of time.</pre>
    <pre>Dismissal was &quot;a last resort&quot;. Regrettably, Scott abandoned these</pre>
    <pre>precepts in his treatment of Minott.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The dispute that led to Minott's dismissal began with the</pre>
    <pre>late delivery of some Canada Savings Bonds and ended with his</pre>
    <pre>inability to purchase a new car to get him to and from work.</pre>
    <pre>O'Shanter offered all of its employees the opportunity to buy</pre>
    <pre>Canada Savings Bonds through payroll deductions. Minott took</pre>
    <pre>advantage of this opportunity, and by the end of October 1990 he</pre>
    <pre>had accumulated $5,000 in bonds. He decided to use this money to</pre>
    <pre>buy a new car because his old car had broken down. He had</pre>
    <pre>arranged to pick up his new car on November 1, but, because of a</pre>
    <pre>problem at the bank, the bonds were not cashed until November 7.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Minott left work a little early on the 7th to get his money.</pre>
    <pre>He asked Ramjatten for the following day off so that he could</pre>
    <pre>pick up his new car and arrange for his insurance and a licence.</pre>
    <pre>Minott testified that Ramjatten told him taking the day off</pre>
    <pre>should not be a problem because nothing urgent needed to be done.</pre>
    <pre>Although she had no authority to give days off, Molloy J. held:

</pre>
    <pre>          It would have been completely out of
          character and absolutely inconsistent with
          this person's work record for over 11 years
          to have simply stayed home from work and
          blatantly lied about having had permission to
          do so. I accept as a fact that he believed,
          and believed on reasonable grounds, that he
          was entitled and authorized to take the day
          off.
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Unfortunately, Minott did not receive the entire $5,000 from</pre>
    <pre>his Canada Savings Bonds. Earlier in the year he had been off</pre>
    <pre>work for two months because of eye surgery and, to get through</pre>
    <pre>this period, he had borrowed money from O'Shanter. The company</pre>
    <pre>deducted the amount owing on its loan from the $5,000. Thus</pre>
    <pre>Minott had less money than he had anticipated when he went to</pre>
    <pre>pick up his new car on November 8, and the dealer refused to go</pre>
    <pre>ahead with the sale. Minott was disappointed and, perhaps</pre>
    <pre>understandably, annoyed at his employer. He did not report for</pre>
    <pre>work on Friday, November 9 or on Monday, November 12. On the</pre>
    <pre>12th, Scott suspended him for two days.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] Scott and Minott differed over which two days Minott was</pre>
    <pre>suspended for. Scott claimed that he had suspended Minott for</pre>
    <pre>Monday, November 12 and Tuesday, November 13, expecting him to</pre>
    <pre>report to work on Wednesday, the 14th. Minott thought that he was</pre>
    <pre>suspended for the 13th and 14th. Molloy J. found Minott &quot;to be an</pre>
    <pre>honest and straightforward witness&quot;, though confused about the</pre>
    <pre>details of what occurred between November 8 and November 14</pre>
    <pre>because he was so upset. She held &quot;I think it reasonable that</pre>
    <pre>there was some confusion in Mr. Minott's mind as to whether he</pre>
    <pre>was suspended for Monday and Tuesday or for Tuesday and</pre>
    <pre>Wednesday.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[11] Minott did call into work on November 14, which the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge found to be consistent with his understanding that he was</pre>
    <pre>suspended that day. When he called he spoke to Scott and the two</pre>
    <pre>had heated words. Minott refused to apologize for his behaviour</pre>
    <pre>and Scott fired him.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] O'Shanter submits that Scott was justified in firing Minott.</pre>
    <pre>This submission has two branches: the trial judge's finding that</pre>
    <pre>Minott was confused about when his two days suspension started is</pre>
    <pre>not reasonably supported by the evidence; and a wilful refusal to</pre>
    <pre>report for work, even for a day, justifies dismissal for cause.</pre>
    <pre>On the first branch, Minott's evidence on cross-examination</pre>
    <pre>provides support for the trial judge's finding. Minott was asked</pre>
    <pre>&quot;and you are not sure which day you were suspended, perhaps, but,</pre>
    <pre>in any event, it was for the 12th&quot;, and he replied &quot;the two days</pre>
    <pre>following&quot;. Accepting this evidence, the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>characterized what occurred as a &quot;gross misunderstanding&quot;. I am</pre>
    <pre>not persuaded that she erred in her characterization. On that</pre>
    <pre>ground alone O'Shanter's submission that Minott was dismissed for</pre>
    <pre>cause must fail.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] But even if Minott knew that he was expected to work on</pre>
    <pre>November 14, yet wilfully refused to do so C and, admittedly,</pre>
    <pre>there is a good deal of evidence to support such a finding C his</pre>
    <pre>refusal did not give O'Shanter cause to dismiss him. O'Shanter</pre>
    <pre>argues that its actions should be judged against Minott's conduct</pre>
    <pre>for the entire week between November 8 and November 14, and not</pre>
    <pre>just in the light of his conduct on the 14th alone. Minott,</pre>
    <pre>however, had received a two-day suspension for his conduct up to</pre>
    <pre>November 12. I do not accept that Minott's wilful refusal to</pre>
    <pre>report to work for one further day can elevate conduct that</pre>
    <pre>warranted a two day suspension into just cause for dismissal.

</pre>
    <pre>[14] Wilfully missing a day's work might in a rare case justify</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. But it does not justify dismissal in this case, where</pre>
    <pre>Minott otherwise had a long record of loyal service and was not</pre>
    <pre>given any warning that his job was in jeopardy. I agree with</pre>
    <pre>Molloy J.'s observation that &quot;[t]he decision to terminate</pre>
    <pre>employment, particularly one of a long-standing employee, is not</pre>
    <pre>one which should be taken lightly&quot;. Even looking at Minott's</pre>
    <pre>misconduct over the entire week of November 8, this &quot;aberrant</pre>
    <pre>episode&quot;, as the trial judge called it, did not warrant his</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. Minott was not blameless for what occurred C a fact</pre>
    <pre>recognized by the trial judge C but his misconduct was not</pre>
    <pre>serious enough to justify his dismissal for cause. I would not</pre>
    <pre>give effect to this ground of appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>Second Issue:  Did the Trial Judge Err in Failing to Dismiss
               Minott's Claim on the Basis of Issue Estoppel?
</pre>
    <pre>[15] O'Shanter relies on the principle of issue estoppel to bar</pre>
    <pre>Minott's action for wrongful dismissal. O'Shanter argues that</pre>
    <pre>whether Minott lost his job by reason of his own misconduct is</pre>
    <pre>the same question as whether the company had just cause to fire</pre>
    <pre>him. Because the Board of Referees found that Minott did lose his</pre>
    <pre>job by reason of his own misconduct, O'Shanter argues that Minott</pre>
    <pre>ought to be prevented from relitigating the same question in</pre>
    <pre>civil proceedings. Just as this court in Rasanen v. Rosemount</pre>
    <pre>Instruments Ltd. held that proceedings under the Employment</pre>
    <pre>Standards Act can give rise to issue estoppel, so too, submits</pre>
    <pre>O'Shanter, should these proceedings under the Employment</pre>
    <pre>Insurance Act. Molloy J. rejected this argument and so do I.

</pre>
    <pre>[16] I will first discuss the general principles underlying issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel and then apply them to this case. Issue estoppel</pre>
    <pre>prevents the relitigation of an issue that a court or tribunal</pre>
    <pre>has decided in a previous proceeding. In this sense issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel forms part of the broader principle of res judicata3.</pre>
    <pre>Res judicata itself is a form of estoppel and embraces both cause</pre>
    <pre>of action estoppel and issue estoppel. Cause of action estoppel</pre>
    <pre>prevents a party from relitigating a claim that was decided or</pre>
    <pre>could have been raised in an earlier proceeding. No question of</pre>
    <pre>cause of action estoppel arises in this case. Issue estoppel is</pre>
    <pre>narrower than cause of action estoppel. It prevents a party from</pre>
    <pre>relitigating an issue already decided in an earlier proceeding,</pre>
    <pre>even if the causes of action in the two proceedings differ.

</pre>
    <pre>[17] The overall goal of the doctrine of res judicata, and</pre>
    <pre>therefore of both cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, is</pre>
    <pre>judicial finality. &quot;The doctrine prevents an encore, and reflects</pre>
    <pre>the law's refusal to tolerate needless litigation.&quot;4 The policy</pre>
    <pre>considerations underlying issues estoppel were discussed in the</pre>
    <pre>leading Canadian case on the subject, Angle v. M.N.R.5

</pre>
    <pre>          The basis of issue estoppel as well as of
          cause of action estoppel has been variously
          explained; for example, that it is &quot;founded
          on considerations of justice and good sense&quot;
          (see New Brunswick R. Co. v. British and
          French Trust Corp. Ltd., [1939] A.C. 1 at
          p.19); that it is &quot;founded upon the twin
          principles so frequently expressed in Latin
          that there should be an end to litigation and
          justice demands that the same party shall not
          be harassed twice for the same cause&quot; (Carl
          Zeiss case, [1967] 1 A.C. 853, per Lord
          Upjohn at p.946, per Lord Guest at p.933);
          that it is founded on &quot;the general interest
          of the community in the termination of
          disputes, and in the finality and
          conclusiveness of judicial decisions; and ...
          the right of the individual to be protected
          from vexatious multiplication of suits and
          prosecutions ...&quot; (Spencer Bower and Turner,
          Res Judicata, 2nd ed. (1969), p.10).


</pre>
    <pre>[18] Issue estoppel has pervasive application and extends not</pre>
    <pre>just to decisions made by courts but, as this court's judgment in</pre>
    <pre>Rasanen affirms, also to decisions made by administrative</pre>
    <pre>tribunals. Whether the previous proceeding was before a court or</pre>
    <pre>an administrative tribunal, the requirements for the application</pre>
    <pre>of issue estoppel are the same. In Angle, Dickson J. set out</pre>
    <pre>three requirements, relying on English authority.

</pre>
    <pre>          Lord Guest in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner &amp;
          Keeler Ltd. (No. 2), [1967] 1 A.C. 853 at p.
          935, defined the requirements of issue
          estoppel as:
</pre>
    <pre>               ... (1) that the same question has been
               decided; (2) that the judicial decision
               which is said to create the estoppel was
               final; and, (3) that the parties to the
               judicial decision or their privies were
               the same persons as the parties to the
               proceedings in which the estoppel is
               raised or their privies.6
</pre>
    <pre>[19] These three requirements have consistently been applied by</pre>
    <pre>Canadian courts. With these three requirements in mind I turn to</pre>
    <pre>the facts of this case. After Minott was fired he applied in</pre>
    <pre>writing to the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission for</pre>
    <pre>unemployment insurance benefits. An insurance officer with the</pre>
    <pre>Commission decided that Minott was disqualified from receiving</pre>
    <pre>benefits for six weeks because he had lost his job &quot;by reason of</pre>
    <pre>his own misconduct&quot; under s.28(1) of the previous statute, the</pre>
    <pre>Unemployment Insurance Act,7 which stated,

</pre>
    <pre>               28. (1) A claimant is disqualified from
          receiving benefits under this Part if he lost
          his employment by reason of his own
          misconduct or if he voluntarily left his
          employment without just cause.8
</pre>
    <pre>[20] Minott appealed the Commission's decision under s.79(1)9 of</pre>
    <pre>the Act to a three-person Board of Referees. The Board held a</pre>
    <pre>hearing. Minott attended and gave evidence. O'Shanter was given</pre>
    <pre>notice of the hearing and the right to be present, but chose not</pre>
    <pre>to attend. The Board, however, had in its file a written</pre>
    <pre>statement from O'Shanter, which indicated that Minott had</pre>
    <pre>received written warnings about his attendance, and that he had</pre>
    <pre>been offered &quot;suitable employment that could have been reached by</pre>
    <pre>public transportation&quot; but did not seem interested.

</pre>
    <pre>[21] The Board upheld the finding of the insurance officer that</pre>
    <pre>Minott had lost his job by reason of his own misconduct, but</pre>
    <pre>concluded that the period of disqualification was too severe. The</pre>
    <pre>Board, therefore, reduced the period of disqualification from six</pre>
    <pre>weeks to three weeks. Under s.8010 of the Act an appeal lies from</pre>
    <pre>a Board of Referees to an Umpire for errors of law or</pre>
    <pre>jurisdiction or for erroneous findings of fact made perversely or</pre>
    <pre>capriciously. Minott, however, chose not to exercise this right</pre>
    <pre>of appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>[22] Against this factual background I consider the three</pre>
    <pre>requirements for issue estoppel. In summary I agree with Molloy</pre>
    <pre>J. that the finding of the Board of Referees does not give rise</pre>
    <pre>to issue estoppel because neither the first requirement C that</pre>
    <pre>the issue be the same C nor the third requirement C that the</pre>
    <pre>parties be the same C was met.

</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  Was the Issue the Same?
</pre>
    <pre>[23] Issue estoppel first requires that the issue in the</pre>
    <pre>subsequent litigation be the same as the issue decided in the</pre>
    <pre>previous litigation and that &quot;its determination must have been</pre>
    <pre>necessary to the result in the litigation&quot;11. In other words,</pre>
    <pre>issues estoppel covers fundamental issues determined in the first</pre>
    <pre>proceeding, issues that were essential to the decision. Issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel applies to issues of fact or of law or of mixed fact and</pre>
    <pre>law.

</pre>
    <pre>[24] The same issue requirement may apply at two levels in</pre>
    <pre>proceedings before the Board of Referees: the underlying or</pre>
    <pre>evidentiary findings on which the finding of misconduct was</pre>
    <pre>based, and the finding of misconduct itself.12 However, neither</pre>
    <pre>the insurance officer nor the Board of Referees made any</pre>
    <pre>evidentiary findings. For example, neither the officer nor the</pre>
    <pre>Board made a finding on whether Minott was mistaken about the</pre>
    <pre>days he was suspended for or whether he deliberately refused to</pre>
    <pre>work on November 14. Had any evidentiary findings been made, the</pre>
    <pre>parties might have been precluded from relitigating those</pre>
    <pre>findings in the subsequent wrongful dismissal action, if the</pre>
    <pre>other requirements of issue estoppel had been satisfied. Those</pre>
    <pre>findings would not have disposed of the wrongful dismissal</pre>
    <pre>action, but they may have narrowed it.

</pre>
    <pre>[25] In this case, however, we only have then the Board's finding</pre>
    <pre>of misconduct. That is a finding of mixed fact and law.13 If the</pre>
    <pre>Board's finding answers the same question that has to be answered</pre>
    <pre>in the wrongful dismissal action, then O'Shanter has met the</pre>
    <pre>first requirement of issue estoppel. Is, then, the question</pre>
    <pre>whether Minott lost his job by reason of his own misconduct the</pre>
    <pre>same question as whether O'Shanter had just cause to fire him?</pre>
    <pre>Molloy J. said that it was not the same question. She reasoned:

</pre>
    <pre>          It is not every incident of misconduct which
          may constitute cause for dismissal. Other
          factors may be considered in determining
          whether a particular incident of misconduct
          warrants dismissal, e.g. the seriousness of
          the misconduct, the number of similar
          incidents, whether or not there have been
          warnings, and whether this was an isolated
          incident in an otherwise long and unblemished
          employment history. Thus, although behaviour
          by an employee which is sufficient to
          constitute cause for dismissal at common law
          will necessarily be &quot;misconduct&quot; within the
          meaning of the Act, the reverse is not
          necessarily the case. Cause of dismissal is a
          broader concept than &quot;misconduct&quot;. There will
          undoubtedly be some fact situations in which
          the determination by the Board of Referees as
          to misconduct will answer precisely the same
          question as is before the court on wrongful
          dismissal (e.g. where there is no dispute as
          to seriousness of the alleged misconduct and
          the real issue is whether it in fact
          occurred, as may arise in situations of
          embezzlement or criminal type activity). That
          is not the situation before me, however. Mr.
          Minott's misconduct must be looked at in
          context to determine whether it constituted
          cause for dismissal at common law. That is
          not the same question as was before the Board
          of Referees which looked only at whether
          there had been misconduct.
</pre>
    <pre>[26] Her reasons emphasize the importance of focussing on the</pre>
    <pre>statutory standard of misconduct in the factual context in which</pre>
    <pre>it is to be applied. A finding of misconduct under the Act does</pre>
    <pre>not necessarily mean that an employer has just cause for</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. Conversely C and here I disagree with the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>C an employer may have just cause for dismissal even though no</pre>
    <pre>misconduct is found. The authorities on misconduct under the Act</pre>
    <pre>demonstrate these propositions. In the recent case of Fakhari v.</pre>
    <pre>Canada (Attorney General)14, Robertson J.A. noted that an</pre>
    <pre>employee's actions could be characterized as misconduct under the</pre>
    <pre>Act though an employer would not have just cause for dismissal:

</pre>
    <pre>          An employer's subjective appreciation of the
          type of misconduct which warrants dismissal
          for just cause cannot be deemed binding on a
          Board of Referees. It is not difficult to
          envisage cases where an employee's actions
          could be properly characterized as
          misconduct, but the employer's decision to
          dismiss that employee will be rightly
          regarded as capricious, if not, unreasonable.
</pre>
    <pre>[27] Conversely, an employee who is incompetent or persistently</pre>
    <pre>careless may be dismissed for cause though no misconduct is made</pre>
    <pre>out, because misconduct requires a wilful or reckless disregard</pre>
    <pre>of an employer's interest.15 In short, misconduct under the Act</pre>
    <pre>cannot automatically be equated with just cause for dismissal at</pre>
    <pre>common law.

</pre>
    <pre>[28] Just cause for dismissal at common law demands a broader</pre>
    <pre>inquiry than the search for misconduct under the Act. To decide</pre>
    <pre>whether an employer had just cause for dismissal, a court may</pre>
    <pre>have to take into account a host of considerations: the</pre>
    <pre>seriousness of the employee's misconduct; whether the misconduct</pre>
    <pre>was an isolated incident; whether the employee received warnings;</pre>
    <pre>the employee's length of service; how other employees were</pre>
    <pre>disciplined for similar incidents; and any mitigating</pre>
    <pre>considerations. Misconduct under the Act seems to focus more</pre>
    <pre>narrowly on the employee's actions that led to the dismissal.

</pre>
    <pre>[29] Admittedly, as Molloy J. points out, some conduct (for</pre>
    <pre>example, stealing from an employer) may justify both a finding of</pre>
    <pre>misconduct under the Act and a finding of just cause for</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. But that is not the case here. The Board in this case</pre>
    <pre>equated Minott's refusal to work in November 1990 with misconduct</pre>
    <pre>under the Act. He was dismissed after refusing to work on</pre>
    <pre>November 14 and therefore the Board held that he lost his job by</pre>
    <pre>reason of his own misconduct. The Board then reduced the period</pre>
    <pre>of disqualification because of Minott's 11 years of service and</pre>
    <pre>because of the problems he had in getting his money for his</pre>
    <pre>Canada Savings Bonds and in buying a new car. The Board viewed</pre>
    <pre>these considerations as relevant to the severity of the</pre>
    <pre>disqualification, not to the question of misconduct. As Molloy J.</pre>
    <pre>observed, in a wrongful dismissal action these considerations are</pre>
    <pre>relevant to the question of just cause. This analysis shows that</pre>
    <pre>misconduct under the Act and just cause for dismissal at common</pre>
    <pre>law do not necessarily raise the same question. On the facts of</pre>
    <pre>this case, the answer to the former does not determine the answer</pre>
    <pre>to the latter.

</pre>
    <pre>[30] O'Shanter relies on this court's reasoning in Rasanen in</pre>
    <pre>support of its position. In Rasanen an employee claimed eight</pre>
    <pre>weeks termination pay under the Employment Standards Act and also</pre>
    <pre>sued his employer for damages for wrongful dismissal. A referee</pre>
    <pre>under the statute found that the employee was not entitled to</pre>
    <pre>termination pay because he was &quot;laid off after refusing an offer</pre>
    <pre>by his employer of reasonable alternative work.&quot; Later, in the</pre>
    <pre>wrongful dismissal action, the trial judge dismissed the</pre>
    <pre>employee's claim because of issue estoppel.

</pre>
    <pre>[31] The trial judge's decision on issue estoppel was upheld by</pre>
    <pre>the majority of the panel in this court. Abella J.A. held that</pre>
    <pre>the question whether the employee was entitled to termination pay</pre>
    <pre>was the same question to be decided in the wrongful dismissal</pre>
    <pre>action. In his concurring reasons, Morden A.C.J.O. took a</pre>
    <pre>narrower view. He held that because the wrongful dismissal action</pre>
    <pre>was to be decided on the basis of constructive dismissal, &quot;the</pre>
    <pre>decision of the referee that the appellant had refused 'an offer</pre>
    <pre>by his employer of reasonable alternative work' ... is a decision</pre>
    <pre>on the same question which inevitably has to be decided in the</pre>
    <pre>action and is one that goes to the root of the action.&quot;16

</pre>
    <pre>[32] But Morden A.C.J.O. also pointed out that if the wrongful</pre>
    <pre>dismissal action were viewed as a case of &quot;straight unjust</pre>
    <pre>dismissal&quot; then &quot;the application of issue estoppel presents some</pre>
    <pre>difficulties.&quot;17 Indeed, in that context, he was not persuaded</pre>
    <pre>that the question would be the same because if the issue was just</pre>
    <pre>cause the effect of refusing an offer of reasonable alternative</pre>
    <pre>work could not be looked at in isolation. &quot;[O]ther considerations</pre>
    <pre>such as the length of time the employee had to consider the</pre>
    <pre>offer&quot; would have to be taken into account.18 Therefore, I do not</pre>
    <pre>read the ratio of Rasanen as standing for the broad proposition</pre>
    <pre>that termination under the Employment Standards Act always raises</pre>
    <pre>the same question as just cause at common law. Whether the same</pre>
    <pre>issue requirement is met depends on the factual context in which</pre>
    <pre>the statutory standard is applied. In this sense, Rasanen is no</pre>
    <pre>different from the present case. Considering the factual context</pre>
    <pre>in which the Board of Referees found Minott had lost his job by</pre>
    <pre>reason of his own misconduct, I am not persuaded that the same</pre>
    <pre>issue requirement of issue estoppel has been met.





</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) Was the Decision of the Board of
               Referees a Final Judicial Decision?
</pre>
    <pre>[33] This requirement has two components: the Board's decision</pre>
    <pre>must be a final decision and it must be a judicial decision. The</pre>
    <pre>Board's decision meets the finality component of issue estoppel,</pre>
    <pre>even though Minott could have appealed the decision to an Umpire.</pre>
    <pre>Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata</pre>
    <pre>sets out the governing principle:

</pre>
    <pre>          A judicial decision, otherwise final, is not
          the less so because it is appealable. If it
          is incapable of revision by the court which
          pronounced it, it is final in that court,
          which is all that is required to be shown,
          and it is immaterial that it is capable of
          being rescinded or varied by an appellate
          court.19
</pre>
    <pre>[34] The Board of Referees under the Employment Insurance Act, as</pre>
    <pre>under the previous Act, does not have the power to revise or</pre>
    <pre>rescind its decision. Thus, the Board's finding of misconduct</pre>
    <pre>conclusively decided Minott's right to unemployment insurance</pre>
    <pre>benefits subject to appeal. The Board's decision, therefore, was</pre>
    <pre>final.

</pre>
    <pre>[35] In my opinion, the Board's decision was also a judicial</pre>
    <pre>decision. The decision of an administrative tribunal may be a</pre>
    <pre>judicial decision for the purpose of issue estoppel though the</pre>
    <pre>tribunal's procedures do not conform to the procedures in a civil</pre>
    <pre>trial. Provided the tribunal's procedures meet fairness</pre>
    <pre>requirements and provided the tribunal is carrying out a judicial</pre>
    <pre>function, its decision will be a judicial decision. The words of</pre>
    <pre>L'Heureux-Dubé J. in Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 1920</pre>
    <pre>bear stating:

</pre>
    <pre>               It must not be forgotten that every
          administrative body is the master of its own
          procedure and need not assume the trappings
          of a court. The object is not to import into
          administrative proceedings the rigidity of
          all the requirements of natural justice that
          must be observed by a court, but rather to
          allow administrative bodies to work out a
          system that is flexible, adapted to their
          needs and fair. As pointed out by de Smith
          (Judicial Review of Administrative Action,
          4th ed., (1980), at p.240), the aim is not to
          create &quot;procedural perfection&quot; but to achieve
          a certain balance between the need for
          fairness, efficiency and predictability of
          outcome. Hence, in the case a bar, if it can
          be found that the respondent indeed had
          knowledge of the reasons for his dismissal
          and had an opportunity to be heard by the
          board, the requirements of procedural
          fairness will be satisfied even if there was
          no structured &quot;hearing&quot; in the judicial
          meaning of the word.
</pre>
    <pre>[36] Fairness requirements were satisfied because Minott knew the</pre>
    <pre>case he had to meet, he was given a reasonable opportunity to</pre>
    <pre>meet it and he was given an opportunity to state his own case.</pre>
    <pre>Procedural differences between a hearing before a Board of</pre>
    <pre>Referees and a civil trial do not make the Board's decision any</pre>
    <pre>less &quot;judicial&quot;. But these differences may trigger the exercise</pre>
    <pre>of the court's discretion to refuse to apply issue estoppel in</pre>
    <pre>appropriate cases, as I will discuss. In my view, however, the</pre>
    <pre>Board's procedures were sufficient to satisfy the judicial</pre>
    <pre>component of the second requirement of issue estoppel.

</pre>
    <pre>[37] Moreover, the Board was carrying out a judicial function. In</pre>
    <pre>a different context the Supreme Court of Canada has already held</pre>
    <pre>that an officer of the Commission, the first level decision</pre>
    <pre>maker, is engaged in a judicial exercise or is carrying out a</pre>
    <pre>judicial function. In Employment and Immigration Commission of</pre>
    <pre>Canada v. MacDonald Tobacco Inc.21 Laskin C.J.C. wrote:

</pre>
    <pre>          Again, the concession so made carries with it
          that the officer and the Commission, in
          dealing with an application for reduction of
          premium, were engaged in a judicial exercise.
          That was, in any event, the view of the
          Federal Court of Appeal. Pratte J., speaking
          for that Court, was plainly right in stating
          that the officer of the Commission, charged,
          in the words of s.24(2) of the Regulations,
          to decide whether a reduction shall be made,
          was obliged to make the decision in
          accordance with the Regulations enacted
          pursuant to s.64 of the Act and thus under
          prescribed standards. The judicial character
          of this power of decision is underlined by
          the provisions for review. There are no
          policy considerations involved in the
          exercise of an authority which comes from the
          Regulations and not by delegation from the
          Commission. Employers' rights are involved in
          an application invoking the authority of an
          officer and made pursuant to the criteria set
          out in the Regulations, criteria which the
          officer is obliged to apply. They are not
          mere guides for a wide discretion.
</pre>
    <pre>               In saying that the officer is carrying
          out a judicial function, I am not to be taken
          as saying also that he must give an oral
          hearing. The Regulations provide for the form
          and contents of an application for reduction
               of premium. This satisfies, in the
          circumstances, any requirement of fairness
          because it is left to an employer to invoke
          the Regulations which, in pursuance of the
          Act, set out the conditions to be met for a
          reduction of premium. The officer's duty is
          to see if the facts set out in the
          application meet the requirements prescribed
          for a reduction of premium. If the employer
          is not satisfied with the officer's decision,
          the Regulations provide for two levels of
          review at his instigation alone.
</pre>
    <pre>[38] If an officer of the Commission is engaged in a judicial</pre>
    <pre>exercise, then so too is the Board of Referees, sitting on an</pre>
    <pre>appeal of the officer's decision. I therefore conclude that the</pre>
    <pre>Board's decision was a final judicial decision and that the</pre>
    <pre>second requirement of issue estoppel was satisfied in this case.

</pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     Were the Parties the Same?
</pre>
    <pre>[39] To apply issue estoppel, the parties to the first proceeding</pre>
    <pre>must be the same as the parties to the second proceeding.</pre>
    <pre>Deciding whether this requirement has been met causes difficulty</pre>
    <pre>when one of the parties to the second proceeding is entitled to</pre>
    <pre>participate actively in the first proceeding and to exercise</pre>
    <pre>fully the rights of a party in that proceeding, but chooses not</pre>
    <pre>to do so. That is the case here. Although O'Shanter could have</pre>
    <pre>taken part in the oral hearing before the Board of Referees, it</pre>
    <pre>declined to do so. In such cases, whether a person is a party for</pre>
    <pre>the purpose of issue estoppel depends on its degree of</pre>
    <pre>participation. Because O'Shanter did not actively participate in</pre>
    <pre>the hearing before the Board of Referees, I conclude that it was</pre>
    <pre>not a party for the purpose of issue estoppel.

</pre>
    <pre>[40] The provisions of the Employment Insurance Act and the</pre>
    <pre>regulations passed under it, the Employment Insurance Regulations22</pre>
    <pre>give the employer the right to participate at the various stages</pre>
    <pre>of the proceedings before the Commission, the Board of Referees</pre>
    <pre>and the Umpire. The employer is entitled to notice, has the right</pre>
    <pre>to make representations at the hearings, is notified of the</pre>
    <pre>outcome and has a right to appeal a decision of the Commission or</pre>
    <pre>of the Board of Referees.23 For example, s.83(1) of the</pre>
    <pre>Regulations, which contemplates that an employer is a party,</pre>
    <pre>states: &quot;A board of referees shall give each of the parties</pre>
    <pre>interested in an appeal a reasonable opportunity to make</pre>
    <pre>representations concerning any matter before the board.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[41] O'Shanter took no part in the proceedings before the Board</pre>
    <pre>of Referees, although it received notice of Minott's appeal.</pre>
    <pre>O'Shanter did not appear before the Board; it did not seek to</pre>
    <pre>introduce any evidence; and it made no written representations.</pre>
    <pre>It did, however, file with a Commission a written statement in</pre>
    <pre>response to Minott's application for benefits. This statement, to</pre>
    <pre>which I referred earlier, was given at the invitation of the</pre>
    <pre>Commission under s.42 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, which</pre>
    <pre>provided:

</pre>
    <pre>               42.  Where, in considering a claim for
          benefit, the Commission finds an indication
          from the documents relating to the claim that
          the loss of employment resulted from the
               claimant's own misconduct or that the
          claimant voluntarily left employment, the
          Commission shall
</pre>
    <pre>               (a) provide an opportunity to the
               claimant and the employer to provide
               information as to the reasons for the
               loss of employment; and
</pre>
    <pre>               (b) where any such information is
               provided, take it into account in
               determining the claim.24
</pre>
    <pre>[42] This statement, which said that Minott had received written</pre>
    <pre>warnings and had been offered a job he could reach by public</pre>
    <pre>transportation, was in the Board's file on appeal and was</pre>
    <pre>apparently relied on by the Board in reaching its decision. The</pre>
    <pre>giving of this statement, however, was the only way that</pre>
    <pre>O'Shanter participated in the proceedings before the Commission</pre>
    <pre>and the Board. In my view, that limited participation was not</pre>
    <pre>sufficient to make O'Shanter a party for the purpose of issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel.

</pre>
    <pre>[43] Recent caselaw in this province suggests that a person must</pre>
    <pre>actively participate in administrative proceedings to meet the</pre>
    <pre>&quot;same parties&quot; requirement of issue estoppel. In both Schweneke</pre>
    <pre>v. Ontario25, and Randhawa v. Everest &amp; Jennings Canadian Ltd.26,</pre>
    <pre>also cases concerning proceedings under the Unemployment</pre>
    <pre>Insurance Act, the employer actively participated in the hearing</pre>
    <pre>before the Umpire or the Board of Referees and was therefore held</pre>
    <pre>to be a party. Similarly, in Rasanen, Abella J.A. held that the</pre>
    <pre>appellant, the employee, if not a party to the proceedings under</pre>
    <pre>the Employment Standards Act, was at least a privy. She wrote:

</pre>
    <pre>          The appellant clearly called the witnesses he
          wanted, introduced the relevant evidence he
          needed, and had the chance to respond to the
          evidence and arguments against him. ... He
          had a meaningful voice, through his own
          evidence and through the assistance of the
          ministry, in a proceeding which decided the
          very issue he sought to raise in his
          subsequent action.27
</pre>
    <pre>[44] In contrast, in the recent case of Wood v. Nor-Sham</pre>
    <pre>(Markham) Hotels Inc.,28 Sharpe J. held that an employer who chose</pre>
    <pre>not to contest an employee's appeal before a Board of Referees</pre>
    <pre>under the Act was not bound by the Board's decision in the</pre>
    <pre>subsequent wrongful dismissal action. As in the case before us,</pre>
    <pre>in Wood the employer had provided information about the</pre>
    <pre>employee's dismissal to the unemployment insurance officer</pre>
    <pre>adjudicating the claim for benefits. The employer, however, did</pre>
    <pre>not attend the hearing before the Board of Referees and instead</pre>
    <pre>wrote the Chairman of the Board saying it would not attend.</pre>
    <pre>Sharpe J. held that &quot;the letter, together with the other conduct</pre>
    <pre>of the employer taken as a whole, do not constitute participation</pre>
    <pre>in the process sufficient to render the employer bound by the</pre>
    <pre>Board of Referees' decision&quot;29.

</pre>
    <pre>[45] In their article Ties that Bind at Common Law: Issue</pre>
    <pre>Estoppel, Employment Standards and Unemployment Insurance</pre>
    <pre>Adjudication30 Jeffrey Goodman and Jeff Murray accurately</pre>
    <pre>summarize the caselaw:

</pre>
    <pre>          The caselaw to date suggests that employers
          can avoid creating an estoppel either by not
          appealing a decision favourable to an
          employee or not attending an employee's
          appeal. The cases have held that by appealing
          or attending at an employee's appeal the
          employer becomes a party to that appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>[46] The recent Australian High Court case, Australian Securities</pre>
    <pre>Commission v. Marlborough Gold Mines Limited31 also lends support</pre>
    <pre>to the need for active participation to become a party for the</pre>
    <pre>purpose of issue estoppel. A company had applied to the trial</pre>
    <pre>court for an order to summons a meeting of its members to</pre>
    <pre>consider a scheme to convert the company from one of limited</pre>
    <pre>liability to one of no liability. The Australian Securities</pre>
    <pre>Commission appeared and told the court that it neither consented</pre>
    <pre>to nor opposed the application. The order was made and a meeting</pre>
    <pre>was held to approve the scheme. The Commission then learned of a</pre>
    <pre>recent judgment suggesting that the scheme was illegal. The trial</pre>
    <pre>court approved the scheme and the Commission filed a notice to</pre>
    <pre>intervene, opposing the approval and then appealing against the</pre>
    <pre>approval. The Australian High Court had to consider whether issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel arose in this context, estopping the Commission from its</pre>
    <pre>opposition. The High Court held that the Commission's appearance</pre>
    <pre>before the court on the application for leave to summons a</pre>
    <pre>meeting was not sufficient to make it a party for the purpose of</pre>
    <pre>issue estoppel. The High Court wrote:32

</pre>
    <pre>          The fact that the Law requires that notice be
          given to the Commission does not make the
          Commission a party. Nor, in our view, does
          the fact that the Commission appeared to
          announce its attitude make it a party. That,
          if anything, was something done by way of
          making information available to the Court.
</pre>
    <pre>[47] A person can be a party for one purpose and not for another.</pre>
    <pre>In the present case, O'Shanter provided information to the</pre>
    <pre>Commission. By doing so it did not become a party for the purpose</pre>
    <pre>of issue estoppel. In addition to the caselaw, I think that</pre>
    <pre>policy considerations justify focussing on the degree of</pre>
    <pre>participation to determine whether an employer in O'Shanter's</pre>
    <pre>position is a party for the purpose of issue estoppel. Holding</pre>
    <pre>that an employer who merely provides information to an insurance</pre>
    <pre>officer becomes a party and thus bound by the Commission's or the</pre>
    <pre>Board's findings could turn a right to participate into a</pre>
    <pre>practical obligation to do so. Ordinarily, employers do not</pre>
    <pre>appear on applications for unemployment insurance benefits or</pre>
    <pre>even on appeals because the stakes are small and they do not have</pre>
    <pre>a direct financial interest in the outcome, although they may be</pre>
    <pre>liable under s.46(1) of the Act to repay any benefits received by</pre>
    <pre>an employee who subsequently succeeds in a wrongful dismissal</pre>
    <pre>action. Thus, to give employers in O'Shanter's position party</pre>
    <pre>status for the purpose of issue estoppel would provide a perverse</pre>
    <pre>incentive for employers to participate actively in hearings</pre>
    <pre>before the Board of Referees or before an Umpire.

</pre>
    <pre>[48] Implicit in this discussion is my rejection of any notion of</pre>
    <pre>non-mutual issue estoppel. The doctrine of non-mutual issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel, which was not argued before us, has roots in American</pre>
    <pre>jurisprudence.33 It permits a judgment to operate in favour of a</pre>
    <pre>non-party. Applied here, it might permit an employer to refrain</pre>
    <pre>from participating in a hearing before a Board of Referees yet</pre>
    <pre>rely on a favourable Board decision in a subsequent wrongful</pre>
    <pre>dismissal action. By adopting a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to the</pre>
    <pre>Board's decision, an employer could rely on issue estoppel if the</pre>
    <pre>employee lost, but be no worse off if the employee won, because</pre>
    <pre>issue estoppel could not be applied against an employer who had</pre>
    <pre>not had its day in court. Applying non-mutual issue estoppel</pre>
    <pre>would allow the employer to &quot;have it both ways&quot;. In my view, in</pre>
    <pre>these cases issue estoppel should be mutual.34 An employer should</pre>
    <pre>only be able to invoke issue estoppel for a favourable decision</pre>
    <pre>if issue estoppel could also be invoked against it for an</pre>
    <pre>unfavourable decision. I do not consider O'Shanter bound by the</pre>
    <pre>Board's decision any more than I consider it would have been</pre>
    <pre>bound in the wrongful dismissal action had Minott succeeded in</pre>
    <pre>his appeal before the Board of Referees. O'Shanter was not a</pre>
    <pre>party for the purpose of issue estoppel and the third requirement</pre>
    <pre>is therefore not satisfied.

</pre>
    <pre>[49] I have concluded that the Board's finding of misconduct</pre>
    <pre>under the Act does not satisfy the first and third requirements</pre>
    <pre>of issue estoppel. Therefore the Board's finding did not prevent</pre>
    <pre>Minott from maintaining his action for wrongful dismissal. Even</pre>
    <pre>had the three requirements been met, however, in my view the</pre>
    <pre>court has always retained discretion to refuse to apply issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel when to do so would cause unfairness or work an</pre>
    <pre>injustice. As Lord Upjohn observed in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v.</pre>
    <pre>Rayner Keeler Ltd.35 &quot;[a]ll estoppels are not odious but must be</pre>
    <pre>applied so as to work justice and not injustice, and I think the</pre>
    <pre>principle of issue estoppel must be applied to the circumstances</pre>
    <pre>of the subsequent case with this overriding consideration in</pre>
    <pre>mind.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[50] Issue estoppel is a rule of public policy and, as a rule of</pre>
    <pre>public policy, it seeks to balance the public interest in the</pre>
    <pre>finality of litigation with the private interest in achieving</pre>
    <pre>justice between litigants. Sometimes these two interests will be</pre>
    <pre>in conflict, or, at least there will be tension between them.</pre>
    <pre>Judicial discretion is required to achieve practical justice</pre>
    <pre>without undermining the principles on which issue estoppel is</pre>
    <pre>founded. Issue estoppel should be applied flexibly where an</pre>
    <pre>unyielding application of it would be unfair to a party who is</pre>
    <pre>precluded from relitigating an issue.

</pre>
    <pre>[51] That the courts have always exercised this discretion is</pre>
    <pre>apparent from the authorities. For example, courts have refused</pre>
    <pre>to apply issue estoppel in &quot;special circumstances&quot;, which include</pre>
    <pre>a change in the law or the availability of further relevant</pre>
    <pre>material. If the decision of a court on a point of law in an</pre>
    <pre>earlier proceeding is shown to be wrong by a later judicial</pre>
    <pre>decision, issue estoppel will not prevent relitigating that issue</pre>
    <pre>in subsequent proceedings. It would be unfair to do otherwise. In</pre>
    <pre>Arnold v. National Westminster Bank plc,36 Lord Keith wrote:

</pre>
    <pre>          ... there may be an exception to issue
          estoppel in the special circumstance that
          there has become available to a party further
          material relevant to the correct
          determination of a point involved in the
          earlier proceedings, whether or not that
          point was specifically raised and decided,
          being material which could not by reasonable
          diligence have been adduced in those
          proceedings. One of the purposes of estoppel
          being to work justice between the parties, it
          is open to courts to recognise that in
          special circumstances inflexible application
          of it may have the opposite result...
</pre>
    <pre>[52] Applying issue estoppel to the findings of an administrative</pre>
    <pre>tribunal to foreclose a subsequent civil proceeding may also be</pre>
    <pre>unfair or work an injustice. Its application to findings made in</pre>
    <pre>proceedings under the Employment Insurance Act is a good example.</pre>
    <pre>Looking at legislative intent, nothing either in the scheme of</pre>
    <pre>the Act or in its individual provisions suggests, for example,</pre>
    <pre>that the finding of misconduct by a Board of Referees or by an</pre>
    <pre>Umpire is binding in a civil action for wrongful dismissal. Issue</pre>
    <pre>estoppel is a common law rule and therefore the courts must</pre>
    <pre>consider the appropriateness of applying it to the findings of a</pre>
    <pre>tribunal under the Act to prevent those finding from being</pre>
    <pre>relitigated in a subsequent action for wrongful dismissal.

</pre>
    <pre>[53] In my opinion, invoking issue estoppel for the findings of a</pre>
    <pre>Board of Referees or of an Umpire raises several concerns. Some</pre>
    <pre>of these concerns are alleviated by holding that the &quot;same</pre>
    <pre>parties&quot; requirement turns on the employer's degree of</pre>
    <pre>participation. But issue estoppel affects employees as well as</pre>
    <pre>employers and thus other concerns remain, which I will discuss</pre>
    <pre>briefly.

</pre>
    <pre>[54] First, the scheme of the Act contemplates that claims for</pre>
    <pre>unemployment insurance benefits be adjudicated quickly,</pre>
    <pre>inexpensively and summarily. To inject issue estoppel into these</pre>
    <pre>claims adjudications would undermine the aim of the legislative</pre>
    <pre>scheme.37 Employers and employees may overlitigate these</pre>
    <pre>adjudications, hire lawyers unnecessarily or pursue appeals they</pre>
    <pre>might not otherwise take out of fear of the consequences in later</pre>
    <pre>civil litigation. As Molloy J. sensibly observed:

</pre>
    <pre>          If the decisions of Boards of Referees as to
          misconduct are held to always be
          determinative of whether there has been cause
          for dismissal at common law, it will be
          necessary for employees to retain counsel and
          litigate before the Board in the same manner
          as before a court in a wrongful dismissal
          action. This would not be a desirable result
          for any of the parties involved, including
          the administrative board itself which would
          soon find its expeditious summary process
          clogged with parties litigating their civil
          causes of action.
</pre>
    <pre>[55] Second, employees apply for benefits when they are most</pre>
    <pre>vulnerable, immediately after losing their job. The urgency with</pre>
    <pre>which they must invariably seek relief compromises their ability</pre>
    <pre>to adequately put forward their case for benefits or to respond</pre>
    <pre>to the case against them.38 Applying issue estoppel may therefore</pre>
    <pre>cause real injustice to an aggrieved employee. As Langdon J.</pre>
    <pre>noted in Hough v. Brunswick Centres &quot;[t]o become unemployed is a</pre>
    <pre>fairly universal experience in modern days. It is an almost</pre>
    <pre>automatic reaction for anyone who is terminated or laid off to</pre>
    <pre>file for benefits. One does not do so with the thought in mind</pre>
    <pre>that if one loses one's claim, one is at risk of having all legal</pre>
    <pre>remedies foreclosed.&quot;39

</pre>
    <pre>[56] Third, the financial stakes in an application for</pre>
    <pre>unemployment insurance benefits are typically insignificant</pre>
    <pre>compared to the financial stakes in an action for wrongful</pre>
    <pre>dismissal.40 Here, before the Board of Referees, only a few weeks</pre>
    <pre>of benefits were at stake, but in the wrongful dismissal action</pre>
    <pre>$40,000 was at stake. As Sharpe J. observed in Randhawa &quot;there</pre>
    <pre>may well be situations where one would hesitate to apply the</pre>
    <pre>doctrine of issue estoppel where a party participated in an</pre>
    <pre>administrative hearing having insignificant consequences and the</pre>
    <pre>result of that hearing was then raised later in a suit which had</pre>
    <pre>enormous consequences.&quot;41 To apply issue estoppel in such a case</pre>
    <pre>may be as unfair to the employer as to the employee.

</pre>
    <pre>[57] Fourth, the procedural differences between a hearing under</pre>
    <pre>the Act and a civil action for wrongful dismissal may cause a</pre>
    <pre>court to exercise its discretion against applying issue estoppel.</pre>
    <pre>The Restatement (Second) of Judgments sets out several exceptions</pre>
    <pre>to the application of issue estoppel.42  One exception recognizes</pre>
    <pre>that procedural differences in the two proceedings may be a</pre>
    <pre>sufficient reason not to apply issue estoppel. Section 28(3) of</pre>
    <pre>the Restatement states that &quot;a new determination of the issue is</pre>
    <pre>warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the</pre>
    <pre>procedures followed in the two courts ...&quot; Morden A.C.J.O.</pre>
    <pre>expressed a similar view in his concurring judgment in Rasanen</pre>
    <pre>when he said &quot;I do not exclude the possibility that deficiencies</pre>
    <pre>in the procedure relating to the first decision could properly be</pre>
    <pre>a factor in deciding whether or not to apply issue estoppel.&quot;43 In</pre>
    <pre>Rasanen itself, Morden A.C.J.O. held that the tribunal procedures</pre>
    <pre>were sufficient to apply issue estoppel. Carthy J.A., dissenting</pre>
    <pre>on this point, held that they were insufficient.

</pre>
    <pre>[58] Procedural differences should be looked at in practical</pre>
    <pre>terms. In the present case, Minott did not have a prehearing</pre>
    <pre>discovery. Although he had limited formal education, he appeared</pre>
    <pre>before the Board of Referees unrepresented, led no evidence,</pre>
    <pre>called no witnesses and had no opportunity to build his case</pre>
    <pre>through cross-examination. His claim failed because the Board had</pre>
    <pre>in its file, and apparently acted on, information from O'Shanter</pre>
    <pre>later proved incorrect in the wrongful dismissal action. I do not</pre>
    <pre>say that the procedures before the Board of Referees were</pre>
    <pre>deficient. They may have been appropriate for the purpose of the</pre>
    <pre>Act and for the summary determination of the disqualification</pre>
    <pre>period to be made by the Board, but entirely inappropriate for</pre>
    <pre>the determination in the wrongful dismissal action of Minott's</pre>
    <pre>claim for damages and of O'Shanter's defence of just cause.

</pre>
    <pre>[59] Finally, the expertise of the Board of Referees is quite</pre>
    <pre>different from the expertise needed to decide a wrongful</pre>
    <pre>dismissal action. The Board of Referees must consider misconduct</pre>
    <pre>in the context of a claim for unemployment insurance not in the</pre>
    <pre>context of a dispute between an employer and an employee over</pre>
    <pre>just cause.44

</pre>
    <pre>[60] Because I take the view that O'Shanter has not met all of</pre>
    <pre>the three basic requirements of issue estoppel, I need not invoke</pre>
    <pre>discretion to hold that the Board's finding of misconduct does</pre>
    <pre>not prevent Minott from maintaining his action for wrongful</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. Had I concluded otherwise, however, I would have been</pre>
    <pre>prompted by the concerns that I have listed to exercise my</pre>
    <pre>discretion to refuse to apply issue estoppel to the finding of</pre>
    <pre>misconduct made by the Board of Referees. I do not intend by</pre>
    <pre>anything I have said to undermine the role of the tribunals under</pre>
    <pre>the Employment Insurance Act. They play a vital role because they</pre>
    <pre>decide entitlement to benefits that are of great importance to</pre>
    <pre>many workers. But because of the very different characteristics</pre>
    <pre>of decision making under the Act, the findings of these tribunals</pre>
    <pre>should not automatically be imported into a subsequent civil</pre>
    <pre>action. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>Third Issue:   Did the Trial Judge Err in Awarding Minott
               Damages Equal to 13 Months Salary?
</pre>
    <pre>[61] Lacking just cause, O'Shanter was required to give Minott</pre>
    <pre>reasonable notice of his dismissal or pay him his salary for the</pre>
    <pre>notice period. Molloy J. assessed the reasonable notice to which</pre>
    <pre>Minott was entitled at 13 months. She therefore awarded him, as</pre>
    <pre>damages for wrongful dismissal, his salary for the 13 month</pre>
    <pre>period. O'Shanter submits that the award is excessive and was</pre>
    <pre>arrived at by applying incorrect principles.

</pre>
    <pre>[62] This submission must be judged against the standard of</pre>
    <pre>appellate review of wrongful dismissal awards. Determining the</pre>
    <pre>period of reasonable notice is an art not a science. In each case</pre>
    <pre>trial judges must weigh and balance a catalogue of relevant</pre>
    <pre>factors. No two cases are identical; and, ordinarily, there is no</pre>
    <pre>one &quot;right&quot; figure for reasonable notice. Instead, most cases</pre>
    <pre>yield a range of reasonableness. Therefore, a trial judge's</pre>
    <pre>determination of the period of reasonable notice is entitled to</pre>
    <pre>deference from an appellate court. An appeal court is not</pre>
    <pre>justified in interfering unless the figure arrived at by the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge is outside an acceptable range or unless, in arriving</pre>
    <pre>at the figure, the trial judge erred in principle or made an</pre>
    <pre>unreasonable finding of fact.45 If the trial judge erred in</pre>
    <pre>principle, an appellate court may substitute its own figure. But</pre>
    <pre>it should do so sparingly if the trial judge's award is within an</pre>
    <pre>acceptable range despite the error in principle.

</pre>
    <pre>[63] O'Shanter submits that in awarding 13 months the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>made two errors in principle: first, she relied on the trial</pre>
    <pre>decision in Cronk v. Canadian General Insurance Co.46, which was</pre>
    <pre>subsequently overturned by this court47; and, second, she</pre>
    <pre>determined the period of reasonable notice by using as a starting</pre>
    <pre>point the rule of thumb that one year's service equals one</pre>
    <pre>month's notice. O'Shanter also submits that even apart from these</pre>
    <pre>errors in principle, 13 months notice is excessive and beyond the</pre>
    <pre>upper limit of 12 months for clerical employees referred to by</pre>
    <pre>this court in Cronk. O'Shanter submits that a reasonable period</pre>
    <pre>of notice was in the range of six months.

</pre>
    <pre>[64] I agree that the trial judge's reasons reflect the two</pre>
    <pre>errors in principle alleged by O'Shanter. I do not agree,</pre>
    <pre>however, that this court's decision in Cronk establishes an upper</pre>
    <pre>limit of 12 months notice for a manual worker such as Minott. And</pre>
    <pre>I do not agree that an award of damages equivalent to 13 months</pre>
    <pre>notice is unreasonable. Although perhaps at the very high end, 13</pre>
    <pre>months notice for Minott is within an acceptable range.</pre>
    <pre>Therefore, I would not interfere with the trial judge's award.

</pre>
    <pre>[65] In Bardal v. The Globe and Mail Ltd.,48 in a frequently cited</pre>
    <pre>passage, McRuer, C.J.H.C. discussed the factors a court should</pre>
    <pre>consider in determining reasonable notice.

</pre>
    <pre>          There can be no catalogue laid down as to
          what is reasonable notice in particular
          classes of cases. The reasonableness of the
          notice must be decided with reference to each
          particular case, having regard to the
          character of the employment, the length of
          service of the servant, the age of the
          servant and the availability of similar
          employment, having regard to the experience,
          training and qualifications of the servant.
</pre>
    <pre>[66] The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed this passage</pre>
    <pre>although it has also said that the Bardal factors are not</pre>
    <pre>exclusive and that, depending on the case, others may have to be</pre>
    <pre>considered49.

</pre>
    <pre>[67] In Cronk, in granting summary judgment for the plaintiff,</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge MacPherson J. focussed on &quot;the character of</pre>
    <pre>employment&quot; factor. He rejected the notion that managerial or</pre>
    <pre>senior employees within an organization are entitled to longer</pre>
    <pre>notice periods than clerical employees. In the present case,</pre>
    <pre>Molloy J. relied on MacPherson J.'s reasoning to &quot;find no basis</pre>
    <pre>in fact or in law to decrease this award given to Mr. Minott</pre>
    <pre>because he is a plasterer rather than an executive.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[68] After the trial decision in this case, however, this court</pre>
    <pre>reversed the trial decision in Cronk. The majority concluded the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge in Cronk had erred by collapsing the &quot;character of</pre>
    <pre>employment&quot; factor into the &quot;availability of similar employment&quot;</pre>
    <pre>factor and therefore he had erred by departing from &quot;the widely</pre>
    <pre>accepted principle&quot; that clerical workers are generally entitled</pre>
    <pre>to less notice than senior managers or specialized employees</pre>
    <pre>holding a high rank in an organization. In view of this court's</pre>
    <pre>decision in Cronk, Molloy J. similarly erred in the present case.

</pre>
    <pre>[69] In my view, she also erred by using as a starting point for</pre>
    <pre>determining the period of reasonable notice, the &quot;rule of thumb&quot;</pre>
    <pre>that an employee is entitled to one month's notice for every year</pre>
    <pre>worked. She explained her &quot;rule of thumb&quot; approach in the</pre>
    <pre>following passage in her reasons.

</pre>
    <pre>               Although case authorities seldom refer
          to it, there has been a long-standing rule of
          thumb applied by specialists in employment
          law within the legal profession. According to
          this rule of thumb, one should allow one
          month of notice for every one year of
          service. That is the general rule. After
          that, there are adjustments up or down for
          extraordinary circumstances usually taking
          into account the list of factors set out in
          Bardal, those being length of service, age
          and availability of similar employment.50
</pre>
    <pre>[70] Thus, to determine the period of reasonable notice to which</pre>
    <pre>Minott was entitled, Molloy J. started with &quot;a little over ll</pre>
    <pre>months of notice&quot; because he had worked for O'Shanter for just</pre>
    <pre>over 11 years. She increased this figure to 13 months because of</pre>
    <pre>his age, 43, at the time of dismissal and because of the unlikely</pre>
    <pre>availability of other employment in the construction industry at</pre>
    <pre>the time. As I have said, she refused to reduce the period of</pre>
    <pre>reasonable notice because Minott was not a managerial employee.

</pre>
    <pre>[71] Those who support the rule of thumb approach to calculating</pre>
    <pre>the period of reasonable notice argue that it accords with</pre>
    <pre>popular perception, that it is reflected in corporate severance</pre>
    <pre>policies, and, most important, that it provides &quot;some</pre>
    <pre>predictability and certainty to the calculation ... while at the</pre>
    <pre>same time allowing for flexibility by adjusting for various</pre>
    <pre>factors.&quot;51

</pre>
    <pre>[72] Predictability, consistency and reasonable certainty are</pre>
    <pre>obviously desirable goals in employment law C both for employers</pre>
    <pre>and for those advising employees who have been or are about to be</pre>
    <pre>dismissed C a point emphasized by Lacourciere J.A. in his</pre>
    <pre>majority reasons in Cronk. These goals, however, are best</pre>
    <pre>achieved by a careful weighing and blending of the Bardal and</pre>
    <pre>other factors relevant to the calculation of reasonable notice,</pre>
    <pre>by establishing reasonable ranges for similar cases, recognizing</pre>
    <pre>that no two cases are the same, and even by establishing upper</pre>
    <pre>limits for particular classes of cases where appropriate.

</pre>
    <pre>[73] The rule of thumb approach suffers from two deficiencies: it</pre>
    <pre>risks overemphasizing one of the Bardal factors, &quot;length of</pre>
    <pre>service&quot;, at the expense of the others; and it risks undermining</pre>
    <pre>the flexibility that is the virtue of the Bardal test. The rule</pre>
    <pre>of thumb approach seeks to achieve this flexibility by using the</pre>
    <pre>other factors to increase or decrease the period of reasonable</pre>
    <pre>notice from the starting point measured by length of service. But</pre>
    <pre>to be meaningful at all, this approach must still give</pre>
    <pre>unnecessary prominence to length of service. Thus, in my opinion,</pre>
    <pre>the rule of thumb approach is not warranted in principle, nor is</pre>
    <pre>it supported by authority.52

</pre>
    <pre>[74] Moreover, it is not reflected in the wrongful dismissal</pre>
    <pre>awards made daily by trial judges. In a recent paper,53 Barry</pre>
    <pre>Fisher used his wrongful dismissal data base (nearly 1600 cases</pre>
    <pre>at the time) to show that the rule of thumb had little or no</pre>
    <pre>validity as a predictor of reasonable notice for short term or</pre>
    <pre>long term employees, though it had &quot;some validity for cases in</pre>
    <pre>the mid-seniority range.&quot;54 Mr. Fisher concluded that the rule of</pre>
    <pre>thumb was not an &quot;all embracing formula.&quot;55 Indeed, Cronk itself</pre>
    <pre>implicity rejects the rule of thumb approach. Ms Cronk, a 30-year</pre>
    <pre>employee, was awarded 20 months notice at trial, reduced to 12</pre>
    <pre>months on appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>[75] Still, as Molloy J. recognized in her judgment in Eaton</pre>
    <pre>Yale,56 what ultimately matters is whether the notice period falls</pre>
    <pre>within an acceptable range.

</pre>
    <pre>          One could, of course, carry out the
          calculation process without such a structure
          by simply considering all of the factors as a
          whole and arriving at a number. Some may
          prefer this approach. I prefer to start from
          a base and then adjust. I doubt that it
          matters provided that the result arrived at
          falls within the appropriate range given the
          circumstances of the case.
</pre>
    <pre>[76] Although I have concluded that the trial judge erred in</pre>
    <pre>principle in calculating the period of reasonable notice, I would</pre>
    <pre>not interfere with her award of 13 months notice because I do not</pre>
    <pre>think it is unreasonable. O'Shanter submits that her award is</pre>
    <pre>excessive, beyond the maximum of 12 months referred to by this</pre>
    <pre>court in Cronk and that a reasonable figure is six months. In</pre>
    <pre>Cronk, Lacourciere J.A. held that the character of the</pre>
    <pre>plaintiff's employment C she was a clerical employee C did not</pre>
    <pre>entitle her to a lengthy period of notice. He concluded that</pre>
    <pre>because of the other Bardal factors, she qualified for the</pre>
    <pre>maximum notice in her category, which he fixed at 12 months. In</pre>
    <pre>concurring reasons, Morden A.C.J.O. agreed with the figure of 12</pre>
    <pre>months for Ms Cronk, without suggesting that it represented an</pre>
    <pre>upper limit for clerical employees. The third judge on the panel,</pre>
    <pre>Weiler J.A. dissented and would have ordered a trial on the issue</pre>
    <pre>of reasonable notice. But she observed that the Bardal factors</pre>
    <pre>did not necessarily require a clerical employee to be given less</pre>
    <pre>notice than a managerial employee. Therefore, I do not regard</pre>
    <pre>this court's decision in Cronk as establishing an upper limit of</pre>
    <pre>12 months notice for all non-managerial or non-supervisory</pre>
    <pre>employees. At most it deals with one occupational category,</pre>
    <pre>clerical employees. Moreover, the imposition of an arbitrary 12</pre>
    <pre>months ceiling for all non-managerial employees detracts from the</pre>
    <pre>flexibility of the Bardal test and restricts the ability of</pre>
    <pre>courts to take account of all factors relevant to each case and</pre>
    <pre>of changing social and economic conditions57.

</pre>
    <pre>[77] I acknowledge that 13 months notice for Minott, even on a</pre>
    <pre>generous view, is at the very high end of an acceptable range.</pre>
    <pre>Thirteen months, however, is justified by the following</pre>
    <pre>considerations: Minott was 43 when he was fired; he has little</pre>
    <pre>formal education and limited skills; and, although he is</pre>
    <pre>experienced in the construction industry, because of a recession</pre>
    <pre>few jobs were available in that industry at the time of his</pre>
    <pre>dismissal. Even if 13 months was slightly outside of the high end</pre>
    <pre>of an acceptable range, to reduce it would amount to unwarranted</pre>
    <pre>tinkering. Therefore, I would not interfere with the damages</pre>
    <pre>award.

</pre>
    <pre>[78] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
