    <pre>[1]  This is a motion to quash the appeal on the grounds that the
only  stated  basis  for the appeal is that Farley  J.  erred  in
refusing  the  plaintiff&#146;s request for an  adjournment  when  the
matter  came before him on the Commercial List.  This sole ground
of  appeal,  contends the moving party, is  with  respect  to  an
interlocutory matter; accordingly, the necessary appeal route  is
to the Divisional Court with leave, not to this court.
[2]  In our view, the motion should be dismissed.  There are
three paragraphs in Farley J.&#146;s order.  The second paragraph
dismisses the plaintiff&#146;s entire action.
[3]  The appellant has appealed Farley J.&#146;s entire order
including the second paragraph. The specific relief sought on the
appeal, namely an order that Farley J. erred in refusing to grant
an adjournment, would lead automatically to a new hearing.  In
short, the whole matter would be reopened.  Paragraph 2 of Farley
J.&#146;s order, which the moving party concedes is a final order,
would fall with the entire order if the appeal is allowed.
Accordingly, Farley J.&#146;s order is, in our view, a final order.
[4]  We direct that the appeal be expedited.
[5]  The costs of this motion are in the cause on the appeal.</pre></td>
