    <pre>HEARD:        July 5 and 6, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Otter P.C.J. dated November 30,
1995.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a trial before a judge alone, the appellant, age
17 at the time, was found guilty of incest with his half-sister
who was then 7 years old. He was sentenced to 15 months closed
custody and 3 months open custody.  He has served his entire
sentence.  This appeal is with respect to his conviction.
[2]  The appellant raises two grounds of appeal based on the
ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  They are:</pre>
    <pre>     (i)  a miscarriage of justice ensued when medical evidence
     capable of undermining the complainant&#146;s credibility was not
     adduced;</pre>
    <pre>     (ii) the appellant&#146;s right to a fair and impartial hearing
     pursuant to s.11(d) was infringed as there was a reasonable
     apprehension of bias arising from the fact that the trial judge
     had presided over the pre-trial where an early guilty plea was on
     the agenda.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant sought leave to introduce fresh evidence in
relation to these grounds of appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>     First Ground of Appeal:</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant was convicted on the evidence of the
complainant alone.  In her statement to the police, the
complainant said that the appellant put his private in her
private on many occasions and that it hurt.  At trial, she said
that he touched his private, meaning his penis, to her private.
In describing her &#147;private&#148; the complainant referred to her
crotch and her &#147;regina&#148;.  She also stated that the appellant told
her &#147;to lick his private part&#148;.
[5]  In his reasons convicting the appellant, the trial judge
referred to what had taken place as &#147;full blown rape&#148;. The
position of the appellant is that defence counsel should have
introduced expert medical evidence concerning the fact that the
complainant&#146;s hymen was intact as well as the condition of her
genitalia and that such evidence would likely have affected the
outcome at trial.
[6]  On May 24, 1995, Dr. Mian conducted a physical examination
of T. M. who attended at the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect
Program at the Hospital for Sick Children.  Dr. Mian concluded
that the physical examination was non-specific for irritation
(bump).  In Dr. Mian&#146;s opinion, the physical examination of the
complainant&#146;s genitalia was neutral, in that it revealed nothing
to indicate or rule out penetration.  She noted that there were
two bumps on the vagina which were consistent with sexual abuse
as well as with a number of innocent explanations. Dr. Mian&#146;s
report was not tendered as evidence at trial.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  If Dr. Mian&#146;s evidence had been introduced at trial, it
would not have been entirely supportive of the defence position
that the evidence of the complainant was unreliable and no
penetration had ever taken place.  The appellant&#146;s trial counsel
used the absence of corroborative medical evidence to attack the
credibility of the complainant at trial and to suggest that there
was insufficient evidence on which the trial judge could convict
the appellant. This was a reasonable tactical approach and, in
our opinion, does not reflect negligence on the part of counsel.
That said, this court has repeatedly said that reasonable
tactical decisions by trial counsel should not be revisited.  On
this basis alone, we would refuse to admit the fresh evidence. We
will, however, go on and deal with the proposed fresh evidence on
its merits.
[8]  In response to the fresh evidence application, the Crown
filed an affidavit by Dr. Mian.  She was cross-examined on it and
it is this cross-examination that the appellant seeks to
introduce as part of the fresh evidence. In her cross-
examination, Dr. Mian agreed that, in one study where offenders
admitted penile penetration of the victim&#146;s vagina, there was
permanent damage to the hymen in 75-85% of the cases.  The
appellant&#146;s position is that this evidence, if admitted, might
have created a reasonable doubt as to whether penetration took
place.  Given that the victim&#146;s description could be viewed as a
description of penetration, this evidence could raise a
reasonable doubt as to her credibility and therefore, whether any
touching took place at all, let alone sexual intercourse.
[9]  In her cross-examination, Dr. Mian also cited a number of
articles in support of her opinion that a young girl could be
sexually abused on a number of occasions but have no evidence of
lasting trauma on her hymen or vaginal area.  Apparently this is
because a young child often does not distinguish between
penetration of the labia and of the hymen.   In cases where child
abusers have admitted penile penetration of the vagina, the
sample size is small and further studies are necessary.  In one
study of ten cases, two of the ten cases showed no damage to the
hymen and two cases resulted in no findings. In another study of
confirmed penile penetration, 15-25% of the cases resulted in no
findings. Dr. Mian repeatedly warned of the dangers of intuitive
thinking.  She did not resile from her opinion that a young girl
who has been sexually abused may not have any signs of trauma to
the hymen.
[10] The appellant also seeks to admit as fresh evidence the
evidence of Dr. Joseph Jacobs to the effect that repeated acts of
sexual intercourse on a child of  T. M.&#146;s age would have resulted
in some form of visible damage to the hymen. In cross-
examination, Dr. Jacobs knew of no studies that supported his
opinion and admitted that he did not practice actively in this
area.
[11] The proposed evidence, if admitted, could not reasonably
have been expected to have affected the result at trial. It was
not necessary to establish that full penetration occurred in
order to find that a sexual assault occurred and that the crime
charged had been committed. Although the trial judge found that
there had been &#147;full blown rape&#148;, or sexual intercourse, he
correctly instructed himself that penetration to the slightest
degree was all that was required. The appellant did not testify
at trial. Having regard to all of the circumstances, the proposed
fresh evidence does not meet the criteria for the admissibility
of fresh evidence.  The first ground of appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     Second Ground of Appeal:</pre>
    <pre>[12] Otter P.C.J. presided over the July 7, 1995 pre-trial where
a possible resolution of the charges by way of an early guilty
plea was discussed. Otter P.C.J. indicated he would require a pre-
disposition report before determining sentence. Implicit in this
discussion was the possibility that the appellant might plead
guilty to one or more of the offences with which he was charged.
Although the matter was set for a guilty plea before
Otter P.C.J., it was adjourned for trial when the appellant
changed his mind about the plea. Although a different judge was
scheduled to preside at trial, on the date of the trial, the
matter was brought before Otter P.C.J. and he presided. The
appellant submits that the failure of trial counsel to object to
Otter P.C.J. presiding over the trial amounted to ineffective
assistance of counsel.
[13] The appellant further submits that a reasonable apprehension
of bias arose. The appellant instructed his counsel to canvass an
early guilty plea; this would have been evident to Otter P.C.J.
The appellant submits that a reasonable person fully informed
might well conclude that, at trial, the appellant&#146;s plea of not
guilty was tainted by the implication at the pre-trial that he
would plead guilty if the conditions were right.
[14] It does not appear that any position was taken or
information divulged that constrained the parties in their
presentation of the case at trial. There is no suggestion that
Otter P.C.J.&#146;s participation in the pretrial inhibited the
appellant&#146;s defence or affected his decision as to whether or not
to testify.
[15] One of the appellant&#146;s co-counsel said that when he found
out that Otter P.C.J. had presided over the pretrial and was the
presiding judge &#147;we were okay with it.&#148;  This was a judgment call
that counsel were entitled to make and not ineffective assistance
of counsel.
[16] An allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias is a
serious one. Apprehension of bias requires a demonstration that
the grounds for this apprehension must be substantial, that a
real likelihood of bias exists and that a mere suspicion is not
enough: R. v. S. (R.D.) (1997) 118 C.C.C.(3d) 353.  Delay in
raising an apprehension of bias can, in some circumstances, be
indicative that the grounds lack substance.  In any event, delay
will make it more difficult for accurate evidence to support or
rebut the allegation to be obtained.  In this case, three years
elapsed before the ground of appeal was raised.  It is submitted
that the information necessary to raise the ground did not come
to appellate counsel&#146;s attention until then.  Having regard to
the opinion of the appellant&#146;s trial co-counsel, a reasonably
informed person in the position of the appellant would have had
no reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of Otter P.C.J.
[17] The appeal is dismissed.</pre>
