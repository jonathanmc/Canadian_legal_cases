    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On February 14, 1999, the respondent was acquitted of sexual
assault after a trial before Mr. Justice Haines of the Superior
Court of Justice in London, Ontario.  The Crown has appealed the
acquittal to this court.
[2]  The accounts of the complainant and the respondent varied
significantly.  At the time of the alleged assault, the
complainant was 15 years old, was a ward of the Children&#146;s Aid
Society, and lived at a  Group Home.  The respondent was 23 years
old and lived in a bachelor apartment. The complainant and the
respondent met at a bus stop.  They chatted briefly and then
agreed to walk to the respondent&#146;s apartment and drink beer
together.  On the way from the beer store to the respondent&#146;s
apartment, the respondent made flirtatious and sexually
suggestive remarks.  When the two returned to the apartment, they
sat and drank beer for some time.  The complainant testified that
she became increasingly withdrawn and uncomfortable as the
evening progressed and that this frustrated the respondent.  The
respondent denied this.
[3]  At one point, the complainant got up to go to the bathroom,
and when she returned she found the respondent lying on the bed.
At the respondent&#146;s urging, the complainant joined him on the
bed, although she says she felt awkward.  The respondent
testified that the complainant had gone to get massage oil and
then allowed him to massage her, which the complainant denies.
The respondent then began to play with the complainant&#146;s hair,
and used his hand to lay her down on the bed. They then began to
have intercourse and, at some time during that intercourse, the
respondent asked her whether he should use a condom, and,
according to the respondent, the complainant said that that would
be a good idea.  He then went into the bathroom to put on a
condom and returned.  However, on his account, he had difficulty
sustaining an erection and no further intercourse took place. The
respondent then manually stimulated himself and the complainant
and went to sleep.  The complainant testified that there was an
initial brief period of intercourse, followed by her becoming
quiet and withdrawn, followed by a second encounter. Accordingly,
the complainant testified that there were two acts of sexual
intercourse, but the respondent testified that there was only
one. On cross-examination, the respondent acknowledged that at
some time the complainant had said &#147;No&#148;, but he took that as
meaning &#147;No&#148; without a condom. The respondent also testified that
he told the complainant, at some point, that he knew when a woman
said no, she meant no.  The complainant testified that she said
&#147;No&#148; on the earlier occasion as the respondent was trying to take
her pants off, but the respondent testified that she took off her
own pants. The trial judge found that &#147;it is common ground that
she did say &#147;No&#148; at one stage, although, on the evidence, it is
not clear to me just when that was said and under what
circumstances&#148;.
[4]  The next morning, after leaving the respondent&#146;s apartment,
the complainant went to the home of two of her friends, where she
broke down and recounted what had happened the previous night.
[5]  At trial, Haines J. found that the complainant &#147;was not an
active participant in the sexual activity&#148; and that &#147;in her mind,
she had decided she didn&#146;t want to have sexual relations with the
accused that night.&#148;  Nonetheless, Haines J. acquitted the
accused because the complainant had not &#147;expressed by words or
conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in such activity&#148;, and
therefore the &#147;the accused had an honest, if mistaken, belief
that the complainant was consenting.&#148;
[6]  The judgement of the trial judge acquitting the respondent
of sexual assault on the basis that the respondent had an honest
if mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting to the
sexual acts was delivered prior to the release of the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ewanchuk (1999), 131 C.C.C.
(3d) 481.
[7]  In Ewanchuk, the Supreme Court held that there are two
components to sexual assault: actus reus and mens rea.  The actus
reus is established by showing that the accused touched the
complainant in a sexual way and that there was an absence of
consent.  Consent in this context is &#147;determined by reference to
the complainant&#146;s subjective internal state of mind towards the
touching, at the time it occurred.&#148; (para. 26)  The mens rea for
the offence is established by showing that the accused intended
to touch the complainant with knowledge of, or reckless or wilful
blindness to, a lack of consent on the part of the person
touched.  The accused may challenge the Crown&#146;s evidence of mens
rea by asserting an honest but mistaken belief in consent.  For
the purposes of the honest but mistaken belief in consent,
&#147;consent&#148; means that the complainant had affirmatively
communicated (through words or conduct) her agreement to engage
in sexual activity. (para. 46)
[8]  The element of actus reus was established at trial, as is
shown by the clear findings of the trial judge that he believed
that the complainant, in her own mind, was not an active
participant and did not want to engage in sexual activity with
the respondent.  As such, the issue on this appeal is the mens
rea element of the offence and, specifically, whether the trial
judge erred in finding that the respondent had an honest but
mistaken belief in consent.
[9]  Dealing with the issue of honest but mistaken belief in
consent, Major J. for the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 64 of
Ewanchuk:
               In cases such as this, the accused&#146;s putting consent into
          issue is synonymous with an assertion of an honest belief in
          consent.  If his belief is found to be mistaken, then the honesty
          of that belief must be considered.  As an initial step the trial
          judge must determine whether any evidence exists to lend an air
          of reality to the defence.  If so, then the question which must
          be answered by the trier of fact is whether the accused honestly
          believed that the complainant had communicated consent.  Any
          other belief, however honestly held, is not a defence. (Italics
          in original.)</pre>
    <pre>[10] The requirement that the evidence lend an &#147;air of reality&#148;
to the defence of honest mistake is meant to weed out spurious
defences and to ensure that all defendants in sexual assault
cases not have access to this defence merely by asserting it.  As
articulated by the Supreme Court, the test involves an analysis
of whether there is something in the evidence of the
circumstances surrounding the alleged assault which lends an air
of reality to the defence. R. v. Bulmer (1987) 33 C.C.C. (3d) 385
(S.C.C.), R. v. Livermore (1995) 102 C.C.C. (3d) 212 (S.C.C.).
Evidence lending an air of reality can come from the accused or
from other sources.  R. v. Osolin (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481
(S.C.C.).  In this case, there was an air of reality to the
defence.  There was evidence before the trier of fact that
supported the position of the appellant that he honestly believed
that the complainant had consented.  This evidence included the
testimony of the respondent that: the complainant requested and
accepted a back massage from the respondent after having
retrieved lotion from the bathroom and having removed her shirt;
the complainant was responsive to kissing and hugging; the
complainant took off her own pants and underwear; and the
complainant&#146;s saying &#147;No&#148; referred to a question about the use of
a condom rather than to the question of willingness to engage in
sexual activity.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The next step, therefore, is to determine whether the
respondent honestly believed that the complainant communicated
consent. The trial judge in this case made the following findings
on this issue:
               Having considered all of the circumstances, I have concluded
          that there is evidence to support the conclusion that the accused
          had an honest, if mistaken, belief that the complainant was
          consenting.  I am, therefore, left with a reasonable doubt, the
          benefit of which I must, according to law, give to the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[12] While understandably the language employed in the reasons of
the trial judge is not in conformity with the later reasons
delivered by Major J. for the Court in Ewanchuk, the trial judge
made significant findings that relate to the issue of consent:
               I have no difficulty finding that the complainant was not an
          active participant in the sexual activity.  Indeed, I accept her
          evidence that in her mind, she had decided she didn&#146;t want to
          have sexual relations with the accused that night.  Clearly, if
          it was apparent to the accused by either the words or actions of
          the complainant that she was not consenting to sexual contact, he
          is guilty of sexual assault.
                                  &#133;
               &#133; However, on all the evidence, I am
          unable to conclude that she expressed by
          words or conduct, a lack of agreement to
          engage in such activity.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Accordingly, he although the trial judge found that while
she the complainant did not want to have sexual relations with
the respondent, he was not prepareddid not go so far as to say
that she was not prepared to consent.  He The trial judge further
finds that she the complainant did not by words or conduct
communicate any lack of consent to the respondent. The Crown on
appeal, however, takes the position that these two findings of
fact demonstrate that the trial judge concluded that the sexual
acts were performed by the respondent without the consent of the
complainant and but for his later and wrongful conclusion that
the respondent had an honest if mistaken belief that the
complainant had consented to them, the trial judge would have
convicted the respondent.
[14] The Crown&#146;s argument is based on the following statement of
the law by Major J. at para. 46 in Ewanchuk: &#147;In order to cloak
the accused&#146;s actions in moral innocence, the evidence must show
that he believed that the complainant communicated consent to
engage in the sexual activity in question&#148;. [Emphasis in the
original.] In other words, the absence of conduct or language on
the part of the complainant negativing consent is no longer
sufficient to make out a defence for honest but mistaken belief.
Rather, the respondent must honestly believe that by her words or
conduct the complainant was communicating her consent to engage
in sexual activity.
[15] The consenting However, it is one thing to show that on the
basis of language employed in a later decision the trial judge
did not articulate the correct criterion, it is another thing to
assume that he would not have applied the more recent
interpretation of the law had he known of it. The trial judge&#146;s
findings in this case are compatible with the standard
articulated in Ewanchuk.  Although he did not make a finding as
to whether the complainant affirmatively communicated her consent
as is now required, there is ample evidence in this record on
which he could have based such a finding had he known it was
required of him.
[16] This is a Crown appeal from the decision of a trial judge
who heard this case on the merits and who acquitted the
respondent because in the last analysis he was not persuaded that
the Crown had proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The
Crown on appeal had no criticism of the judgment below other than
its failure to conform to the subsequent decision in Ewanchuk. On
a Crown appeal against a verdict of acquittal, I do not think
that this court should be overly critical of the reasons given by
the trial judge in accordance with the law as he then understood
it simply because the Supreme Court has reformulated the legal
test that is to be applied.  Form must not be allowed to triumph
over substance in a case such as this where the decision of the
trial judge could easily have been written in a way that conforms
with the precise wording of the Supreme Court&#146;s latest ruling.
[17] I am not prepared to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s
finding as to an honest if mistaken belief.  He found that the
respondent had an honest belief that the complainant had
consented to sexual activity and therefore he must have accepted
the testimony of the respondent relating to the conduct of the
complainant which the respondent perceived to be the
manifestation of her consent.  In these circumstances, while the
trial judge may not have said that the respondent honestly
believed that the complainant &#147;had communicated consent&#148;, his
finding that he honestly believed that the complainant &#147;was
consenting&#148; coupled with his finding that she had not &#147;expressed
by words or conduct a lack of agreement to engage in such
activity&#148; amounts to substantial compliance with the later ruling
of the Supreme Court of Canada such that it does not warrant a
new trial.
[18] On a Crown appeal of an acquittal, this court can only set
aside the acquittal and enter a conviction if it is certain that
the requisite factual findings have been made: R. v. Cassidy
(1989), 71 C.R.(3d) 350 (S.C.C.)  In this case, the findings of
fact to support a conviction are simply not in place. At the
highest, the Crown can only ask for a new trial in the
expectation that a second judge would, in the light of Ewanchuk,
enter a conviction on the same evidence.  In my view, this court
should not subject the respondent to another trial because the
trial judge in this case did not use precisely the same formula
as did the Supreme Court in a later case. This would be at least
analogous to &#147;double jeopardy&#148;.
[19] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>

    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A. (dissenting):</pre>
    <pre>[20] This Crown appeal from an acquittal for sexual assault
requires this court to consider the defence of mistaken belief in
consent.  The complainant was 15 years of age when she met the
respondent at a bus stop in the City of London.  They returned to
his apartment and after a period of drinking, various sexual acts
took place.  There were significant differences between the
accounts of the complainant and respondent.  The complainant
testified that she did not consent to the sexual activity.  The
principal defence raised was consent.  However, in the
alternative the respondent&#146;s counsel argued that the respondent
could be acquitted on the basis of mistaken belief in consent.
[21] The trial judge accepted the complainant&#146;s evidence that she
did not want to have sexual relations with the respondent.  He
acquitted the respondent on the basis of mistaken belief in
consent.  The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in two
respects.  He misapprehended the elements of the defence and
erred in holding that there was an air of reality to the defence.
Accordingly, the Crown submits that the acquittal should be set
aside and a conviction entered.  I agree with the appellant that
the trial judge did misapprehend the elements of the mistake
defence.  In my view, however, there was an air of reality to the
mistake defence.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and order
a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[22] The offence was alleged to have occurred on Friday, April 3,
1998.  In the previous months, the complainant had been
experiencing serious personal difficulties, including problems
with drug use, skipping school, and fights with her parents.  She
had been living in several foster homes, with friends, and on the
streets.  Finally, in the days prior to April 3rd, she had
decided to enter a strict group home, the  Group Home.  On April
3rd, the complainant had been staying at the Group Home for five
days in a row.  Shortly before 5:00 p.m., she was standing at a
bus stop on her way back to the residence for dinner.  The
respondent was also at the bus stop and they began chatting.
They had never met before that day.  At one point, the respondent
invited the complainant back to his place for some beer and she
accepted.  While it was her intention to get drunk at the
respondent's place, she claimed that she still planned to make it
back to the group home before her 9:30 p.m. curfew.
[23] The complainant&#146;s version of the subsequent events is as
follows.  She and the respondent walked to the respondent's
apartment and stopped there briefly while he checked his
telephone messages.  After this, they walked to the beer store
where the respondent bought a 24-pack of beer.  During their
walk, the respondent began talking in a suggestive manner,
implying that he was interested in sex.  The complainant
testified that she told him she just wanted to drink with him.
[24] Back at the respondent&#146;s apartment they drank beer and
continued talking.  She told him about her personal circumstances
and that she was 15 years of age.  In the course of the
conversation, the complainant realized that the respondent had
been dating the daughter of one of her former foster mothers.
She recalled that the mother had said some rather negative things
about the respondent.  During this time, the respondent continued
to be flirtatious, to the point where the complainant felt
uncomfortable.  On several occasions the respondent asked the
complainant if she wanted to spend the night but she declined.
The complainant did not flirt back with the respondent.  Instead,
she became increasingly quiet and withdrawn.  The complainant was
thinking of leaving the entire time, but she stayed because she
felt intimidated by the respondent's body language and things he
was saying.  For instance, when the complainant turned quiet at
one point, the respondent became frustrated and walked around the
room, hitting his fist against the wall and asking her why she
was so quiet and if he had done something wrong.
[25] Later in the evening, the complainant moved towards the
front door.  The respondent stood in front of the door and asked,
&#147;[Why] do you want to leave, am I doing something?&#148;  The
complainant did not want to &#147;offend&#148; the respondent so she
returned to her chair and continued drinking.
[26] By this point, the complainant was on her fourth or fifth
beer and was pretty drunk.  She acknowledged that her consumption
of alcohol affected her recollection of the evening's events.
The complainant refused the respondent&#146;s invitation to sit beside
him on the couch.  The respondent grabbed her chair, pulled it
over next to the couch, and then leaned over towards her on the
arm of her chair.  The complainant could not recall what he said
at this point but the incident &#147;sort of freaked [her] out&#148;.  At
some point, the respondent backed off and again asked the
complainant why she was being so quiet.
[27] At one point, the complainant went to the washroom.  (She
disagreed with defence counsel&#146;s suggestion that her purpose in
doing so was to get some massage oil because the respondent had
offered to give her a back massage.) When she returned, the
respondent was lying on the bed, fully clothed.  He asked her to
sit on the bed.  Although she felt awkward, she sat down on the
edge of the bed.
[28] The respondent started playing with the complainant&#146;s hair.
She did not say anything because she was scared.  The respondent
put his hand on her shoulder and tried to lay her down on the
bed.  The complainant tried to stay sitting up but the respondent
became more forceful and pushed her down.  The complainant
testified, &#147;He didn&#146;t push me hard, but he was forceful.&#148;  She
felt that if she had tried hard enough, she could have remained
in a sitting position.  She did not try hard enough, however,
because she felt intimidated.
[29] When asked if the respondent said anything when he pushed
her down on the bed, the complainant testified:
               A.   Umm, he, he asked me if I wanted a condom and I, I
                    said no, &#145;cause I didn&#146;t want to have sex.
               Q.   What did you say to him when he
                    asked you that?
               A.   Well, I, I just said no, and then I
                    just said no.</pre>
    <pre>[30] On cross-examination, the complainant testified that she did
not say &#147;No, I don't want to have sex.&#148;  Rather, at this point,
she just said &#147;no&#148;.  With the complainant lying on her back, the
respondent began kissing her lips and neck.  She did not kiss him
back.  He then started removing her pants by undoing the
drawstring that held them up.  He pulled her pants down to about
mid-thigh.  The complainant tried to stop him by pulling them
back up so he pulled them down again, this time managing to take
them right off her legs.  After this, he took the complainant&#146;s
underpants off and put them at the end of the bed.
[31] The complainant, who was still on her back, squirmed and
moved backwards towards the top of the bed, trying to sit up.  By
this point, she felt very drunk.  She was also scared and
uncomfortable and was becoming increasingly withdrawn.  After
removing the complainant&#146;s pants and underwear, the respondent
took off her shirt and bra.  He also removed his own shirt,
pants, and underwear.  The complainant testified:
               A.   He ah, I tried to say something, like a, I said
               no, you know, I said no and I just sort ah, I squirmed again, I,
               I tried to back up again and I don't know whether he heard me or
               not, but I said it.
               Q.   How loud did you say it?
               A.   I think it was loud enough, I, I
               was fairly quiet, but I'm pretty sure I said
               it loud enough.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] After the complainant had said no, and while she was still
lying on her back, the respondent performed oral sex on her.  She
agreed that she did not try again to push the respondent away.
She testified that she did not think that there was anything else
she could do as she had already told him &#147;no&#148; and tried to back
away when he removed her clothing.  She also agreed that she
could not be sure that he heard her say &#147;no&#148;.
[33] The respondent began having intercourse with the
complainant.  At one point, the complainant started squirming
backwards and he stopped.  The complainant curled up in a ball
with her arms around her knees and sat at the top corner of the
bed near the pillows.  She was quiet and withdrawn.  The
respondent seemed agitated and frustrated and he said, &quot;We don't
have to have sex...when a girl says no she means no.&quot;
[34] The respondent then left the bed for a couple of minutes.
When he returned, he started playing with the complainant's hair
and kissing her neck.  He laid her down again by pulling her legs
out so that she was stretched out on the bed.  Then he began
performing oral sex on her.  The complainant testified:
               Ah, he said when a girl says no, she means no, and he kept
          playing with my hair, and I just, I, I, couldn't say any more you
          know, like I couldn't, I couldn't do any more, so when you know,
          he laid me down again, I just, I just laid there like.</pre>
    <pre>[35] Next, the respondent flipped the complainant over.  Although
she tried to resist and remain on her back, she ended up on her
hands and knees and the respondent had intercourse with her.
Then he flipped her over again, so that she was on her back, and
continued to have intercourse with her for a couple of minutes.
The complainant was unresponsive.  When he stopped having
intercourse, the respondent masturbated (the complainant thought
he ejaculated) and then went to the washroom.
[36] The complainant wrapped herself in blankets and curled up
and faced the wall. When the respondent returned from the
washroom, he went under the covers, put his arm around the
complainant and held her with some force.  He fondled her vagina
with his hand and then rolled over and went to sleep.
Eventually, the complainant went to sleep.  She testified that it
was too late and she was too drunk to return to the group home.
The following day, the complainant left the apartment and went to
the home of some friends.  She told them what happened and they
convinced her to go to the police.
[37] At the end of her evidence in-chief, the complainant
repeated that she did not agree to participate in any sexual
activity with the respondent.  She never flirted with him or
responded encouragingly to any of his suggestive comments or
flirtatious behaviour.
[38] The respondent was 23 years of age in April 1998. He had a
lengthy criminal and youth record including convictions for
crimes of dishonesty.  His version of events after the encounter
at the bus stop was very different from that of the complainant.
[39] The appellant denied making any suggestive comments on the
way to his apartment.  At the apartment they talked and listened
to music.  He claimed that the complainant never told him her
age.  He denied that he &#147;came on&#148; to the complainant or that she
began to leave at one point.  He denied punching or banging the
wall.  The respondent testified that after chatting and drinking
beer for a couple of hours, he sat on the bed because the couch
had become uncomfortable.  The complainant remained on a chair.
Around this time, the respondent brought up the topic of back
massages, and he either offered to give the complainant a back
massage or she asked him to give her one.  In any event, the
complainant went to the washroom, and, while she was in there,
the respondent asked her to bring out some lotion that he kept in
the medicine cabinet.  She returned with the lotion and sat down
on the bed beside the respondent (who was sitting in the middle
of the bed).
[40] The respondent testified that once the complainant was on
the bed, he asked her if she wanted a massage and she said
&#147;sure&#148;.  Without further prompting, she took off her shirt and
lay down on her stomach wearing only her bra.  As the respondent
began applying lotion to the complainant&#146;s back, he noticed her
bra was in the way.  Not wanting to get lotion on it, he asked
the complainant if she wanted him to undo her bra and she said
&quot;sure&quot;.  The respondent undid the bra and began massaging her
back, from her neck down to her waist.  After about ten minutes,
the respondent stopped massaging because his wrists started to
hurt.  He lay down beside the complainant and fastened her bra.
They were lying on the bed facing each other and staring into
each other's eyes.  At some point, they started kissing and then
&#147;one thing led to another&#148;.  The respondent maintained that the
kissing was initiated by both of them at the same time.
[41] After a couple of minutes of kissing and hugging, the
respondent reached down and undid the drawstring on the
complainant's pants.  The complainant grabbed her pants and
underwear, pulled them down, and put them at the side of the bed.
The respondent kissed his way down her body &#151; from her neck to
her breasts to her stomach &#151; and then performed oral sex on her
for about five minutes.  After this, he pulled down his own pants
and underwear and had intercourse with the complainant while she
was on her back.  The respondent denied ever flipping the
complainant over and having intercourse with her a second time
while she was on her hands and knees.
[42] In chief, the respondent testified that the complainant&#146;s
shirt remained on the floor beside the bed after he had finished
massaging her.  On cross-examination, however, he testified that
she put her shirt back on after the massage, and that as he was
kissing his way down her body, she removed her shirt again but
left her bra on.  While he was kissing her, he was feeling her
breast under her bra.
[43] The respondent testified that after a minute or two of
intercourse, he stopped and asked the complainant if he should
get a condom.  The complainant said that would be a good idea, so
he went to the washroom to get one.  But when he returned with
the condom, he had lost his erection.  He lay down on the bed and
tried masturbating but he could not become erect.  He eventually
gave up and rolled over and drank his beer.  When they had both
finished their beers, the respondent turned down the music and
they went to sleep.
[44] In chief, the respondent testified that the complainant
never said &#147;no&#148; during the sexual activity.  He testified that he
told her that, &#147;if you don't want to do this, that's fine, I mean
ah, I understand because ah, I know when a girl says, like, like
she said, I understand if a girl says no, they mean no&#148;.  On
cross-examination, however, the respondent testified that during
the first couple of minutes of intercourse, before he mentioned
anything about a condom, the complainant said &#147;something about
no&#148;.  He wasn&#146;t sure if she meant no because she wanted him to
put on a condom and that is why he asked her if she wanted him to
get a condom.  It was when he returned from the bathroom that he
told her, &#147;When a girl says no ... I understand that she means
no.&#148;
[45] The respondent testified that from his perspective, the
complainant was &#147;willing&#148; the whole time.  She did not resist in
any way during the sexual contact.  If she had, he would have
stopped.  He denied that she ever squirmed away from him up to
the top of the bed, or that she was ever curled up in a ball as
she had described in her testimony.</pre>
    <pre>THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AT TRIAL</pre>
    <pre>[46] The respondent&#146;s principal defence was that the complainant
consented to the sexual activity.  Defence counsel submitted that
the complainant&#146;s denial of consent should not be accepted.  She
submitted that her evidence did not make sense and the true
characterization of the events was simply that, for a number of
reasons, after the fact the complainant regretted the encounter.
As she put it, &#147;[the complainant] did consent to that sexual
activity and now feels differently about it&#148;.  Counsel made only
brief mention of the alternative defence of mistake.  She
submitted:
            And even if she wasn&#146;t consenting, I would submit that it&#146;s a
          case where [the respondent], based on what she says happened and
          on her behaviour, may well have believed that she was consenting,
          and certainly it would be enough to raise a reasonable doubt, in
          my submission.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[47] Defence counsel did not point to any particular behaviour
that, in her view, constituted a foundation for the defence of
mistake.
[48] Crown counsel submitted that there was no basis for the
defence of mistake because the respondent did not give evidence
that he believed &#147;that she was consenting, based on the evidence
of what was happening&#148;.  Crown counsel submitted that the case
was one of consent or no consent; that the complainant and
respondent had given diametrically opposed versions and on his
version the complainant was a willing participant.</pre>
    <pre>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</pre>
    <pre>[49] In his reasons, the trial judge briefly reviewed the two
versions of events as testified to by the complainant and the
respondent.  Regrettably, he made few findings of fact and did
not indicate which version of events he accepted.  For example,
the trial judge did not indicate whether he found that there were
two acts of intercourse or whether the massage episode occurred.
Nor did he resolve the question of when the complainant said
&#147;no&#148;, whether the respondent heard her, and whether the
conversation related to the use of a condom.
[50] The critical portion of the reasons, where the trial judge
applied the law to the facts, is as follows:
               I have no difficulty finding that the complainant was not an
          active participant in the sexual activity.  Indeed, I accept her
          evidence that in her mind, she had decided she didn&#146;t want to
          have sexual relations with the accused that night.  Clearly, if
          it was apparent to the accused by either the words or actions of
          the complainant that she was not consenting to the sexual
          contact, he is guilty of sexual assault.
               It was, on the evidence of the
          complainant, apparent to her that the accused
          was interested in engaging in sexual activity
          with her.  He was very flirtatious and made
          sexually suggestive comments.  He invited her
          to sit on the bed and then initiated intimate
          contact.
               It is common ground that she did say
          &#147;no&#148; at one stage, although, on the evidence,
          it is not clear to me just when that was said
          and under what circumstances.  But, whatever
          the circumstances, that was the only protest
          she verbalized.
               I also appreciate how difficult it must
          have been for her, as a 15 year old with
          limited life experience and limited life
          skills, to deal with this threatening
          situation.  I expect she quite simply didn&#146;t
          know what to do.  However, on all the
          evidence, I am unable to conclude that she
          expressed by words or conduct, a lack of
          agreement to engage in such activity.
               Having considered all of the
          circumstances, I have concluded that there is
          evidence to support the conclusion that the
          accused had an honest, if mistaken, belief
          that the complainant was consenting.  I am,
          therefore, left with a reasonable doubt, the
          benefit of which I must, according to law
          give to the accused.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[51] The defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent in
cases of sexual assault was first dealt with by the Supreme Court
of Canada in R. v. Pappajohn (1980), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 481.  In that
case, at p. 514, McIntyre J. indicated that the defence can only
be put to the jury, or considered by the trier of fact, if there
is an air of reality, which requires &#147;some evidence beyond the
mere assertion of belief in consent by counsel for the
appellant&#148;.  Until the decision in R. v. Ewanchuk (1999), 131
C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) there was never a statement by a
majority of the court of the minimum circumstances which in law
would give rise to the defence and thus provide a foundation for
an air of reality.  In R. v. Osolin (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481
(S.C.C.) at 533, Cory J. held that &#147;the defence of mistaken
belief in consent will be invoked rarely,&#148; as sexual assault is
not a crime that &#147;lends itself to commission by mistake or by
accident.&#148;  But he also held at p. 531 that &#147;the trial judge must
consider all the evidence and all the circumstances&#148; before
ruling on whether there is an air of reality to the defence.
Further, although the bare assertion of a mistaken belief will
not suffice, the necessary factual foundation can come from any
number of sources, including the evidence of the complainant.
[52] On the other hand, at least since Pappajohn, it has been
relatively clear from the Supreme Court of Canada decisions that
what might be termed neutral conduct on the part of the
complainant cannot alone serve as a foundation for the defence of
mistake.  The fact that the complainant did not protest, that she
did not say &#147;no&#148;, that she was not physically injured, that her
clothes were not torn, that she voluntarily placed herself in
unfortunate circumstances, although proffered as an indication
that the accused could have believed she was consenting did not
successfully raise the defence:  R. v. Pappajohn at 514; R. v.
Robertson (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 488 and 497; R.
v. Reddick (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.) at 259; R. v.
Livermore (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 212 (S.C.C.) at 222.
[53] More importantly, at least since the decision of the Supreme
Court in R. v. Esau (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 289, it has been
apparent that, in law, something more than lack of resistance was
required.  As Major J. said for a majority of the court at p.
297:
               In this appeal, it is the totality of the evidence that
          gives the defence an air of reality. The absence of resistance or
          violence is only one factor that must be considered alongside the
          accused's evidence that the complainant did and said things that
          led him to believe she was consenting. I intended my reasons to
          conclude that the absence of resistance or violence alone could
          not raise the defence.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[54] While prior cases have tended more often to emphasize the
facts that will not support an air of reality,1 in Ewanchuk, a
case decided after the trial of this matter, Major J. for a
majority of the court set out the minimum legal requirements to
support the defence of mistake in sexual assault cases.  As the
passages set out below demonstrate, not only must there be more
than an absence of resistance, but the requisite belief on the
part of the accused is not simply that the complainant was
consenting.  He must have a belief as to the manner in which that
consent was manifested.  The accused must believe that either by
actions or words the complainant said &#147;yes&#148;.  Otherwise the
belief will be deemed not to be an honest one.  Major J. held as
follows, at pp. 499-500:
            In order to cloak the accused's actions in moral innocence, the
          evidence must show that he believed that the complainant
          communicated consent to engage in the sexual activity in
          question. A belief by the accused that the complainant, in her
          own mind, wanted him to touch her, but did not express that
          desire, is not a defence. The accused's speculation as to what
          was going on in the complainant's mind provides no defence.
               For the purposes of the mens rea
          analysis, the question is whether the accused
          believed that he had obtained consent. What
          matters is whether the accused believed that
          the complainant effectively said &quot;yes&quot;
          through her words and/or actions. The
          statutory definition added to the Code by
          Parliament in 1992 is consistent with the
          common law:
                    273.1(1) Subject to subsection (2) and
               subsection 265(3), &quot;consent&quot; means, for the
               purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, the
               voluntary agreement of the complainant to
               engage in the sexual activity in question.
               There is a difference in the
          concept of &quot;consent&quot; as it relates to
          the state of mind of the complainant vis-
          à-vis the actus reus of the offence and
          the state of mind of the accused in
          respect of the mens rea. For the
          purposes of the actus reus, &quot;consent&quot;
          means that the complainant in her mind
          wanted the sexual touching to take
          place.
               In the context of mens rea --
          specifically for the purposes of the honest
          but mistaken belief in consent -- &quot;consent&quot;
          means that the complainant had affirmatively
          communicated by words or conduct her
          agreement to engage in sexual activity with
          the accused. This distinction should always
          be borne in mind and the two parts of the
          analysis kept separate.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[55] And at p. 504:
            In cases such as this, the accused's putting consent into issue
          is synonymous with an assertion of an honest belief in consent.
          If his belief is found to be mistaken, then honesty of that
          belief must be considered. As an initial step the trial judge
          must determine whether any evidence exists to lend an air of
          reality to the defence. If so, then the question which must be
          answered by the trier of fact is whether the accused honestly
          believed that the complainant had communicated consent. Any other
          belief, however honestly held, is not a defence.
               Moreover, to be honest the accused's
          belief cannot be reckless, wilfully blind or
          tainted by an awareness of any of the factors
          enumerated in ss. 273.1(2) and 273.2. If at
          any point the complainant has expressed a
          lack of agreement to engage in sexual
          activity, then it is incumbent upon the
          accused to point to some evidence from which
          he could honestly believe consent to have
          been re-established before he resumed his
          advances. If this evidence raises a
          reasonable doubt as to the accused's mens
          rea, the charge is not proven.  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[56] And at p. 501:
            For instance, a belief that silence, passivity or ambiguous
          conduct constitutes consent is a mistake of law, and provides no
          defence: see R. v. M. (M.L.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 3, 89 C.C.C. (3d)
          96. Similarly, an accused cannot rely upon his purported belief
          that the complainant's expressed lack of agreement to sexual
          touching in fact constituted an invitation to more persistent or
          aggressive contact.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[57] In my view, the trial judge in this case asked himself the
wrong question.  He asked whether it was apparent to the
respondent from the complainant&#146;s words or actions that she was
not consenting.  He answered that question in the negative.  He
was unable to conclude that &#147;she expressed by words or conduct, a
lack of agreement to engage in such activity&#148; and therefore found
that the defence of mistake was established.  However, that was
not sufficient to establish the defence.  Applying Ewanchuk, the
question was whether the accused honestly believed that the
complainant had communicated consent.  The trial judge never
answered that question, nor, in my view, did he make the findings
of fact from which this court could conclude that the respondent
held that belief.
[58] I believe that one source of confusion may lie in s. 273.1
of the Criminal Code, where Parliament has provided a definition
of consent for the purposes of sexual assault.  Part of that
definition is expressed in the negative:
               (2)       No consent is obtained, for the purposes of
               sections 271, 272 and 273, where
               (a)  the agreement is expressed by the
               words or conduct of a person other than
               the complainant;
               (b)  the complainant is incapable of
               consenting to the activity;
               (c)  the accused induces the complainant
               to engage in the activity by abusing a
               position of trust, power or authority;
               (d)  the complainant expresses, by words
               or conduct, a lack of agreement to
               engage in the activity; or
               (e)  the complainant, having consented
               to engage in sexual activity, expresses,
               by words or conduct, a lack of agreement
               to continue to engage in the activity.
               [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[59] However, the fact that the complainant did not express by
words or conduct a lack of consent did not establish consent in
fact and is not, in light of Ewanchuk, a sufficient factual
foundation for the defence of mistake.  What else is required
will depend on the circumstances of the case.  In R. v. Livermore
(1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 212 (S.C.C.) at 221-22, McLachlin J. gave
some examples:
            The accused's bare assertion that he &quot;believed&quot; that the
          complainant consented must be supported by something in the
          circumstances that suggests that he may honestly have held such a
          belief: Pappajohn, supra. Otherwise, the goal of screening out
          the spurious defence based on nothing but the accused's facile
          assertion of belief will be thwarted. Examples of such
          circumstances are well documented in the jurisprudence. For
          example, sexually aggressive conduct by the complainant, a
          previous relationship of intimacy coupled with no reason to
          suspect a change of heart, and the case of the known prostitute
          are frequently cited as examples of situations in which an honest
          mistake may be made as to consent.</pre>
    <pre>[60] In my view, but for the error in law by the trial judge as
to the elements of mistaken belief in consent, the verdict would
not necessarily have been the same.  His findings that she did
not express a lack of agreement merely set the stage for a
possible successful defence.  As Major J. said in Ewanchuk at p.
501, &#147;a belief that silence, passivity or ambiguous conduct
constitutes consent is a mistake of law, and provides no
defence.&#148;2  If there was nothing more, the result should have
been a finding of guilt.  An honest belief required that the
trial judge at least have a reasonable doubt that the respondent
believed she had communicated consent.  Simply put, it was not
enough that the complainant did not express a lack of agreement.
[61] Accordingly, the Crown is entitled to at least a new trial.
Mr. Kelly submits, however, that there is no air of reality to
the defence and that since the trial judge found as a fact that
the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity, this
court should enter a finding of guilt.  In R. v. Cassidy (1989),
50 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 200, the Court held that an
appellate court may substitute a conviction on a Crown appeal
from an acquittal by a trial judge only if &#147;all the findings
necessary to support a verdict of guilty must have been made,
either explicitly or implicitly, or not be in issue&#148;.  This test
is to be strictly applied.
[62] In the circumstances of this case, the Crown is only
entitled to a finding of guilt in this court if (a) there is no
air of reality to the defence, or (b) the trial judge found all
the facts that support a guilty verdict if he had properly
applied the law.  In my view, there is an air of reality.
Further, while the trial judge did not make sufficient findings
to support a defence of mistake, equally he did not make
sufficient findings from which this court could conclude that
defence could not succeed had he properly applied the law.  I
will deal with each of these conclusions below.

               (a)  Air of reality</pre>
    <pre>[63] For there to be an air of reality to the mistake defence,
there must be evidence beyond the assertion by an accused that he
believed the complainant consented:  R. v. Osolin, supra at pp.
533-34.  The accused must also be able to point to evidence that
he believed that the complainant &#147;effectively said &#145;yes&#146; through
her words and/or actions&#148;:  R. v. Ewanchuk at p. 499.
[64] In approaching the question of air of reality, the
surrounding circumstances cannot be ignored.  The complainant was
only 15 years of age and had never met the respondent.  Thus,
there was no history of consensual sexual activity.  But, there
is also no dispute that the complainant and the respondent had
been drinking and the complainant conceded that her recollection
of events was affected accordingly.
[65] According to the complainant, prior to the act of oral sex
she tried to pull up her pants when he pulled them down, she said
&#147;no&#148; and squirmed away.  On the other hand, the complainant also
testified that before this incident, the respondent asked her
directly if she wished him to use a condom and she said, &#147;no&#148;
because she did not want to have intercourse.  The complainant,
however, did not tell the respondent her reason for not wanting
him to use a condom.
[66] According to the respondent, after the consensual back rub,
he and the complainant kissed and hugged and then she pulled her
pants off after he undid the drawstring.  In the circumstances of
this case, where there is no suggestion that the consent was
obtained by threats, her act of taking off her pants, if
believed, is evidence of actual consent, not mistaken belief in
consent:  R. v. Ewanchuk, at p. 503.
[67] What remains from the two stories to lend an air of reality
to honest mistake is the following.  Based on the respondent&#146;s
story it is possible that a trier of fact could find that the
complainant did participate in the back rub, including removing
her bra, and did participate in the kissing and hugging that
immediately preceded the oral sex.  A trier of fact could also
accept the respondent&#146;s evidence that when the complainant did
say &#147;no&#148; in the course of the first act of intercourse, he
stopped and made inquiries of the complainant concerning the use
of a condom and that thereafter there was no more sexual
activity.
[68] It is also possible that a trier of act could find that the
complainant did not squirm, did not pull up her pants and when
directly asked, said &#147;no&#148; in a way that the respondent could have
believed she was saying no to the use of a condom, not to sexual
activity.  Although they disagree on the timing, both the
complainant and the respondent agree that there was a question
about a condom.  The question and answer about the condom must be
set against the background of the events that night, including
the complainant&#146;s testimony about the constant flirtatious talk
and the accepting of the invitation to sit on the bed.
[69] This is not an assertion that &#147;no means yes&#148;: R. v.
Ewanchuk, at p. 501.  The respondent never claimed that although
the complainant said &#147;no&#148; he believed that she really wanted to
engage in sexual activity.  Further, it was the complainant's
evidence that she said &#147;no&#148; in answer to the question about
whether she wanted the respondent to use a condom.  A trier of
fact could find, given the circumstances previously outlined,
that the respondent believed that the &#147;no&#148; related only to the
condom use and that the complainant by conduct was communicating
her agreement to sexual activity.  It is not for this court,
which has not seen or heard the witnesses, to pass on the
improbability or otherwise of such a finding.  As McLachlin J.
said in R. v. Cuerrier (1998), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 261 (S.C.C.) at
27, the nature of consent is complex and diverse.  &quot;People can
and do cast caution to the winds in sexual situations.&quot;  The air
of reality test is met if there is some evidence upon which a
properly instructed trier of fact could form a reasonable doubt
as to mens rea: R. v. Ewanchuk at p. 502.  The reasonableness or
unreasonableness of the belief is a factor for the trier of fact:
R. v. Bulmer (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at 329; R. v.
Darrach (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.) at 252-53;
Criminal Code, ss. 265(4), 273.2.
[70] As Major J. said in Ewanchuk at p. 504, &#147;[c]ases involving a
true misunderstanding between parties to a sexual encounter
infrequently arise but are of profound importance to the
community&#146;s sense of safety and justice.&#148;  While the law must
afford men and women &#147;the peace of mind of knowing that their
bodily integrity and autonomy&#148; will be respected, at the same
time, the law must &#147;protect those who have not been proven guilty
from the social stigma attached to sexual offenders.&#148;  This may
be one of those cases of a true misunderstanding.  That question
should be resolved by a trier of fact who has the advantage of
observing the principle participants, unless this court can say
with certainty that based on the findings of fact by the trial
judge a finding of guilt was inevitable.

               (b)  Necessary findings of fact</pre>
    <pre>[71] The trial judge found that the complainant was not an active
participant in the sexual activity, that she had decided that she
did not want to have sexual relations with the respondent that
night, and that she did not express by words or conduct a lack of
agreement to engage in such activity.  While those findings are
sufficient to find that the complainant did not consent in fact,3
with only those findings, it is my view that it is not possible
to find that had the trial judge properly applied the law of
mistake he would necessarily have convicted the respondent.
[72] In view of his findings that the complainant did not express
by words or actions that she was not consenting, the trial judge
must have found that the respondent did not hear the complainant
say &quot;no&quot;, or that she said &#147;no&#148; only to the condom use.
Presumably, as well he was not satisfied that her squirming
actions indicated a lack of consent.  As indicated, the trial
judge did find that the complainant was &#147;not an active
participant in the sexual activity&#148;.  That finding is
inconsistent with the respondent&#146;s evidence that the complainant
pulled her own pants off, but is not inconsistent with the
complainant&#146;s evidence of sexual overtures by the respondent and
the respondent&#146;s evidence of the massage and the hugging and
kissing.  Further, the finding that she did not express by words
or conduct a lack of agreement to sexual activity suggests she
did not pull up her pants, as she claimed, and that she did not
say &#147;no&#148; to sexual activity.
[73] Based on those findings, it is not possible to say that the
trial judge would have convicted had he applied the proper test
for the mistake defence.  I place particular emphasis on the
question about condom use.  The trial judge stated that it was
not clear to him just when the complainant said &#147;no&#148; and under
what circumstances.  He certainly did not reject the possibility
that this incident concerned the use of a condom rather than lack
of consent to intercourse.  The trial judge also did not resolve
the dispute about the number of acts of intercourse.  If there
was only one and if the respondent made it clear to the
complainant that he would not proceed if she did not want to,
this would support a finding of mistake and would also go a long
way to meeting the requirements of s. 273.2(b), which provides
that the defence of mistaken belief in consent is not available
if &#147;the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the
circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that
the complainant was consenting&#148;.
[74] To summarize, the Crown has shown that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had not
misdirected himself.  However, there is sufficient evidence from
the stories of these two principal witnesses to provide an air of
reality to the defence of mistake.  The trial judge had the
unique advantage of having seen and heard the complainant and the
respondent.  It is apparent to me from the findings that he did
make that the trial judge did not accept the full account of
either person. It will be for a properly instructed trier of fact
to determine whether the mistake defence succeeds.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[75] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
acquittal, and order a new trial.</pre>

No' at the Expense of Fault and Proportionality Principles&quot;
(1999), 22 C.R. (5th) 39 at 46-7, that this statement is obiter
in the Ewanchuk case and goes beyond what Parliament intended in
its reform of the consent rules for sexual assault cases.  Be
that as it may, it represents the considered opinion of a
majority of the Supreme Court: Sellars v. The Queen, [1980] 1
S.C.R. 527 at 530 referring with approval to this court's
decision in Ottawa v. Nepean Township et al., [1943] 3 D.L.R. 802
at 804.
3    In my view, nothing turns on the fact that the trial judge
found that the complainant had decided that she did not &#147;want&#148; to
have sexual relations with the respondent.  In my view, it is
implicit in that finding, in the circumstances of this case, that
he found that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to engage
in the sexual activity in question, see s. 273.1(1).</pre></td>
