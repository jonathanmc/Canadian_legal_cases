    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of White J., Ontario Court
(Provincial Division)
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction on charges of breaking
and entering with intent to commit an indictable offence and the
theft of a snowmobile.  As the Crown has conceded, the only issue
in this case is whether the dock identification of the appellant
by the victim of the offence, Mr. Leclaire, was sufficient to
maintain the verdict.
[2]  This is a situation in which Mr. Leclaire and the appellant
were strangers.  They had never met before.  On the night in
question, Mr. Leclaire encountered two men attempting to steal
his snowmobile.  The only evidence with respect to the identity
of the appellant as the perpetrator was the dock identification
of Mr. Leclaire.
[3]  In convicting him of the offence, the trial judge stated:
&#147;I found Mr. Leclaire to be an extremely observant and reliable
witness&#148;.  Mr. Leclaire had previously not provided any
description of the person that he had seen, other than indicating
to the investigating officer that the second man who was involved
in the offence had told him that the other person who had run
away was Daniel Mooney.  Daniel Mooney, of course, was
subsequently arrested and was on trial.
[4]  In our view, this verdict based exclusively on dock
identification cannot be maintained.  The trial judge did not
instruct himself that dock identification was undesirable and
unsatisfactory.  The probative force of the dock identification
was undermined by the total absence of proper identification
procedures.  Moreover, the fact that Mr. Leclaire had heard the
name Daniel Mooney, passed it on to the police, that he was asked
to testify at the trial of Daniel Mooney and identified him as
the culprit also undermines the probative value of the dock
identification.
[5]  In the result, there being no confirmatory evidence
whatsoever to support the dock identification, it cannot serve as
the foundation for the convictions.
[6]  The appeal is therefore allowed.  The convictions are set
aside and a verdict of acquittal is ordered.</pre>
