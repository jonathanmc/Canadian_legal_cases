    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of His Honour Judge Eddy dated

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant advanced a number of grounds of appeal. Since
we think there must be a new trial because of the insufficiency
of the inquiry in response to the appellant&#146;s application for an
adjournment to permit him to retain counsel, we propose to deal
only with that issue.
[2]  At the appellant&#146;s first scheduled trial date, October 1,
1996, his counsel advised the court that there was &#147;a fundamental
disagreement as to how the matter should be handled.&#148;  He added
that the appellant had already contacted two other lawyers, one
in Sarnia and the other in London, about representing him.
Because of the disagreement between the appellant and his
counsel, the appellant&#146;s counsel sought an order removing him
from the record and a 3-week adjournment to give the appellant
time to retain and instruct new counsel. The presiding judge, Her
Honour Judge Austin, removed the appellant&#146;s counsel from the
record and adjourned the trial to December 16, 1996. She selected
the December 16th trial date after consulting with Ian Bruce, the
Sarnia lawyer to whom the appellant had spoken about representing
him. Mr. Bruce was in the courthouse on other business at the
time. Judge Austin endorsed the information in respect of the
December 16th trial date, &#147;peremptory to the defence, with or
without counsel must go ahead.&#148;  At this time, Mr. Bruce was not
retained or &#147;on the record.&#148;  He had, however, said that he would
represent the appellant if he had the authority from Legal Aid to
do so.
[3]  In early November 1996, after Mr. Bruce had been formally
retained, he concluded that he was in a conflict position because
of a family law retainer in which the appellant had some
peripheral involvement. He thus withdrew as the appellant&#146;s
counsel. It is clear that the appellant had nothing to do with
Mr. Bruce&#146;s decision to withdraw and that until early November
1996, he thought that Mr. Bruce would represent him at his trial.
[4]  On December 16, 1996, when the appellant&#146;s case was called,
Crown counsel advised the trial judge, His Honour Judge Eddy,
that the appellant had been represented by counsel, but no longer
had counsel. Crown counsel also reminded the trial judge that the
matter was &#147;peremptory&#148; to the defence. The appellant was then
arraigned and asked to plead without any inquiry concerning the
absence of counsel. At that point, duty counsel asked the trial
judge to put the matter down until 2:00 p.m. so that she could
make inquiries of Legal Aid and counsel in London to whom the
appellant had spoken about representing him.
[5]  Sometime during the afternoon of December 16th, the case was
called again and duty counsel made submissions for an adjournment
for the appellant so that the appellant could retain counsel. She
explained that she had been in contact with the office of a
London lawyer, Richard Braiden, and Legal Aid &#147;&#133; to sort out what
happened.&#148;  She told the trial judge that the appellant had done
what he believed was necessary to retain Mr. Braiden as his
counsel through Legal Aid. She also told the trial judge that
here had been a &#147;mix up&#148; between Mr. Braiden&#146;s office and Legal
Aid. She said:
          </pre>
    <pre>         I believe that he [the Appellant] did make efforts and he
   was under the impression that he had counsel [Mr. Braiden] as of
   this morning &#133; And Mr. Moore did go to Mr. Braiden&#146;s office and
   arrange for counsel and re-do his Legal Aid &#133; It was approved
   pending and telling, the two lawyers telling Legal Aid which
   lawyer was representing him on what case. I guess there was some
   mix up &#133; Mr. Braiden&#146;s office said that they were awaiting a
   letter from Legal Aid.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  Duty counsel was correct in stating that there had been a
&#147;mix-up&#148; between Mr. Braiden&#146;s office and the Legal Aid office.
We see no need to review the particulars of Mr. Braiden&#146;s
dealings with Legal Aid, other than to note that there was a
communications problem between his office and Legal Aid.
[7]  It is unfortunate that duty counsel did not advise the trial
judge of the fact that after the October 1, 1996 adjournment, the
appellant had retained Mr. Bruce and that, through no fault of
the appellant, Mr. Bruce had withdrawn. We assume that duty
counsel did not have this information to give the trial judge
because the appellant, in the somewhat harried circumstances of
his adjournment request, did not tell her about Mr. Bruce&#146;s
retainer and subsequent withdrawal. We should make it clear that
we do not suggest that duty counsel was in any way delinquent in
the discharge of her duties.
[8]  In any case, having received somewhat incomplete information
from duty counsel about Mr. Braiden&#146;s putative retainer and no
information about Mr. Bruce&#146;s retainer and withdrawal, the trial
judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This has been marked peremptory upon the accused as of when
          ? &#133; What is endorsed on the record October 1, 1996 &#145;adjourn to
          December 16th, 10 a.m., trial peremptory to the defence with or
          without counsel. Must go ahead.&#146;  I am accepting the Court record
          for what it is and that is a declaration to the accused because
          he appeared at that time that this matter was required to go
          ahead with or without counsel. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  Duty counsel then observed that she could say no more,
beyond repeating that the appellant had attempted to retain
counsel and &#147;&#133; he was under the impression that he had counsel as
of this morning.&#148;  The trial judge responded by ruling that the
trial must proceed.
[10] In refusing the adjournment which the appellant requested,
the trial judge was obviously influenced to a great extent by
Judge Austin&#146;s October 1st endorsement. Indeed, almost from the
outset the trial judge appears to have viewed Judge Austin&#146;s
endorsement to be both binding on him and determinative of the
appellant&#146;s application for an adjournment to retain counsel.
He also appears to have concluded that it was the appellant&#146;s
fault that he did not have counsel.
[11] We see nothing in the record that would support a conclusion
that the appellant&#146;s conduct in respect of his attempts to retain
counsel was designed to delay his trial. Whether he acted
reasonably in his Legal Aid related dealings with Mr. Braiden is
somewhat problematic. That, however, is an issue that was not
fully explored because of the inadequate inquiry conducted at the
time of the appellant&#146;s adjournment request. Thus, to the extent
that the reasonableness of the appellant&#146;s action may be a live
issue, it was not the basis upon which the trial judge refused
the appellant&#146;s adjournment request.
[12] As we have said, the trial judge appears to have refused the
appellant&#146;s request for an adjournment to retain counsel because
he concluded that the appellant was required by Judge Austin&#146;s
October 1st endorsement to obtain counsel by December 16th, or
proceed to trial without counsel. If an appropriate inquiry had
been conducted, the fact that the appellant had retained counsel
and that his counsel had withdrawn would have been made known to
the trial judge. The appellant was not given the opportunity to
volunteer this information. If he had been asked, as we think he
should have been, whether he had  anything to add to Duty
Counsel&#146;s comments, the trial judge would have been informed that
after October 1, 1996, the appellant had retained Mr. Bruce, and
that Mr. Bruce later withdrew as his counsel. Given this
information, it is, in our view, likely that the trial judge
would have recognized that the appellant was not entirely to
blame for not having counsel. In this somewhat indirect way, the
failure of the trial judge to conduct an adequate inquiry into
the facts underlying the appellant&#146;s request for an adjournment
to retain counsel resulted in the trial judge giving undue weight
to the October 1, 1996 endorsement making the December 16th trial
peremptory to the defence.
[13] We  accept that the complainant and other Crown witness
would have been inconvenienced by an adjournment and will be
further inconvenienced by having to appear at a new trial. We
are, however, unable to conclude that the appellant suffered no
material prejudice by being forced to defend himself.
[14] Thus, the appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed and a
new trial directed. We do not think it necessary to deal with the
appellant's submission that the trial judge did not provide him
with adequate assistance in the conduct of his defence (see R. v.
McGibbon (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. C.A.)) and the further
submission that the trial judge made several errors in law during
the course of the trial.
