      <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN ( Respondent)
               v. GARY SCOTT MORAND (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        LABROSSE, ROSENBERG and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       David E. Harris,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Bradley Reitz,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         February 2, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal from
conviction. We agree that the conviction for extortion was a
nullity due to the erroneous election by the Crown. Section
686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code has no application. The Crown
does not seek a new trial on that offence. That conviction is
quashed.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge did not make improper use of the appellant's
failure to testify. The trial judge did note that the Crown
evidence was uncontradicted. We do not agree, however, that the
trial judge failed to weigh and evaluate the Crown evidence or
that he used the appellant's failure to testify to bolster the
Crown evidence. There is nothing in the trial judge's reasons to
indicate that he placed any burden on the appellant to contradict
the testimony by the Crown witnesses.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge used the
guilty plea on the possession charge to bolster the Crown's case.
However, it was made clear by Crown counsel that this charge did
not relate to the trafficking charge. A mere passing mention of
the possession charge does not lead to an inference that the
trial judge misused that guilty plea.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  As to sentence, the appellant has an appalling record for
similar offences. These offences were very serious. The appellant
coerced a young man, by threats, to traffic in narcotics at a
high school and to other young people.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, the extortion conviction is quashed. The appeal
from conviction and sentence is otherwise dismissed.</pre></td>
