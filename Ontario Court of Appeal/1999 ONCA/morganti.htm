      <pre>HEARD:         October 27, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Hoilett
dated March 17, 1998.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  On a motion under Rule 21, Hoilett J. dismissed the
appellants’ action on the basis that all of the issues raised in
the statement of claim are barred by the principle of issue
estoppel.
[2]  On March 2, 1995, the respondent Strong made an assignment
in bankruptcy.  When she applied for a discharge the appellants,
who were creditors of Ms. Strong served a notice of opposition.
The grounds for opposing the discharge included assertions that
Ms. Strong had failed to disclose all of her assets and income to
the trustee and that she continued to have household and personal
items of a value greater than $2,000 in her possession.
[3]  The discharge hearing was held on February 22, 1996 before
Blair J.  There is no transcript of the hearing.  We are told
that the appellant, Domenic Morganti attended, cross-examined Ms.
Strong and gave evidence in support of his position opposing the
discharge.
[4]  Blair J. made an order granting Ms. Strong an absolute
discharge.  In his reasons, he said:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Mr. Morganti’s main thrust for opposing the discharge was
          that Ms. Strong has assets which she either is not declaring or,
          to the extent that they have been declared, she is undervaluing
          them significantly.  These assets are all of a household nature
          and tools-of-the-trade nature.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[5]  Blair J. found that there was no credible evidence to
support this position.  He accepted the evidence of Ms. Strong
and concluded that there were no assets that had not been
declared.
[6]  On August 6, 1997, the appellants obtained an order under s.
38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, B-3
authorizing them to bring this action on their own behalf and
behalf of the creditors of Ms. Strong.
[7]  In our view, issue estoppel applies to bar all of the claims
in the statement of claim except the one relating to the property
at 21 Segwun Road, Waterdown.  In general terms, all of the other
claims allege that Ms. Strong fraudulently failed to disclose and
turn over assets to the trustee of her bankrupt estate and that
these assets should be used to satisfy the claims of her
creditors including the appellants.  These claims raise the same
issues that were determined by Blair J. at the discharge hearing.
The appellants and Ms. Strong were parties to and participated in
that hearing.  The decision of Blair J. was not appealed.  It was
a final decision.  We see no basis to interfere with the
conclusion of the motions judge as it relates to these claims.
[8]  The claim regarding 21 Segwun Road is set out in paragraphs
14 and 15 of the statement of claim.  The appellants allege that
while in bankruptcy Ms. Strong purchased the property at 21
Segwun Road with the respondent Robert Beck, and that she paid
approximately $33,000.00 towards the purchase price.  Title was
taken in Mr. Beck’s name.  The statement of claim alleges that
Ms. Strong has an interest in the property arising from a
resulting trust which interest is subject to the claims of her
creditors.
[9]  We are told that the issue of Ms. Strong’s alleged interest
in this property was not raised at the discharge hearing.
Neither the notice of opposition nor the reasons of Blair J.
included issues relating to 21 Segwun Road.  In our view, issue
estoppel does not operate to bar this part of the appellants’
action.
[10] The motions judge would have also dismissed the appellants’
claim relating to 21 Segwun Road on the erroneous premise that
the appellants are claiming that Ms. Strong’s interest in the
property arose from an alleged common law relationship with Mr.
Beck and that it was therefore immune from the claims of the
trustee.  In fact, the claim is based on the assertion that there
is a resulting trust in her favour.  In our view, the motions
judge erred in dismissing those parts of the statement of claim
against Ms. Strong relating to her alleged interest in 21 Segwun
Road.
[11] The motions judge also erred in dismissing the action
against Mr. Beck.  The claim against him relates solely to his
interest in 21 Segwun Road.  Moreover, he was not a party to the
proceedings before Blair J.
[12] In the result, we would allow the appeal and set aside the
judgment with respect to those claims set out in paragraphs 14
and 15 of the statement of claim.  In all other respects, the
judgment is confirmed.
[13] The respondents did not file a factum or appear on the
argument of this appeal.  Counsel for Ms. Strong advised the
court by letter that his client opposed the appeal, but would not
attend on the argument.  The appellants have had mixed success.
There will be no order for costs of the appeal.</pre></td>
