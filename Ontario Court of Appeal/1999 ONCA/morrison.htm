    <pre>HEARD:         June 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal from sentence imposed by  Gonet J. on March  19, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On March 19, 1999 the appellant pleaded guilty to the
charges of (i) escaping lawful custody; (ii) trafficking in
cocaine; and (iii) possession of cocaine for the purpose of
trafficking. He had been arrested on February 27, 1999. He was
sentenced to 9 months on (ii) plus 1 month on (i) and 6 months on
(iii), both concurrent to (ii), with a recommendation that he be
involved in the Temporary Absence Program. He has been now
detained for an immigration hearing, which event will likely
affect his eligibility for parole and has affected his
eligibility for enrolment in the Temporary Absence Program and
his ability to take any substance abuse or family life programs
while incarcerated.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant acknowledged that he is a drug addict
(marijuana and cocaine). He has multiple drug convictions. His
record for this and other offences span the decade: 1986 &#150; 96. An
outstanding drug charge from 1997 has not yet been resolved.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  However within a month of being charged in 1997, he
experienced a revelation which he asserts changed the direction
of his life. With the support of his now wife and his mother, he
appears to have abstained from drugs for approximately 20 months,
before yielding to the temptations put before him by bad company
and stumbling into smoking some marijuana again which quickly
degenerated into the revival of his crack cocaine habit. During
his drug free period he went back to school for upgrading and he
also took a training program in carpentry. With the encouragement
and assistance of his and his wife&#146;s families, he opened a
clothing store after fixing up the premises. It appears that his
wife kept close tabs on the store&#146;s finances so that the
appellant was not able to use store money to fund his crack
habit. Thus he turned to the avenue of selling crack to feed his
own habit. In this respect it appears that the support of his
wife and the success he was enjoying unfortunately worked to his
immediate detriment.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  At his sentencing, appellant&#146;s counsel and his wife
indicated to the court that he wanted treatment to deal with the
cause underlying the criminal offences before the court. In order
to enable the appellant to get treatment, his counsel proposed a
conditional sentence of 12 months with strict conditions to
ensure compliance.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant also apparently spoke on his own behalf, it
would seem in regard to his desire and need for assistance in
rehabilitation. Inexplicably his statement was &#147;inaudible&#148; to the
court reporter so that there is a gap in the transcript. The
judge did not refer in his reasons to anything said by the
appellant nor did he address the aspect of rehabilitation.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant, his wife and his mother are concerned that he
become rehabilitated. They are willing to engage in a strict
regime to this end.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Under ordinary circumstances and without any consideration
of the aspect of rehabilitation, one would not view the sentence
as being out of line. However, what needs to be considered in
these fairly unusual circumstances is the question of cause and
effect and the distinct possibility of rehabilitation which would
break the cycle. Under present conditions, the appellant has no
opportunity to engage in suitable treatment. He has the support
and encouragement of his wife, her family and his own family to
fortify him in his expressed and semi-achieved goal of becoming
drug free. That he has slipped and fallen does not end the
inquiry as to rehabilitation; given the invidious evil of drugs,
it is likely that this path will never be smooth nor
uninterrupted. However, if he succeeds in his goal on a long term
basis then our society will be the beneficiary of a recovered
member and a good example for others.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Rehabilitation was a live issue advanced on a realistic
basis but unaddressed in the sentencing below. We are therefore
of the view under these circumstances, with a view towards
encouraging continued dedication towards rehabilitation, that the
proper sentence would be that of time served plus two years of
probation. The appellant has requested that one of the terms of
his probation be that he not associate with or knowingly be in
the company of anyone who has a criminal record whether or not
involving drugs or whom he knows to be a drug user, so that he
have a reason to avoid such bad company or to disengage himself
if he finds that he is so engaged. In addition, the probation
conditions are: (a) to report to his parole officer immediately
upon release and so often thereafter as directed; (b) to abstain
from the use or possession of any non-prescription drug; (c) to
forthwith enroll in a substance abuse program at the Donwoods
Institution and faithfully attend; (d) to agree to be tested for
drug usage at any time as required by his probation officer; (e)
to be employed on a full time basis either at the subject
clothing store or as permitted by his parole officer; (f) to
reside with his wife; and (g) to maintain a curfew between the
hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. except for the purposes of work
or receiving counselling.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Leave is granted. The appeal against sentence is allowed.
The sentence is varied in accordance with these reasons.</pre></td>
