      <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

      <pre>COUNSEL:   D. Stortini for the appellant</pre>
      <pre>           L.J. Burns and F. Alibhai for the respondents</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:     October 13 and 14, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Dyson J. dated June 27, 1997.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  Following a fire that destroyed much of their house and its
contents, the respondents asserted a claim against the appellant,
their insurer.   The appellant resisted their claim on the basis
of arson and of fraud in the claim for contents.  After trial,
Dyson J. gave judgment for the respondents in an amount that was
substantially less than their claim.  The appellant appeals, and
the respondents cross-appeal, from the judgment at trial.</pre>
      <pre>The appeal</pre>
      <pre>[2]  On the issue of liability, Ms. Stortini took us through
passages in the transcripts and exhibits in an attempt to show
that, having regard to evidence of motive and to the speed and
intensity of the fire,  the respondents had been parties to arson
and that they had committed fraud in their claim for loss of
contents allegedly destroyed in the fire.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  We deal first with the defence of arson.  Having found that
the appellant had established that the fire was incendiary in
origin, Dyson J. reviewed the evidence relating to the
respondents’ motive and opportunity to set the fire and concluded
as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>          I was impressed by [Mrs. Mostafa’s]
          comportment when she indicated her husband
          was not the type of man to commit such an
          act.  I was impressed with the demeanour and
          responses of Mr. Mostafa when he was
          confronted directly with the accusation that
          he knew who committed the crime.  Further, I
          was impressed with the sincerity and emotion
          of the [respondents] in relation to the loss
          of many of their valued possessions and
          family heirlooms, which they clearly
          treasured.
          </pre>
      <pre>          I am satisfied that the [appellant] has not
          established on a balance of probabilities
          arson on the part of the [respondents].</pre>
      <pre>[4]  With respect to the alleged fraud in the respondents’ claim,
particularly with respect to two paintings for which Dyson J.
ultimately denied any recovery, he said:
          </pre>
      <pre>          With respect to the two Von Grutzner
          paintings, Mr. Mostafa stated that he had
          obtained the two paintings in a trade which
          had an agreed value of $20,000, but the goods
          that he exchanged were not, in his view
          worth, $20,000.  He stated that he knew
          nothing of Von Grutzner and he was leaving
          the assessment to the expert.  Rather than
          being fraudulent and wilfully misleading, I
          found Mr. Mostafa to be completely candid
          about this item.</pre>
      <pre>[5]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge, on the evidence
before him, to reach the conclusions he did respecting the
appellant’s allegations of arson and fraud, and we are not
persuaded that he committed any reversible error in reaching
those conclusions.</pre>
      <pre>[6]  The appellant took issue with Dyson J.’s decision to
dispense with the jury and try the action alone.  That decision
was made on the ninth day of a twelve-day trial, in response to
the second motion for such an order brought by the respondents.
In his ruling, Dyson J. stated that:
          </pre>
      <pre>          I’ve pondered the problems that have arisen
          as a result of the testimony, and I must say
          that the complexity that has arisen as a
          result of the evidence has given me great
          concern, particularly with respect to the
          issue of the value of the contents being
          considered by the jury after repudiation of
          the contract in January of 1991.  The issue
          of actual cash value or replacement cost is,
          again, one of considerable difficulty and
          complexity, not only for lay persons but for
          persons in the profession.
          </pre>
      <pre>          I was under the impression at the outset of
          the trial that the issue of arson or no arson
          was really the major and main issue to be
          decided by this jury.  However, it has become
          abundantly apparent that other complex issues
          must be put to the jury …Accordingly it is
          with great regret and reluctance that I am
          going to release the jury from their duties
          and consider the matter myself.</pre>
      <pre>[7]  This court will not interfere with a trial judge’s exercise
of discretion to take a case from a jury except where it is shown
that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or capriciously or
was based upon a wrong or inapplicable principle of law.  We are
not persuaded that Dyson J. made any such error in the present
case.</pre>
      <pre>[8]  Dyson J. ordered that the amount payable to the respondents
bear prejudgment interest at the rate of 10%  per annum from
January  4th, 1991, when the appellant denied their claim.  The
presumptive rate of prejudgment interest payable under the Courts
of Justice Act was 12.3% per annum.  Ms. Stortini submitted that
the average annual rate of prejudgment interest between 1991 and
the date of trial was 6.2%, and that Dyson J. erred in failing to
order prejudgment interest at that rate.</pre>
      <pre>[9]  In our view, this submission is without merit.  Had Dyson J.
seen fit to do so, it was open to him to award interest at the
presumptive rate of 12.3% mandated by s.128(1) of the Courts of
Justice Act.   Instead, he exercised his discretion under s.130
of that Act to reduce the interest rate to 10%.  He committed no
reversible error by failing to reduce the interest rate to the
still lower figure proposed by the appellant.</pre>
      <pre>[10] The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
      <pre>The Cross-Appeal</pre>
      <pre>[11] The respondents cross-appealed.  They sought to vary the
judgment at trial to allow damages for the loss of their house by
reference to replacement cost rather than actual cash value, and
to provide specifically for payment to them of the fee charged by
their public adjuster.</pre>
      <pre>[12] We deal first with the claim for replacement cost.  As noted
by Dyson J., the house was neither replaced nor repaired.
Although the respondents continued to maintain its carrying costs
until 1993, they then sold it and moved into another residence
closer to their place of business.  Their insurance policy with
the appellant specifically provided for payment of actual cash
value at the date of the occurrence if they did not repair or
replace the building.  Dyson J. committed no error in failing to
calculate the respondents’ award based on replacement cost.</pre>
      <pre>[13] For a fee of 7%, Alex N. Sill Insurance Adjustment Company
(Canada) Ltd. (“Sill”) undertook to assist in the calculation and
presentation of the respondents’ claim for building and contents.
The respondents submitted that Dyson J. should have ordered the
appellant specifically to pay the amount of Sill’s fee which, we
were advised, was approximately $79,000 plus interest.</pre>
      <pre>[14] For the appellant’s “bad faith” in dealing with the
respondents’ claim, Dyson J. ordered the appellant to pay to the
respondents their costs of the action on a solicitor and client
basis.  The quantification of those costs will entail the
assessment of the amount payable for reasonable disbursements for
services reasonably necessary to advance the respondents’
position at trial.  While that assessment will undoubtedly
include some amount referable to the Sill fee, we consider it
preferable to leave to the assessment officer the calculation of
the specific amount of that fee that should be assessed in the
context of the respondents’ solicitor and client costs.

[15] The cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.
