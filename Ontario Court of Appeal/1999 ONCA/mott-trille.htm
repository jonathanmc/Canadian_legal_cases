    <pre>On appeal from the order of Spence J. dated September 10, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]        Save  for  paragraphs 7, 9, 14, 16,  19  and  21,  the
appellant challenges all of the paragraphs in the order of Spence
J. We will address his main challenges one by one.
[2]       Paragraph 2 of the order below: in our view, Spence J.
was correct in striking out the claim to have the Watch Tower and
Bible Tract Society of Canada proceedings declared null and void.
The appellant does not contest the fact that these proceedings
have been set aside by these organizations and replaced by
subsequent proceedings. The declaration sought is in essence
moot. Moreover, the claim now sought to be made is based on an
alleged contractual right to due process rather than a right to
due process based on administrative law. There was no pleading to
found the contractual basis now being put forward nor was this
argument made before Spence J. The claim cannot be recast in this
fundamental way at this stage. This ground of appeal fails.
[3]       Paragraph one of the order below: the appellant seeks
to contest the order below striking the claims relating to the
Law Society proceedings and the appellant&#146;s disbarment, by
advancing this claim cast as an allegation of malicious
falsehood. It was not pleaded nor argued before Spence J. in this
way and would be an entirely new cause of action. Such a
fundamental amendment cannot be permitted at this stage. This
ground of appeal fails.
[4]       Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order below: the defamation
alleged is the incorrect statements made to the Law Society in
relation to the Legrove matter. In our view, it is plain and
obvious that these statements could not have harmed the
appellant&#146;s reputation. This claim was, therefore, properly
struck out. Since these statements found the conspiracy claim in
the context of the Law Society proceedings, it was properly
struck out as well.
[5]       Paragraph 8 of the order below: the appellant argues
that this claim survives because of Ms. Steed&#146;s breach of her
common law duty of confidentiality in revealing information
acquired on discovery. This again is a completely new claim. The
claim as pleaded and argued before Spence J. is based on written
terms of settlement. It cannot be so fundamentally altered at
this stage. This ground also fails.
[6]       The above paragraphs were the appellant&#146;s principal
points of attack on the order below. His remaining challenges can
be dealt with even more shortly. We agree with Spence J. that the
appellant has no standing to seek a declaration that the
defendants dealt improperly with Legal Aid. We also agree that
the appellant&#146;s request to enjoin proceedings which have now
taken place must be struck. Nor do we find any error in principle
in the disposition of costs made by Spence J. Finally, the
appellant advanced no argument to cast doubt on the remaining
paragraphs of the order below.
[7]       The appeal is dismissed with costs.
[8]       The cross-appeal raises four issues to be dealt with.
[9]       First, it is said that the claims based on gross
negligence should be struck. We agree. The relationship between
the appellant and the defendants cannot found the duty of care
alleged. Moreover, the only damages claimed flow not from the
negligence alleged, but from the discipline proceedings
themselves.
[10] Second, the claim for defamation in connection with the
Watch Tower Society should be struck. The representations on
which it is based are simply not defamatory of the appellant.
[11] Third, the conspiracy claim connected to these
representations must also fail, since the defamation claim itself
has been struck.
[12] Fourth, the claim for fees against Watch Tower must be
struck as an abuse of power. The appellant has simply made too
many assertions in too many forums that there was no agreement by
Watch Tower to pay his fees to be permitted to advance this
claim.
[13] Given these findings there is no need to deal with the claim
for security for costs.
[14] The cross-appeal is allowed with costs.
