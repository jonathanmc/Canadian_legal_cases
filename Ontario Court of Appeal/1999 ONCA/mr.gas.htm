    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. MR. GAS LIMITED (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, ROSENBERG and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Frank Addario,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Gene Assad,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 1, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by His Honour Judge David Dempsey on
August 11, 1995 and from the sentence imposed on January 26, 1996</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  The narrow issue in this case was whether there was evidence
to  support  a  finding on Count 6 that there had been  a  threat
within the meaning of s. 61(1)(a) of the Competition Act.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  parties  proceeded by way of an  agreed  statement  of
facts.   Judging the issue on the basis of that agreed  statement
of  facts,  we  think that there was not sufficient  evidence  to
permit the trial judge to draw the inference of a threat as  that
term has been defined in the authorities.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed, the conviction set
aside, and an acquittal entered.</pre></td>
