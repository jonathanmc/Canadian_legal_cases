    <pre>[1]  In determining the amount of child and spousal support
payable by the husband, the trial judge ascribed an annual income
to the husband of approximately $60,000. In our view, it was open
to the trial judge to make that finding and we see no basis for
interfering with it. The respondent did, however, concede that
for purposes of child support under the guidelines, the trial
judge erred in deducting CPP and UI payments and that the correct
annual income figure should have been $61,167.50 instead of
$58,526.40. It follows that the amount of child support should
have been $836 per month and paragraph 3 of the judgment is
varied accordingly.

[2]  With respect to spousal support, we are of the view that the
trial judge erred in fixing the amount of support at $700 per
month and that he also erred in limiting the duration of the
support payments to a period of 18 months. This was a traditional
marriage of some 17 years’ duration in which the husband worked
and the wife essentially managed the home and raised the couple’s
two children. The important role played by the wife left her
vulnerable and economically disadvantaged upon the break-up of
the marriage. In concluding that the wife should receive support
payments in the amount of $700 per month, the trial judge failed
to adequately consider the needs of the wife and in particular,
the fact that her monthly expenses, which were by no means
extravagant, exceeded her monthly income by more than $2,000.

[3]  Balancing the wife’s financial position against the
husband’s ability to pay, we believe that the amount of spousal
support should have been fixed at $1,100 per month and paragraph
6 of the judgment is varied accordingly.

[4]  With respect to the duration of the spousal support, the
trial judge placed undue emphasis on the desirability of the wife
achieving self-sufficiency. In effect, his order presumed that
the wife would become self-sufficient once she had achieved a
Grade XII education. This conclusion was not borne out by the
evidence. It was the position of the wife that to achieve self-
sufficiency, she intended to take a community college course of
some two years’ duration after obtaining her Grade XII degree.
Even then, there could be no assurance that the wife would
achieve the necessary degree of self-sufficiency warranting a
clean break.

[5]  In our view, the wife’s goals were both reasonable and
laudable and the order for spousal support should have reflected
this. In all of the circumstances, we are of the view that the
wife was entitled to spousal support for a period of five years
commencing November 1, 1997 and terminating on November 1, 2002.
Paragraph 7 of the judgment is varied accordingly.

[6]  In addition, the judgment is varied to include a term that
on November 1, 2002 or before, either party may apply to the
court to reconsider the wife’s entitlement to support and any
continuation of support. The quantum of support, if any, should
be decided in light of all of the circumstances as may then exist
and upon application of ss. 15(5) and (7) of the Divorce Act,
R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.).

[7]  For the sake of clarity, the above variations are
retroactive to November 1, 1997.

[8]  The wife is entitled to her costs of the appeal.</pre></td>
