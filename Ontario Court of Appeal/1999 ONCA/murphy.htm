    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The issue in this case was the proper interpretation  of  a</pre>
    <pre>separation   agreement  and,  in  particular,  what  rights   and</pre>
    <pre>obligations  arose  from the clause dealing  with  the  appellant</pre>
    <pre>husband’s pension from Ontario Hydro.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]   In her action, the respondent wife was claiming for amounts</pre>
    <pre>not paid to her in respect of the appellant husband’s pension. It</pre>
    <pre>appears  to  be  common  ground  between  the  parties  that   if</pre>
    <pre>maintained,  the  judgment  for the amount  found  owing  to  the</pre>
    <pre>respondent  also  effectively determines the ongoing  rights  and</pre>
    <pre>obligations of the parties under the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[1]</pre>
    <pre>[3]   It  was the appellant’s position at trial that the November</pre>
    <pre>28, 1984 separation agreement did not reflect the true intentions</pre>
    <pre>of  the  parties  and that it should be rectified  to  include  a</pre>
    <pre>provision that the respondent’s entitlement to any proceeds  from</pre>
    <pre>his  pension would terminate upon her remarrying or entering into</pre>
    <pre>a common law relationship for a period of 30 days or more.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge refused to give effect to this argument, and</pre>
    <pre>granted  judgment to the respondent. We believe  that  the  trial</pre>
    <pre>judge  committed two errors which require the judgment to be  set</pre>
    <pre>aside and a new trial ordered.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The  evidence of the appellant was that the  “Revisions  to</pre>
    <pre>Proposed  Separation Agreement”, signed by both parties, resolved</pre>
    <pre>all  the  outstanding issues between them and that  very  shortly</pre>
    <pre>thereafter, the agreement, upon which the respondent relies,  was</pre>
    <pre>executed.  The appellant’s version is supported by the letter  of</pre>
    <pre>November 20, 1984 from his solicitor and was not disputed by  the</pre>
    <pre>respondent. Despite the uncontradicted evidence of the  appellant</pre>
    <pre>that the outstanding issues between the parties were resolved  by</pre>
    <pre>the  “Revisions  to  Proposed Separation  Agreement”,  the  trial</pre>
    <pre>judge, in refusing to grant rectification, appears to have  based</pre>
    <pre>his  decision, at least in part, upon the assumption  that  there</pre>
    <pre>were further negotiations:

</pre>
    <pre>          I  don’t  have any evidence about the context
          in  which that negotiation took place  and  I
          think that’s important because I have no idea
          what  horse  trading went  on  between  these
          parties.  It may well be that as at the  time
          Exhibit  Five  [the  “Revisions  to  Proposed
          Separation  Agreement”] was signed  that  was
          the  substance or at least a portion  of  the
          substance   of  the  bargain  between   these
          people.  But a month later or so,  they  sign
          the new document and it’s different. How am I
          to  tell  whether  or  not  some  compromises
          weren’t  made  and  some changes  in  various
          other entitlements or positions unless I know
          the   entire   course  of  history   or   the
          negotiations  and I don’t have  the  evidence
          from the lawyers.
</pre>
    <pre>     [6]  In our view, on the basis of the record before him, the</pre>
    <pre>trial  judge  was not entitled to engage in the speculation  that</pre>
    <pre>there were further negotiations that could have altered the terms</pre>
    <pre>reflected by the “Revisions to Proposed Separation Agreement”.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  trial judge also stated that if he were to accept  the</pre>
    <pre>evidence  of  the  appellant, he would, in effect,  be  making  a</pre>
    <pre>finding  that  the appellant’s solicitor “committed malpractice”.</pre>
    <pre>As  the  solicitor had not testified and was not otherwise before</pre>
    <pre>the  court, the trial judge concluded that he could not make that</pre>
    <pre>finding:</pre>
    <pre>          [1]  I’m not prepared to make any finding of fact which might
          lead to that conclusion in the absence of the lawyer having an
          opportunity to defend himself.
</pre>
    <pre>     [8]   In  our  view, the trial judge imposed an  unwarranted</pre>
    <pre>constraint  on the right of the parties to have the case  decided</pre>
    <pre>on  the  basis  of  the admissible evidence.  A  finding  in  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant’s favour, had that been the result, would have  had  no</pre>
    <pre>adverse consequences for the solicitor who could not be bound  by</pre>
    <pre>the  result  and  who  had no right to be heard  in  the  present</pre>
    <pre>proceedings.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]   In view of the issues and evidence as a whole, we find that</pre>
    <pre>these  errors are sufficient to cast doubt on the judgment  under</pre>
    <pre>review.   As  the  case  gives  rise  to  difficult   issues   of</pre>
    <pre>interpretation  which turn, in part at least, on credibility,  it</pre>
    <pre>would  not  be  appropriate  for this  court  to  substitute  its</pre>
    <pre>determination for that of the trial judge.  Accordingly, we order</pre>
    <pre>a new trial.

</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  matter of costs, both of the first trial and  of  this</pre>
    <pre>appeal,  should be left to the discretion of the trial  judge  on</pre>
    <pre>the new trial.</pre></td>
