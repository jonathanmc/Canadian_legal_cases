    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an application by the appellant Crown for a stay of
the declaratory judgment of Pitt J. to the following effect:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Ontario Works Act and Regulations must be read as
          requiring meaningful consultation and explicit concurrence of the
          band councils and bands prior to implementation, and in the
          absence of such explicit concurrence are unenforceable.  The
          institution of this proceeding by the applicants is unambiguous
          evidence of an absence of such concurrence. [emphasis in
          original]</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The record indicates that the Ontario Works Act, the
province&#146;s primary social assistance programme, is currently
being delivered to members of bands living on reserves by 108
Ontario bands, including the respondent bands.  The Ontario Works
Act replaced earlier legislation pursuant to which bands had
delivered social assistance to their members since the late
1950&#146;s.
[3]  It is common ground that the three-stage test identified in
Metropolitan Stores v. Manitoba (Attorney General), (1987) 1
S.C.R. 110 is applicable:
          </pre>
    <pre>               First, a preliminary assessment must be made of the merits
          of the case to ensure that there is a serious question to be
          tried.  Secondly, it must be determined whether the applicant
          would suffer irreparable harm if the application were refused.
          Finally, an assessment must be made as to which of the parties
          would suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of the
          remedy pending a decision on the merits.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The respondents concede that there is a serious question to
be tried on the merits and accordingly, the motion must be
determined on the basis of irreparable harm and balance of
convenience.
[5]  In my view, the Attorney General has demonstrated that there
is a sufficient risk of irreparable harm to justify a stay.
According to the evidence before me, there are some 7,000
households province-wide which receive social assistance
administered by bands.  Eight to nine hundred households fall
within the authority of the respondent bands.  While counsel
reached an agreement for disbursement of social assistance
benefits for the months of September and October, there is no
arrangement in place for November forward and it is unlikely that
this appeal will be heard prior to December.
[6]  It does not seem possible or practicable to conduct votes by
the members of all 108 bands prior to November.  The respondents
submit that the Attorney General could comply with the spirit of
Pitt J.&#146;s declaration by obtaining the agreement of the band
councils to administer the funds pending the appeal.  That is
difficult to reconcile with the language of the judgment which
specifically requires the &#147;explicit concurrence of the band
councils and bands prior to implementation&#148;.  It seems to me,
accordingly, that even if I were to adopt the suggestion advanced
by the respondents, some form of stay of Pitt J.&#146;s order would be
required.  I conclude, accordingly, that if some form of stay is
not granted, there is a serious risk that thousands of
individuals will not receive needed primary social assistance.
[7]  In my view, it would not be appropriate to accept the
suggestion advanced by counsel for the respondent, namely, that
the province be required to secure the consent of band councils
in their designation as delivery agents under the Ontario Works
Act.  Given the number of bands involved and the short period of
time available to implement alternative arrangements should all
or any of the bands refuse their consent, it is my view that this
proposal, if accepted, poses a risk that those entitled to
benefits might not receive them due to an administrative lapse or
hiatus.
[8]  I find as well that the balance of convenience favours
granting a stay.  It is common ground that the bands are the most
appropriate authority to administer social assistance to
individuals living on reserves.  Administration of these benefits
is a complex matter requiring knowledge of local conditions and
the circumstances of social assistance recipients.  To require a
significant alteration in the administrative arrangements
necessary for distribution of social assistance before legal
issues have been finally resolved, would be a cumbersome, costly
and potentially unnecessary course of action.  In assessing the
balance of convenience, I take into account the fact that the
respondents have secured a judicial declaration which is
determinative of their rights unless and until set aside or
varied on appeal.  I cannot ignore, however,  the fact of the
appeal and the concession that there is a serious issue to be
dealt with on the appeal.
[9]  I come, finally, to Mr. Klippenstein&#146;s submission that any
stay should be on the basis of preservation of the &#147;approximate
status quo position&#148;.  Indeed, it was submitted that although the
bands refuse to take any formal step that might be seen as waiver
of what they assert to be their legally protected right of self-
government, they could, as a practical matter, live with &#147;the
approximate status quo&#148; pending determination of the appeal.
[10] This suggestion that any limitation should be placed upon
the authority to administer the Ontario Works Act and Regulations
as the government sees fit was strongly resisted by Ms. Sterling.
She submitted that while those responsible to the administration
of the Act would be bound by its terms, the court should not
impose any limitations on the right of the responsible
authorities to implement and administer the Act as they see fit.
[11] While I accept the case presented by the Attorney General
for a stay of Pitt J.&#146;s order,  I find there to be some merit in
the submission that something approaching the present status quo
should be maintained pending final determination of the appeal.
The difficulty, of course, is to define present status quo.  It
is apparent that the Ontario Works Act and Regulations is a
complex and dynamic scheme.  Decisions must be taken on a daily
basis with respect to individual recipients, and more broadly,
with respect to what is described as the &#147;roll out&#148; of the
government&#146;s policy reflected by the legislation.  After giving
the matter careful consideration, I have decided that my formal
order should simply stay the judgment of Pitt J. pending the
determination of this appeal, but I add to this endorsement the
following observations in the expectation that they will provide
guidance to the parties.
[12] The Attorney General has come before this court to ask for
the extraordinary discretionary relief of a stay of a duly
pronounced judgment.  I have acceded to the arguments advanced by
the Attorney General as, in my view, it is imperative that
arrangements remain in place to ensure that individuals will
continue to receive social assistance benefits to which they are
legally entitled.  On the other hand, an important right is
asserted by the respondents and was accepted by Pitt J., namely,
the Aboriginal right of self-government.  While it remains to be
seen whether the arguments in favour of that right will prevail
in this court, they clearly found favour with Pitt J. and, for
the time being at least, his judgment represents the law of the
province.
[13] In granting the Attorney General a stay in this matter, it
is my expectation that the same spirit that motivated the
application for a stay, namely, the desire to maintain the
present arrangements for the delivery of social assistance
benefits and to avoid administrative chaos, would guide the
responsible authorities in the decisions they take with respect
to administration of the Act.  While I certainly do not suggest
that the stay should freeze matters precisely in the state as
they now exist, I do say that it would be contrary to the spirit
of this order for the appellant to alter significantly the
present arrangements with the bands for the administration of the
Act and Regulations pending the determination of this appeal.
[14] For these reasons, I grant the motion and stay the judgment
of Pitt J. pending the determination of the appeal.  The Attorney
General did not seek costs of this motion and I make no order as
to costs.
[15] It is common ground that this appeal should be heard as
early as possible.  In the circumstances, should the parties seek
an earlier date than is available from the Registrar, they should
seek direction from the Associate Chief Justice.</pre>
