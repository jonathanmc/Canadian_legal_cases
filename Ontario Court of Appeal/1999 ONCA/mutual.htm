    <pre>On appeal from the orders of Ferguson J. dated October 16, 1996
and German J. dated April 2, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Authorities in the Russian Federation are investigating
allegations of theft and corruption involving Russian citizens,
one of whom was a government official.  The investigative trail
led them to Canada where they requested the assistance of the
Canadian authorities in pursuing the investigation.  That request
eventually resulted in the two orders which are the subject of
this appeal.  The appeal is taken pursuant to leave granted by
Weiler J.A.
[2]  The appellant, Xeme Inc., appeals from the order of Ferguson
J. made under s. 18 of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal
Matters Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.30 (4th Supp.) (the Act).  That ex
parte order, referred to as the &#147;gathering&#148; order, directed that
copies of documents in the possession of the R.C.M.P. be turned
over to Corporal James Hillyard of the R.C.M.P.  The documents
had been seized from the appellant&#146;s business premises and three
banks.  They were seized and detained by the R.C.M.P. under the
authority of search warrants issued in connection with a criminal
investigation they were conducting.  The Canadian investigation
arose as a result of information provided by the Russian
investigators and concerned with some of the same events as the
Russian investigation.
[3]  The appellant also appeals from the order of German J. made
under s. 20 of the Act.  She directed that the documents turned
over to Corporal Hillyard be sent to the Russian Federation.
This order is referred to as a &#147;sending&#148; order.  The proceedings
before German J. were taken on notice to the appellant (and other
interested parties who are not parties to this appeal) and
following a hearing in which counsel for the appellant cross-
examined Corporal Hillyard and made extensive submissions.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant raises five issues:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  Is the administrative arrangement between Canada
     and the Russian Federation ineffective by virtue of its
     failure to specify the type of legal assistance
     requested?</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  Could German J. order certain documents produced
     under the authority of the gathering order be sent to
     the Russian Federation even though those documents were
     not specifically referred to in the request made by the
     Russian Federation?</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  Could German J. make a sending order affecting
     documents that may have related to offences which were
     the subject of an amnesty order made by a competent
     authority in the Russian Federation?</pre>
    <pre>     (4)  Could German J. make a sending order even though
     Corporal Hillyard conceded on cross-examination that an
     unspecified number of the documents were not relevant
     to his investigation?</pre>
    <pre>     (5)  Could German J. make a sending order even though
     Corporal Hillyard conceded on cross-examination that an
     unspecified number of the documents had not been
     examined or translated and that he could not,
     therefore, say they were relevant?</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Some of the grounds of appeal are directed at both orders.
Others attack only the sending order.  It is the appellant&#146;s
contention that if any of them succeed, the sending order must be
quashed.
[6]  Before considering the grounds of appeal, I will summarize
the factual background giving rise to the orders, the statutory
scheme established by the Act, the diplomatic steps leading to
this application and the orders made by Ferguson J. and German J.</pre>
    <pre>The Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The facts revealed by the lengthy investigations conducted
by Canadian and Russian investigators are complicated.  For
present purposes, a simplified version of those events will
suffice.  Stable nuclear isotopes are used in various scientific,
medical and commercial endeavours.  These isotopes are very
valuable as the technology needed to produce them is
sophisticated and expensive.  One gram of an isotope is worth
anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000 on the world market.  They are
produced in only two locations in the world, one in Russia and
one in the United States.  Isotopes produced in Russia are
designated either for the domestic or the world market.  The
price established on the domestic market is fixed by the
government and is substantially below prices for the same
isotopes on the world market.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In 1990 and 1991, Alexandre Pokidyshev was the General
Director of the government agency controlling the production and
sale of stable nuclear isotopes by Russia.  The investigation in
Russia revealed that Pokidyshev conspired with one Alexandre
Rodionov and others to illegally export approximately 800
isotopes from Russia.  These isotopes were obtained at domestic
prices under the pretense that they were to be sold in the
domestic market.  In fact, it was intended that the isotopes
would be removed from Russia and sold on the world market at much
higher prices.
[9]  Rodionov, with the cooperation of Pokidyshev, transferred
some 800 isotopes from Russia to Canada using various corporate
entities under Rodionov&#146;s control.  Pokidyshev received various
bribes, some of which were transferred in and out of bank
accounts in Canada.  About $150,000 was traced through
Pokidyshev&#146;s accounts in Canada.
[10] The appellant is one of the several corporate vehicles used
by Rodionov to effect the removal of the isotopes from Russia,
the transfer of the isotopes to Canada, the subsequent transfer
of money to corporate entities in the United States controlled by
Rodionov and the bribery of Pokidyshev.  The investigation
revealed that the appellant and the other corporate entities
conducted no business apart from that related to the isotopes and
that they were effectively controlled by Rodionov.
[11] In June 1994, the Russian Federation obtained Letters
Rogatory in Canada to assist in their investigation.  According
to the material filed in support of the application, the stable
nuclear isotopes which had been stolen from Russia were illegally
exported to Canada and were being sold on the world market
through corporate entities in Canada.  This information led the
R.C.M.P. to commence a criminal investigation in August 1994.
That investigation paralleled the Russian investigation but, of
course, sought evidence in relation to the commission of offences
in Canada.  The R.C.M.P. executed several search warrants,
including warrants on the business premises of the appellant.
Material seized under those warrants was ordered detained for the
purposes of the domestic investigation under the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Code.  The Russian authorities
initially sought access to the documents under the provisions of
the Criminal Code, but eventually abandoned that effort in favour
of the applications which resulted in the orders under appeal.
[12] The R.C.M.P. have charged Rodionov with paying secret
commissions contrary to s. 426 of the Criminal Code.  Rodionov,
who resided in Canada at one time, has since taken up residence
in a country which does not have an extradition treaty with
Canada.  There is a warrant outstanding for his arrest.
[13] Some of the isotopes which are the subject matter of this
investigation are currently being held by customs officials in
the United States.  They were seized from companies controlled by
Rodionov.  According to the U.S. authorities, these isotopes have
a value of over $95 million on the world market.</pre>
    <pre>The Statutory Scheme</pre>
    <pre>[14] The arguments advanced on appeal turn largely on the
interpretation of various sections of the Act.  The process of
statutory interpretation requires that the court look to the
words of the statute, the scheme of the statute as a whole and
the purpose and intention of Parliament when it passed the Act:
R. v. Gladue (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 397-98 (S.C.C.).
[15] The purpose of this Act is clear.  By 1988, when the Act was
proclaimed, international crime had become a major problem.
Criminals, especially sophisticated ones, used the limits imposed
on police and prosecutors by national borders to facilitate their
criminal schemes and avoid detection:  United Kingdom v. Ramsden
(1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 294-95 (Ont. C.A.), leave to
appeal to S.C.C. refused May 1, 1997.  In 1988, Canada had
international obligations under various treaties and conventions
to assist other states in the investigation and detection of
crime, but had no domestic legislation in place to provide the
necessary assistance and co-operation.  The Act filled that void
and must be read with that purpose in mind.
[16] The Act addresses various kinds of help that Canada and
foreign states can provide to each other in their efforts to
combat international crime.  This appeal is concerned with Part I
of the Act which provides various means by which a foreign state
can obtain information from sources in Canada to assist that
foreign state in its investigation of criminal activity.
[17] The overall scheme of Part I of the Act may be described in
these terms.  The foreign state seeking Canada&#146;s assistance must
have a treaty with Canada as defined in the Act (s. 2).
Alternatively, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Canada must
have entered into an administrative arrangement with the foreign
state providing for assistance in the particular investigation
being conducted by the foreign state (s. 6).  If a treaty or
administrative arrangement is in place, the foreign state may
request the assistance of the Canadian authorities.  Requests for
assistance made by foreign states under the Act must be approved
by the Minister of Justice (s. 11(1), s. 17(1)).  If the Minister
approves the request, a competent Canadian authority (in this
case the Attorney General for Ontario) shall, where the request
requires a court order for its implementation, make the necessary
application to a superior court (s. 11(2), s. 17(2)).  If the
court grants the order and further orders the material sent to
the foreign state, the material can only be sent if the Minister
of Justice is satisfied that the foreign state will comply with
the terms of the order (s. 16, s. 21).
[18] Under the Act, the Minister of Justice serves as the
guardian of Canadian sovereignty interests.  She effectively
controls both ends of the process.  No request goes forward
without her approval and no sending order is implemented without
her approval.  The central role of the Minister of Justice in the
process reflects the essentially political nature of decisions
involving international relations.  These decisions properly rest
with the executive arm of the federal government which is
responsible for the conduct of Canada&#146;s foreign relations:
Republic of Argentina v. Mellino (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 334 at
349 (S.C.C.).
[19] The judiciary also plays a role under Part I of the Act.  In
the request for assistance, the competent authority may seek the
issuance of a search warrant (s. 11, s. 12), the examination of
persons under oath in Canada (s. 17, s. 18), or the production of
documents located in Canada (s. 17, s. 18).  These compulsory
measures can be invoked only where a judge of the Superior Court
of the province so orders (s. 12, s. 18).  In making the order,
the judge must be satisfied that the statutory conditions
precedent to the order have been met.  Any information obtained
under these orders can be sent to the foreign jurisdiction only
if the court so orders (s. 15, s. 20).  In exercising its
jurisdiction to order information sent to the foreign
jurisdiction, the court may place terms and conditions on the
sending order (s. 15(1)(b), s. 20(2)).  In deciding what terms,
if any, to impose, the court must consider both the interests of
parties affected by the order and the need to give effect to the
request made by the foreign state.
[20] The judicial role under Part I of the Act is twofold.  The
judge must ensure compliance with the statutory conditions
precedent to the making of the order requested and the judge must
craft an order which balances the legitimate state and individual
interests at stake:  United Kingdom v. Hrynyk (1996), 107 C.C.C.
(3d) 104 at 117 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).  The terms of the order
will depend, to a large extent, on the nature of the order made
and the individual interests affected by the order.  For example,
where the order involves the taking of evidence from a person, it
may well be necessary to impose terms which will protect that
person&#146;s right not to incriminate herself:  e.g. see United
States of America v. Ross (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 320 (Que.
C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused February 8, 1996;
United Kingston v. Hrynyk, supra.</pre>
    <pre>The Diplomatic Steps</pre>
    <pre>[21] On January 19, 1996, the Russian ambassador to Canada wrote
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs requesting Canada&#146;s assistance
in respect of an ongoing investigation by the Russian authorities
in conjunction with the R.C.M.P.  The investigation was said to
relate to the offences of bribery, the payment and acceptance of
secret commissions and the theft of stable nuclear isotopes from
the Russian Federation.  The details of that investigation were
set out in Letters Rogatory which were incorporated by reference
in the ambassador&#146;s letter and attached to that letter.  The
Letters Rogatory made it clear that the Russian authorities were
investigating the possible misappropriation of the isotopes, the
payment of bribes to a Russian official and the abuse of power by
that official.    The Letters Rogatory requested information
concerning certain bank accounts and also asked that certain
persons be questioned by the Canadian authorities.
[22] The ambassador&#146;s request concluded in these words:
          </pre>
    <pre>            My Government should be grateful if Canadian authorities
       would provide this legal assistance through any means available
       under Canadian Law and proposes that this note, together with
       your reply, constitute an administrative arrangement providing
       for legal assistance which will enter into effect on the date of
       receipt of your reply and will remain in effect for six months
       from that date.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The ambassador&#146;s reference to &#147;administrative arrangement&#148;
takes one to s. 6(1) of the Act which provides that the Minister
of Foreign Affairs may, where there is no treaty between Canada
and another state, &#147;&#133;enter into an administrative arrangement
with that other state providing for legal assistance with respect
to an investigation specified therein. &#133;&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[24] By letter dated February 7, 1996, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs for Canada acknowledged the ambassador&#146;s request and
wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Under section 6 of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal
       Matters Act of Canada, the Minister of Foreign Affairs may enter
       into an administrative arrangement with another state to provide
       legal assistance in a specific case.  Your letter and this
       response will constitute such an administrative arrangement under
       the Act in order to provide legal assistance to the Russian
       Federation in the case of Mr. Alexandre Mikhailovich POKIDYSHEV,
       Mr. Alexandre Yakovlevich RODIONOV, the Centre for Stable
       Isotopes and XEME Inc. as set out in the Russian letter rogatory
       of June 4, 1994, and supplementary letters rogatory of November
       14, 1995 and November 20, 1995.  This arrangement has been
       approved by the Minister of Justice of Canada and will remain in
       effect for six months from the date of this letter.</pre>
    <pre>[25] On April 5, 1996, the Russian authorities made a formal
request for assistance under s. 17 of the Act.  That request set
out the offences being investigated by the Russian authorities
(bribery, theft, misuse of official position), detailed the facts
which had been revealed by the Russian and R.C.M.P.
investigations to that point and sought orders requiring
production to the Russian authorities of copies of documents
seized from the appellant&#146;s place of business and from various
financial institutions.
[26] In July 1996, the Russian ambassador requested a renewal of
the administrative arrangement.  As with the initial request, the
ambassador asked the Canadian authorities to provide &#147;legal
assistance through any means available under Canadian law.&#148;  The
Minister of Foreign Affairs renewed the administrative
arrangement as of August 7, 1996.
[27] On September 17, 1996, the Canadian authorities, pursuant to
s. 17 of the Act, formally approved the Russian request dated
April 5, 1996.  That approval specifically referred to providing
copies of documents seized by Canadian law enforcement agencies.
[28] On October 16, 1996, the Attorney General of Ontario, a
&#147;competent authority&#148; under the Act, applied for a gathering
order under s. 17(2) of the Act.  The application was supported
by the affidavit of Corporal Hillyard.  In that affidavit he
summarized the diplomatic steps leading to the application, the
Russian investigation and the Canadian investigation.   Based on
his investigation and the documents provided by the Russian
authorities, he concluded that the seized documents would provide
evidence to the Russian authorities in respect of offences over
which the Russian court had jurisdiction.  He listed these
offences as theft (misappropriation of entrusted property), abuse
of authority or power of office, giving and receiving a bribe,
and intermediation in bribery.  Corporal Hillyard also indicated
that he had been made aware of an amnesty decree declared by the
Russian Federation and had sought advice from the Russian
authorities as to the relevance of that decree to this case.  He
stated that the authorities had advised him in writing that the
decree would have no effect on the offences or persons being
investigated in this matter.  The letter was attached to his
affidavit.
[29] The application led to the gathering order made by Ferguson
J. and eventually to the sending order made by German J.</pre>
    <pre>The Orders Under Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[30] The gathering order made by Ferguson J. was made under s.
18(2)(b) which provides that a judge may:
          </pre>
    <pre>            order a person named therein to make a copy of a record or
       to make a record from data and to produce the copy or record to
       the person designated under paragraph (c). &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[31] Before Ferguson J. could make the order, he had to be
satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  that an offence had been committed with respect to which the
  foreign state had jurisdiction (s. 18(1)(a));  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>    that evidence of the commission of the offence will be found
  in Canada (s. 18(1)(b)).</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[32] The affidavit of Corporal Hillyard filed before Ferguson J.
provided ample grounds for both findings.
[33] In making his order, Ferguson J. was also required to
consider whether the order should &#147;include any terms or
conditions that the judge considers desirable, including those
relating to the protection of the interests of the person named
therein and of third parties&#148; (s. 18(5)).  Ferguson J. imposed
such a term by requiring that notice be given to various parties,
including the appellant, of any application to send the gathered
material to the Russian Federation.  That notice was given.
[34] Following compliance with the order of Ferguson J., Corporal
Hillyard, the person designated to take possession of the
documents by Ferguson J., made the report required by s. 19 of
the Act.
[35] The order of German J. was made under s. 20(1), the relevant
parts of which read:
          </pre>
    <pre>            A judge to whom a report is made under subsection 19(1) may
       order that there be sent to the foreign state the report and any
       record or thing produced, as well as a copy of the order &#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[36] In making that order, German J. was required to consider
whether any terms or conditions should be included in the sending
order.  Section 18(2) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>            An order made under subsection (1) may include any terms or
       conditions that the judge considers desirable, after having
       considered any representations of the Minister, the competent
       authority, the person who produced any record or thing to the
       person designated under paragraph 18(2)(c) and any person who
       claims to have an interest in any record or thing so produced,
       including terms and conditions
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  necessary to give effect to the
          request mentioned in subsection 17(1);
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  with respect to the preservation
          and return to Canada of any record or thing
          so produced;  and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  with respect to the protection of
          the interests of third parties.</pre>
    <pre>[37] German J. imposed no such terms and, as I understand the
submissions, no terms were sought before her or in this court.</pre>
    <pre>The Grounds of Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[38] Before turning to the specific grounds of appeal, I will
address in more general terms the function of the judge under s.
20 of the Act.  Section 20(1) provides that a judge &#147;may order
the produced material sent to the foreign jurisdiction&#148; and s.
20(2) states that a judge &#147;may impose terms and conditions on
that order.&#148;  Both subsections give the judge a discretion.
Neither require, as s. 15 does when the material gathered was
seized by a search warrant, that the judge satisfy herself that
the material was gathered in accordance with the gathering order.
Nor must the judge acting under s. 20 be satisfied that the
material will afford evidence of the commission of an offence in
a foreign jurisdiction.  I do not regard s. 20 as providing
either an appeal from or a review of the gathering order under s.
18.
[39] The discretion vested in a judge by s. 20(1) and s. 20(2) is
framed broadly so that the judge may consider the specific issues
raised in a particular application made for an order to send
material to the foreign jurisdiction.  Those issues will involve
a consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of
the material which the applicant seeks to have sent to the
foreign jurisdiction and the representations made by the
applicant or any other party appearing on the application for the
sending order.  For example, where a party with an interest in
the material contends that it has no connection to the
investigation of any crime within the foreign state&#146;s
jurisdiction, the judge will consider that submission and any
evidence relevant thereto in deciding what order, if any, to make
under s. 20.  Similarly, if an interested party contends that the
s. 18 order was based on false or inaccurate information or
offers additional information which is relevant to the basis upon
which the gathering order was obtained, the s. 20 judge can hear
evidence and any factual findings she makes can be factored into
both her decision to make the order and her decision as to the
terms, if any, to be included in the order.  The factors to be
considered by the s. 20 judge will depend on the circumstances of
each application.
[40] There are, however, limits on the discretion vested in the
s. 20 judge.  These limits flow from the nature of the judicial
role in the process contemplated by the Act.  In my view, a judge
under s. 20 is not concerned with the advisability of assisting
the foreign jurisdiction or whether the foreign jurisdiction will
comply with any order the judge might make.  Those matters must
be addressed by the Minister of Justice.  Similarly, I do not
think that a judge on a s. 20 application can be concerned with
either the ultimate evidentiary value of the requested material
to the foreign jurisdiction or with the conduct of any
proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction:  United States of
America v. Ross (1994), 44 B.C.A.C. 228 (B.C.C.A.), per Southin
J.A. (In Chambers).</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1:   Is the administrative arrangement between Canada and
the Russian Federation ineffective by virtue of its failure to
specify the type of legal assistance requested?</pre>
    <pre>[41] Counsel for the appellant submits that the exchange of
letters between the Russian ambassador and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs did not specify the type of legal assistance
requested by the Russian Federation and could not, therefore,
constitute an administrative arrangement, within the meaning of
s. 6 of the Act.  He submits that as there was no proper
administrative arrangement the court had no jurisdiction to make
any order under the Act.
[42] The respondent submits that when the documentation is
considered in its entirety, the nature of the legal assistance
requested is clearly set out.
[43] Section 6(1) permits the Minister of Foreign Affairs
(Secretary of State), with the approval of the Minister of
Justice, to enter into administrative arrangements with foreign
states that do not have a treaty with Canada for the purpose of
providing assistance in the investigation of crime.  Section 6(4)
of the Act directs that the arrangement will be effective &#147;&#133;with
respect to the type of legal assistance that is specified
therein.&#148;
[44] The administrative arrangement does not trigger any
application under the Act or necessarily result in any judicial
proceeding.  It creates the necessary diplomatic channels for a
subsequent request by a foreign state for assistance.  If a
request is made and if the Minister of Justice approves it, an
application for assistance will be made to the court by a
&#147;competent authority.&#148;  The judicial phase of the process
contemplated by the Act begins with the application triggered by
the foreign state&#146;s request and the Minister&#146;s approval under s.
17.
[45] I doubt that a judge acting under s. 18 or s. 20 of the Act
can review the terms of an administrative arrangement to
determine whether these terms conform with the Act.  Nothing in
either section suggests that a judge should look behind the
application and the request to satisfy herself that the Canadian
and foreign authorities have properly established the necessary
diplomatic channels for the making of the request.
[46] In any event, I need not come to any final conclusion as to
whether a judge acting under s. 18 or s. 20 can consider the
validity of the administrative arrangement.  I am satisfied that
the letters exchanged between the ambassador and the Secretary of
State considered along with the appended documents made the
nature of the requested assistance clear.  The letter from the
Russian ambassador referred to Letters Rogatory which set out the
nature of the investigation in some detail.  That same letter
requested assistance &#147;through any means available under Canadian
law.&#148;  The reply from the Secretary of State acknowledged that
the letter and his response would &#147;constitute such an
administrative arrangement under the Act in order to provide
legal assistance&#133;.&#148;  I think on any sensible reading of the
ambassador&#146;s letter and the response, the administrative
arrangement contemplated legal assistance by any or all of the
means set out in Part I of the Act.  In my view, s. 6 does not
require more specificity in the description of the type of legal
assistance to be provided under an administrative arrangement.
Certainly, the Minister of Justice could require more
specificity, but that is a matter for the Minister.
[47] Furthermore, in this case, the Letters Rogatory made it
clear that the Russian authorities wanted access to material in
the possession of the R.C.M.P.  When the exchange of letters is
read in conjunction with the description of the investigation in
the attached Letters Rogatory, it is obvious that the Russians
were seeking help in gaining access to materials seized by the
R.C.M.P. in the course of their parallel investigation.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2:   Could German J. order certain documents which
were the subject of the gathering order be sent to the
Russian Federation when those documents were not
specifically the subject of the request made by the Russian
Federation?</pre>
    <pre>[48] Copies of documents relating to an account of Alexandre
Pokidyshev seized from a branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce were included in the gathering order made by Ferguson J.
These documents contained evidence of the bribes allegedly paid
by Rodionov to Pokidyshev.  The documents had been seized by the
R.C.M.P. under the authority of a warrant issued after the
Russian authorities had made their request for assistance in
April 1996.  Consequently, the Russian request did not refer to
these documents.  The affidavit sworn by Corporal Hillyard in
support of the application for the gathering order did, however,
describe these documents and set out reasonable grounds to
believe that the documents could afford evidence of the
commission of one of the enumerated offences in Russia.
[49] The appellant acknowledges that the documents were relevant
to the investigation, but submits that as they were not
specifically identified in the request for assistance, they could
not be included in the gathering order.  It follows, the
appellant contends, that if they were not properly the subject of
a gathering order, German J. should not have ordered them sent to
the Russian Federation. This submission relates to five of the
hundreds of documents that are subject to the gathering and
sending orders.
[50] This submission is without merit.  Nothing in the Act
suggests that the request from the foreign state must comply with
the statutory prerequisites to a gathering order set out in s.
18(1).  The section refers by incorporation to the application
being made by the &#147;competent authority.&#148;  In this case, the
application contains the affidavit of Corporal Hillyard and the
attachments to that affidavit including the request.  Ferguson J.
was entitled to look at all of the information filed on the
application in determining what documents should be included in
the gathering order.  Corporal Hillyard&#146;s affidavit clearly
establishes the basis for including the copies of the documents
related to Pokidyshev&#146;s bank account.
[51] Not only does the language of the Act not support this
submission, but there is also considerable merit to the
respondent&#146;s contention that this interpretation would render the
Act useless in some situations.  In some cases, although not this
one, the foreign state will not be able to identify specific
documents, or the exact location of the documents.  In such
situations, if the appellant is correct, a foreign state could
not make an effective request even though the &#147;competent
authority&#148; could provide an affidavit with the necessary
information.  The suggestion that in those cases the &#147;competent
authority&#148; should first give the information to the foreign
authority who can then include it in the request would create a
needless formality.
[52] There is a second reason why this submission must be
rejected.  It relates to copies of documents that had been seized
from Pokidyshev&#146;s bank account.  The appellant has no connection
to or interests in those documents.  There is nothing in the
material which provides any basis upon which the appellant could
have standing to challenge the application for an order sending
these documents to the Russian Federation:  United Kingdom v.
Ramsden, supra, at pp. 303-306.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3:   Could German J. make a sending order when the
documents related to offences which were the subject of an
amnesty order made by a competent authority in the Russian
Federation?</pre>
    <pre>[53] In his factum, counsel for the appellant submits:
          </pre>
    <pre>            The order to gather and send extend to documents which, on
       the uncontested evidence, may relate solely to offences which are
       no longer within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation to
       prosecute.</pre>
    <pre>[54] In making this submission, the appellant relies on the
evidence that some of the offences may have been the subject of
an amnesty order.  On the material contained in the application
for the gathering order and on the evidence heard before German
J., there appears to be some controversy as to the effect of the
amnesty order.  There is direct evidence that the order would
have no effect on any of the charges being investigated.  It is
also acknowledged by the appellant that at least two of the
offences are not affected by the amnesty order.  In my view, it
would have been inappropriate for either Ferguson J. or German J.
to come to any conclusion as to the scope of the amnesty order or
its effect on the jurisdiction of the Russian court.  The
possibility of an amnesty in Russia was no reason to refuse to
make the orders requested.
[55] In any event, the offences referred to in the material all
arise out of the same chain of events.  All of the documents
sought were relevant to the investigation of all of the offences.
It could not realistically be said that a particular document was
relevant to one offence but not to the others.  Consequently,
whatever the scope and effect of the amnesty order, it had no
bearing on the exercise of the authority granted under both s. 18
and s. 20.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 4:   Could German J. make a sending order even though
Corporal Hillyard conceded on cross-examination that an
unspecified number of the documents were not relevant to his
investigation?</pre>
    <pre>[56] Counsel for the appellant submits that German J. had no
jurisdiction to send documents to the Russian Federation because
Corporal Hillyard conceded on cross-examination that some of the
documents were irrelevant to his investigation.  As I understand
the submission, counsel argues that this concession required that
German J. refuse to order that any of the documents be sent to
Russia.
[57] Counsel acknowledges that at the investigative stage of a
criminal proceeding, the court must take a generous view of
relevance.  This is particularly so in complex commercial
investigations.   Counsel also accepts that the judge acting
under s. 20 is not concerned with the ultimate admissibility of
any of the documents in a Russian court.  He contends, however,
that no matter how generous a view of relevance one takes, it
cannot extend to documents that the officer in charge of the
investigation has deemed to be irrelevant.
[58] The gathering and sending orders cover a voluminous number
of documents.  Most of the material which had been seized
pursuant to the search warrant issued under the Criminal Code
were included in the gathering and sending orders.  On the
evidence adduced before German J., the appellant&#146;s business
related exclusively to the isotopes which were the subject matter
of the Russian investigation.  The bulk of the documents which
were the subject of the sending order were copies of documents
seized from the appellant&#146;s place of business or from its
accounts at various banks.  A small number of the documents were
seized from banks and related to accounts of other individuals or
corporations.  The appellant, of course, had no standing to
object to any order with respect to these documents.
[59] It is important to recognize the nature of the appellant&#146;s
submission before German J.  She was not asked to examine
specific documents and to exclude those documents from the
sending order because they were not relevant.  Rather, she was
asked to refuse to make any order on the basis that the cross-
examination of Corporal Hillyard demonstrated that the Russian
authorities were on a &#147;fishing expedition.&#148;
[60] German J. was entitled to approach the question of relevance
on a broad basis.  In my view, relevance in this context means
helpful to the authorities in discovering, understanding and
proving the complex events underlying the allegations which were
the subject matter of the Russian investigation.
[61] In cross-examination, Corporal Hillyard acknowledged that he
had decided that some of the documents were not relevant to his
investigation and that copies of those documents were included
among those which were to be sent to the Russian Federation.
Corporal Hillyard was not asked how many documents came within
this category or the basis upon which he had concluded that the
documents were not relevant to his investigation.
[62] I think the appellant incorrectly equates Corporal
Hillyard&#146;s determination that certain documents were not relevant
to the domestic investigation with a conclusion that they could
have no relevance to the ongoing Russian investigation.  The two
investigations were joint, but not the same.  The Canadian
investigation related to specific offences over which the
Canadian courts had jurisdiction and not to potential offences
which were within the Russian jurisdiction.   Corporal Hillyard&#146;s
determination of relevance was also no doubt based in part on his
knowledge of the documents and the information available to the
Canadian authorities as a result of the seizure and examination
of the documents.  The Russian authorities had not had the
opportunity to see all of the documents to assess their relevance
in the context of their investigation.  Corporal Hillyard&#146;s
assessment of relevance in the context of the specific Canadian
allegations and informed by the Canadian rules of evidence and
the knowledge gained by the examination of the documents is not
determinative of the relevance of the documents to the Russian
authorities.  German J. was entitled to consider all of the
circumstances.
[63] Given that the appellant had no business other than that
related to the isotopes, it seems an obvious conclusion that all
of the business and financial records of the company were
relevant in the broad sense of the word to a criminal
investigation involving those isotopes.
[64] It would be inconsistent with the spirit of international co-
operation underlying the Act to foreclose access to all of the
documents, many of which have undoubted relevance to the Russian
investigation, simply because an officer had conceded that some
were not relevant to the domestic investigation.  The so-called
admission made by Corporal Hillyard did not deprive German J. of
the jurisdiction to make the sending order.  Nor did it support a
finding that the Russian request was a &#147;fishing expedition&#148; or
provide a reason for refusing to make the sending order.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 5:    Could German J. make a sending order even though
Corporal Hillyard conceded that an unspecified number of the
documents had not been examined or translated and he could not,
therefore, say that they were relevant?</pre>
    <pre>[65] The argument in support of this ground of appeal is
essentially the same as that advanced on the fourth ground of
appeal.  If anything, it is weaker because it is premised on an
inability to positively say that certain documents were relevant
as opposed to an admission that certain documents were not
relevant in the officer&#146;s opinion.  My analysis and conclusion
with respect to the fourth ground of appeal apply to this
argument as well and I need not repeat them.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[66] I would dismiss the appeal.
