    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  principal  grounds  of  appeal  in  this  appeal  from</pre>
    <pre>conviction  for  sexual assault concern the  admissibility  of  a</pre>
    <pre>statement  the appellant gave to the police at the  time  of  his</pre>
    <pre>arrest.  The appellant submits that the statement is inadmissible</pre>
    <pre>on  both  common  law  and Charter grounds.  The  appellant  also</pre>
    <pre>argues that the trial judge placed undue weight on his failure to</pre>
    <pre>call  certain  witnesses.  For the reasons that follow,  I  would</pre>
    <pre>dismiss this appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was tried by Mossop J. on two counts of sexual</pre>
    <pre>assault  relating  to separate complainants.  The  appellant  was</pre>
    <pre>acquitted  on  one  of  the counts, and  thus  this  appeal  only</pre>
    <pre>concerns his conviction for the sexual assault of the complainant</pre>
    <pre>T.G.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The appellant was approximately 35 years of age at the time</pre>
    <pre>of  the  alleged assault.  Ms. G. was 14 years old at  the  time.</pre>
    <pre>Her  father and the appellant were friends, and she had done some</pre>
    <pre>baby-sitting  for  the  appellant.   On  February  3,  1994,  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant  and the complainant met by chance at a hospital  where</pre>
    <pre>the  appellant&#146;s mother was a patient.  After they  visited  with</pre>
    <pre>the appellant&#146;s mother briefly, the appellant and the complainant</pre>
    <pre>returned  to  the  appellant&#146;s  apartment.   According   to   the</pre>
    <pre>complainant, the appellant gave her liquor and drugs.  She  began</pre>
    <pre>to feel dizzy and lay down on the couch.  Then the appellant then</pre>
    <pre>sexually assaulted her.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  appellant denied the allegations.  He  testified  that</pre>
    <pre>after  he and the complainant visited with his mother they  split</pre>
    <pre>up and he went downtown to play pool in a tournament.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The appellant was originally arrested on July 11, 1995 with</pre>
    <pre>respect to the count upon which he was ultimately acquitted.   He</pre>
    <pre>was  arrested a second time on February 28, 1996 in  relation  to</pre>
    <pre>the count involving T.G.  The statements made by the appellant at</pre>
    <pre>that  time were relied upon by the trial judge in convicting  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant.
</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</pre>
    <pre>          
               1.   The appellant&#146;s rights under ss. 7 and 10(b) of the
          Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed because the
          appellant was denied the opportunity to speak to his counsel of
          choice.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The trial judge erred in failing to
          find  that  the  statement  was  inadmissible
          because of a threat or inducement offered  by
          the arresting officer.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The trial judge erred in drawing an
          adverse  inference from the  failure  of  the
          defence  to call certain witnesses who  could
          discredit the complainant.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The Counsel of Choice Issue
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   There is a preliminary issue with respect to the ground  of</pre>
    <pre>appeal  concerning  the  alleged  violation  of  the  appellant&#146;s</pre>
    <pre>rights.  It seems apparent that at trial, defence counsel limited</pre>
    <pre>his submissions concerning the admissibility of the February 28th</pre>
    <pre>statement to common law voluntariness grounds.  Ms. Klukach,  for</pre>
    <pre>the  Crown  respondent,  agreed that it was  still  open  to  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant to argue this ground of appeal in light of the decision</pre>
    <pre>of  the  Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Brown, [1993] 2  S.C.R.</pre>
    <pre>918.   In  that  case, a majority of the Court  agreed  with  the</pre>
    <pre>dissenting  reasons of Harradence J.A. in the  Alberta  Court  of</pre>
    <pre>Appeal (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 481.  Harradence J.A. had held,  at</pre>
    <pre>p. 488, that it was open to an appellant to raise a Charter issue</pre>
    <pre>for  the  first  time on appeal if &#147;the court  has  a  sufficient</pre>
    <pre>factual foundation to appraise the issue without prejudice to the</pre>
    <pre>parties  and particularly where refusing to do so will result  in</pre>
    <pre>unfairness&#148;.   In this case, the statement was videotaped  and  a</pre>
    <pre>transcript of the videotape was available to this court.   Having</pre>
    <pre>heard  counsel&#146;s  submissions, the court was satisfied  that  the</pre>
    <pre>respondent  was  not prejudiced by defence counsel&#146;s  failure  to</pre>
    <pre>raise  this  issue  in  the trial court and  we  agreed  to  hear</pre>
    <pre>argument on the Charter issues.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  appellant  was  arrested with respect  to  the  charge</pre>
    <pre>involving  T.G. at approximately noon on February 28, 1996.   The</pre>
    <pre>arrest  took  place  on the day prior to the  date  set  for  the</pre>
    <pre>preliminary inquiry on the other charge.  The appellant was fully</pre>
    <pre>advised  of  his  right to counsel and given the standard  police</pre>
    <pre>cautions,  including the advice that he was &#147;not obliged  to  say</pre>
    <pre>anything  unless you wish to do so&#148;.  The appellant  advised  the</pre>
    <pre>officer that he wished to speak to a lawyer.  The actual dialogue</pre>
    <pre>between the appellant and the officer was as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               Officer:  Okay.  Um, if you like I know you want to call a
          lawyer right now.  Would you like me to fill you in on some of
          the details of the allegations prior to calling a lawyer?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:     I'd prefer to wait for a
          lawyer present, please.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:   I  doubt that you  will  get
          somebody present but uh, do you want  a  duty
          counsel  that  you  have something  for  your
          lawyer to tell you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Okay.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:  Just so you know.   I'm  sure
          he's going to want to know a little bit.   Do
          you have a specific lawyer you want to call?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Not at present, no.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Officer:  Pardon me?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Not at present, no.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:  Okay.  So legal aid, is  that
          what you want to go through?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:     Um, I have a  lawyer  at
          the  moment, but, he may be in court at  this
          time, so, in regards to the other case.  That
          is due tomorrow.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:  Okay.  His office may be able
          to  get in touch with him.  Do you want me to
          try that one first or to get legal aid?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     If possible, yeah.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Officer:  Okay.  And that is &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:     Uh, Tugender.   I  don't
          know his first name.  In Preston.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Officer:  Well, I'll leave it up to you.
          Do you want me to get you the phone right now
          and  you  try him first before I go into  the
          details of the allegation? (unintelligible)
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Well, I'll listen to what
          you  have  first and then contact the  lawyer
          immediately
          afterwards.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The police officer then proceeded to outline the allegations</pre>
    <pre>made by Ms. G.  Up to this point the appellant&#146;s rights under  s.</pre>
    <pre>10(b)  of  the Charter were not violated.  Although the appellant</pre>
    <pre>obviously  had  a  lawyer retained on the other  charge,  it  was</pre>
    <pre>apparent that he was content to obtain initial advice from  legal</pre>
    <pre>aid  duty  counsel.   Further, although the  appellant  initially</pre>
    <pre>indicated that he wished to speak to a lawyer at once, he  almost</pre>
    <pre>immediately  changed his mind and chose to hear  the  allegations</pre>
    <pre>that  had been made against him and later answer questions.   See</pre>
    <pre>R. v. Roper (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 204 (C.A.).

</pre>
    <pre>[10] After she outlined the allegations, the police officer asked</pre>
    <pre>the  appellant  if he had any questions.  The following  dialogue</pre>
    <pre>then ensued.</pre>
    <pre>          
               Appellant:     Unless I have a lawyer present, please.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  Officer:    Okay.    So   I'll    try
          Mr. Tugender's office first?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Uh huh.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Officer:  Okay.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:   Okay   W.,  I  have  the
          videotape  back on.  We put  in  a  call  for
          legal aid.  First we put the call in to  your
          lawyer, Mr. Tugender.  And he was in court so
          we put the call in to legal aid.  That was at
          12:42.   And then finally at 1:30  legal  aid
          phoned  back and you spoke to a Stan Kasinski
          &#150;   does  that  sound  right?   And  are  you
          satisfied  now that you've had  proper  legal
          instruction?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Appellant:     Uh huh.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:   Okay.  Um, as you know  when
          you were in last time I explained the details
          of  the  allegations to  you.   I've  already
          explained  them basically to you  now  and  I
          want  you to have the opportunity if you want
          to  say  anything or question anything  about
          it,   the   videotape's  on,  now   is   your
          opportunity to ask anything else  that  you'd
          like to know about it.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:      Uh, not unless  I  have
          legal advice with me.  That's what I was told
          just now, so.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:  I'm sure (unintelligible) not
          coming in though, right?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:     No, he said he'd get  in
          touch  with my other lawyer, or get in  touch
          with a lawyer and then go to it from there.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Officer:   Okay.  That's all  fine  and
          well  but this is your opportunity as far  as
          I'm  concerned.  I'm not calling you in again
          with  a  lawyer to give you that opportunity.
          So  if  there's anything you want to question
          me about before you're released okay, this is
          kind of the only time.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:      Uh, well, basically  no
          there isn't because of the, still brought  up
          before the judge, or before the lawyer, so he
          can read the report anyways and then question
          it from there.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Officer:  Do you mind if I ask you a few
          questions?   You don't have to  answer.   But
          I'm  just going to ask you a couple, just for
          my own clarification.  If you do in fact know
          a [T.G.], or did know?
          </pre>
    <pre>                Appellant:      I  do know  her,  yeah.
          [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The officer then proceeded to question the appellant.   The</pre>
    <pre>trial  judge  relied upon the answers given by the  appellant  to</pre>
    <pre>find that the appellant was not a credible witness.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] Counsel for the appellant placed particular emphasis on  the</pre>
    <pre>parts  of the appellant&#146;s statements that I have underlined.   He</pre>
    <pre>argued that the officer violated the appellant&#146;s rights when  she</pre>
    <pre>continued to question him in the face of his request to speak  to</pre>
    <pre>Mr.  Tugender,  the lawyer he had retained for the other  charge.</pre>
    <pre>It  seems  to me that this part of the interview is  open  to  at</pre>
    <pre>least two interpretations:</pre>
    <pre>          
               1.   The appellant had not received adequate legal advice;
          or
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The appellant had received adequate
          legal  advice from duty counsel, but did  not
          wish   to  be  questioned  unless  a  lawyer,
          preferably Mr. Tugender, was present.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
</pre>
    <pre>[13] If the appellant had not received adequate legal advice from</pre>
    <pre>duty  counsel,  and  was still seeking assistance  from  his  own</pre>
    <pre>lawyer, I would have no difficulty in finding a violation of  his</pre>
    <pre>rights   under  s.  10(b)  of  the  Charter  in  the   particular</pre>
    <pre>circumstances of this case.  The governing principles are set out</pre>
    <pre>by Lamer J. in R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 10:</pre>
    <pre>          
                    At this juncture, I would underline the fact that the
          appellant Leclair was asked if he wanted to call another lawyer
          and his answer was &quot;no&quot;. The Crown's submission was that by
          giving this answer Leclair waived his right to counsel. I do not
          agree. Leclair had clearly indicated that he wished to contact
          his lawyer. The mere fact that he did not want to call another
          lawyer cannot fairly be viewed as a waiver of his right to retain
          counsel. Quite the contrary, he merely asserted his right to
          counsel and to counsel of his choice. Although an accused or
          detained person has the right to choose counsel, it must be noted
          that, as this court said in R. v. Tremblay, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 435
          (S.C.C.), a detainee must be reasonably diligent in the exercise
          of these rights and if he is not, the correlative duties imposed
          on the police and set out in Manninen are suspended. Reasonable
          diligence in the exercise of the right to choose one's counsel
          depends upon the context facing the accused or detained person.
          On being arrested, for example, the detained person is faced with
          an immediate need for legal advice and must exercise reasonable
          diligence accordingly. By contrast, when seeking the best lawyer
          to conduct a trial, the accused person faces no such immediacy.
          Nevertheless, accused or detained persons have a right to choose
          their counsel and it is only if the lawyer chosen cannot be
          available in a reasonable time that the detainee or the accused
          should be expected to exercise the right to counsel by calling
          another    lawyer.    [Emphasis    in    bold
          added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[14]  In  this  case, there was no pressing need to  conduct  the</pre>
    <pre>interview  at  the  time  chosen  by  the  police  officer.   The</pre>
    <pre>allegations related to an event that had occurred over two  years</pre>
    <pre>earlier.   The  officer  knew that the  appellant  had  a  lawyer</pre>
    <pre>retained  for  the  other charge who would,  at  the  latest,  be</pre>
    <pre>available the following day at the preliminary inquiry.   If,  as</pre>
    <pre>was likely the case, Mr. Tugender was in court, he would probably</pre>
    <pre>have  been  available sometime after court  recessed.   In  fact,</pre>
    <pre>within  minutes of the interview resuming, Mr. Tugender did  call</pre>
    <pre>the  station  and  was  able  to  speak  to  the  appellant.   In</pre>
    <pre>circumstances  such as this, I would hold that the appellant  was</pre>
    <pre>entitled  to  attempt  to obtain advice  from  that  lawyer.   It</pre>
    <pre>follows that if the appellant had asserted that right and had not</pre>
    <pre>already  spoken to a legal aid lawyer, the police  officer  would</pre>
    <pre>have been obliged to cease questioning the appellant.

</pre>
    <pre>[15]  However,  that is not what occurred in this  interview.  In</pre>
    <pre>response to a direct question from the officer whether he had had</pre>
    <pre>&#147;proper  legal instruction&#148; the appellant apparently  replied  in</pre>
    <pre>the affirmative.  His later statement that he did not want to ask</pre>
    <pre>anything  of  the  officer &#147;unless I have legal advice  with  me&#148;</pre>
    <pre>indicates  not a request for further advice, because the  initial</pre>
    <pre>advice was inadequate, but a statement that he would not ask  the</pre>
    <pre>officer anything about the allegations until he had a lawyer with</pre>
    <pre>him.   However,  as  the  law now stands, the  Charter  does  not</pre>
    <pre>guarantee  an  adult offender the right to have a lawyer  present</pre>
    <pre>during  questioning.1  McLachlin J. made  that  clear  in  R.  v.</pre>
    <pre>Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151 at 184 in the following excerpt  from</pre>
    <pre>her summary of the right to silence rule:</pre>
    <pre>          
                    First, there is nothing in the rule to prohibit the
          police from questioning the accused in the absence of counsel
          after the accused has retained counsel. Presumably, counsel will
          inform the accused of the right to remain silent. If the police
          are not posing as undercover officers and the accused chooses to
          volunteer information, there will be no violation of the Charter.
          Police persuasion, short of denying the suspect the right to
          choose or depriving him of an operating mind, does not breach the
          right to silence.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Since the appellant did not have the right to have  counsel</pre>
    <pre>present  during the questioning, the officer was not  obliged  to</pre>
    <pre>cease  questioning the appellant in the face of such  a  request.</pre>
    <pre>Accordingly,  the  appellant&#146;s rights were not  infringed  merely</pre>
    <pre>because the officer continued to question the appellant.

</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Even  if  this part of the dialogue with the  officer  were</pre>
    <pre>equally open to the two interpretations, the appellant could  not</pre>
    <pre>succeed  on  this  ground.  The burden was on  the  appellant  to</pre>
    <pre>establish a violation of his Charter rights.  He did not  testify</pre>
    <pre>on  the  voir dire, and there was no other evidence to  establish</pre>
    <pre>that  he  was asserting a right to proper legal advice  from  his</pre>
    <pre>counsel of choice.

</pre>
    <pre>[18] Finally, there is nothing in the transcript of the interview</pre>
    <pre>from  which  I can find that the appellant&#146;s right to choose  was</pre>
    <pre>overborne  by  any  police conduct.  The appellant  said  he  had</pre>
    <pre>received  proper legal advice.  He had been interviewed  by  this</pre>
    <pre>same  officer in relation to the other charge.  He was  aware  of</pre>
    <pre>his  rights,  but  for  reasons of his own chose  to  answer  the</pre>
    <pre>officer&#146;s questions.  Since the appellant has not established any</pre>
    <pre>violation of his Charter rights this ground of appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>          
               2.   Common law voluntariness
</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge&#146;s reasons on the voir dire were brief and he</pre>
    <pre>made few findings of fact.  The thrust of the ruling was that the</pre>
    <pre>police  questioning  was  not  so oppressive  as  to  render  the</pre>
    <pre>statement  involuntary.  Counsel for the appellant  submits  that</pre>
    <pre>the  trial judge erred in failing to find that the statement  was</pre>
    <pre>involuntary by reason of a threat or inducement.  He relies  upon</pre>
    <pre>this statement by the officer:</pre>
    <pre>          
               Okay.  That&#146;s all fine and well but this is your opportunity
          as far as I&#146;m concerned.  I&#146;m not calling you in again with a
          lawyer to give you that opportunity.  So if there&#146;s anything you
          want to question me about before you&#146;re released today, this is
          kind           of          the           only
          time.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[20]  Counsel  for  the appellant argues that this  statement  is</pre>
    <pre>misleading by suggesting to the appellant that this would be  his</pre>
    <pre>only  opportunity to give his side of the story.  However, in  my</pre>
    <pre>view, the words used do not fairly bear that interpretation,  and</pre>
    <pre>they  amount to neither a threat nor an inducement.  The  officer</pre>
    <pre>had   made   it  clear  that  the  appellant  would  be  released</pre>
    <pre>irrespective  of whether he gave a statement or  not.   She  also</pre>
    <pre>made no promise to the appellant, such as an offer of psychiatric</pre>
    <pre>or other assistance in exchange for a statement, as in R. v. Bird</pre>
    <pre>(1989),  50  C.C.C.  (3d) 89 (Man. C.A.).  There  is  nothing  to</pre>
    <pre>indicate that the appellant felt that he was under any obligation</pre>
    <pre>to give a statement or that this would be his only chance to give</pre>
    <pre>his  side  of  the  story.  To the contrary, in response  to  the</pre>
    <pre>statement from the officer set out above, the appellant  declined</pre>
    <pre>the offer and said the following:</pre>
    <pre>          
               Uh, well, basically no there isn&#146;t because of the, still
          brought up before the judge, or before the lawyer,  so he can
          read the report anyways and then question it from there.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[21] It follows that I can find no basis for interfering with the</pre>
    <pre>trial  judge&#146;s finding of fact that the statement was  voluntary.</pre>
    <pre>I would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          
               3.   Adverse inference from the failure of the defence to
          call certain witnesses.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[22]  In  his  statement to the police officer the appellant  was</pre>
    <pre>asked  why  the  complainant  would make  this  allegation.   The</pre>
    <pre>appellant replied as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               I have no idea except for the fact that um, at that time she
          was having difficulties with other people in the city such as
          stealing and uh blackmailing, which is what she&#146;s doing here to
          me because I wouldn&#146;t give her drugs, booze, cigarettes or money.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[23] In his examination in chief at the trial, the appellant  was</pre>
    <pre>asked  whether he had any explanation for the accusation made  by</pre>
    <pre>the  complainant against him.  The appellant said that he had &#147;no</pre>
    <pre>idea&#148;  why  he was accused by either of the complainants.   Crown</pre>
    <pre>counsel   cross-examined   the   appellant   on   this   apparent</pre>
    <pre>inconsistency and the appellant returned to the position  in  his</pre>
    <pre>statement  that the complainant had previously tried to blackmail</pre>
    <pre>him.  He also said that his former girlfriend was</pre>
    <pre>present on some of these occasions and she warned him never to be</pre>
    <pre>alone  with the complainant because she would &#147;pull this kind  of</pre>
    <pre>stuff&#148;  by accusing somebody of touching her.  He also said  that</pre>
    <pre>the  complainant&#146;s own father had told the appellant  not  to  be</pre>
    <pre>alone  with  her  since he too had been falsely  accused  by  the</pre>
    <pre>complainant.   He  also alleged that the complainant  had  stolen</pre>
    <pre>from, and attempted to blackmail, many other people.

</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In  his  reasons  for judgment, the trial  judge  said  the</pre>
    <pre>following about this aspect of the appellant&#146;s testimony:</pre>
    <pre>          
                    There was a great deal of evidence adduced from the
          accused that seemed to relate the actions of the complainant &#133; to
          a series of blackmail attempts and successes which were based on
          hearsay evidence allegedly transmitted to the accused.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  do  not  find  such  accusations  as
          contributing  anything to the  resolution  of
          the issue before the court.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  my  view the evidence  of  the
          accused  is  suspect as  being  tainted.   It
          strikes  me  that the accused has  created  a
          scenario  after  the event to  establish  his
          innocence.   Given his propensity to  promote
          his  evidence  by creating non-witnesses  who
          did  not  appear at the trial  I  find  great
          difficulty in accepting his story related  to
          [T.G.].
          

</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Counsel for the appellant made essentially two  submissions</pre>
    <pre>in  relation to these parts of the trial judge&#146;s reasons.  First,</pre>
    <pre>since  the  defence would have been precluded from  leading  this</pre>
    <pre>evidence  by  the  collateral fact rule there was  no  basis  for</pre>
    <pre>drawing  an adverse inference.  Second, in any event,  the  trial</pre>
    <pre>judge  erred  in  the circumstances of this case  in  drawing  an</pre>
    <pre>adverse  inference  from the failure to call witnesses  who  were</pre>
    <pre>equally available to the Crown and the defence.

</pre>
    <pre>[26] I find it unnecessary to deal with the first point since, in</pre>
    <pre>my  view,  the impugned portions of the reasons do not constitute</pre>
    <pre>an improper comment on the failure to call witnesses.  To repeat,</pre>
    <pre>the first portion was as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               There was a great deal of evidence adduced from the accused
          that seemed to relate the actions of the complainant &#133; to a
          series of blackmail attempts and successes which were based on
          hearsay evidence allegedly transmitted to the accused.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  do  not  find  such  accusations  as
          contributing  anything to the  resolution  of
          the          issue         before         the
          court.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[27]  In  my view, at this point the trial judge is only  dealing</pre>
    <pre>with the appellant&#146;s evidence and his attack on the complainant&#146;s</pre>
    <pre>credibility.   The trial judge, quite properly attributes  little</pre>
    <pre>weight  to that part of the appellant&#146;s evidence because most  of</pre>
    <pre>it was based on hearsay.

</pre>
    <pre>[28]  The  portion  of  the reasons for  judgment  to  which  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant takes particular exception is the following:</pre>
    <pre>          
               In my view the evidence of the accused is suspect as being
          tainted.  It strikes me that the accused has created a scenario
          after the event to establish his innocence.  Given his propensity
          to promote his evidence by creating non-witnesses who did not
          appear at the trial I find great difficulty in accepting his
          story related to [T.G.].
          

</pre>
    <pre>[29] I do not read this part of the reasons as drawing an adverse</pre>
    <pre>inference from the failure to call any witness.  Rather, it is  a</pre>
    <pre>comment on the appellant&#146;s manner of testifying.  The more he was</pre>
    <pre>cross-examined, the more the appellant embellished his story  and</pre>
    <pre>tried  to  support  it  with  an  increasingly  diverse  cast  of</pre>
    <pre>characters,  most of whom the appellant was unable  to  identify.</pre>
    <pre>For example, in relation to the alibi (he claimed to be at a pool</pre>
    <pre>tournament) he was pressed for the names of some of the people he</pre>
    <pre>played  with and could not give any.  He claimed there were  many</pre>
    <pre>people the complainant was blackmailing but could not name any of</pre>
    <pre>them,  other  than  his former girlfriend  and  the</pre>
    <pre>complainant&#146;s  father.   He  claimed  that  the  complainant  was</pre>
    <pre>stealing from many people including her father, mother,  and  her</pre>
    <pre>aunts.   It  is  apparent that the trial  judge  found  that  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant  was simply fabricating this evidence in an attempt  to</pre>
    <pre>support  his own story.  It is a finding amply supported  by  the</pre>
    <pre>record.  It is not so much that they were not called, they  could</pre>
    <pre>not  be named.  I am satisfied that the trial judge did not place</pre>
    <pre>improper  emphasis on the failure to call witnesses and  did  not</pre>
    <pre>draw an adverse inference from the failure to call witnesses.
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION

</pre>
    <pre>[30] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.
