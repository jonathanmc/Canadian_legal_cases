    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice N. Borkovich dated
June 8, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  John and Olga Nahatchewitz were married on June 15, 1992.
They then lived together in the house which the husband owned at
12 Maurice Street, in Kitchener, Ontario.  On October 1, 1993,
while the wife was on a trip back to her native Ukraine, he sold
the Maurice Street house and used the proceeds to buy a house at
128 Dekay Street, in Kitchener, where they lived together from
her return until they separated in December 1995.
[2]  The central issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge
erred in denying the husband a deduction for the value of the
Maurice Street property in the calculation of his net family
property.
[3]  For the reasons that follow I have concluded that the trial
judge erred, that a deduction must be given, and that the appeal
on this issue must be allowed.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  At the time of the marriage, the appellant husband was
seventy years old and was living in the Maurice Street property
which he had owned since 1988. He had been married twice before.
[5]  The respondent wife was fifty years old at the date of the
marriage.  She had not been married before.  She had lived and
worked her entire life in the Ukraine before coming to Canada in
June 1991 to visit her brother in Edmonton.
[6]  Shortly before the wife was to return to the Ukraine, she
met and married the appellant.  She then applied to stay
permanently in Canada, supported by the husband, who executed an
Undertaking of Assistance for her to Immigration Canada.
[7]  In August of 1992, the Canadian immigration authorities
required that the wife leave Canada temporarily.  As a result,
she travelled to the Ukraine and did not return to Canada until
October 27, 1993.
[8]  While the wife was away, the husband sold the Maurice Street
property for $101,000 and purchased the Dekay Street property
with the proceeds.  With what the trial judge properly found to
be the unprofessional complicity of his lawyer on the
transaction, the husband signed the deed for the Maurice Street
property declaring that he was not a spouse.
[9]  When the wife returned to Canada, the husband and his lawyer
had her sign her consent on a second deed for the property which
the lawyer held in case of future difficulties.  While the trial
judge rejected the evidence of the wife that if she had been
aware of the consequences of signing she would have requested
that the Dekay Street property be put in their joint names, he
did find that her consent was obtained in circumstances
tantamount to fraud so as to vitiate the transfer.
[10] The parties continued to live together in the Dekay Street
property until late 1995 when they separated.
[11] At trial, there were two outstanding issues, namely the
equalization of net family property under the Family Law Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. F-3 (&quot;the Act&quot;) and spousal support.
[12] In deciding the first of these the trial judge accepted the
evidence of the wife as contained in her Net Family Property
Statement.  He then said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               For calculating the amount of the net family property, I
          have found that the value of Maurice Street matrimonial home is
          not deductible.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The resulting calculation yielded an equalization payment
from the husband to the wife of $61,800.
[14] The trial judge disposed of the spousal support issue by
determining that in all the circumstances, including the
husband's Undertaking of Assistance given to Immigration Canada,
the wife should receive a lump sum payment of $15,000.
[15] Finally, the trial judge ordered that because the wife had
remained throughout in the Dekay Street property there would be
no order of pre-judgment interest.  He ordered costs to the wife
on a party-and-party basis to trial and thereafter on a solicitor-
client basis, apparently because of offers that had been made.
[16] The husband's main ground of appeal is the failure of the
trial judge to permit a deduction for the value at the date of
the marriage of the Maurice Street property in the net family
property calculation of the husband.  He also appeals the support
order and the costs order.  The wife cross-appeals from the
denial of pre-judgment interest.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[17] The central question raised in this appeal is the treatment
of the Maurice Street property and the net family property
determination.  In my view, the answer is clearly indicated by
the governing legislation, and the interpretation given to it in
the case law.
[18] The relevant sections of the Act are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   (1)   In this Part,
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;matrimonial home&quot; means a matrimonial
          home under section 18 and includes property
          that is a matrimonial home under that section
          at the valuation date;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;net family property&quot; means the value of
          all the property, except property described
          in subsection (2), that a spouse owns on the
          valuation date, after deducting,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the spouse's debts and other
          liabilities, and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  the value of property, other than a
               matrimonial home, that the spouse owned on
               the date of the marriage &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               18.   (1)  Every property in which a
          person has an interest and that is or,
          if the spouses have separated, was at
          the time of separation ordinarily
          occupied by the person and his or her
          spouse as their family residence is
          their matrimonial home.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Pursuant to s. 4 the husband is entitled to deduct from his
net family property the value of the Maurice Street property as
property he owned on the date of the marriage, unless the
matrimonial home exception applies.
[20] Section 18 requires that where spouses have separated, to
qualify as a matrimonial home, the property must have been the
family residence of the spouses at the time of separation.
[21] In this case, at the time of separation the Maurice Street
property was not ordinarily occupied by the parties as their
family residence.  The fact that it had at one time prior to
separation been so occupied is not enough to bring it within the
legislative definition of matrimonial home.
[22] I can find no policy basis to support the opposite
conclusion for the Maurice Street property.  The policy
imperative of the legislation is clear: in calculating net family
property a matrimonial home is to be treated differently from
other property owned at the date of the marriage.
[23] To exclude from this exception a property which was a
matrimonial home at the date of marriage but ceased to be at the
time of separation is no less defensible than to include such a
property as a matrimonial home but exclude from net family
property the funds brought into the marriage by one spouse which
were thereafter used to buy it.  Either could be attacked for
creating anomalous and unfair results inconsistent with the
fundamental objective of the legislation.  Or each could be
defended as in some measure achieving the objective of treating a
matrimonial home differently in the net family property
calculation.  Hence there is no policy victory achieved by
including the Maurice Street property within the definition of
matrimonial home in calculating net family property.
[24] Given that there is no overriding policy consideration that
would dictate otherwise, the ordinary meaning of the legislation
must prevail.
[25] This reading of the legislation is supported by the relevant
jurisprudence.  With one exception, it uniformly employs the
interpretation I have set out.  The leading case remains Folga v.
Folga (1986), 2 R.F.L. (3d) 358 (Ont. H.C.J.).  For the most
part, it has been consistently followed.  See, for example, West
v. West (1997), 33 R.F.L. (4th) 56 (Ont.Gen. Div.).
[26] Only Miller v. Miller (1987), 8 R.F.L. (3d) 113 (Ont. Dist.
Ct.) concludes that a matrimonial home owned by one spouse on the
date of the marriage but no longer serving as such at the time of
separation cannot form a deduction from that spouse's net family
property.  For the reasons I have given I find this conclusion
unsustainable in the face of the governing legislation.  I am
fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Miller has been
explicitly rejected (see Smith v. Smith (1995), 13 R.F.L. (4th)
379 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  It has also been the subject of adverse
commentary. See Susanne Goodman, Family Law: Reference Materials,
37th Bar Admission Course: Phase 3 (Toronto: Law Society of Upper
Canada, 1995) c. 21 at p. 21-20, fn. 136, and James G. McLeod,
Annotation to Miller v. Miller (1987), 8 R.F.L. (3d) 114 at 115.
I would agree with these criticisms of Miller.
[27] While there has been no appellate decision on this issue, as
I have outlined, the state of the trial jurisprudence has been
relatively well settled.  I venture to say that there has been
significant reliance on it by practitioners in the area.  This
adds support to the conclusion I have reached, namely that the
Family Law Act permits the husband to deduct the value of the
Maurice Street property in calculating his net family property.
[28] The wife argues in the alternative that the definition of
&quot;matrimonial home&quot; in s. 4(1) of the Act includes the proceeds of
an existing matrimonial home which are then used to purchase a
substitute matrimonial home.  The wife says that this would
include the proceeds of the sale of the Maurice Street property
which were used to purchase the Dekay Street property.  She
relies for this on Kukolj v. Kukolj (1986), 3 R.F.L. (3d) 359
(Ont. U.F.C.).
[29] I cannot agree.  I am very doubtful about the correctness of
Kukolj.  But more importantly, that case involved funds brought
into the marriage by one spouse which were shortly thereafter
used to purchase a matrimonial home and for which a deduction was
not permitted.  In this case, it was not funds but the Maurice
Street property which was brought into the marriage by the
husband.  It is that property which must meet the statutory
definition of matrimonial home if a deduction for it is to be
denied.  As I have set out, it cannot do so.
[30] Finally, the wife argues that because of the husband's false
statement that he was not a spouse made on the sale of the
Maurice Street property the court should order, pursuant to
s. 24(1) of the Act, that he substitute other real property or
money for it.
[31] I disagree.  Section 24(1) permits the substitution of
property for &quot;the matrimonial home&quot;.  In this case, for the
reasons I have given the Maurice Street property does not meet
that definition.
[32] In summary, therefore, I conclude that the trial judge erred
in declining to permit the husband to deduct the value of the
Maurice Street property in calculating his net family property.
[33] The wife argues that if this deduction is permitted, it
should be in the amount of the sale price in 1993, namely
$101,000, but less the fees paid on that sale.  Again, I
disagree.  The Act requires that the deduction must be of the
value as at the date of the marriage.  It is not to be reduced by
the fees incurred later to dispose of that property.
[34] The recalculation thus entailed produces a net asset value
at separation for the husband of $128,532.03 and for the wife of
$556.88 and at marriage, for the husband of $105,940.00 and for
the wife of negative $2,200.00.  Since there is no basis for
anything other than the usual equal division, the resulting
equalization required is a payment by the husband to the wife of
$9,917.58.
[35] The second major issue raised by the husband is his
challenge of the support order made below. In my view this
challenge must fail.  In Hickey v. Hickey, [1999] S.C.J. No. 9
(Q.L.), the Supreme Court of Canada firmly underlined the
proposition that significant deference must be given to trial
judges in relation to support orders.  Absent an error in
principle, the significant misapprehension of the evidence, or
unless the award is clearly wrong, it should stand.
[36] There is no such error here.  The trial judge considered all
the circumstances, including the husband's Undertaking of
Assistance given to Immigration Canada, and ordered that a lump
sum payment of $15,000 was appropriate.  I would not interfere
with his determination.
[37] I would also dismiss the cross-appeal from the denial of pre-
judgment interest.  The trial judge concluded that because the
wife had resided in the Dekay Street property throughout the
proceedings and therefore had the benefit of the use of this
property, she ought not to receive pre-judgment interest on her
equalization payment.  I see no basis for interfering with this
conclusion.
[38] Finally, the husband has been partially successful on this
appeal.  I would therefore award him one-half of his costs of
this appeal.  As this result might have affected the costs order
at trial, the parties shall have thirty days to make written
submissions as to whether there should be any change made in the
trial costs order.
[39] In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.  The husband
is entitled to one-half his costs of the appeal.  Any further
order as to trial costs will await written submissions.
