    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Having received and reviewed the submissions of the parties
as  to  the  costs of the trial we make the following  additional
endorsement.
[2]  While the trial judge does not explain his costs order it
appears very likely that his award of solicitor/client costs was
based on the facts that the respondent&#146;s recovery vastly exceeded
her offer of settlement. As a result of the appeal, that is no
longer so. However it remains true that she was successful at
trial. She should therefore receive her costs of the trial on a
party and party basis. The judgment at trial is further amended
to effect this.</pre>
