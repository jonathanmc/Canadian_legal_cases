    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. RAMDAT NARAIN (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, CHARRON and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Keith E. Wright, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Catherine Cooper, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 5, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction by His Honour Judge C. H. Paris on
July 6, 1998 and the sentence imposed on September 11, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   While  it  would be better to avoid reference to  decisions
such  as Tremblay v. The Queen, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 120 (S.C.C.)  and
R. v. L'Heureux (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (S.C.C.) in cases that
do  not  involve the possession of stolen goods, for the  reasons
set  out by Fish J.A. in R. v. Mathieu (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 415
(Ont. C.A.) affirmed (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (S.C.C.) we  are
satisfied that the trial judge did not misdirect himself in  this
case in a way that prejudiced the appellant.  The trial judge did
not  apply  a  test of whether the appellant&#146;s explanation  might
reasonably be true.  Rather, he asked whether the evidence  could
be  true.  This was not inconsistent with the burden and standard
of  proof  in  a criminal case.  We do not agree that  the  trial
judge  fell  into the error of simply comparing the two  versions
and  choosing  the  one  that was more  credible.   He  carefully
reviewed all of the evidence and gave reasons, fully supported by
the  record,  for  rejecting  the appellant&#146;s  evidence  and  for
accepting  the  Crown evidence, which evidence  proved  the  case
beyond a reasonable doubt.
[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
