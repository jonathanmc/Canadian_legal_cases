    <pre>[1]  The motions judge applied the doctrine of res judicata to
dismiss this action because of the decision of Ground J. in the
class action, action No. 94-CQ-58919CP. That decision has since
been upheld by this court and leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada has been denied.

[2]  Before us the appellant did not suggest that this case did
not raise the same question as the class action, nor that the
question had not been finally decided, nor that the parties were
not the same persons. In other words, he did not challenge that
the usual indicia of res judicata were met. In our view, he was
correct in this.

[3]  Rather, he argued that the decision rendered by Borkovich J.
on October 6, 1998 in R. v. Docouto made res judicata
inapplicable and raised a genuine issue for trial.

[4]  We disagree. The simple reality is that the decision in R.
v. Docouto does not erase the decision in the class action. It
does not purport to do so, nor could it given that it was a
criminal case with different issues and different parties
although arising, we are told, from the same general factual
context.

[5]  The class action decision, therefore, continues to serve as
the basis on which res judicata must be applied to this case. We
cannot engage, as we were invited to, in assessing the effect
that Borkovich J.'s conclusions or the evidence before him might
have at this stage on the decision rendered in the class action.
If that were to be done, it must be done directly in the class
action, not indirectly in this action.

[6]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
