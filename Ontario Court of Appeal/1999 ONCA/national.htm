    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of  Rutherford J. dated May 21, 1999</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a motion by the Laurentian Bank of Canada and the
National Bank of Canada to quash an appeal to this court from a
default judgment granted by Rutherford J. and to set aside the
stay of his judgment imposed by rule 63.01(1).
[2]  The position of both banks is that because of the remedy
provided by rule 19.08 for setting aside a default judgment, the
judgment of Rutherford J. is not a final judgment for the
purposes of an appeal to this court under s.6(1)(b) of the Courts
of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43.  The position of the
appellants is that the judgment is a final judgment within the
meaning of s.6(1)(b).
[3]  We agree with the position of the banks.
[4]  The remedy provided by rule 19.08 is available to a
defendant against whom a default judgment has been granted by the
registrar, by the court on a motion under rule 19.04, by the
court on a motion under rule 19.05 or that has been obtained
after trial.  The remedy is a motion to a judge of the Superior
Court to set aside or vary the default judgment.  As such, the
remedy is not an appeal within the meaning of s.6(1)(b) of the
Courts of Justice Act.  It follows that the appellants&#146; remedy at
this stage of the proceedings is a motion to set aside or vary
the judgment of Rutherford J.
[5]  It is our view, therefore, that a default judgment granted
under rule 19 is not a final judgment for the purposes of an
appeal to the Court of Appeal within the meaning of s.6(1)(b) and
does not become a final judgment, if at all, until the remedy
provided by rule 19.08 has been sought and refused.
[6]  In our view, the policy that underlies rule 19.08 is to
preclude appeals to the Court of Appeal from the multitude of
default judgments which are granted throughout the province.
Absent rule 19.08, a default judgment would be a final judgment
under s.6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, which would result
in a multitude of appeals to the Court of Appeal.  Accordingly,
the Civil Rules Committee has provided through rule 19.08 an
expeditious remedy to set aside or vary default judgments without
the need to institute an appeal to this court.
[7]  In the result, the appeal is quashed.  It follows that as
there is no longer an appeal before this court, there is no stay
of the judgment of Rutherford J.  The moving parties are entitled
to their costs.
