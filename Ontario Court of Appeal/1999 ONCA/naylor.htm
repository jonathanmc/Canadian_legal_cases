    <pre>WEILER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Contract law ordinarily requires that there be an offer made
by one party and an acceptance communicated by the other party.
In The Queen in Right of Ontario v. Ron Engineering and
Construction Eastern Ltd. (1981), 119 D.L.R. (3d) 267 (S.C.C.),
however, the Supreme Court created an exception to the ordinary
requirement that acceptance of an offer must be communicated.
Instead, the court held that a prime contractor&#146;s act of
submitting a tender in response to a call for tenders by a tender
calling authority results in a contract at the moment that the
tender is capable of acceptance. Communication of acceptance of
the tender is unnecessary. The Supreme Court held that a
unilateral contract, known as a preliminary contract or contract
A, is created. The principal term of this preliminary contract A
is that the prime contractor is obliged not to withdraw its
tender for a certain period after the opening of the tenders. The
corollary term of preliminary contract A is that, if the prime
contractor&#146;s tender is accepted by the tender calling authority
or owner, the prime contractor and the owner both have an
obligation to enter into a construction contract. The
construction contract is known as contract B.
[2]  The core issue in this case is the extent to which the
principles in Ron Engineering, supra, apply between a prime
contractor and a subcontractor. For the reasons that follow, I
have concluded that a preliminary contract A does indeed arise
when a subcontractor submits a bid1 to a prime contractor and the
prime contractor incorporates that bid as part of its tender to
the owner. As in Ron Engineering, preliminary contract A comes
into existence at the moment that the prime contractor&#146;s tender
is capable of acceptance. The primary term of preliminary
contract A is that the subcontractor is bound not to withdraw its
bid for a stipulated period of time after the bids have been
opened.2 The next question is, &#147; If the prime contractor&#146;s tender
is accepted, does preliminary contract A give rise to an
obligation on the part of the prime contractor to enter into
construction contract B with the subcontractor even though the
prime contractor has not communicated its acceptance of the
subcontractor&#146;s tender?&#148; In my opinion the prime contractor is
not automatically bound to enter into construction contract B
with the subcontractor. Once the prime contractor&#146;s tender is
accepted, the prime contractor does, however, have certain
obligations towards the subcontractor under preliminary contract
A. In return for the subcontractor being bound by its bid, the
successful prime contractor is obligated to enter into
construction subcontract B with the subcontractor unless the
prime contractor has a reasonable objection to the subcontractor.
The factors which a court should consider in determining whether
the prime contractor&#146;s objection to the subcontractor is
reasonable include the timeliness of the prime contractor&#146;s
objection and the actions taken by the prime contractor as a
result of its objection. In addition, the fairness and good faith
of the prime contractor in its dealings with the subcontractor
are also factors to consider in determining the reasonableness of
the prime contractor&#146;s objection.
[3]  The application of these general principles in this case
leads me to conclude that Ellis-Don, a prime construction
contractor, breached its preliminary contract A with Naylor, an
electrical subcontractor, whose bid was incorporated into Ellis-
Don&#146;s tender on a construction project, by not entering
construction subcontract B with Naylor. Ellis-Don formed the
opinion that it was not able to enter into a construction
contract with Naylor due to labour incompatibility arising out of
a ruling of the Ontario Labour Relations Board (&#147;OLRB&#148;). Ellis-
Don submits that, as a result, it had a reasonable objection to
entering into a construction contract with Naylor. Ellis-Don did
not, however, inform Naylor of its opinion in a timely manner,
determine if the OLRB decision applied in circumstances when it
was already bound by its bid on a project, or give Naylor a real
opportunity to meet its objection. Instead, Ellis-Don asked
Naylor to extend its commitment to be bound by its bid,
encouraged Naylor to bid on a post-tender addition to the
contract, and then, using the work Naylor had done, some of which
was confidential, secretly looked for another subcontractor. In
these circumstances, Ellis-Don&#146;s objection to using Naylor cannot
be considered to be reasonable. In awarding the subcontract to
another subcontractor, Ellis-Don breached its preliminary
contract A with Naylor. Consequently, Naylor is entitled to
damages, which I have assessed in the amount of $182,500.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In November or December 1991, Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial
Hospital (the &#147;Hospital&#148;, &#147;OTMH&#148; or &#147;tender calling authority&#148;)
called for tenders to build a major addition and renovation to
the Hospital through the Toronto Bid Depository System (the &#147;Bid
Depository&#148;).
[5]  The Bid Depository is a uniform tendering system the purpose
of which is to provide an organized and fair framework for the
tendering of construction projects. Among the purposes of the Bid
Depository is that it promotes trust, leads to better co-
operation throughout the project, and prevents the shopping of
bids.3
[6]  The Ontario Bid Depository Standard Rules and Procedures
(the &#147;Rules&#148;), endorsed by various construction associations and
the Ministry of Government Services, apply to all Ontario Bid
Depositories and a majority of other bid depositories. Pursuant
to the Rules, subcontractors in each category -- electrical,
mechanical etc. -- elect which prime contractors they wish to
receive their bids. The bids are made on standardized forms to
permit ready comparison. Following the stipulated closing time,
prime contractors open the sealed bids they have received. The
prime contractors then have forty-eight hours to determine which
subcontractors to include or &#147;carry&#148; in their tender to the owner
or tender calling authority. One subcontractor in each category
is named as the subcontractor the prime contractor proposes will
do that work and the subcontractor&#146;s bid is incorporated as part
of the price of the tender.
[7]   Naylor had previously done work on the Hospital and was
interested in bidding on the project as an electrical
subcontractor. Ellis-Don was interested in becoming the prime
contractor. Before submitting a bid to Ellis-Don, Naylor
contacted Ellis-Don because it was concerned about a problem of
labour compatibility. Naylor had heard that Ellis-Don was
involved in a dispute with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (&#147;IBEW&#148;). The IBEW was arguing that Ellis-Don
was bound to use only members affiliated with the IBEW to perform
electrical subcontract work. Ellis-Don had retained counsel to
fight the issue before the Ontario Labour Relations Board and the
decision was pending. Naylor&#146;s employees were unionized but they
were not affiliated with the IBEW. In response to Naylor&#146;s query,
Ellis-Don told Naylor that the lack of IBEW affiliation would not
be a problem and that if Naylor submitted a bid to it for the
electrical subcontract work and its price was the lowest, Ellis-
Don would &#147;carry&#148; Naylor&#146;s bid in its tender to the Hospital.
[8]  It took Naylor approximately six weeks to prepare its bid,
the total of which was  $5,539,000. Naylor&#146;s supporting documents
were approximately 118 pages long. In addition, Naylor had to
submit a Bid Bond and an agreement from the bonding company to
issue a Performance Bond in the event that Naylor was the
successful bidder. The Bid Depository&#146;s standard tender form that
Naylor submitted to Ellis-Don contained the following provision:
          </pre>
    <pre>        This tender may be accepted for a period not exceeding seven
     (7) calendar days beyond the period established in the tendering
     documents for acceptance of the prime contractors&#146; tenders&#133; It is
     a condition of this tender, that, when accepted, the subsequent
     form will be in the form of C.C.A. Document No.1, Canadian
     Standard Form of Construction Contract between Contractor and Sub-
     Contractor, or another form of contract to be agreed upon and
     that the terms will incorporate the relevant provisions of the
     contract between Prime Contractor and Owner.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  When Ellis-Don opened the bids it had received from the
various subcontractors, Naylor was the lowest electrical
subcontractor bidder. Ellis-Don &#147;carried&#148; Naylor&#146;s bid in its
tender to the Hospital as the electrical subcontractor it would
use to perform the work if its tender of $38,135,900 was
accepted.
[10] Section 3 of the bid form of Ellis-Don&#146;s tender states:
          </pre>
    <pre>         In the Stipulated Price the following subcontractors are
     carried and they will perform the work indicated &#133; Electrical &#133;
     Naylor Group.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Tenders closed on December 12, 1991. Ellis-Don was the
lowest prime contractor because it had named or &#147;carried&#148; Naylor
in its bid. The next lowest electrical bid available to Ellis-Don
was that of Comstock, whose employees were affiliated with the
IBEW. Comstock submitted a bid that was approximately $411,000
higher than Naylor&#146;s bid. The trial judge found that if Ellis-Don
had carried Comstock&#146;s bid in its tender, Ellis-Don would not
have been the lowest tender.4  Conversely, Naylor&#146;s low bid, used
by another prime contractor to the exclusion of Ellis-Don, would
have greatly increased the prospect that another prime contractor
would have been awarded the project.
[12] The Hospital could not formally accept any tender until
funding was assured by the Ministry of Health. However, informal
acceptance may be inferred. In his examination in chief, Mr.
Antidormi of Ellis-Don, who was the project manager on the OTMH
project, was asked:
          </pre>
    <pre>         Q.   And can you tell us when you became the project manager
     for this project, the hospital project?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I found out that we had the job
          around Christmas time. We had a Christmas
          party in the weeks following the December 12
          tender and I was told at the Christmas party
          that I was going to be assigned as the
          project manager, that they had some &#150; they
          weren&#146;t awarding the job right away. It was a
          90 day award and that eventually I would be
          called into the office for our pre-
          construction meeting which is our in-house
          review of the bid and how it was compiled and
          just a general review of the job and what had
          to be done.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Another indication that the Hospital had accepted Ellis-
Don&#146;s tender is seen in the fact that only Ellis-Don was asked to
provide an updated tender on additional work proposed by the
Hospital&#146;s architect. In addition, a letter written by Ellis-Don
to Naylor, dated February 10,1992, read in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Ellis-Don has been asked to extend our tender acceptance
     period on the [Hospital] project by two months to May 11, 1992.
     This extension of time is required for Ministry approvals to take
     place.</pre>
    <pre>     The tender documentation relating to the
project did not, however, contain a condition
that the project was subject to the approval
of the Ministry of Health. It was a question
of when, not if, the funding would be in
place.</pre>
    <pre>[14] On February 11, 1992 Ellis-Don asked Naylor to similarly
extend its bid prices. On February 14, 1992 Naylor replied:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In order to hold prices firm for an additional 60 days (i.e.
     from the date of the original commitment to May 11, 1992) our
     major supplier has requested a Letter of Intent from us on this
     project.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Consequently, we request that you
          provide us with a Letter of Intent at our
          fixed price of $5,539,000 with the condition
          being that it is not binding only if the
          project does not go ahead or Ellis-Don is not
          the successful General Contractor. In all
          other instances Naylor Group would be awarded
          the project.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Ellis-Don did not reply to Naylor&#146;s letter.
[16] On the same date, February 14th, Naylor sent a fax to Ellis-
Don stating:
          </pre>
    <pre>         This is to confirm that our tender for the above project is
      hereby extended to midnight May 11, 1992.</pre>
    <pre>[17] On February 28, 1992, the Ontario Labour Relations Board
(&#147;OLRB&#148;) released its decision with respect to Ellis-Don and the
IBEW, reported sub nom, International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, Local 894 v. Ellis-Don Ltd, [1992] O.L.R.B. Rep. Feb.
147. The majority decision upheld a grievance by the IBEW and
declared that a 1962 agreement between Ellis-Don and the IBEW
created bargaining rights which had not been abandoned. The
question of damages Ellis-Don had to pay for not using union
workers who were members of the IBEW on the earlier unrelated
project was remitted to the parties to work out but the Board
retained jurisdiction to interpret its order. Section 45(10) of
the Ontario Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2 as am.
states that the decision of an arbitrator is binding and that the
parties, &#147;&#133; shall do or abstain from doing anything required of
them by the decision.&#148;
[18] The day the decision was released, at least some personnel
of Ellis-Don became aware of the decision. By March 10,1992 at
the latest, the officer at Ellis-Don with whom Naylor was dealing
was aware of the decision.
[19] On March 4, 1992, Ellis-Don asked Naylor to provide an
additional bid on certain post-tender changes to the work for the
Hospital. On March 17th the quote had still not been received and
Ellis-Don pressed Naylor for its price. The same day, Naylor gave
Ellis-Don an oral quotation in the amount of $132,192. Ellis-Don
in turn submitted its tender to the Hospital&#146;s architects again
naming Naylor as the electrical subcontractor. Unlike Naylor&#146;s
initial bids, which became known to the other bidders when the
envelopes were opened at the Bid Depository, the post-tender
addendum amount was not publicized nor was it part of some bid
opening procedure.
[20] The law firm representing Ellis-Don before the OLRB also
represented Naylor with respect to labour matters. On March 23rd,
1992 the law firm sent a copy of the OLRB decision to Naylor at
Naylor&#146;s request.
[21] On April 15, 1992 Ellis-Don orally informed Naylor that
Ellis-Don would not use it on the Hospital project because of the
OLRB&#146;s decision. During the conversation, Ellis-Don also told
Naylor, &#147;I can&#146;t get anyone else to do it [the electrical
subcontract work] at your price.&#148;  Naylor took this statement as
evidence that Ellis-Don was shopping Naylor&#146;s bid. Ellis-Don
denied shopping Naylor&#146;s bid. Despite Ellis-Don&#146;s protestations
to the contrary, the trial judge found that Ellis-Don had acted
in an unethical manner and had begun negotiating with Guild
Electric prior to informing Naylor of its opinion respecting the
effect of the OLRB&#146;s decision. There is evidence to support the
trial judge&#146;s finding and his further finding that Ellis-Don did
not inform Naylor in a timely fashion that it was seeking
alternative contractors.
[22] Naylor wrote to the Hospital&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and
Board members complaining of unfairness and asked the Hospital
not to permit its substitution as the electrical subcontractor.
The letter of May 3,1992 to Board members stated in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; It was our belief that pending approval of the funding
      from the Ministry, Ellis-Don would be awarded the contract and
      Naylor Group would be awarded the electrical sub-contract from
      Ellis-Don.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The letter went on to allege that, in Naylor&#146;s opinion,
Ellis-Don was shopping Naylor&#146;s bid.
[24] On May 5, Ellis-Don wrote a &#147;without prejudice&#148; letter to
the President of the Hospital in which it indicated that it was
unable to use Naylor because of the OLRB decision, that it was
now obliged to let the contract to an IBEW affiliated company,
and that
          </pre>
    <pre>            [h]ad the contract been awarded within the original time
       frame, then a subcontract would have been awarded to Naylor, by
       Ellis-Don, for this project.</pre>
    <pre>[25] On May 6, 1992, the Hospital awarded the construction
contract to Ellis-Don.
[26] On May 13, 1992 Ellis-Don wrote to Naylor in part as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          As Ellis-Don is bound to follow the judicial direction given
      by the Ontario Labour Relations Board as stated in their decision
      #2426-89-G with regards to the IBEW, we regrettably will be
      unable to enter into a Subcontract Agreement with your firm for
      the electrical work at the referenced project.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Naylor replied on May 14:
          </pre>
    <pre>         It is our position, which is supported in law, that you are
     already contractually obligated to Naylor Group Inc. in respect
     to the provision of electrical work on the OTMH project. This is
     a result of naming us as the electrical subcontractor in your
     tender of December 12, 1991.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Further, unless we hear from you
          immediately to the contrary we are treating
          Ellis-Don&#146;s letter of May 13, 1992 as a
          breach of that contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               We note your reference to the Ontario
          Labour Relations Board decision #2526-89-G
          and would indicate that this decision only
          determined rights as between Ellis-Don and
          the International Brotherhood of Electrical
          Workers. This decision does not affect any
          other party and certainly not OTMH or Naylor.
          The fact that it now poses Ellis-Don
          difficulty, a situation you knew was a
          possibility at the time of your tender on
          December 12, 1991 does not give you a right
          to unilaterally terminate our contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[28] On June 2, 1992 Ellis-Don wrote to the architect indicating
that it had chosen Guild Electric as the electrical
subcontractor. Guild Electric&#146;s price for performing the
electrical work, including the additional work for which Ellis-
Don had asked Naylor to submit a post-tender bid was identical to
Naylor&#146;s price to the penny. Guild Electric had not been a pre-
qualified bidder under the tender process for the Hospital
project and had not submitted a bid on it. Ellis-Don was required
to obtain the Hospital&#146;s consent to the substitution of
subcontractors. On June 4, 1992 the architects for the project,
on behalf of the Hospital, confirmed that Ellis-Don could use
Guild Electric to replace Naylor on the project. On July 7,1992
Ellis-Don signed a letter of intent with Guild Electric.
[29] On July 13, 1992, Naylor sued for damages for breach of
contract seeking the amount of $1,769,412. In the alternative, it
made a claim based on unjust enrichment or quantum meruit.
[30] At trial, reported at [1996] O.J. No 3247 (Gen. Div.),
Langdon J. dismissed Naylor&#146;s action in contract against Ellis-
Don because Ellis-Don had not communicated its acceptance of
Naylor&#146;s offer according to general contract principles. In so
doing he held that the exception created in Ron Engineering,
supra, did not apply here. Alternatively, he held that any
contract that existed was frustrated due to the decision of the
OLRB. Had the trial judge found that an enforceable contract
existed, he would have assessed the damages at $730,286. Instead,
he granted Naylor&#146;s alternative request for relief based on
unjust enrichment and awarded damages of $14,560, representing
the cost to Naylor of preparing its tender.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[31] The issues arising on this appeal are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Was there a preliminary contract, or contract A,
          between Naylor and Ellis-Don;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   Was Ellis-Don&#146;s objection to using
          Naylor reasonable;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   If a contract existed, was it
          frustrated;
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   Unjust enrichment;
          </pre>
    <pre>               5.   Damages.</pre>
    <pre>[32] By way of cross-appeal, Ellis-Don asks that the judgment
granted to Naylor be set aside and that the action be dismissed.
In the alternative Ellis-Don asks that if Naylor&#146;s claim in
contract is sustained, the trial judge&#146;s assessment of damages of
$730,286 be set aside and damages be reduced to $22,000.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.        Was there a preliminary contract, or contract A,
          between Naylor and Ellis-Don?</pre>
    <pre>[33] It is common ground that Ellis-Don did not communicate any
acceptance of Naylor&#146;s offer to do the electrical subcontract
work on the Hospital to Naylor. The question is, was it necessary
for Ellis-Don to do so before a contractual relationship of any
kind was created?
[34] Those who use the Bid Depository System mutually agree to be
bound by its rules in their dealings with one another: Scott
Steel (Ottawa) Ltd. v. R.J. Nicol Construction (1975) Ltd.
(1993), 10 C.L.R. (2d) 128 (Ont. Div. Ct.) (dissenting reasons of
Greer J., not on this point, reported at (1993), 15 C.L.R. (2d)
10).
[35] Thus the submission of a bid by a subcontractor, like the
submission of a tender by a prime contractor, signifies
acceptance of all the terms of the Bid Depository System and
constitutes a preliminary contract or contract A. In accordance
with the Bid Depository&#146;s Standard Rules and Procedures under
which Naylor made its bid, Naylor&#146;s bid was irrevocable for a
stipulated period of time beyond the period for acceptance of the
prime contractor&#146;s tender. There can be little doubt that the
bidding process is dependent upon, and requires, that Naylor be
bound by the price it has bid once that bid has been incorporated
into the prime contractor&#146;s tender and the tender has become
irrevocable. See Gloge Heating and Plumbing Ltd. v. Northern
Construction Co. Ltd. (1986), 19 C.L.R. 281 (Alta. C.A.).
[36] That said, the question remaining to be determined is the
obligation of the prime contractor in exchange for the
subcontractor being bound by its bid. In Ron Engineering, supra,
the Supreme Court held that a corollary term of preliminary
contract A, is that both the contractor and the owner are
automatically obliged to enter into construction contract B, if
the contractor&#146;s tender is accepted by the owner. Naylor&#146;s
position is that, in accordance with the decision of the British
Columbia Supreme Court in M.J. Peddlesden Ltd. v. Liddell
Construction Ltd. (1981), 128 D.L.R. (3d) 360, the ratio in Ron
Engineering, supra also applies to a bid made by a subcontractor
to a prime contractor. Accordingly, Naylor submits that Ellis-Don
breached its obligation to enter into a construction contract
with Naylor and that Ellis-Don is liable to Naylor in damages.
[37]  For its part, Ellis-Don relies on the majority decision in
Scott Steel (Ottawa) Ltd. v. R.J. Nicol Construction (1975) Ltd.,
supra. There, the court held that before the successful prime
contractor can be sued for refusing to enter into construction
contract B with the subcontractor, the prime contractor must have
communicated its acceptance of the subcontractor&#146;s bid. In the
case before us, the trial judge accepted that he was bound by the
decision in Scott Steel. In addition, he found the wording in the
forms of tender issued by the Bid Depository clearly contemplated
traditional communication of acceptance of any bid by a
subcontractor. He stated, &#147;Those forms are clear enough to be
construed as expressly negating any deemed acceptance arising
from the mere fact of carrying a sub-trade bid into a prime
tender.&#148;  The trial judge&#146;s reliance on the wording of the form
documents is appropriate. In Ron Engineering, supra, at 272,
Estey J. commented that the terms of preliminary contract A in a
given case depend on the wording of the terms and conditions in
the call for tenders, the related documents, and the rules upon
which the tender was made.5
[38] As indicated in the facts portion of these reasons, the Bid
Depository&#146;s standard Official Tender Form makes it a condition
of the prime contractor&#146;s tender that, when accepted, the
subsequent form of the contract between the prime contractor and
the sub-contractor will be the Canadian Standard Form of
Construction Contract.6 Article 10 of the General Conditions to
the Standard Form is particularly germane and I have reproduced
the pertinent portions below.
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.1      The Contractor agrees to&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               a)   enter into contracts or written
          agreements with his Subcontractors to require
          them to perform their work in accordance with
          and subject to the terms and conditions of
          the Contract Documents &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.2 The contractor agrees to employ
          those Subcontractors proposed by him in
          writing and accepted by the owner at the
          signing of the contract.
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.3 The Owner may, for reasonable
          cause, object to the use of a proposed
          Subcontractor and require the Contractor to
          employ one of the other subcontract bidders.
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.4 In the event that the owner
          requires a change from a proposed
          Subcontractor the contract price shall be
          adjusted by the difference in cost and mark-
          up occasioned by such required change.
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.5 The contractor shall not be
          required to employ as a Subcontractor a
          person or firm to whom he may reasonably
          object.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               10.7 Nothing contained in the Contract
          Documents shall create a contractual
          relationship between a Subcontractor and the
          Owner.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[39] Article 10.2 states that the contractor will employ the
subcontractors proposed by him and accepted by the owner when the
contract between the prime contractor and the owner is signed. If
there was an automatic construction contract between a
subcontractor and prime contractor upon acceptance of the prime
contractor&#146;s tender by the tender calling authority, there would
be no need for the prime contractor to submit the names of its
subcontractors and to have them formally accepted in writing by
the owner at the time the principal contract is signed.
[40] Article 10.3 of the General Conditions to the contract
documents provides that the owner may, on reasonable grounds,
object to a subcontractor and, if so, the prime contractor is
required to employ another subcontractor. Similarly, Article 10.5
states that the contractor shall not be required to employ as a
subcontractor a person or firm to whom he may reasonably object.7
[41] Thus, Ellis-Don was not automatically required to enter into
a construction contract with Naylor when its tender was chosen
because Article 10, in particular, envisages the possibility that
someone other than the subcontractor named in the tender may be
employed to do the work. This does not mean that the preliminary
contract or contract A created no duty on the part of Ellis-Don
to Naylor. The Bid Depository Rules contemplate that contracts
will be awarded to the subcontractors whose bids are carried by
the successful prime bidder.8 Read as a whole, article 10
envisages that Ellis-Don will enter into a contract with Naylor
unless Ellis-Don or the Hospital has a reasonable objection to
Naylor. As found by the trial judge, that is the reasonable
expectation that the parties had. Where it is possible under the
terms of the contract to give effect to the reasonable
expectation of the parties a court will do so. As stated by Estey
J. in Ron Engineering, supra, at p.273, &#147;&#133;the integrity of the
bidding system must be protected where under the law of contracts
it is possible to do so.&#148;  Although the general law of contracts,
which requires that acceptance of an offer be communicated, is
not superceded, the integrity of the bidding process requires
that the reasonable expectation of the parties be given effect.
Thus, unless the successful prime contractor has a reasonable
objection to the subcontractor it has proposed, the prime
contractor must communicate its acceptance of the subcontractor&#146;s
bid.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.        Was Ellis-Don&#146;s objection to using Naylor reasonable?</pre>
    <pre>[42] One of the factors to be considered in determining whether
an objection is reasonable is the time when the objection is
raised. As found by the trial judge, Ellis-Don did not raise its
objection to using Naylor in a timely fashion. Instead, Ellis-Don
shopped Naylor&#146;s bid, including the price for the post-tender
addendum, to other companies including Guild Electric. Although
the trial judge held that such disclosure was unethical, he did
not attach any legal significance to it, in part because he also
found that after the tenders were opened they were public in
nature. The trial judge appears to have overlooked the evidence
that the post-tender addendum amount was not publicized nor was
it part of any bid opening procedure. He ought to have considered
that Ellis-Don also disclosed Naylor&#146;s pricing for the post-
tender work. This disclosure took place during the period of time
when Naylor, in response to Ellis-Don&#146;s request, had agreed to
extend its commitment to be bound by its bid. In effect, by
asking Naylor to extend the period during which it was bound,
Ellis-Don asked Naylor to extend the terms of the preliminary
contract, contract A, and Naylor agreed to do so. The subcontract
was the largest subcontract on which Naylor had ever bid and
would, therefore, have involved a major commitment of Naylor&#146;s
resources.
[43] By using the Bid Depository System and naming Naylor in its
tender, Ellis-Don agreed not to shop the bid it received from
Naylor during the time period Naylor was bound by its bid. The
integrity of the Bid System depends upon bid shopping not taking
place; indeed, the whole system is set up to prevent bid
shopping. Unless the prime contractor is bound not to shop for
another subcontractor while a subcontractor is bound by its bid,
there is no reason for the subcontractor to participate in the
Bid System and to be bound by its bid after the tenders have been
opened. If the commitment is a major one, a subcontractor may be
unable to bid other projects during the period of time that the
subcontractor is bound by its bid.
[44] During the time that Naylor was bound by its bid, Ellis-Don
used information from Naylor, part of which had been obtained in
confidence, for its own advantage. Ellis-Don negotiated a
contract, with an IBEW affiliated subcontractor who had not
participated in the Bid Depository, on terms more favourable to
it than the terms offered by any IBEW contractor who had used the
Bid Depository. 9 Misuse of confidential information is
actionable: See Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona
Resources Ltd. (1989), 61 D.L.R. (4th) 14 (S.C.C.); Gottcon
Contractors Ltd. v. Manzo (1992), 40 C.P.R. (3d) 498 (Ont. Gen.
Div.), appeal to the C.A. dismissed by endorsement [1996] O.J.
No. 1773.
[45] I am also not convinced that Ellis-Don&#146;s opinion that the
OLRB&#146;s decision prevented it from employing Naylor was correct. I
say this for two reasons. Firstly, to require Ellis-Don to hire
an IBEW affiliated electrical subcontractor would have resulted
in significant prejudice to Ellis-Don and the OLRB would have
considered this in any subsequent proceeding by the IBEW
complaining about Ellis-Don employing Naylor.
[46] Prior to the OLRB decision, Ellis-Don bid on a project and
agreed to abide by the Rules of the Bid Depository system. Those
Rules required Ellis-Don to award a subcontract only to a
subcontractor which had used the system and submitted a bid under
the Rules. If Ellis-Don was obliged to enter into an agreement
with an IBEW affiliated subcontractor and it had abided by the
Bid Depository Rules and hired the lowest IBEW affiliated
subcontractor which had bid, namely Comstock, it would have been
prejudiced to the extent of $400,000.
[47] A similar issue to the case at bar arose in Aluma Systems
Canada Inc., [1994] O.L.R.D. No. 4398. Much as the IBEW did in
this case, the trade union in Aluma Systems brought a grievance
before a panel of the OLRB alleging a violation of the provincial
collective agreement because workers who did not belong to the
union in question had been employed. Both here and in Aluma
Systems the prime contractor denied that it was bound by the
agreement and took the position that the applicant union had
abandoned its bargaining rights. In both cases the Board found in
favour of the union. In Aluma Systems, the Board then determined
whether it should impose an estoppel on the ability of the union
to assert its strict rights10. The Board observed that &#147;&#133; estoppel
is an equitable concept utilized in appropriate circumstances to
fashion a fair and appropriate remedy.&#148; The Board concluded:
          In this case, we are of the view that the appropriate time
     frame for the estoppel is in reference to the date of issuance of
     this decision. Thus, any contracts that UMACS (Aluma) had bid on
     or any projects commenced prior to the date of this decision may
     be completed in the manner to which the employer had already
     committed. However, any work tendered and received after the date
     of this decision would have to be done in compliance with the
     responding party&#146;s obligations under the provincial ICI agreement
     with the Labourers&#146; International Union of North America.
     [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[48] In United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,
Local 785 v. Toronto Dominion Bank, [1995] O.L.R.B. Rep. May 686,
a panel of the OLRB held that the Bank was bound by the
provincial collective agreement between the Carpenters Employer
and Employee Bargaining Agencies. The OLRB panel in the TD Bank
case held that the union was estopped from relying on the
agreement until the Board issued its decision, which was May 3,
1995. On May 2, 1995 the Bank had finalized the list of bidders
who were pre-qualified to bid with respect to an addition and
renovation of its bank in Owen Sound. The Bank had not specified
in the tender that those tendering would be obliged to use
members of the Carpenter&#146;s Union to do the work.  The Bank could
have retendered the Owen Sound project but it did not do so.
Instead it accepted a tender from a non-union contractor. The
union grieved.
[49] The OLRB noted that the decision of the earlier panel of the
Board had specifically stated that the &#147;estoppel therefore does
not apply to contracts entered into after the issuance of this
decision.&#148; The OLRB upheld the union&#146;s grievance. In doing so the
OLRB stated:
         The Bank is not in the position of a contractor with respect
     to the bidding process. The Bank does not bid on projects;
     rather, it accepts bids. The prejudice to the Bank arises at the
     time the Bank enters into a contract the timing of which is
     entirely within its own control. The Bank does not suffer any
     significant prejudice in interrupting the bidding process. It is
     only once the Bank has accepted a bid which does not include an
     agreement to comply with the Carpenters Provincial Agreement,
     that the Bank could be prejudiced by subsequently being obliged
     to comply with that agreement.[Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[50] Both Aluma Systems and the TD Bank decisions indicate that
the OLRB is sensitive to the prejudice a prime contractor may
suffer once it has submitted a tender by which it is bound. It
appears that, in such instances, the union would be estopped from
claiming any damages. At the very least, because the OLRB left it
to the IBEW and Ellis-Don to work out the issue of damages, but
maintained jurisdiction if they could not agree, Ellis-Don should
have gone back to the OLRB for clarification concerning the issue
of prejudice.
[51] Secondly, if given an opportunity, it may have been possible
for Naylor to enter into an arrangement with an IBEW affiliated
electrical company that would have allowed it to retain a share
of the profit from the contract. In Twin City Mechanical v.
Bradsil (1967) Ltd. (1996), 31 C.L.R. (2d) 210 (Ont. Gen.Div.),
rev&#146;d on other grounds [1999] O.J. No. 140 (C.A.), evidence was
led as to a number of possible solutions to a problem of labour
incompatibility. One was that the incompatible subcontractor
could enter into an arrangement with a compatible union sub-
subcontractor whereby compatible union workers would be used on
the job site and the two subcontractors would share the profit.
Another possible solution was for the incompatible subcontractor
to agree to assign its contract to a labour compatible
subcontractor in return for a share of the profits.
[52] I appreciate that it is always easier to see matters more
clearly with the benefit of hindsight. The situation is not an
easy one. Nonetheless, the onus is on Ellis-Don to show that its
objection to entering into a contract with Naylor was reasonable.
I am not satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances I
have mentioned, Ellis-Don has discharged this onus. As a result,
Ellis-Don is in breach of its preliminary contract A with Naylor.
[53] Having regard to my conclusion, it is not, strictly
speaking, necessary for me to elaborate further on the factors to
be considered in determining whether a prime contractor has a
reasonable basis for not entering into a contract with a
subcontractor. Given the apparent divergence between Ontario
decisions and those elsewhere in Canada, I do, however, wish to
make some further comment. In my opinion the fairness11 and good
faith12 with which the prime contractor has treated the
subcontractor are important factors to consider in assessing the
reasonableness of the prime contractor&#146;s decision not to enter
into construction contract B. In Scott Steel, supra, fairness and
good faith were not in issue. The prime contractor took the
position that the proposed subcontractor would be unable to do
the work within the construction schedule that was subsequently
established by the owner&#146;s architects. The trial judge found that
there was no evidence of bid shopping or any other improper
motive on the part of the prime contractor and those findings
were not appealed. The dissent by Greer J. focussed on the fact
that the prime contractor had not abided by the rules of the bid
system because the approval of the architect had not been
obtained to the substitution of the subcontractor. Whether or not
a party has abided by the rules of the bid system, would of
course, be a consideration in determining the fairness and good
faith with which the parties have acted. The result in Peddlesden
Ltd., supra, is consistent with a duty to bargain in good faith.
The general contractor, whose tender had been accepted by the
owner, refused to enter into a contract with the subcontractor on
the ground that a performance bond submitted with the tender
lacked the subcontractor&#146;s corporate seal. The court held that
the omission of the seal from the bond was a mere slip capable of
subsequent correction. Instead of giving the subcontractor an
opportunity to remedy the situation the general contractor had,
instead, sought to avoid entering into a contract with the
subcontractor. In addition, the general contractor sought to take
advantage of its own default in not notifying the subcontractor
within the thirty day period that the subcontractor was bound by
its bid whether or not it intended to enter into a contract with
it. Similarly, Fred Welsh Ltd. v. B.G.M. Construction Ltd., supra
concerned a situation where the prime contractor, after naming a
subcontractor in its bid, and during the period of time that the
subcontractor was bound by its bid, encouraged another
subcontractor to provide a lower bid and was found to have
engaged in bid shopping. Viewed in this manner, it is possible to
reconcile the results in Scott Steel, and Peddelsden, as well as
B.G. Welsh, supra.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.        Was the contract frustrated?</pre>
    <pre>[54] A contract is an agreement that apportions risk and
responsibility between the parties. Frustration occurs when a
situation has arisen for which the parties made no provision in
the contract and performance of the contract becomes &#147;a thing
radically different from that which was undertaken by the
contract&#148;: Ocean Tramp Tankers Corporation v. V/O Sofracht,
[1964] 1 All E.R. 161 at 166 (C.A.). Because the parties have
made no provision for the situation that arises, they are
generally considered not to have allocated the risk respecting
that event in the contract and in the circumstances it is
considered unjust to hold them to the contract.</pre>
    <pre>[55] Both Ellis-Don and Naylor were aware of the problem of
labour incompatibility at the time that Naylor bid to Ellis-Don.
I do not, however, agree with the trial judge&#146;s alternate
conclusion that, if there was a contract, the relationship
between the parties was frustrated.
[56] In Ron Engineering, supra, the Supreme Court held that the
time when the risk of a mistake is allocated between the parties
to a construction contract is when the tender is first capable of
acceptance, that is, when the tender has been submitted to the
owner. By analogy, one way of looking at this case would be to
say that when Ellis-Don incorporated Naylor&#146;s bid in its tender
and submitted it to the owner, Ellis-Don assumed the risk of a
mistake with respect to labour incompatibility. I do not,
however, find it necessary to base my conclusion on the issue of
frustration on this analogy.
[57] The OLRB rendered its decision after Ellis-Don&#146;s tender was
capable of acceptance by the Hospital and after the preliminary
contract A came into existence. The trial judge accepted Ellis-
Don&#146;s position that, in the event construction contract B
automatically came into being between the parties if Ellis-Don
were successful in its tender, contract B would have been
frustrated by the OLRB&#146;s decision. I have already indicated that
construction contract B does not automatically come into
existence if the prime contractor&#146;s tender is successful. Ellis-
Don is not obliged to enter into a subcontract with the
subcontractor it has named in its tender if it has a reasonable
objection to doing so. For the reasons given concerning the
reasonableness of Ellis-Don&#146;s objection to using Naylor, I am not
satisfied that Ellis-Don has discharged its onus of proving that
construction contract B would have been frustrated.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.        Unjust Enrichment</pre>
    <pre>[58] Having regard to my conclusions, I would also find that
Ellis-Don was unjustly enriched at Naylor&#146;s expense. It is more
appropriate, however, to assess the damages on the basis that
Ellis-Don breached the terms of its preliminary contract A with
Naylor.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.        Damages</pre>
    <pre>[59] The award of damages in this case is for Ellis-Don&#146;s breach
of its preliminary contract A with Naylor.
[60] If a construction contract B had been entered into, the
measure of damages to which Naylor would have been entitled to
would have been its profit. Because I am dealing with a breach of
the preliminary contract A, the measure of damages is Naylor&#146;s
lost opportunity to enter into a contract with Ellis-Don. While
it is appropriate to consider the profit Naylor would have
realized if it had been given the opportunity to perform the
work, the contingency that Naylor would not have received the
contract because of an unfavourable interpretation of the OLRB
decision, and the contingency that its profit would have been
reduced due to having to make an arrangement with an IBEW
affiliated subcontractor , must be taken into account.
[61] The contingency of unforeseen difficulties on the job site
must also be factored in as a deduction from the assessment of
Naylor&#146;s damages. Here that contingency is a very real one. Guild
Electric had to spend some 3000 extra hours on the job due to
unforeseen problems with the wireway / demolition for the
Hospital.
[62] Ellis-Don also submits that the trial judge erred in his
calculation of the profit. In total Guild Electric spent 53,000
hours on the project as opposed to the 38,589 hours estimated by
Naylor. The trial judge did not factor in the additional cost to
Naylor of these hours in calculating Naylor&#146;s profit. At Naylor&#146;s
labour cost of $29.38 the underestimate is said to represent a
cost of $423,395.00. While some effect should be given to Ellis-
Don&#146;s submission, the submission itself must be discounted
bearing in mind the significant advantages that the trial judge
found Naylor had over Guild Electric. Naylor was an Oakville
based company. Its key personnel could be assumed to be more or
less on site. Guild Electric is based in Scarborough and would
have incurred proportionately higher costs for travel, meals and
other like expenses.  Naylor employed a 1:1 ratio of journeymen
to apprentices and thereby had lower labour costs. Naylor had
also previously done work on the Hospital and was familiar with
the electrical system.
[63] I do not propose to give any effect to Ellis-Don&#146;s
submission that the trial judge should not have allowed Naylor a
17% profit margin on extras as I am not satisfied that any error
has been demonstrated in the trial judge&#146;s reasons in this
regard.
[64] The assessment of damages in these circumstances must always
be more or less a matter of estimate. Having regard to the
contingencies I have mentioned it is impossible to ascertain the
damages in question with arithmetical precision. The assessment
is a difficult one. It seems to me that in all of the
circumstances it is appropriate to discount the trial judge&#146;s
estimate of Naylor&#146;s damages for loss of profit, namely $730,286,
by 50%. I would further discount the resulting figure of $365,143
by another 50% for the contingency that the OLRB would not allow
the contract to be awarded to Naylor or that Naylor may have had
to enter into a sub subcontract with a company with IBEW
affiliation. With these factors in mind it seems to me that an
award of $182,500 would be appropriate and I would so order.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[65] In conclusion, for the reasons given I have found that
preliminary contract A came into being, that there was a breach
of contract A by Ellis-Don, and that contract A was not
frustrated. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside
the award of the trial judge based on quantum meruit. In view of
the decision reached, I would allow the alternate ground of the
cross-appeal and set aside the assessment of damages in the
amount of $730,286. I would award damages in the amount of
$182,500 plus pre-judgment interest. I would also award costs of
the appeal to the appellant.

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1    In these reasons, the document submitted by the
subcontractor quoting the price for which it will do the work is
called a bid and the document submitted by the prime contractor
to the owner is called a tender.
2    Under the Bid Depository Rules, described in more detail in
paragraph 5 et seq., if a subcontractor, having submitted a bid,
discovers it has made a mistake and wishes to withdraw its bid,
the notice of withdrawal must be given to the prime contractors
concerned and the Bid Depository not later than three hours prior
to the closing time for receipt of tenders from prime
contractors.  The notice may be given by telephone but must be
confirmed by telegram (Rule 11). After this time the
subcontractor is bound by its bid for a stipulated period of
time.
3    The reference to shopping a bid refers to the practice of a
prime contractor soliciting a bid from a subcontractor with no
intention of working with that particular subcontractor and then
disclosing or using that bid to get another subcontractor to
perform the contract for the same value or less.
4    Although the call for tenders typically contains a privilege
clause that reserves to the owner a discretion to choose a bid
that is not the lowest bid, an expectation of good faith and fair
dealing has been held to be an implied term of contract A. See
footnote 12 infra. The construction contract cannot be awarded on
the basis of a hidden preference or on a basis other than that
which has been stipulated in the documents governing the
submission of a tender.
5    In Ron Engineering, supra, Estey J. stated at 272 that:
         The revocability of the offer (i.e. by the
         tenderer) must, in my view, be determined in
         accordance with the &#145;General Conditions&#146; and
         &#145;Information for Tenderers&#146; and the related
         documents upon which the tender was submitted.
                             . . . .
         There is no disagreement between the parties here
         about the form and procedure in which the tender
         was submitted by the respondent (i.e. the tenderer)
         and that it complied with the terms and conditions
         of the call for tenders.  Consequently, contract A
         came into being. The principal term of contract A
         is the irrevocability of the bid, and the corollary
         term is the obligation in both parties to enter
         into a contract (contract B) upon the acceptance of
         the tender.  Other terms include the qualified
         obligations of the owner to accept the lowest
         tender, and the degree of this obligation is
         controlled by the terms and conditions established
         in the call for tenders.&#148;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>6    By mutual agreement another form of contract may be used
between the prime contractor and the subcontractor. Any contract
between the prime contractor and the subcontractor must, however,
incorporate the relevant provisions of the contract between the
Prime Contractor and the Owner.
7    It might be argued that article 10.5 contemplates a
situation where the owner requires the prime contractor to employ
a different subcontractor than the one the prime contractor has
named in its tender.  In such instances, the prime contractor is
not obliged to accept a subcontractor proposed by the owner if
the prime contractor&#146;s objection is reasonable.  I agree that
article 10.5 applies to the situation where the owner has
proposed a substitute subcontractor under article 10.3.  I do
not, however, agree that Article 10.5 applies only in this
situation.  The Article contains no limiting words to this
effect.  By Contrast, Article 10.4 begins with the words:</pre>
    <pre>         In the event that the owner requires a change from
         a proposed Subcontractor
         </pre>
    <pre>and goes on to require the owner to adjust the contract price. If
Article 10.5 had been intended to apply only in the event that
the owner required a change, article 10.5 would have opened with
the same wording as Article 10.4.
8    e.g. A prime contractor&#146;s tender must contain&#148;&#133;names of the
Subcontractors, bidder proposes to perform the work under the
Contract, and to include in the Agreement he would sign with the
Owner&#148; (Article 16.1 instructions to bidders).</pre>
    <pre>A prime contractor whose tender is accepted by the owner &#147;is
bound to place a sub-contract with one of the trade contractors
who used the Bid Depository&#148; (Rule 13(c));</pre>
    <pre>Section 3 of the bid form of Ellis-Don&#146;s tender states: In the
Stipulated Price the following subcontractors are carried and
they will perform the work indicated&#133;Electrical&#133;Naylor Group.</pre>
    <pre>The Official Bid Form for Naylor&#146;s bid stated: This tender may be
accepted for a period not exceeding seven (7) calendar days
beyond the period established in the tendering documents for
acceptance of the prime contractor&#146;s tender.  It is a condition
of this tender, that, when accepted, the subsequent contract will
be in the form of C.C.A. Document No. 1, &#133; and that the terms
will incorporate the relevant provisions of the contract between
Prime Contractor and Owner.
9    Ellis-Don violated the rules of the Bid Depository by
entering into a contract with Guild Electric. A prime contractor
&#147;is bound to place a sub-contract with one of the trade
contractors who used the Bid Depository&#148;: Rule 13(c).
10    In this case, the panel held that the omission of Ellis-
Don&#146;s name from the schedule was a factor to consider and not
decisive of the question.  Afterwards, Ellis-Don received a copy
of the draft decision of the panel, which would have denied the
grievance on the basis that the omission was decisive of the
question.  Between the date of the draft decision and the date of
the final decision a meeting of the full board of the OLRB took
place at which the draft decision was reviewed.  Ellis-Don
launched an application for judicial review seeking to set aside
and quash the panel&#146;s decision on the basis that it had been
denied natural justice by the actions of the panel of the OLR B.
Pending the judicial review, Ellis-Don brought two motions. One
motion was for a stay of the Board&#146;s decision until the judicial
review application was adjudicated. The second motion was for an
order compelling the chair, vice-chair and the registrar of the
OLRB to attend for examination under oath pursuant to rule 34.10
of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Steele J. sitting as a single
judge of the Divisional Court heard the motions. On June 26,
1992, he dismissed the motion for a stay. He granted the motion
to have the three people examined. O&#146;Driscoll J. on behalf of a
panel of the Divisional Court allowed an appeal by the IBEW and
the Attorney General. When the OLRB&#146;s decision was judicially
reviewed, the Divisional Court declined to find that natural
justice had been denied on the basis that whole board review of a
question of law by the OLRB had been expressly approved by the
S.C.C. in IWA v. Consolidated Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1
S.C.R. 282. See (1995), 89 O.A.C. 45. An appeal to the Court of
Appeal was also dismissed at (1998), 108 O.A.C. 301.  Leave to
appeal to the S.C.C. was granted January 21, 1999; see [1998]
S.C.C.A. No. 292.
11    This was an aspect of the Supreme Court&#146;s decision in Ron
Engineering, supra, upon which Romilly J. commented in Fred Welsh
Ltd. v. B.G.M. Construction Ltd., [1996] B.C.J. No. 802 (B.C.
S.C.) at para 43:</pre>
    <pre>     The plaintiff submits that the law of tendering from
     the Ron Engineering line of cases is an attempt by the
     courts to reconcile the reasonable expectations of all
     parties within the context of acceptable commercial
     standards and practice.  I concur with that view of the
     court&#146;s role.  Moreover, there is, now, a generally
     accepted duty of fairness upon those calling for
     tenders that includes a duty to avoid mischief and not
     give unfair advantage to any participant: Foundation
     Building West Inc. v. Vancouver (City) (1995), 22
     C.L.R. (2d) 94 (B.C.S.C.). The extent and scope of this
     duty in the particular circumstances is largely defined
     by the rules established in the Contract A between the
     parties.</pre>
    <pre>     In another Supreme Court decision, Lac Minerals Ltd. v.
International Corona Resources Ltd. (1989), 61 D.L.R. (4th) 14,
(S.C.C.), La Forest J. held at 47 the reasonable expectations of
the parties were linked to a duty of good faith:
        &#133; the institution of bargaining in good faith is one
        that is worthy of legal protection in those
        circumstances where that protection accords with the
        expectations of the parties
        </pre>
    <pre>     Furthermore, in an article entitled, Good Faith in Contract
Bargaining: General Principles and Recent Developments (19930, 15
Adv. Q. 57. Professor Cassels, comments that good faith means
giving effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties.  In
addition, situations in which one party seeks to snap up an
advantage in an unfair manner as well as situations where a party
wrongly seeks to avoid an obligation will be considered to be a
breach of the duty of good faith: Cassels, supra, at 78, 79, and
82.
12    The expectation of good faith and fair dealing has been has
been given recognition in construction cases in Chinook
Aggregates Ltd. v. Abbotsford (District) (1989), 40 B.C.L.R. (2d)
345 (B.C. C.A.); George Wimpey Canada v. Hamilton-Wentworth (Reg.
Mun.) (1997), 34 C.L.R. (2d) 123 (Ont. Gen. Div.) citing, inter
alia Preston Murphy v. The Town of Alberton (1993), 356 A.P.R. 34
(P.E.I. S.C.T.D.); Kencor Holdings Ltd. v. Government of
Saskatchewan, [1991] 6 W.W.R. 717 (Sask. Q.B.);  Vachon
Construction Ltd. v. Cariboo (1996), 136 D.L.R. (4th) 307 at 314-
5 (B.C. C.A.); Arrow Construction Products Ltd. v. Nova Scotia
(1996), 436 A.P.R. 241 at 253 (N.S. C.A.); and Health Care
Developers Inc. v. The Queen in Right of Newfoundland (1996), 136
D.L.R. (4th) 609 at 627 (Nfld. C.A.). These cases mainly involve
the effect to be given to the privilege clause in the call for
tenders, that is, a clause that reserves to the owner discretion
to choose a bid that is not the lowest bid.</pre></td>
