    <pre>HEARD:         November 12, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice D. Ferguson, sitting
with a jury, on January 19, 1998 and from the sentence imposed on
March 11, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant was convicted of attempted murder by a  court
composed of a judge and jury.  He appeals his conviction  on  the
basis  that  the trial judge failed to instruct the jury  on  the
defence of intoxication.
[2]  The offence arose out of an incident involving three
persons: the appellant, the victim (Holder), and another man
(Currie), during which the victim was stabbed in the abdomen by
the appellant.
[3]  The appellant did not testify.  The sole evidence respecting
the appellant's consumption of alcohol came from the evidence-in-
chief of the Crown witnesses Holder and Currie who were cross-
examined at length about their own consumption of alcohol.
However, they were not cross-examined about the appellant's
alcohol consumption.  There was no expert evidence about the
effects of alcohol consumption.  Moreover, as the Crown submits,
the defence of intoxication was not relied upon by the defence
and there is no suggestion that counsel did not act competently
in the appellant's defence.
[4]  While it may be argued that there was some confusion as to
the exact position taken by trial counsel with respect to
intoxication at the outset of trial, his subsequent conduct makes
it clear that he was not advancing this defence.  His decision
not to cross-examine the Crown witnesses regarding the
appellant's beer consumption and the failure to object when the
trial judge did not charge the jury on intoxication make it clear
that drunkenness was not being advanced as a defence.  In
addition, the trial judge conducted an extensive pre-charge
hearing during which defence counsel took the position that a
&quot;drunkenness&quot; instruction was not necessary.
[5]  On the basis of the evidence, the appellant drank about
eight beers between 7:00 p.m. and the stabbing of the victim
which took place between approximately 10:00 p.m. and 3:48 a.m.
the next morning.  As stated earlier, the appellant did not
testify about his condition and no expert evidence was led.  In
addition, there was no pre-offence or post-offence conduct to
suggest that the appellant was intoxicated.
[6]  In our view, there was no air of reality to the defence of
drunkenness in this case and a clear decision was made by the
appellant not to advance this defence.  The evidence was not such
that it should override counsel's decision.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed.
