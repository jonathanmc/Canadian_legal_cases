    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice D. S. Crane dated
March 27, 1997

ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellants Dofasco Inc. and James T.  Melville  appeal
from  the judgment of Crane J. finding them jointly and severally
liable  to  the  respondent NBD Bank, Canada  in  the  amount  of
$1,984,945.27   U.S.   for   negligent  misrepresentation.    The
appellants raise a number of factual and legal issues  that  will
require a detailed summary of the facts.  The essential issues in
the  litigation,  however, concern the legal  effect  of  several
telephone  calls that occurred on January 10 and 11, 1991  and  a
letter  that  was sent on January 10, 1991.  These communications
led  to  a  decision by the respondent to fund  cheques  totaling
approximately  $4 million U.S. in accordance with a  $20  million
credit   facility  given  by  the  respondent  to  Algoma   Steel
Corporation  Limited.   At  the  time,  Algoma,  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary of Dofasco, was in serious financial difficulty.   The
trial  judge found that Percival Nicholas an official at  Dofasco
and James Melville, Algoma&#146;s Vice-President (Finance), misled the
respondent as to Algoma&#146;s true financial state.  As a  result  of
these  misleading representations the respondent agreed  to  lend
the  requested $4 million.  Two weeks later, Algoma  and  Dofasco
announced  that  Algoma was insolvent.  Algoma  was  subsequently
able to restructure under the auspices of the Companies Creditors
Arrangment  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 [CCAA] but  the  respondent
suffered  a  significant loss.  For the reasons  that  follow,  I
would  dismiss the appeals.  The respondent cross-appeals on  the
basis that, inter alia, the trial judge erred in finding that the
tort  of  deceit was not made out.  In view of my conclusions  on
the appeals, it is unnecessary to deal with the cross-appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>The persons involved
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  respondent, NBD Bank, Canada, is a Canadian  chartered
bank and is a subsidiary of NBD Bank N.A., which is based in  the
United  States.   The original agreement between Algoma  and  the
respondent was made in October 1987.  That agreement was  amended
from time to time.  The principal witness for the respondent  was
Jeremy  Hynes.   He  joined the Bank as second vice-president  in
September 1990 and immediately became responsible for the  Algoma
account.  The allegedly negligent misrepresentations were made to
Mr.  Hynes.   Mr.  Hynes reported to the respondent&#146;s  president,
William Schmid.
[3]  Algoma was Canada&#146;s third largest steel producer and was
based in Sault Ste. Marie.  The appellant James Melville began
working for Algoma as a teenager.  After finishing university and
law school he returned to Sault Ste. Marie and joined Algoma as a
solicitor.  In 1990 and 1991 he was Algoma&#146;s Vice-President
(Finance), Secretary and Treasurer.  He was the person at Algoma
with whom Mr. Hynes dealt.
[4]  Algoma had a United States subsidiary, Cannelton Coal Co.
It was proposing to sell Cannelton in 1991.  This sale would
provide necessary working capital for Algoma and was critical to
any successful restructuring.  The alleged negligent
misrepresentations concerned the funding of cheques in the amount
of $4 million, which included the Cannelton payroll.
[5]  The appellant Dofasco acquired ownership of the shares in
Algoma in August 1988.  It had invested $600 million in Algoma,
but by late 1990 that investment was in peril.  Initially, Algoma
operated autonomously, with operations and overall responsibility
left to the management and the board of Algoma.  However, in July
1990, the operation of the daily cash management function for
Algoma was transferred to Dofasco.  John Rule, a Dofasco treasury
analyst, assumed responsibility for netting out the daily
payables and receivables for Algoma and its subsidiaries and, as
necessary, accessing the appropriate bank facilities, including
the facility at the respondent.  Rule had responsibility for
contacting the traders in the respondent&#146;s trading room.  Rule
was named as a defendant.  The trial judge dismissed the claim
against him.
[6]  Rule&#146;s superior was Percival Nicholas, the manager of cash
and banking in Dofasco&#146;s treasury department. The trial judge
found that Nicholas made negligent misrepresentations to Mr.
Hynes.  Dofasco accepted that it was vicariously liable for the
actions of Nicholas.1  Nicholas reported to Allen Root, the
Dofasco treasurer, who in turn reported to Dofasco&#146;s vice-
president finance, Bill Solski.</pre>
    <pre>The Credit Facility
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  initial  credit facility between  the  respondent  and
Algoma  was  taken  out  in 1987.  That facility  was  unsecured,
uncommitted, and subject to payment on demand.  The facility  was
used  primarily to fund, on a daily basis, cash flow requirements
of Algoma's U.S. accounts with NBD Bank, N.A.  Thus, if the total
payables  exceeded the total receivables in the U.S. accounts  on
any  day,  Algoma would borrow U.S. dollars from the  respondent,
which  would  be  transferred to NBD  Bank,  N.A.  to  cover  the
deficiency.   Paragraph (e) of the facility  originally  provided
that  Algoma  was  to maintain unused portions  of  other  credit
facilities  with other banks in amounts sufficient to  repay  any
advance made by the respondent.  In November 1988, the respondent
agreed  to  remove paragraph (e) on condition that  Algoma  would
notify  the  respondent if the other available credit  facilities
fell below $20,000,000 Cdn.
[8]  The mechanics for accessing the facility are important.  The
facility contemplated that Algoma would notify the respondent by
telephone that it wished to borrow money.  Under the facility,
the amount of the loan and the interest rate were to be agreed
upon by the respondent and Algoma&#146;s Assistant Treasurer and its
supervisor of cash operations.  In 1990, Mr. Hynes had the
authority to approve the loan on behalf of the respondent.  In
the normal course, other persons handled the day-to-day
management of the facility.
[9]  As indicated, in July 1990, Dofasco and Algoma integrated
their treasury functions at Dofasco.  Accordingly, Dofasco
employees, in particular John Rule, became responsible for
dealing with the respondent on a day-to-day basis.  The trial
judge found that while Mr. Rule actually dealt with one of the
traders in the respondent&#146;s trading room, the loan had to be
approved by the loan officer, Mr. Hynes.  The appellants
challenge this finding and it forms one of the grounds of appeal.
In short, the appellants argue that even if there were negligent
misrepresentations, they did not result in any loss because the
loans that caused the loss were made before any
misrepresentations, as a result of the communications between Mr.
Rule and the traders.  I will return to the facts in support of
this submission below when I deal in detail with the events of
January 10 and 11, 1991.
[10] Dofasco did not otherwise have a direct customer/bank
relationship with the respondent.  It did have a banking
relationship with the respondent&#146;s parent company, NBD Bank N.A.
There is some suggestion in the evidence that NBD Bank N.A. was
anxious to ensure that relations between Algoma and the
respondent did not adversely affect the relationship between the
two parent companies.  An underlying theory of the defence was
that the decision to advance the $4 million was made so as not to
prejudice the relationship between the two parent companies and
that Mr. Hynes was not seeking information or assurances from
Dofasco officials in January 1990.  Rather, he was merely keeping
them &#147;in the loop&#148; at the request of NBD Bank N.A.</pre>
    <pre>The strike
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  In mid-1990, Algoma&#146;s employees went on strike.  The strike
lasted  for 112 days and was the longest strike in the  company&#146;s
history.    Algoma,  which  was  already  in  a  weak   financial
condition,  was further weakened by the strike.  Even  after  the
strike  was  settled (November 21, 1990), Algoma would experience
short-term financing difficulties during the &#147;ramping-up&#148; period.
At  this  time, the company had to pay the full cost of producing
steel  and had no choice but to wait the normal course of payment
of  sixty  to ninety days before it received payment.   Thus,  in
late  1990, Algoma had a need for cash to meet its fixed overhead
costs and the costs of production following the settlement of the
strike.</pre>
    <pre>The fall of 1990
</pre>
    <pre>[12]  However,  the short-term problems caused by the  ramping-up
after the strike were not Algoma&#146;s only problems.  Its income had
been  falling  steadily since 1988 while its capital expenditures
had  been  increasing.  In early 1989, Dofasco had loaned  Algoma
$100  million (unsecured).  By 1990, the steel industry had moved
into  a  downturn.  The weakest companies, like Algoma, would  be
most  affected by these adverse economic conditions.  In  October
1990, Dofasco initiated a project under the code name &#147;Liz Dodge&#148;
for   &#147;dislodging  Algoma  from  Dofasco&#148;.   In  November   1990,
Dofasco&#146;s  chief financial officer reported to the Dofasco  board
that  Algoma  was in very serious financial trouble and  that  by
continuing  to  support Algoma, Dofasco itself would  be  put  at
risk.  The immediate cause of concern was a request by Algoma  to
increase its credit facilities with its other bankers (i.e. other
than the respondent).  The syndicate of bankers, led by the Royal
Bank, was willing to give Algoma a new $250 million facility only
if  Dofasco would provide some form of guarantee.  Algoma  needed
the  increase in the credit facility in part to fund $122 million
in debentures that were coming due on November 30, 1990.  Dofasco
refused  to  guarantee the loan.  Instead, Dofasco purchased  the
debentures  itself.  The trial judge found that this  &#147;desperate&#148;
purchase  was  to  give  the  Dofasco Board  sufficient  time  to
establish study teams on the Algoma situation to present  options
to  the  Dofasco Board at the end of January 1991.  The  work  of
these  committees, including the Liz Dodge committee, took  on  a
new  urgency  as  a  result  of the November  developments.   The
committees included experts in insolvency.
[13] The trial judge found that the appellants knew that from
November 1990, standing alone Algoma was no longer solvent.  They
recognized that Algoma had to be restructured if it were to
survive.
[14] The next crisis for Algoma was a $32.5 million milestone
payment upon the existing syndicated bank credit facility due on
December 31, 1990.  Dofasco sought to defer this payment.  This
would require an amendment to the Royal Bank facility.
Mr. Solski and Mr. Nicholas of Dofasco met with the Royal Bank
and in late December, the banks agreed to the postponement.  At a
Dofasco Board meeting in December, a presentation was made
concerning reorganization of Algoma, including a discussion of
the CCAA.  Mr. Melville was present for this presentation.</pre>
    <pre>January 1991
</pre>
    <pre>[15] On January 3, 1991, Mr. Hynes called Mr. Nicholas because he
was  concerned that the failure to pay the $32.5 million  to  the
Royal  Bank,  which had been publicly announced, was  a  default.
Mr.  Nicholas  told  him that the payment was not  defaulted  but
deferred to provide a window to Algoma for the purpose of ramping-
up  after the strike.  Nicholas also told Hynes that Dofasco  was
not putting more money into Algoma and that the respondent should
do  whatever  it had to do to get comfortable with  Algoma  as  a
stand-alone  credit  risk.  He referred Hynes  to  the  appellant
Melville for any further inquiries.
[16] The following day, Hynes spoke to Melville.  Melville
confirmed the deferral of the $32.5 million.  He also said that
Algoma had $60 million in available working credit lines, but
that Algoma would need $80 million to ramp up after the strike.
He said that they would be back to normal operations at the end
of March.  In his evidence, Mr. Melville agreed that this
statement about available credit was misleading and incorrect.
It would seem that Algoma was now in breach of the terms of the
facility by not informing the respondent that available credit
facilities had fallen below $20,000,000.
[17] Mr. Melville also promised to provide statements of cash
flow analysis to show how Algoma would be dealing with the
demands on cash flow.  The trial judge rejected Melville&#146;s
evidence that he only promised to provide an analysis of how
Algoma intended to use the monies borrowed from the respondent.
The trial judge found that Melville knew that if he provided the
cash flow forecasts to Mr. Hynes the loan facility with the
respondent would be cancelled.  The trial judge found that there
was an implied misrepresentation to the effect that the cash flow
statements would support the representation that Algoma&#146;s
problems were due to the short-term ramping-up problem.  In any
event, Mr. Melville did not provide a cash flow statement, nor a
statement of the estimated cash activity of the facility with the
respondent at any time.  The trial judge also referred to minutes
of an Algoma Board meeting of January 7 in which there was a
discussion led by Mr. Melville on a six-month cash flow forecast
which indicated that a shortfall, in comparison to existing
available credit lines, would occur in early February.
[18] There was other evidence that the cash flow problem was even
more desperate.  At a meeting of the Liz Dodge committee on
January 7, one of the members noted that unless Algoma could
obtain access to the credit line with the respondent or sell
pellets to Dofasco, Algoma would run out of cash that week.  Mr.
Nicholas had previously noted in his diary that the proposed sale
of the pellets to Dofasco could be attacked by creditors in the
future as an improper preference.  Mr. Nicholas was now working
in his day-to-day cash management function for Algoma in an
atmosphere of crisis.  Cash flow estimates that were normally
prepared every month were now prepared every day.
[19] Then, on January 9, Mr. Hynes learned from a colleague that
the Royal Bank line of credit was secured.  In the result, the
respondent was now the only unsecured lender to Algoma.  Mr.
Hynes' superior instructed him to limit the facility to the
current level, which on that date stood at $700,000 U.S.  Mr.
Hynes did not immediately pass on this information to the
appellants.</pre>
    <pre>January 10, 11, 1991
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  On  January 10, Mr. Rule of Dofasco called the respondent&#146;s
trading room and requested a loan of $4 million to cover cheques,
including  the  Cannelton Coal payroll.   Dishonouring  of  these
cheques  could impair the sale of Cannelton, which was  important
to  any  restructuring of Algoma.  The trading room conversations
are  tape-recorded and transcripts of the relevant  conversations
were produced at the trial.  As indicated, it is the position  of
the   appellants   that  the  loans  were   made   during   these
conversations,  before  the  representations  by   Nicholas   and
Melville  that  the  trial judge found  to  be  misleading.   The
substance of the conversation between Mr. Rule and the trader  at
10:00  a.m.  on  January 10 was as follows.  Mr.  Rule  made  the
request  for  $4 million in addition to the $700,000 outstanding.
The trader replied, &#147;Okay that shall be done and I think it looks
as though its going to be 7 + 7/8&#148;.  The respondent&#146;s trader then
relayed  the request to Mr. Hynes.  Mr. Hynes conferred with  his
superior and they decided that the respondent would not make  the
loan.  Fifteen minutes after the trading-room conversation, Hynes
left  an urgent message for Nicholas.  Nicholas returned the call
with Mr. Rule present to participate by way of speaker telephone.
Hynes  said  that  there was no alternative  but  to  return  the
cheques  since the respondent would not make the loan.   Nicholas
said either &#147;you can&#146;t bounce cheques&#148; or &#147;hold on, let&#146;s not  be
rash,  something can be worked out&#148;.  Nicholas said Hynes  should
speak to Melville.
[21] Mr. Hynes put in a call to Mr. Melville.  The call was
returned in the mid-afternoon on January 10th.  Melville was
confrontational and demanded that the respondent make the $4
million loan.  Hynes told Melville of the respondent&#146;s concern
because they had just learned about the Royal Bank security.
Melville told Hynes that Royal Bank had been secured for ten
years.  This was only partially true.  From time to time the line
of credit had been secured.  However, more recently the Royal
Bank had taken security on the line of credit in its annual
credit review, before the strike. After the conversation, Hynes
again consulted with his superiors and the decision not to fund
the loan was confirmed.  Hynes was told to inform Dofasco of the
decision.
[22] Hynes called Nicholas, who urged him to speak to Melville
again because Melville was &#147;reasonable&#148;.  Nicholas also told
Hynes that the cheques could not be funded elsewhere because
Algoma did not have sufficient margins available under the Royal
Bank facility to permit more borrowing.  It would seem that this
is the first time that the respondent learned that Algoma was in
breach of the terms of the facility.  Nicholas urged Hynes to
call Melville to see if something could be worked out.
[23] Mr. Hynes again called Mr. Melville.  The trial judge found
that the most serious misrepresentations were made during this
conversation.  There were conflicting versions of this
conversation.  The trial judge accepted Mr. Hynes' evidence over
that of Mr. Melville.  Mr. Hynes returned to the issue that the
Royal Bank had security.  Mr. Melville indicated that the U.S.
accounts were not encumbered and that if the respondent&#146;s
discomfort was that it was the only unsecured lender, he could
give it the U.S. accounts receivable.  He said that there were
about $2 to $3 million receivables but these were going to
increase as Algoma ramped up after the strike.  They also talked
about the cash flows that had been promised six days earlier
regarding the ramp-up as Algoma&#146;s operations returned to normal.
Melville also said that he had the proceeds from the Cannelton
sale coming in around March 1st and that could be used to pay out
the respondent.
[24] Following the conversation, Mr. Hynes typed out a letter
summarizing the conversation and faxed a copy to Mr. Melville at
Algoma and Mr. Nicholas at Dofasco.  The letter was as follows:

          This   confirms   and  is  further   to   our
          conversation  of January 10,  1991  regarding
          the captioned unsecured facilities.  The Bank
          originally     provided    its    uncommitted
          facilities in return for an undertaking  from
          Algoma  that  it  would  maintain  sufficient
          unutilized credit facilities from  its  other
          banks to retire outstandings under NBD Bank's
          facilities   upon   request.    In    letters
          exchanged  August 15, 1988  and  November  4,
          1988  this was modified to an undertaking  by
          Algoma   to   advise   the   Bank   if    the
          aforementioned  unutilized  facilities   fell
          below Cdn. $20,000,000.  The intent hereunder
          was   clearly  to  ensure  that  NBD   Bank's
          unsecured  position could be funded  from  an
          alternative source at any time.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Today's conversations with you, John Rule and
          Perc  Nicholas at Dofasco indicate that  this
          reserve  is  not  available to  fund  cheques
          written  by  Algoma against its  U.S.  Dollar
          account  at NBD Bank, N.A. in Detroit.   This
          places the Bank in the unforeseen position of
          choosing whether to return Algoma cheques  to
          cap  its  exposure  at  current  levels.   In
          conversations  last week, NBD  (assuming  the
          other    unutilized    facilities    existed)
          expressed its desire to limit Algoma's use of
          its   facilities  to  U.S.  $8,000,000  until
          Algoma  could  provide information  regarding
          its  credit  needs and cash inflows  for  the
          first quarter of 1991.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Although   this  information  has  not   been
          received    and    it   appears    unutilized
          alternative funds to clear cheques  drawn  on
          NBD are not available, the Bank wants to help
          Algoma.    In  order  to  clear  the  cheques
          outstanding,  could  you  please  provide  no
          later  than  12:00 p.m. Friday,  January  11,
          1991 the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1. a list of the cheques (or cheque groups like
             payroll)  outstanding and the  date(s)  they
	     were written;
          2. confirmation that no further cheques are being
	     drawn on NBD until a mutually-satisfactory line
	     of credit has been arranged;
          3. a statement of the amount of outstanding receivables
             available to reduce outstandings, along with your
	     undertaking that these lock-box proceeds will be
	     dedicated to reducing NBD's exposure from its peak
	     not to exceed U.S. $8,000,000;
          4. your estimate of the U.S. receivables available
	     going forward which are not pledged to any other
	     lender and Algoma is willing to pledge to secure
	     a mutually-satisfactory credit facility from NBD;
          5. your  undertaking that, if NBD  temporarily
             provides  advances  to Algoma  that  exceed
             the  amount  of  the  mutually-satisfactory
             credit  facility  to  be  arranged,  Algoma
             will  first  apply cash proceeds  from  the
             sale  of its U.S. coal assets to repay said
             excess  advances.  If no  facility  can  be
             agreed,  the  aforementioned proceeds  will
             first   be   used  to  retire   all   NBD's
             exposure.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  preceding  request does  not  materially
          deviate  from  the information outlined  last
          week  to assist NBD in accommodating Algoma's
          first quarter cash needs.  It is NBD's desire
          to  meet  Algoma's banking needs during  this
          difficult  period of restructuring,  if  this
          can be accomplished without exposing the Bank
          to an unsecured, uncovered position without a
          highly  probable  source of  repayment.   NBD
          trusts that Algoma understands this and  will
          provide  it  with  the assurances  needed  to
          continue our good relationship.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Please provide the requested reply as soon as
          possible.  Thank you for your cooperation  in
          this matter.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  trial  judge found several misrepresentations  by  Mr.
Melville in this conversation and as recorded in the letter.  The
U.S.   receivables  were  not  available  as  security   to   the
respondent.   Melville knew that they had  been  pledged  to  the
Royal Bank.  The representation about the Cannelton Coal proceeds
was misleading since it was dependent upon Algoma still being  an
operating  and viable entity in control of its assets.   Melville
knew  that as early as January 22, 1991, Algoma could be declared
insolvent.
[26] At approximately 10:00 a.m. on January 11, Mr. Rule
telephoned the respondent&#146;s trading room and spoke to Peter
Evans, the respondent&#146;s senior vice-president, money market and
chief trader.  Dofasco relies on this conversation, because it
precedes the communication between Mr. Hynes and Mr. Nicholas
that was the basis of Dofasco&#146;s liability.  Mr. Rule asked the
trader if they can &#147;roll the 4.7 today&#148;.  Mr. Evans replied that
he did not think it was a problem but he wanted to talk to Mr.
Hynes because he was aware that there had been a lot of activity
the previous night and he wasn&#146;t sure if Mr. Hynes had &#147;resolved
his problem&#148;.  When Evans came back on the telephone he said the
following:

               Here now, apparently what happened  as a
	  result of these  conversations we have rolled
	  the funds.  The thing is he  is going to  ask
	  for prime on it so it would go to 9-1/2%.
               &#133;
                Okay 4.7 for three days and then I will
          get   Jerry  [Hynes]  to  speak  to  all  the
          interested  parties, obviously  resolve  what
          ever his concerns are with them.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Mr. Rule replied &#147;okay&#148;.  Mr. Hynes testified and confirmed
that  Mr.  Evans did talk to him and he had asked for the  higher
interest rate.  Mr. Hynes spoke to Mr. Nicholas on the morning of
January   11th,   sometime   after   this   conversation.    This
conversation  formed  the basis of liability  of  the  appellant,
Dofasco.   Hynes  asked Nicholas if he had seen the  letter.   He
said  that he had and they reviewed its contents.  Nicholas  said
that, &#147;it sounded reasonable to me&#148; and, &#147;Is this okay with Jamie
[Melville]?&#148;  Hynes testified that at that point it &#147;looked  like
a done deal&#148;, the only thing left was for Melville to get back to
him as required in the letter.  He told Nicholas that the cheques
would  clear.   The trial judge found that as a  result  of  this
conversation  Hynes  waived the noon  deadline  set  out  in  the
letter.
[28] Later in the day, Mr. Hynes received a letter from Mr.
Melville.  That letter merely confirmed that Algoma would not
write any further cheques on the credit facility until a new or
amended facility had been approved and Melville&#146;s understanding
that the amount outstanding against the facility was
approximately $6.4 million.  The trial judge characterized this
letter as &#147;disingenuous&#148;.  Mr. Hynes was concerned that this was
not a response to the five points in his January 10th letter and
he tried to get hold of Melville.  They eventually talked around
4:40 p.m. and the conversation lasted about twenty minutes. At
the end of the conversation, Mr. Hynes was satisfied that he had
a deal.  Melville repeated the representations about the U.S.
receivables.  He somewhat modified the representation about the
Cannelton Coal sale, indicating that in the event the U.S.
receivables were not sufficient, the Cannelton proceeds would be
available to take the respondent out, subject to approval by the
Board.  Mr. Hynes believed that this agreement would be
documented within the next three weeks to make the respondent a
secured lender. Mr. Hynes took no steps to dishonour the cheques
after this conversation.  He testified that had he been told of
Algoma&#146;s potential insolvency, the respondent would not have
cleared the cheques.
[29] Mr. Hynes spoke to Mr. Melville the next week about
receiving the cash flow estimates.  For the first time, Melville
stated that he could not give the respondent the U.S. receivables
without Board approval, but the Board would be meeting in two
weeks to consider the new arrangement.  Mr. Hynes made several
attempts to get hold of Melville over the next few days, but was
unsuccessful.  In the meantime, he prepared the necessary
paperwork that Melville would need to present to the Algoma
Board.
[30] On January 22nd, Dofasco&#146;s Board decided not to extend any
further financial support to Algoma and to write off its equity
interest in Algoma.  On the same day, Algoma&#146;s Board decided to
pursue a financial restructuring.  On January 23rd, Melville sent
Mr. Hynes a press release indicating that Algoma was seeking to
restructure its debt and that &#147;all reasonable forecasts show the
company is unable to produce adequate cash flow to support the
heavy debt load, even with the contemplated sale of Cannelton
[Coal]&#148;.  Mr. Hynes had never been provided with the promised
cash flow forecasts.  When he received the press release, Mr.
Hynes tried to get hold of Nicholas.  Nicholas referred him back
to Melville.  By this time he was very angry.  He felt that he
had been negotiating in good faith with Algoma and that this turn
of events was &#147;inappropriate&#148;.
[31] On January 30th, the respondent made a demand of Algoma on
the Facility.  Algoma did not respond.  On June 1, 1992, a court-
ordered arrangement was entered into under the CCAA, whereby
Algoma was restructured and emerged under new ownership.  As a
result of the restructuring, the respondent received
approximately $1.6 million U.S., resulting in a net loss of about
$2 million U.S.  Under the CCAA arrangement, the respondent was
barred from bringing an action for misrepresentation against
Algoma itself.</pre>
    <pre>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</pre>
    <pre>Liability of Mr. Melville
</pre>
    <pre>[32]  I  have referred to some of the findings made by the  trial
judge  in relation to the appellant Mr. Melville.   To summarize,
the  trial  judge  found  the  following  misrepresent-ations  by
Melville.  I have placed in square brackets a very brief  summary
of  the  findings  by the trial judge as to  the  true  state  of
affairs.

          January 4, 1991:

                1.    Algoma was having short term cash
          problems  due to the &#147;ramping up&#148;  after  the
          strike.  [Implying  that this  was  the  only
          problem   when  there  was  a   longer   term
          structural problem.]
                2.    The  promise to supply cash  flow
          statements.  [Wrongly implying that the  cash
          flow  statements would support the short term
          &#147;ramping up&#148; problem.]

          January 10, 1991:

                1.    The Royal Bank line of credit had
          been  secured for about 10 years.  [In  fact,
          the  security  had only been  taken  in  June
          1990.]
                2.    Algoma&#146;s U.S. accounts receivable
          were not pledged and available as security to
          the    respondent.    [In   fact,   all   the
          receivables,  including  the  U.S.  accounts,
          were pledged to the Royal Bank.]
                3.    The  respondent&#146;s  loan  position
          would  be paid out upon the sale of Cannelton
          Coal.   [The  truth  of  this  representation
          depended   upon   Algoma   still   being   an
          operating, viable entity in late February  or
          March and in control of its assets.  Melville
          was   not   in  a  position  to   make   this
          representation since he knew Algoma could  be
          insolvent  by  January  22,  1991  after  the
          meetings  of  the Dofasco and Algoma  boards.
          Melville  did  not  disclose  this  fact   to
          Hynes.]</pre>
    <pre>Liability of Dofasco</pre>
    <pre>[33] Dofasco&#146;s liability turns on the representations made by Mr.
Nicholas  in  his conversation with Mr. Hynes on the  morning  of
January  11,  1991.   The  trial judge found  that  Mr.  Nicholas
affirmed  the  contents of the January 10th letter knowing  inter
alia that the receivables were already pledged to the Royal Bank.
The  trial  judge  made  this finding, in part,  because  of  the
context  set by earlier conversations with Mr. Hynes  that  would
have  led him to believe that Algoma did have something to  offer
the  respondent  to give it sufficient comfort  to  make  the  $4
million  loan.  In addition, the trial judge found  that  in  the
circumstances, the only non-negligent response Mr. Nicholas could
make to Mr. Hynes&#146; inquiries was to expressly disclaim.  However,
since he found a positive misrepresentation it is unnecessary  to
determine  whether the failure to disclaim or disclose  the  true
state  of Algoma&#146;s financial state of affairs would alone suffice
to render Dofasco liable.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Mr.  Melville  and Dofasco raised many grounds  of  appeal.
Some of them are common to the two appellants.  Where possible  I
have  grouped the common grounds together.  I intend to deal with
the grounds of appeal in the following order:

   1.   When the loans were made &#150; the indoor management rule.
               (a)  As applied to Mr. Melville
               (b)  As applied to Dofasco
   2.   Mr. Melville&#146;s  personal liability
   3.   The duty of care with respect to negligent misrepresentation
               (a)  As applied to Mr. Melville
                    i.  Sufficiently close or &#147;special&#148; relationship
		    (the prima facie duty of care)
                    ii. Policy reasons for not attributing personal
		    liability
               (b)  As applied to Dofasco
   4.   The standard of care imposed on Dofasco
   5.   The Statute of Frauds
   6.   Misrepresentations by Mr. Melville
   7.   Negligent misrepresentation by Mr. Nicholas (Dofasco&#146;s
   liability)</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>1.   When the loans were made&#151;the indoor management rule
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)   As applied to Mr. Melville</pre>
    <pre>[35] Counsel for the appellant Melville submits that although the
trial  judge found misrepresentations by Melville on  January  4,
1991  concerning the cash flow estimates, the misrepresentations,
if  any,  that  caused  the  loss  to  the  respondent  were  Mr.
Melville&#146;s  statements  to Mr. Hynes on January  10th  and  11th.
Counsel  submits that even these conversations did not cause  any
loss to the respondent, because the loans were made prior to  the
misrepresentations.
[36] I am prepared to deal with this submission on the basis that
Mr. Melville would not have been found liable based solely on the
January 4th conversation.  In my view, this ground of appeal
cannot succeed.  The trial judge dealt with this issue only as it
applies to the January 10th conversation.  That was sufficient to
find liability on Melville&#146;s behalf.  It was not sufficient for
dealing with the appellant Dofasco and I will deal with that
below.  With respect to the January 10th trading room
conversations, the trial judge made the following findings.  The
trading room telephone conversations did not effect the actual
loan.  Since it was a term of the facility that it was
uncommitted, a loan officer such as Mr. Hynes would have to
approve the loan.  The procedure in the trading room was that
when a request for funds was received, the trader would quote a
rate of interest and determine the duration of the advance.  The
trader then took this request to the loan officer.  Upon the
request being approved the internal transfers would be made in
the United States to cover the indebtedness in the Algoma
account.  In this case, when the request for $4 million U.S. was
made on January 10th, the decision was made not to fund and Mr.
Hynes advised Mr. Nicholas a short time later that the respondent
required the $4 million to be funded elsewhere.  It was after
this decision was conveyed first to Mr. Nicholas and then to Mr.
Melville that Mr. Melville made the misrepresentations.
[37] The appellant argues that so far as Algoma was concerned,
the loan was completed during the initial trading room
conversation and in accordance with the indoor management rule,
the respondent cannot set up its own internal procedures as a
defence.  In my view, that is not what occurred here.  Under the
terms of the facility between Algoma and the respondent, there
was no commitment by the respondent to lend.  It was unsecured.
Its only protection, as the trial judge observed, was in the
assessment of the risk of each advance.  This was not something
that Algoma could reasonably believe would be left to someone in
the trading room.  It was open to the trial judge to find that in
those circumstances there could be no loan until a loan officer
had approved.  The subsequent course of events involving Mr.
Hynes, Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Melville indicate that everyone
understood that the loan had not been funded on January 10th.

               (b)  As applied to Dofasco</pre>
    <pre>[38]  While  the trial judge did not deal specifically  with  the
trading room conversation on January 11th, in my view the  indoor
management rule had no application.  By late January 10th, all of
the  parties were aware that unless Algoma made some satisfactory
arrangement with the respondent, the $4 million loan would not be
funded   and  the  cheques  would  be  dishonoured.   The  indoor
management  rule  has no application where the  other  party  has
knowledge  of  the limitation on the authority:  Anderson  Lumber
Co.  Ltd.  v.  Canadian Conifer Ltd. (1977), 77 D.L.R.  (3d)  126
(Alta. S.C. App. Div.).  Dofasco knew, through Mr. Nicholas, that
the loan would not be funded unless Mr. Hynes received a reply to
his  letter of January 10th, by noon on January 11th.  It may  be
that  Mr.  Hynes  waived that requirement when he  spoke  to  Mr.
Nicholas, received Mr. Nicholas&#146; assurances and told him that the
cheques  would be cleared.  However, that does not assist Dofasco
in  this  case,  since  by that time Mr. Nicholas  had  made  the
statements  upon  which  the  trial judge  imposed  liability  on
Dofasco.
[39] There is a further problem with this submission by the
appellant.  At the time of the conversations on the mornings of
January 10 and 11, the cheques had not yet cleared.  Algoma had
breached its agreement with the respondent in that it had not
informed the respondent that it no longer had $20 million credit
available.  Mr. Hynes only learned of this state of affairs on
January 10th after the trading room conversation on that date.
In any event, as indicated, the essential features of this
facility were that it was unsecured, uncommitted, and subject to
payment on demand.  As late as 5:00 p.m. on January 11, the
respondent with some effort could have dishonoured the cheques
and thus not suffered any loss.  In my view, given the terms of
the facility it would have been entitled to do so, even if the
loans were made during the trading room conversations on January
10 and 11.  See Barclay Construction Corp. v. Bank of Montreal
(1989), 41 B.C.L.R. (2d) 239 (C.A.) and Inter-City Express Ltd.
v. Toronto-Dominion Bank (1976), 66 D.L.R. (3d) 754 (B.C.S.C.).
The respondent did not make a demand nor dishonour the cheques
and thereby continued to extend credit to Algoma because of the
representations by Mr. Melville and Mr. Nicholas.
[40] Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
appeal in respect of either appellant.</pre>
    <pre>2.   Mr. Melville&#146;s personal liability</pre>
    <pre>[41]  Mr.  Melville argues that he should not be held  personally
liable  for  acts that he performed in his role as an officer  of
the  company  and  for the benefit of the company.   Counsel,  in
effect,  put this submission on two different bases.   First,  he
argues that the respondent should not be permitted to pierce  the
corporate  veil to render Mr. Melville liable for acts  done  for
the  benefit  of his corporate employer, in accordance  with  the
decision  in ScotiaMcLeod Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd.  (1995),
26  O.R.  (3d)  481  (C.A.).   Second,  he  argues  that  in  his
individual  capacity Mr. Melville did not owe a duty of  care  to
the  respondent.   I will deal with this first  submission  under
this heading.
[42] In ScotiaMcLeod at pp. 490-91, Finlayson J.A. held that
absent fraud, deceit, dishonesty or want of authority it is rare
for officers of companies to be held personally liable for
actions ostensibly carried out under a corporate name &#147;unless it
can be shown that their actions are themselves tortious or
exhibit a separate identity or interest from that of the
company&#148;.  The short answer to the appellant&#146;s submission is that
the respondent established to the trial judge&#146;s satisfaction that
Mr. Melville&#146;s actions were themselves tortious.  In the
subsequent decision of this court in ADGA Systems International
Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 101, Carthy J.A.
speaking for the court confirmed that the general rule is that
officers are liable for their own tortious acts.  As he said at
p. 107:

     The consistent line of authority in Canada holds simply
     that, in all events, officers, directors and employees of
     corporations are responsible for their tortious conduct even
     though that conduct was directed in a bona fide manner to the
     best interests of the company, always subject to the Said v. Butt
     exception.2</pre>
    <pre>[43]  In  Valcom,  the  plaintiff  claimed  against  a  corporate
competitor  and a director and two employees of that  competitor.
The  action  was based on allegations that the competitor  raided
the  plaintiff&#146;s  employees  and caused  the  plaintiff  economic
damage.   Carthy J.A. held that the action could proceed  against
the individuals and he concluded with this comment:

     It is my conclusion that there is no principled basis for
     protecting the director and employees of Valcom from liability
     for their alleged conduct on the basis that such conduct was in
     pursuance of the interests of the corporation. It may be that for
     policy reasons the law as to the allocation of responsibility for
     tortious conduct should be adjusted to provide some protection to
     employees, officers or directors, or all of them, in limited
     circumstances where, for instance, they are acting in the best
     interests of the corporation with parties who have voluntarily
     chosen to accept the ambit of risk of a limited liability
     company. However, the creation of such a policy should not evolve
     from the facts of this case where the alleged conduct was
     intentional and the only relationship between the corporate
     parties was as competitors. Any such evolution should await facts
     which are apposite to the policy concerns and should probably be
     articulated as a definitive extension of the defence in Said v.
     Butt. Such a development would be in the direction indicated by
     La Forest J. in his dissenting reasons in London Drugs and thus
     may have to await further consideration by the Supreme Court.
     [Emphasis added.]3</pre>
    <pre>[44]  Similarly, I can see no basis for protecting  Mr.  Melville
from  liability  for  his  tortious acts towards  the  respondent
simply  because  he  may have been acting  in  pursuance  of  the
interests  of  the corporation.  If he is to avoid liability,  it
can  only be on the basis that he did not owe a duty of  care  to
the respondent and I turn to that issue now as it affects both of
the appellants</pre>
    <pre>The duty of care with respect to negligent misrepresentation</pre>
    <pre>          (a) As applied to Mr. Melville</pre>
    <pre>[45]  The appellant, Melville, argues that he did not owe a  duty
of  care in his personal capacity to the respondent in accordance
with  the  test in Anns v. Merton London Borough Council,  [1978]
A.C.  728  (H.L.).  The appellant makes two submissions  in  this
respect.   He  submits that it was not reasonable or  foreseeable
that  the respondent would be relying on him personally.  Second,
he  submits that there are policy reasons why personal  liability
should  not  be  found against him in the circumstances  of  this
case.  These submissions track the two parts of the Anns test  as
summarized by Wilson J. in Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen,  [1984]  2
S.C.R. 2 at 10:

                (1) is there a sufficiently close relationship
	  between the parties (the [defendant] and the person
	  who has suffered the damage) so that, in the
	  reasonable contemplation of the [defendant],
	  carelessness on its part might cause damage to that
          person? If so,
                (2)  are there any considerations which
          ought  to negative or limit (a) the scope  of
          the duty and (b) the class of persons to whom
          it  is  owed  or (c) the damages to  which  a
          breach of it may give rise?</pre>
    <pre>[46]  In  Hercules Managements Ltd. v. Ernst &amp;  Young,  [1997]  2
S.C.R. 165 at 185-86, the Supreme Court of Canada held that  this
test applies to negligent misrepresentation. I will deal with the
two submissions separately.

(i)  Sufficiently close or &#147;special&#148; relationship (the prima
     facie duty of care)</pre>
    <pre>[47]  In Hercules Management at p. 186-87, La Forest J., speaking
for  the  court, referred to this first part of the Anns test  as
the prima facie duty of care.  Determination of whether there was
this  prima facie duty of care required an inquiry as to  whether
there  could  be  said  to  be  a relationship  of  proximity  or
neighbourhood between the defendant-representer and the plaintiff-
representee.     He  also  equated  it  with  what  Iacobucci  J.
referred to as the &#147;special relationship&#148; in the earlier case  of
Queen  v.  Cognos  Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R.  87  and  held  that  it
subsumed two essential criteria.  As he said at p. 188:

     In cases of negligent misrepresentation, the relationship
     between the plaintiff and the defendant arises through reliance
     by the plaintiff on the defendant's words. Thus, if &quot;proximity&quot;
     is meant to distinguish the cases where the defendant has a
     responsibility to take reasonable care of the plaintiff from
     those where he or she has no such responsibility, then in
     negligent misrepresentation cases, it must pertain to some aspect
     of the relationship of reliance. To my mind, proximity can be
     seen to inhere between a defendant-representor and a plaintiff-
     representee when two criteria relating to reliance may be said to
     exist on the facts: (a) the defendant ought reasonably to foresee
     that the plaintiff will rely on his or her representation; and
     (b) reliance by the plaintiff would, in the particular
     circumstances of the case, be reasonable. To use the term
     employed by my colleague, Iacobucci J., in Cognos, supra, at p.
     110, the plaintiff and the defendant can be said to be in a
     &quot;special relationship&quot; whenever these two factors inhere.

</pre>
    <pre>[48]  In  my  view, there was a special relationship between  Mr.
Melville  and the respondent to meet the first part of  the  Anns
test.    Mr.  Melville  was  Algoma&#146;s  Vice-President  (Finance),
Secretary  and  Treasurer.  He was the  respondent&#146;s  contact  at
Algoma.   He  held himself out as capable of making decisions  on
Algoma&#146;s  behalf  as  it related to satisfying  the  respondent&#146;s
concerns  about  its lack of security.  He must have  known  that
carelessness  on  his  part  would  result  in  a  loss  by   the
respondent.   The  trial judge found that  the  appellant  &#147;would
reasonably know and in fact did know, that Mr. Hynes and his bank
trusted him and would accept and rely upon what he said to them&#148;.
This  finding  was  amply supported by  the  record.   Thus,  Mr.
Melville  ought  reasonably to have foreseen that the  respondent
would  rely  upon his representations.  The first  criterion  was
met.   For virtually the same reasons, reliance by the respondent
was   reasonable.    In  addition,  there  was   the   particular
circumstance  that  on two occasions, Mr. Nicholas  referred  Mr.
Hynes  back  to  Mr.  Melville to try to come  to  some  sort  of
arrangement  that would allow the cheques to clear.   The  second
criterion  was also met and thus the first part of the Anns  test
was  met.   Mr. Melville owed a prima facie duty of care  to  the
respondent.  In the course of argument, counsel framed this  part
of  the  Anns  test  as  requiring an inquiry  into  whether  the
defendant  reasonably relied upon Mr. Melville  in  his  personal
capacity.   In my view, that kind of inquiry is better considered
under  the second part of the Anns test, which requires the court
to  consider  whether there are any policy concerns to  be  taken
into account to limit the prima facie duty of care.  See Hercules
Management at 190-91.
          </pre>
    <pre>ii.  Policy reasons for not attributing personal liability</pre>
    <pre>[49] Counsel for the appellant focused most of his argument as to
the  application of the Anns test on the policy reasons  for  not
attributing  personal liability to the appellant.   He  suggested
three  reasons  why the court should not find that  Mr.  Melville
owed  a  duty  of care to the respondent.  Those reasons  may  be
summarized as follows:

     I.   it is anomalous to hold Mr. Melville personally liable
     when as a result of the CCAA process, the respondent was barred
     from pursuing the claim against Algoma;

     II.  the parties, Algoma and the respondent, had allocated
     the risk between them by contract, and the court should not
     impose personal liability when the damage suffered arose out
     of the very dealings contemplated in the contract;

     III. imposition of personal liability in the circumstances
     of this case would  result in indeterminate liability.</pre>
    <pre>[50] I will deal with each of these issues in turn.

I.   The impact of the CCAA</pre>
    <pre>[51] Algoma commenced the process under the CCAA on February  18,
1991.   The process was a lengthy one and the Plan of Arrangement
was approved by Farley J. in April 1992.  The Plan had previously
been  accepted  by  the overwhelming majority  of  creditors  and
others  with  an  interest in Algoma.  The  Plan  of  Arrangement
included the following term:

          6.03 Releases

          From  and  after  the  Effective  Date,  each
          Creditor  and Shareholder of Algoma prior  to
          the  Effective Date (other than Dofasco) will
          be  deemed to forever release Algoma from any
          and  all  suits, claims and causes of  action
          that  it may have had against Algoma  or  its
          directors, officers, employees and  advisors.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[52]  Thus,  the  respondent was barred from bringing  an  action
against  Algoma  for the misrepresentations by its  officer,  the
appellant  Melville.   Mr. Melville argues  that  permitting  the
respondent  to  pursue  the  same cause  of  action  against  Mr.
Melville personally would subvert the CCAA process.  He argues by
analogy  from  the  holding in London Drugs  v.  Kuehne  &amp;  Nagel
International,   [1992]  3  S.C.R.  299.   In  that   case,   the
defendants,  employees of a warehouse company,  badly  damaged  a
transformer  that  the plaintiff had stored  with  the  warehouse
company.   Under  the  contract between  the  plaintiff  and  the
warehouse  company the &#147;warehouseman&#146;s&#148; liability was limited  to
$40.00.   It was held that the defendant employees were  entitled
to  take advantage of the limitation of liability clause  in  the
contract  of  storage between their employer  and  the  plaintiff
notwithstanding  there  was no privity of  contract  between  the
employees  and  the plaintiff.  The court held  that  privity  of
contract  should  be  relaxed having  regard  to  the  particular
circumstances  of  the  case,  especially  the  wording  of   the
limitation  of  liability  in  the  contract.   Writing  for  the
majority  of the court, Iacobucci J. found that there were  sound
policy  reasons  for  relaxing  the  doctrine  of  privity.    In
particular,  he was concerned that otherwise the plaintiff  would
be  allowed  to circumvent or escape the limitation of  liability
clause  to  which it had expressly consented.  He  referred  with
approval at pp. 441-42 to an excerpt from the reasons of Le  Dain
J. in Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147 at 206:

     A concurrent or alternative liability in tort will not be
     admitted if its effect would be to permit the plaintiff to
     circumvent or escape a contractual exclusion or limitation of
     liability for the act or omission that would constitute the tort.
     Subject to this qualification, where concurrent liability in tort
     and contract exists the plaintiff has the right to assert the
     cause of action that appears to be most advantageous to him in
     respect of any particular legal consequence.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[53] In my view, the appellant has not demonstrated that allowing
the respondent to pursue its claim against him would undermine or
subvert  the  purposes of the Act.  As this court noted  in  Elan
Corp.  v.  Comiskey (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 289 at 297, the  CCAA  is
remedial   legislation   &#147;intended  to   provide   a   structured
environment for the negotiation of compromises between  a  debtor
company  and  its creditors for the benefit of both&#148;.   It  is  a
means  of  avoiding a liquidation that may yield little  for  the
creditors,  especially unsecured creditors like  the  respondent,
and  the debtor company shareholders.  However, the appellant has
not  shown that allowing a creditor to continue an action against
an  officer  for  negligent  misrepresentation  would  erode  the
effectiveness of the Act.
[54] In fact, to refuse on policy grounds to impose liability on
an officer of the corporation for negligent misrepresentation
would contradict the policy of Parliament as demonstrated in
recent amendments to the CCAA and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.  Those Acts now contemplate that an
arrangement or proposal may include a term for compromise of
certain types of claims against directors of the company except
claims that &#147;are based on allegations of misrepresentations made
by directors&#148;.4  L. W. Houlden and C. H. Morawetz, the editors of
The 2000 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Toronto:
Carswell, 1999) at p. 192 are of the view that the policy behind
the provision is to encourage directors of an insolvent
corporation to remain in office so that the affairs of the
corporation can be reorganized.  I can see no similar policy
interest in barring an action against an officer of the company
who, prior to the insolvency, has misrepresented the financial
affairs of the corporation to its creditors.  It may be necessary
to permit the compromise of claims against the debtor
corporation, otherwise it may not be possible to successfully
reorganize the corporation.  The same considerations do not apply
to individual officers.  Rather, it would seem to me that it
would be contrary to good policy to immunize officers from the
consequences of their negligent statements which might otherwise
be made in anticipation of being forgiven under a subsequent
corporate proposal or arrangement.
[55] Finally, I agree with counsel for the respondent that the
analogy to London Drugs is flawed.  In that case, upholding a
strict application of the doctrine of privity of contract would
have allowed the plaintiff to circumvent or escape the limitation
of liability clause to which it had expressly consented.  On
January 10 and 11, when the respondent decided to extend credit
because of Mr. Melville&#146;s misrepresentations, the respondent
could not reasonably have contemplated any future limitation on
its rights through a CCAA process.  To the contrary, because of
those misrepresentations, it did not contemplate any
reorganization through such a process.  As far as it was
concerned, based on the statements made by Mr. Melville, Algoma
was experiencing short-term cash flow problems due to the ramping
up.

II.  Allocation of risk</pre>
    <pre>[56]  A  related  submission  by the appellant  centred  on  what
counsel referred to as an attempt by the respondent to reallocate
the risk.  Counsel argues that the respondent and Algoma had made
their  bargain  and  allocated the risks in accordance  with  the
contract.  In this case, the respondent did not take any security
for the lending facility.  It accepted the risk of dealing with a
corporation enjoying limited liability and the courts should  not
allow  the  parties to circumvent their prior risk allocation  by
imposing personal liability on employees.
[57] This submission is similar to the submission that the
respondent was attempting to circumvent the effect of the CCAA
process.  It is largely based upon the dissenting reasons of La
Forest J. in London Drugs and his concurring reasons in Edgeworth
Construction Ltd. v. N.D. Lea &amp; Associates Ltd., [1993] 3 S.C.R.
206.  In the former case, he held, in part, that where there is a
contractual relationship between the employer and the plaintiff,
the employee should remain liable to the plaintiff only for
&#147;independent torts&#148; committed by the employee.  However, to date
that approach has not attracted a majority of the Supreme Court
of Canada.  The majority of the Court in London Drugs held that
the individual employees were entitled to take advantage of the
clause limiting liability in the contract between their employer
and the plaintiff to $40.00.  There was, however, no question
that the employees were liable to the plaintiffs for their
negligence in moving the plaintiff&#146;s machinery.  Iacobucci J.
speaking for the majority at pp. 407-8 rejected the independent
tort exception:

                    Having said  this, I wish simply to 
	  add  what has  already  become evident  by my
          conclusion.   There  is  no general  rule  in
          Canada to the effect that an employee  acting 
 	  in the course of his  or her  employment  and
	  performing the  &quot;very essence&quot;  of his or her
          employer's  contractual  obligations  with  a 
	  customer does not owe a duty of care, whether
	  one labels  it  &quot;independent&quot;  or  otherwise,
          to  the  employer's  customer.   Our  law  of
	  negligence has long since moved  away from  a
	  category approach when dealing with duties of
          care.  It is now well  established  that  the
	  question  of  whether  a  duty of care arises
	  will  depend  on the  circumstances  of  each
          particular  case,   not   on   pre-determined
	  categories  and  blanket  rules as to who is,
	  and  who  is  not,  under  a duty to exercise
          reasonable  care.   There may  well be  cases
 	  where,   having   regard   to  the particular
	  circumstances  involved, an employee will not
	  owe a   duty of care to his or her employer's
	  customer.   Indeed,  the   respondents   have
	  provided   this  Court  with  a   series   of
	  decisions  where  this  conclusion appears to
	  have been reached: see Sealand of the Pacific
	  v.  Robert C. McHaffie Ltd. (1974), 51 D.L.R. 
	  (3d)  702  (B.C.C.A.);   Moss  v.  Richardson
          Greenshields of Canada Ltd.,  [1989] 3 W.W.R.
	  50  (Man. C.A.);   Summitville   Consolidated
	  Mining Co. v. Klohn Leonoff  Ltd.,  B.C.S.C.,
	  Van. Reg. No. C880756, July 6, 1989; and R.M.
	  &amp; R. Log Ltd. v. Texada Towing Co. (1967), 62
	  D.L.R. (2d) 744 (Ex. Ct.).

                     However,  this does not mean  that
          this  is  the necessary result in all factual
          situations.   Abstaining from  commenting  on
          the conclusions reached in the cases cited, I
          find nothing in any of them, nor have I found
          anything  else, which supports  the  type  of
          blanket  rule  advocated by the  respondents.
          At  best, these decisions simply confirm that
          the question of whether a duty of care arises
          between an employee and his or her employer's
          customer depends on the circumstances of each
          particular  case.   The mere  fact  that  the
          employee is performing the &quot;very essence&quot;  of
          a  contract between the plaintiff and his  or
          her employer does not, in itself, necessarily
          preclude a conclusion that a duty of care was
          present.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[58]  Thus, according to the majority, whether or not a  duty  of
care  arises depends on the facts of the particular  case.   Also
see  Edgeworth Construction per McLachlin J. at pp. 218 and  222.
One of the most important policy considerations is the problem of
imposition   of  indeterminate  liability,  which  is   discussed
separately below.  I have not been persuaded that there  are  any
other  policy considerations specific to the facts of  this  case
that  would  justify a holding that Mr. Melville was not  liable.
While  it  is true that the respondent did not take any security,
its  arrangement with Algoma did include certain safeguards.  For
example,  as  the  facility was amended, Algoma was  required  to
inform  the  respondent if unused lines of  credit  available  to
Algoma  fell below $20 million.  As the Vice-president (Finance),
Mr.  Melville should have been aware of this requirement and that
Algoma  was in breach of this requirement.  He was also aware  of
all of the circumstances that put the respondent at risk.  He had
attended  the relevant board meetings of Algoma and Dofasco.   He
had promised to provide cash flow forecasts to Mr. Hynes, but had
failed  to  do so because, as found by the trial judge,  he  knew
that  if  they were disclosed the respondent would have cancelled
the facility.  By his own conduct he had put the respondent in  a
vulnerable  position  and  undermined the  effectiveness  of  the
safeguards  that did exist to protect the respondent.   In  those
circumstances, I see no policy reason for immunizing Mr. Melville
from  the  consequences of the negligent misrepresentations  that
the   trial  judge  characterized  as  &#147;egregious,  serious  mis-
statements&#148;.

III. Indeterminate liability</pre>
    <pre>[59] In Hercules Managements supra at 192, La Forest J., speaking
for  the  court, held that &#147;the fundamental policy  consideration
that  must  be  addressed in negligent misrepresentation  actions
centres  around  the  possibility that  the  defendant  might  be
exposed  to  &#145;liability  in  an  indeterminate  amount   for   an
indeterminate  time  to an indeterminate  class&#146;&#148;.   However,  in
Hercules Managements at p. 198, La Forest J. held that &#147;in  cases
where the defendant knows the identity of the plaintiff (or of  a
class  of  plaintiffs) and where the defendant&#146;s  statements  are
used  for the specific purpose or transaction for which they were
made,  policy considerations surrounding indeterminate  liability
will  not  be  of  any concern since the scope of  liability  can
readily be circumscribed&#148;.  In my view, this is a complete answer
to the indeterminate liability policy concerns.  Mr. Melville was
aware  of  the identity of the plaintiff and his statements  were
used  for  the very purpose and transaction for which  they  were
made.   No  question of indeterminate liability  arises  in  this
case.  See Haig v. Bamford et al., [1977] 1 S.C.R. 466 at 478-79.
[60] Accordingly, I agree with the trial judge that the appellant
Melville was properly found to owe a duty of care to the
respondent.</pre>
    <pre>3.  As applied to Dofasco</pre>
    <pre>[61]  Dofasco also argues that it did not owe a duty of  care  to
the respondent in accordance with the Anns test.  For many of the
same  reasons  discussed in relation to Melville,  this  argument
must fail.  Dofasco had stepped into the shoes of Algoma for  the
purposes of daily cash management, the very matter for which  the
credit  facility  was available.  There was a sufficiently  close
relationship  between  Dofasco and the respondent  that,  in  the
reasonable  contemplation of Dofasco, carelessness  on  its  part
might  cause  damage to the respondent.  This is particularly  so
given  that  the respondent was the only bank that did  not  have
security.
[62] Dofasco has also not advanced any policy grounds to negative
or limit the scope of the duty owed to the respondent.  The same
considerations concerning the CCAA and indeterminate liability
apply to Dofasco as they did to Melville.
[63] Dofasco also argues that imposing liability is inconsistent
with commercial reality.  According to the contractual
relationship between the respondent and Algoma, it was for the
bank to assess its own risk.  The respondent assessed the risk
and increased the interest rate accordingly.  Dofasco argues that
therefore it was not just or reasonable to find a duty of care.
[64] In Hercules Managements, La Forest J. used terms such as
&#147;reasonable&#148;, &#147;simple justice&#148; and &#147;basic fairness&#148; in discussing
the application of the Anns test to cases of negligent
misrepresentation.  These expressions must be read in context.
La Forest J. adopted a rigorous analysis of the Anns test as it
applied to negligent misrepresentation.  Thus, at p. 190, he
wrote that, &#147;determining whether &#145;proximity&#146; exists on a given
set of facts consists in an attempt to discern whether, as a
matter of simple justice, the defendant may be said to have an
obligation to be mindful of the plaintiff&#146;s interest in going
about his or her business&quot;.  However, this forms part of his
reasons for defining the scope of the prima facie duty in terms
only of foreseeability and reliance and pushing other factors
into a consideration of whether there are policy reasons for
limiting the duty of care in the particular case.
[65] It is worth setting out some of the discussion about the two
criteria relating to the prima facie duty as explained by La
Forest J. at p. 187-89 of Hercules Management:

               In order to render &quot;proximity&quot; a  useful
          tool in defining  when a duty of care  exists
	  in    negligent   misrepresentation    cases,
          therefore,  it is necessary  to  infuse  that
	  term with some meaning. In other words, it is
	  necessary to set out the basis upon which one
	  may  properly  reach  the  conclusion    that
          proximity inheres between a representor and a
	  representee.
               &#133;
               In cases of negligent misrepresentation,
          the  relationship between the  plaintiff  and
          the  defendant arises through reliance by the
          plaintiff on the defendant's words. Thus,  if
          &quot;proximity&quot; is meant to distinguish the cases
          where  the defendant has a responsibility  to
          take  reasonable care of the  plaintiff  from
          those   where   he  or  she   has   no   such
          responsibility,     then     in     negligent
          misrepresentation cases, it must  pertain  to
          some  aspect of the relationship of reliance.
          To  my  mind, proximity can be seen to inhere
          between   a   defendant-representor   and   a
          plaintiff-representee   when   two   criteria
          relating to reliance may be said to exist  on
          the facts: (a) the defendant ought reasonably
          to  foresee that the plaintiff will  rely  on
          his  or  her representation; and (b) reliance
          by  the  plaintiff would, in  the  particular
          circumstances of the case, be reasonable.  To
          use   the  term  employed  by  my  colleague,
          Iacobucci  J., in Cognos, supra, at  p.  110,
          the  plaintiff and the defendant can be  said
          to  be  in  a &quot;special relationship&quot; whenever
          these two factors inhere.
               &#133;
                The  purpose  behind the  Anns/Kamloops
          test  is simply to ensure that enquiries into
          the existence of a duty of care in negligence
          cases  is  conducted in two parts: The  first
          involves  discerning  whether,  in  a   given
          situation, a duty of care would be imposed by
          law; the second demands an investigation into
          whether the legal duty, if found, ought to be
          negatived or ousted by policy considerations.
          In the context of actions based on negligence
          causing  physical damage, determining whether
          harm   to   the   plaintiff  was   reasonably
          foreseeable  to  the  defendant  is  alone  a
          sufficient  criterion for deciding  proximity
          or  neighbourhood under the first  branch  of
          the Anns/Kamloops test &#133;
                In negligent misrepresentation actions,
          however, the plaintiff's claim stems from his
          or    her   detrimental   reliance   on   the
          defendant's (negligent) statement, and it  is
          abundantly   clear  that  reliance   on   the
          statement  or representation of another  will
          not, in all circumstances, be reasonable. The
          assumption  that always inheres  in  physical
          damage cases concerning the reasonableness of
          the    plaintiff's    expectations    cannot,
          therefore,  be  said  to inhere  in  reliance
          cases. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[66]  The  trial judge based his findings on the earlier decision
in Queen v. Cognos Inc. supra and did not address the application
of the Anns test in these terms.  Thus, he did not expressly find
that   Dofasco  ought  to  reasonably  have  foreseen  that   the
respondent  would  rely  on  Nicholas&#146; representation;  and  that
reliance by the respondent would, in the particular circumstances
of  the case, be reasonable.  On the other hand, he did find that
Nicholas &#147;knew that the plaintiff would be relying on anything he
said  to Mr. Hynes in these telephone conversations and that  the
plaintiff  bank was looking to him for information&#148;.   There  was
evidence  to  support this finding, which in my view disposes  of
the first part of this element of the Anns test.
[67] The trial judge&#146;s reasons also support a finding that Hynes'
reliance would, in the particular circumstances, be reasonable.
He found that the inquiries by Mr. Hynes on behalf of the
respondent were pursuant to its contractual relationship to
provide credit to Algoma on the terms and conditions agreed to in
the letter that led to the granting of the Facility.  The letter
included a term that loans would be available &#147;subject to our
continued satisfaction with Algoma&#146;s financial conditions&#148;.
Since Dofasco had taken over the daily cash management function
it would be reasonable for Hynes to look to Dofasco for
information notwithstanding the January 3, 1991 &#147;disclaimer&#148; that
the bank should do whatever it had to do to get comfortable with
Algoma as a stand-alone credit risk.  As Nicholas was in charge
of the day-to-day banking function, it was reasonable for Hynes
to rely upon information provided by Nicholas.  The facility was
directly tied to the day-to-day banking function.  The trial
judge described the relationship between the facility and the day-
to-day banking function in this way:

     The Plaintiff&#146;s facility brought Algoma a sophisticated Cash-
     Net lock box system, under which Algoma, in the course of the
     considerable business of itself and its subsidiaries in the
     United States, could make optimum use of available cash by
     netting out of receivables and payables each day.  The
     arrangement was that the treasury officers at Algoma and
     subsequently by the summer of 1990, at Dofasco on behalf of
     Algoma, would each morning access by computer the information of
     the cash in and cash out for the day.  If a deficiency, they
     would borrow against the debit balance to zero.  On those days
     when the receipts exceeded the payables in the system, the excess
     would pay down the outstanding indebtedness of the plaintiff.
     All to the effect that there was an optimum use of cash and of
     credit.  Both banker and customer were well satisfied with the
     system.</pre>
    <pre>[68] Given this relationship it was reasonable for the respondent
to look to and rely upon representations by Mr. Nicholas.  It was
also  reasonable  given  the particular  circumstances  in  early
January  1991.   Prior  to  the  crucial  telephone  conversation
between  Hynes  and  Nicholas, Nicholas  had  referred  Hynes  to
Melville  on  two occasions and encouraged him to work  something
out  with  him.  As the trial judge said, this would at the  very
least  leave  Mr.  Hynes with the impression  that  there  was  a
capacity  to make an arrangement that would provide the necessary
comfort  to  the  respondent.  It was reasonable then,  as  Hynes
testified,  for  him  to  get  back to  Nicholas  to  verify  the
agreement  he  thought  he had reached  with  Melville  and  more
importantly  his understanding of the facts upon which  any  deal
would  be  based.  This did not necessarily impose  any  duty  on
Nicholas  to respond.  He might have refused to make any comment,
but then this would in all likelihood have caused Hynes to refuse
to  clear  the  cheques, given that three of the five  pieces  of
information  referred  to  in  the  January  10th  letter  relate
directly  to the day-to-day cash management and the  use  of  the
facility.
[69] Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge properly found that
the respondent had established the necessary special relationship
to render Nicholas and hence Dofasco,5 liable for
misrepresentations to the respondent.</pre>
    <pre>4.   The standard of care imposed on Dofasco</pre>
    <pre>[70] Dofasco also argues that the trial judge erred in placing  a
duty on it to fully disclose Algoma&#146;s true financial position, as
if it were in a fiduciary relationship with the respondent.  This
submission  misconstrues the trial judge&#146;s  reasons.   The  trial
judge  made  it  clear  that  there was  no  duty  to  make  full
disclosure  of  all  affairs  of  Algoma  and  he  rejected   the
respondent&#146;s  submission  that  the  appellants  had  breached  a
fiduciary  duty.   As  he  said, this was  a  typical  commercial
relationship   between  corporations  of   ample   resources   of
experience or foresight.  He did hold that there was a  duty  &#147;in
the circumstances&#148; to disclose highly relevant information as  to
the  risks  of  lending  the  $4 million.6   Those  circumstances
included  the following.  Nicholas was aware that Mr.  Hynes  was
attempting  to  assess  the risk of lending  to  Algoma  and  was
looking  for  a  probable source of repayment.  He  had  referred
Hynes  to  Mr.  Melville  to  attempt  to  reach  some  kind   of
accommodation, although he knew that Algoma had run out of credit
from  other  sources.  He also knew or ought to have  known  that
Algoma  was  in breach of its contractual obligation to  disclose
this fact to the respondent.
[71] The trial judge referred to the following excerpt from
Cognos at p. 123:

     In reality, the trial judge did not impose a duty to make a
     full disclosure on the respondent and its representative.  He
     simply imposed a duty of care, the respect of which required,
     among other things and in the circumstances of this case, that
     the appellant be given highly relevant information about the
     nature and existence of the employment for which he had applied.</pre>
    <pre>[72]  When he came to apply the law to the facts, the trial judge
held that Dofasco&#146;s liability did not depend on a failure to make
full  disclosure, or even on a duty to disclose.  Admittedly,  at
first  blush  some  of  the trial judge&#146;s holdings  might  appear
inconsistent.  At one point, he said that when called by Hynes to
discuss  the  letter  Nicholas  had  only  one  option   in   the
circumstances and that was not to discuss it.  Later,  the  trial
judge  said  that  Nicholas was &#147;caught&#148; and &#147;had  to  disclaim&#148;.
However, when the reasons are read as a whole it is my view  that
there is no inconsistency, nor did the trial judge impose a  duty
of  full  disclosure.  He held that if Nicholas had said  nothing
about  the letter in the telephone call with Hynes on the morning
of January 11th, there would not have been any liability.  Having
discussed  the contents of the letter in detail with  Mr.  Hynes,
Mr.  Nicholas&#146; only option at that point was to disclaim.   There
was  liability  because, in the words of the  trial  judge,  &#147;Mr.
Nicholas crossed the line contrary to his original intentions and
did  provide information and assurances to Mr. Hynes  which  were
misrepresentations  on  the  facts  and   law   of   this   case,
constituting  the  tort of negligent misrepresentation.&#148;   Having
entered the arena and provided some information or assurances  to
the  respondent, Mr. Nicholas was required to exercise reasonable
care  in making those representations.  This could, depending  on
the  circumstances,  require  the disclosure  of  information  to
ensure that representations made are accurate and not misleading:
Cognos at p. 121.  In my view, the trial judge did not impose  an
inappropriate  standard of care upon Dofasco.  I would  not  give
effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>5.   The Statute of Frauds</pre>
    <pre>[73]  The appellants argue that the respondent&#146;s claim is  barred
by  s.  8  of the Statute of Frauds, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.19,  which
provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
     8.   No action shall be brought to charge a person upon or
     by reason of a representation or assurance made or given
     concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit,
     ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or
     purpose that such other person may obtain money, goods or credit
     thereupon, unless the representation or assurance is made by a
     writing signed by the party to be charged therewith.  [Emphasis
     added.]</pre>
    <pre>[74]  I  have  considerable doubt that  either  Mr.  Melville  or
Dofasco  could be considered &#147;any other person&#148; for the  purposes
of  s.  8  given  that  Dofasco  had  taken  over  Algoma&#146;s  cash
management  function  and  Melville was  Algoma&#146;s  Vice-President
(Finance).  In any event, this section has been held not to apply
to  negligent misrepresentation.  See W.B. Anderson &amp; Sons,  Ltd.
and  Others v. Rhodes (Liverpool), Ltd. and Others, [1967] 2  All
E.R. 850 (H.C.) applying Banbury v. Bank of Montreal, [1918] A.C.
626  (H.L.) and J. G. Fleming, The Law of Torts, 8th ed. (Sydney,
Australia:  Law  Book  Co., 1992) at 639.   I  would  apply  that
holding to this case.  In my view, the Statute of Frauds  was  no
defence to this action for either appellant.</pre>
    <pre>6.   Misrepresentation by Melville</pre>
    <pre>[75]  The  elements of negligent misrepresentation are summarized
by Iacobucci J. in Queen v. Cognos Inc. at p. 110 as follows:

     (1) there must be a duty of  care  based on a &quot;special
     relationship&quot; between the representor and the representee;
     (2) the representation in question must be untrue,
     inaccurate, or misleading;
     (3) the representor must have acted negligently in
     making said misrepresentation;
     (4) the representee must have relied, in a reasonable
     manner, on said negligent misrepresentation; and
     (5) the reliance must have been detrimental to the
     representee in the sense that damages resulted.</pre>
    <pre>[76] In addition to the question of causation in relation to  the
trading  room  conversations dealt with above,  counsel  for  Mr.
Melville made two submissions with respect to these elements.  He
argued  that  the damages resulted from the assurances  given  by
Nicholas  to Mr. Hynes after Hynes discussed the letter with  him
on  the  morning of January 11th.  He points out that the January
10th  letter  was conditional.  Hynes would agree to advance  the
money  only  if he received certain assurances from  Melville  by
noon.   He actually never received those assurances from Melville
before  taking the decision to clear the cheques.  Thus,  it  was
not shown that the respondent relied upon any representations  by
Melville and there was no detrimental reliance.
[77] I would not give effect to these submissions.  The trial
judge found that Mr. Melville&#146;s liability depended upon the
statements that he made to Mr. Hynes on January 4th and 10th.  On
January 4th, Melville said that Algoma was merely having short-
term cash problems due to the &#147;ramping-up&#148; after the strike and
promised to provide cash flow statements.  The trial judge found
that the former was not true and that the latter implied that the
cash flow statements would support this representation.  On
January 10th, Melville said that the Royal Bank had been secured
for about ten years, that Algoma&#146;s U.S. accounts receivable were
not pledged and were available as security to the respondent and
that if a new credit facility could not be effected, the
respondent&#146;s loan position would be paid out of the sale of the
Cannelton Coal Company sale proceeds.  The trial judge found that
these were misrepresentations.  It was open to him to do so on
this record.  He referred to Cognos and held that all of the
elements as stated there were made out in relation to Mr.
Melville.  It is implicit in this holding that the requisite
detrimental reliance was made out.
[78] The appellant&#146;s argument is focused too narrowly.
Melville&#146;s statements of January 4th and 10th must be put in
context.  As of January 3, 1991, Mr. Hynes was concerned about
Algoma&#146;s ability to repay funds advanced under the facility.
Thereafter, he was seeking information from Melville so that he
could assess the credit risk.  Melville&#146;s statements were
designed to reassure Mr. Hynes and ensure that the cheques,
especially the Cannelton payroll, cleared.  Those statements were
the foundation for the letter and set the stage for the final
conversation with Nicholas.  The trial judge could properly infer
that the respondent relied upon those statements to its detriment
and that they were one of the causes of the loss.  The
respondent&#146;s case against Melville does not fail simply because
Nicholas&#146; statements also contributed to the loss.  It is not the
law that a particular defendant&#146;s negligent misrepresentation
must be the sole cause of the plaintiff&#146;s loss.  It is sufficient
that the plaintiff relied upon those statements to its detriment.
The respondent clearly did.
[79] Accordingly, I would dismiss Mr. Melville&#146;s appeal.</pre>
    <pre>7.   Negligent misrepresentation by Nicholas (Dofasco&#146;s liability)</pre>
    <pre>[80]  Dofasco submits that Nicholas made no untrue statement  and
the  trial  judge  erred in imposing a duty on  Dofasco,  through
Nicholas,  to  disclose  the  true  state  of  Algoma&#146;s  affairs.
Dofasco   submits   that  Nicholas&#146;  comment  that   &#147;it   sounds
reasonable&#148;  was  not a misrepresentation of a  fact,  especially
given  Nicholas&#146; earlier unequivocal statement to Hynes that  the
respondent  should  do whatever it had to do to  get  comfortable
with  Algoma as a stand-alone credit risk.  Dofasco also  submits
that  there was no evidence from Hynes as to what he thought  the
&#147;sounds  reasonable&#148; comment meant and it was  not  open  to  the
trial judge to infer that Hynes relied upon that statement to the
respondent&#146;s  detriment.   In  any  event,  the  only  deal  that
Nicholas was saying was reasonable was, as set out in the letter,
a request for information.  Finally, Dofasco takes issue with the
trial  judge&#146;s finding that Hynes and Nicholas discussed each  of
the  five  numbered points in Hynes&#146; letter to Melville  item  by
item.   This last point can be disposed of quickly.  While  Hynes
did  not recall this part of the conversation, Nicholas did.   It
was  open to the trial judge to accept this part of Mr. Nicholas&#146;
evidence.
[81] Whether or not Mr. Nicholas&#146; statements were
misrepresentations and whether or not the respondent reasonably
relied upon them are findings of fact.  These findings turned
upon the trial judge&#146;s assessment of the credibility of the many
witnesses and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.  See
Kripps v. Touche Ross &amp; Co. (1997),  89 B.C.A.C. 288 (B.C.C.A.)
at paragraphs 88 to 104.  It was not necessary, for example, for
Mr. Hynes to testify that he relied upon the statements by
Nicholas on the morning of January 11th.  That reliance could be
inferred from all the circumstances.  The fact that after the
conversation, Mr. Hynes took no steps to stop the cheques from
clearing, notwithstanding he did not have a reply from Mr.
Melville, is compelling evidence that Mr. Hynes must have relied
upon the assurances he received from Mr. Nicholas.  As indicated
above, it was not necessary for the respondent to prove that the
statements by Mr. Nicholas were the only factors that induced the
respondent to act to its detriment: Kripps v. Touche Ross &amp; Co.
supra at para. 103.  With that in mind, I will turn to the
findings of fact by the trial judge.
[82] A critical finding of fact made by the trial judge and a
finding that is supported by the evidence is that by December
1990, the appellants knew that standing alone, Algoma was no
longer solvent.  That fact alone called for prudence on the part
of Nicholas in dealing with the respondent.  Nicholas himself had
written in a memo that a proposed sale of pellets by Algoma to
Dofasco could be attacked by creditors as a preference.  His
statements to Mr. Hynes must be measured against this background.
The trial judge found that the respondent did not have sufficient
information independent of the statements by Nicholas and
Melville to enable it to evaluate the risk.  On the other hand,
Nicholas knew that standing alone Algoma was insolvent.  He knew
that no decision had been made about whether Dofasco would commit
further funds to Algoma.  He knew, or should have known, that all
of the receivables, including the U.S. accounts receivable, were
encumbered.  He knew, or ought to have known, that Mr. Melville
could not commit to using the proceeds of the Cannelton sale to
pay out the respondent&#146;s loan.  The proceeds from that sale were
seen as crucial to any Algoma reorganization.  At the very least,
Nicholson knew or ought to have known that only the Algoma board
could make that commitment and it was very much an open question
whether Algoma would still be a viable entity when a sale was
completed.
[83] The appellant submits that Dofasco&#146;s liability turned
entirely upon the statement by Nicholas to Hynes to the effect
that what was contained in the letter sounded reasonable.  Based
on this submission, the appellant argues that it was unreasonable
for the trial judge to find liability solely on the basis of this
comment when, it argues, Hynes was merely keeping Dofasco &#147;in the
loop&#148; to appease the respondent&#146;s parent.  In my view, this is
not a fair reading of the trial judge&#146;s reasons.  As I read those
reasons, liability was based on the entire conversation, which
included a point-by-point discussion of the five items.  For
example, the trial judge found as follows:

    I find that Mr. Nicholas understood that Mr. Hynes was
    attempting to assess a risk of whether to fund the 4 million
    dollars outstanding.  I find Mr. Nicholas despite his original
    intentions was drawn into the determination of this matter.  I
    find that Mr. Nicholas, although initially intending to remain
    neutral with regard to the Algoma credit, did cross the line and
    involved himself.</pre>
    <pre>[84]  The trial judge then reviewed the five items in the  letter
and  concluded that Mr. Nicholas knew or ought to have known that
the   letter  contained  misrepresentations,  for  example,   the
availability  of the U.S. accounts receivable.  In that  context,
the trial judge concluded that, &#147;Dofasco could not purport to act
on  the agreement of 10 January without, by implication conveying
acceptance  of  that agreement unless, there was a  specific  and
expressed  disclaimer  to  the contrary&#148;.   Further,  Mr.  Hynes&#146;
evidence was that keeping Dofasco in the loop was only one of his
reasons for speaking to Mr. Nicholas.  He was also attempting  to
have Dofasco &#147;verify&#148; what Melville had told him.
[85] These findings were reasonably open to the trial judge and
established Dofasco&#146;s liability.  This court is in no position to
retry the case and draw our own different inferences, as was
urged by the appellant, from the literal wording of the letter.
The context was all important and the trial judge who heard five
weeks of evidence was in the best position to interpret the
letter and the conversations between Hynes and Nicholas,
especially since liability can be founded on what was implicitly
represented by Nicholas:  Cognos, at pp. 129 &#150; 31.  I have not
been convinced that the trial judge made an overriding and
palpable error of fact in concluding that Nicholas made negligent
misrepresentations upon which the respondent reasonably relied to
its detriment.
[86] I have considered whether the conversation between Hynes and
Nicholas of January 3rd in which Nicholas told Hynes that he
should get comfortable with Algoma as a stand-alone risk
constituted some kind of disclaimer such that it was unreasonable
for Hynes to then rely upon the statements made by Nicholas one
week later in the conversation of January 11th.  The trial judge
implicitly found to the contrary when he held that only an
express disclaimer at the very time of the January 11th
conversation would suffice.  Again, this was a conclusion that
was reasonably open to the trial judge.  He found that
notwithstanding the earlier disclaimer and Nicholas&#146; own
professed intention not to be drawn into making any
representations about the continued viability of Algoma, he
crossed the line and did make representations that he knew the
respondent would rely upon.  It was reasonable for Hynes to rely
upon the representations in the January 11th conversation in the
circumstances, some of which I have reviewed above.  In addition
to those circumstances, there was also the fact that Mr. Nicholas
was the first person to inform Hynes that Algoma did not have
credit available from other lenders.  It was during this
conversation, on January 10th, that Nicholas expressed great
concern about the cheques not clearing, stating according to
Hynes that &#147;you can&#146;t bounce cheques&#148;.  The entire context would
reasonably leave Hynes with the impression that Nicholas and
Dofasco were acutely aware of the Algoma situation and were
taking a keen interest in its financial affairs, notwithstanding
the earlier &#147;disclaimer&#148;.  There was nothing in the conversations
of January 10 and 11 to suggest that Mr. Nicholas was not at the
time assuming responsibility for what he was representing to the
respondent:  Cognos supra at 116.
[87] As to the standard of care, I have already dealt with this
question above.  More generally, it is not a fair
characterization that the trial judge imposed a duty upon
Nicholas to disclose the true state of Algoma&#146;s financial
affairs.  The duty of care imposed by the trial judge was the
duty to &#147;exercise such reasonable care as the circumstances
require to ensure that representations made are accurate and not
misleading&#148; as referred to in Cognos at p. 121.  In Cognos at p.
123, the court recognized that in some circumstances a &#147;failure
to divulge highly relevant information is a pertinent
consideration in determining whether a misrepresentation was
negligently made&#148;.  In any event, the trial judge found that
Nicholas &#147;affirmed in the circumstances of this case&#148;.  This can
only mean that the trial judge found that Nicholas affirmed the
truth of the misrepresentations in the January 10th letter.  I
can see no basis for interfering with this finding of fact.
[88] Accordingly, I would dismiss Dofasco&#146;s appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE CROSS-APPEAL

[89]  The respondent raised two issues in its cross-appeal.  Both
were contingent on the appellants&#146; success in their appeals.   In
light of my conclusions, it is unnecessary to deal with the cross-
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION

[90]  Accordingly,  I would dismiss the appeals  with  costs.   I
would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.

_______________________________
1    The claim against Nicholas, who was also named as a
defendant, was therefore dismissed.
2    Said v. Butt, [1920] 3 K.B. 497 holds that where the
corporate officer acting bona fide within the scope of his
authority procures or causes the breach of a contract between the
employer and a third person, he does not thereby become liable to
an action of tort at the suit of the person whose contract has
been broken.  It has no application to the facts of this case.
3    Similarly, see Meditrust Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug
Mart, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, delivered
September 9, 1999, [1999] O.J. No. 3243.
4    Section 5.1(2) of the CCAA and s. 50(14) of the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act.
5    As indicated, Dofasco accepted that it was vicariously
liable if Nicholas were found to be negligent.
6    When the trial judge&#146;s reasons are read as a whole, I have
considerable doubt that the trial judge imposed any liability on
the basis of non-disclosure.  It seems to me that a fair reading
of his reasons shows that the trial judge imposed liability on
the appellants for their positive misrepresentations.</pre></td>
