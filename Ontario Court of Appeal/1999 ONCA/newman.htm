    <pre>[1]  The issue as ultimately pleaded in this case was whether the
appellant=s employment was a fixed term contract or one of
indefinite term. The trial judge gave very full reasons for her
finding that it was a fixed term contract that expired after two
years. In addition, she found that prior to its expiration, the
parties had engaged in some discussions about future arrangements
and that the contract was extended for one month for that
purpose. The trial judge further found that the discussions
continued until the date the appellant resigned. These
conclusions are fully supported by the evidence and indeed it
would be difficult to contemplate a different disposition.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Accordingly, having accepted this finding, it is not
necessary for us to deal with the other arguments raised on the
appeal. The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
