    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Beaulne J. dated January
12, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted before Beaulne J. of the Ontario
Court (Provincial Division) of assault with a weapon and
possession of a weapon contrary dangerous to the public peace.
Following an assessment hearing the appellant was found not
responsible on account of mental disorder.  After a disposition
hearing, he was ordered detained in the custody of the Royal
Ottawa Hospital.  He appeals his conviction.
[2]  The events leading to the convictions followed the forced
entry by the police into the appellant&#146;s apartment.  After
entering the apartment, the police proceeded to the appellant&#146;s
bedroom.  The appellant, wielding a knife, attacked them.  He was
shot and wounded by one of the police officers.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Did the trial judge err in finding that the police were
        acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent
        injury when they forcibly entered the appellant&#146;s apartment?
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Assuming that the police officers had jurisdiction to enter
        the apartment, did the trial judge err in finding the conduct of
        the police within the apartment did not involve an unjustifiable
        use of power?</pre>
    <pre>   Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant represented himself at trial and,
unfortunately, the trial record is not as satisfactory as it
might be.  However, what clearly emerges is that a person
believed to be a cousin of the appellant, made a 911 call, not
emanating from the appellant&#146;s apartment, and expressed the
concern that the appellant, who was a psychiatric patient, was
alone and was a threat to himself and to others.  Attempts were
made to contact the appellant by telephone but the line rang
busy.
[4]  Bruce Binda of the Ottawa-Carleton Ambulance Service
testified that he and his partner were dispatched to a &#147;priority
3&#148;call, which indicated that they should arrive promptly with no
delay for a patient who may be a psychiatric threat to himself.
He and his partner requested police backup because they didn&#146;t
know what they were &#147;going to confront&#148; when they arrived at the
scene.
[5]  Constable Brian Dodds received information from his
dispatcher that he was to assist an ambulance crew &#147;with a
possible person suffering from mental illness&#148;. He also received
information from his dispatcher (which he believed had been
passed on by a family member of the appellant) that the appellant
had threatened to kill a specific person, was being irrational
and could possibly be a threat to himself.  He was further
advised by the ambulance crew that this address had come up on
their system and that the person inside was &#147;possibly suicidal
and was a possible danger to himself or somebody else&#148;.
[6]  Constable Brenda McGillvray, who accompanied arrived on the
scene shortly before the ambulance crew or Constable Dodds,
stated that she received information from her dispatcher that the
person in the apartment &#147;had made some &#150; some kind of motions
that he wanted to &#150; to hurt someone&#148;.
[7]  Attempts were made by the police dispatcher to contact the
appellant by telephone but there was no answer. The ambulance
team and the police arrived at the apartment and pounded on the
door.  There was no response.  Constable Dodds testified that he
then requested guidance from the Command Centre and that he was
then told by his duty staff sergeant to that he had to &#147;check&#148;
the occupant&#146;s condition and that he should therefore go ahead
and breach the door.  The door was forced, the two police
officers and one of the ambulance attendants entered the
apartment, and climbed up the stairs where they encountered
another door.  Cst. Dodds knocked repeatedly and, when there was
no response, he nudged the door open and looked into the bedroom
to find went to the bedroom where they saw the appellant lying in
the bed with his hands under the covers.  The telephone was off
the hook and the cord was around the appellant&#146;s neck.
[8]  The police were in uniform and Cst. Dodds identified himself
and McGillvray as police officers.  Cst. Dodds tried to carry on
a conversation with the appellant, but the appellant did not
respond.  He repeatedly asked the appellant to show his hands but
the appellant did no not do so and made no response to the
request.  Finally, he showed one hand &#150; it was empty &#150; but kept
the right hand under the covers.  Suddenly, he leapt from the bed
and advanced towards the police officers holding in his right
hand a butcher knife that had a blade that was seven and one half
inches in length.  He was asked to put the knife down.  When he
refused, Cst. Dodds drew his revolver and shot the appellant.
The appellant, however, kept advancing on Cst. Dodds and Cst.
Dodds shot him again.  The paramedic, Binda, attended his wounds
and he was arrested and charged with the two offences in
question.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[9]  I agree with the submission of the Crown that this appeal
amounts to an invitation to revisit factual and credibility
issues that were properly the function of the trial judge.  These
findings were supported by the evidence and, given those findings
of fact, this case is substantially on all fours with R. v. Godoy
(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.); affirming (1997), 115
C.C.C. (3d) 272 (Ont. C.A.).
[10] In Godoy, the police responded to a 911 call that originated
from the accused&#146;s apartment.  The 911 call was classified as an
&#147;unknown trouble&#148; call as the line had been disconnected before
the caller spoke.  This type of call was deemed by police policy
as the second highest priority distress calls, superceded only by
calls concerning officers in distress.  When the accused answered
the door, he told the police that there was no problem and
refused to permit the police to enter.  A police officer
prevented the accused from shutting the door and entered the
apartment. There they found the spouse of the accused crying and
exhibiting signs of having been struck.  The charge of assaulting
police officers arose out of the struggle with the accused when
he was charged with assaulting his spouse.  The defence to
assaulting the police was that the entry was unauthorized and the
subsequent actions of the police, including arresting the
accused, were illegal.  This defence was successful at trial but
was overruled on appeal to this court.  An appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada was dismissed.
[11] Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Lamer C.J.C. held at
pp. 139-140:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the case at bar, the forced entry into the appellant's
          home was justifiable considering the totality of the
          circumstances.  The police were responding to an unknown trouble
          call.  They had no indication as to the nature of the 911
          distress.  They did not know whether the call was in response to
          a criminal action or not.  They had the common law duty
          (statutorily codified in s.42(3) of the Act) to act to protect
          life and safety.  Therefore, the police had the duty to respond
          to the 911 call.  Having arrived at the appellant's apartment,
          their duty extended to ascertaining the reasons for the call.
          Acceptance of the appellant's bald assertion that there was &quot;no
          problem&quot; would have been insufficient to satisfy that duty.  The
          police had the power, derived as a matter of common law from this
          duty, to enter the apartment to verify that there was in fact no
          emergency.  The fact that the appellant tried to shut the door on
          the police further contributes to the appropriateness of their
          response in forcing entry.  As I have already discussed, the
          privacy interest of the person at the door must yield to the
          interests of any person inside the apartment.  A threat to life
          and limb more directly engages the values of dignity, integrity
          and autonomy underlying the right to privacy than does the
          interest in being free from the minimal state intrusion of police
          entering an apartment to investigate a potential emergency.  Once
          inside the apartment, the police heard the appellant's wife
          crying.  They had a duty to search the apartment and find her.
          ...
</pre>
    <pre>[12] In the case in on appeal, the appellant seeks to distinguish
Godoy on the basis that the 911 call originated from outside the
apartment.  This is a distinction without a difference.  The
emergency was in the apartment and the police could not establish
contact with the occupant of the apartment, either by telephone
or by knocking on the door.  In the light of the stated nature of
the emergency, the police would have been remiss in their duty
not to investigate to the point of forcing entry.  An informed
caller from outside the apartment describing the nature of the
emergency is a more reliable justification for a concern about
the health and safety of the occupant of the apartment than is a
disconnected telephone call.
[13] Accordingly, the answer to the first issue is &#147;No&#148;: the
trial judge did not err in finding that the police were acting in
the execution of their duty when they forcibly entered the
appellant&#146;s apartment.
[14] As to the second issue, the alleged conduct of the police
officers said to involve an unjustifiable use of power, the
answer is also &#147;No&#148;.  The evidence fully supports the facts as
found by the trial judge as set out below:
          </pre>
    <pre>               On January 1st, 1997, Mr. Bruce Binda was directed to attend
          at 18 Preston Street in the City of Ottawa as part of an
          ambulance team on a priority 3 call resulting from a 911 call,
          that is to say that a patient may be a psychiatric threat to
          himself.  He went to 118 Preston Street and requested the
          assistance of the police.  Constables Brenda McGillivary and
          Brian Dodds of the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police Force arrived
          at the scene.
          </pre>
    <pre>               As a result of a forced entry, after
          Constable Dodds had knocked on the door and
          identified himself, the three persons entered
          Mr. Nicholls' apartment.  They saw an
          individual lying on a bed, covered by sheets,
          with both hands underneath the sheets.  This
          was Mr. Nicholls.  He refused to show both
          hands at the same time after being asked to
          do so.  At some point in time, he lunged out
          of the bed at Constable Dodge [sic] with a
          large knife thrust forward in his hand.  The
          space between the two was some four to six
          feet.
          </pre>
    <pre>               He was requested to put it down, but
          kept advancing.  Constable Dodds took out his
          pistol and fired two shots.  Mr. Nicholls
          crumpled to the ground.  Mr. Binda gave
          immediate medical assistance . . .
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... They [the police officers] had
          information from their dispatcher, and from
          Mr. Binda, that there was concern for the
          safety of a person at 118 Preston Street.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, from the above quoted law
          [Regina v. Godoy, infra (Ont. C.A.)], and on
          the facts of this case, Constable Dodds had
          jurisdiction to enter the premises and was
          not a trespasser at law.  I find that
          Constable Dodds did advise Mr. Nicholls to
          put down the knife as he was lunging towards
          him, that Mr. Nicholls kept coming, and that
          the shots were then fired. ...</pre>
    <pre>[15] The police and ambulance crew were responding to a serious
911 call and had a duty to investigate the situation to ensure
that the appellant was not a danger to himself or others.  In
order to locate the appellant and to do so, forced entry was
necessary.  When confronted with a dangerous attack from an
unpredictable individual, Cst. Dodds acted appropriately.  There
was no unjustifiable use of police powers in this case.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, I would dismiss
the appeal.</pre>
