    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]    In our view, the appellant has failed to show that there
was any error with respect to the report of Dr. Ameis or that
there is any basis to admit the report of Dr. Ameis as Afresh
evidence@. The respondents were not obliged to call Dr. Ameis as
a witness and, in any event, the respondents consented to the
appellant filing Dr. Ameis=s report. The appellant was afforded
full opportunity to file the report as evidence. He simply failed
to do so. Moreover, the trial judge inadvertently referred to the
aspect of Dr. Ameis=s report that was helpful to the appellant in
her charge to the jury, thereby mitigating, if not eliminating,
any disadvantage the appellant may have suffered from not having
the report formally entered as an exhibit.
[2]
[3]    We also reject the submission that there are grounds to
interfere with the jury=s nil award for future loss of income.
The appellant had returned to full-time work several years before
the trial. The claim for past loss of income was not clearly
framed as including loss of overtime right up to the date of
trial. Accordingly, we do not accept the submission that the
jury=s award of the full amount claimed for past income loss
reflected a finding that the appellant=s income loss continued to
the date of trial. The evidence of future income loss went both
ways, and we do not accept that the jury must have ignored the
evidence in rejecting the appellant=s claim under this head.</pre>
    <pre>[4]    Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[5]    We give leave on the cross-appeal, but find that it should
be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[6]    In our view, the trial judge had before her an adequate
basis to conclude that the offer to settle was not sufficient to
trigger a costs order under Rule 49. While her estimate of the
costs accrued to the date of the offer was on the generous side,
it did not fall outside the range of acceptability.</pre>
    <pre>[7]    We are also of the view that we should not interfere with
the costs fixed by the trial judge.  Murano v. Bank of Montreal
(1998), 163 D.L.R. (4th) 21, decided after the trial in the case
at bar, cautions against fixing costs where a party could be
deprived of the opportunity of a proper hearing on the issue. In
light of the principles expressed in Murano, it would have been
preferable in the circumstances of this case to have the costs
assessed as requested by the defendants. However, the record
indicates that the plaintiff did provide the court with
documentary support for the costs and disbursements claimed, and
the defendants were heard on the issue. In view of the nature of
the case and the amounts at issue, the amount of costs fixed by
the trial judge was entirely reasonable, and in our view, should
not be disturbed.</pre>
    <pre>[8]    Accordingly, the appeal and the cross-appeal are
dismissed. As there has been divided success, there shall be no
order as to costs.</pre></td>
