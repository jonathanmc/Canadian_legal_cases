</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Madam Justice Rose Boyko on
February 18, 1998 and from the sentence imposed on April 17, 1998
</pre>
      <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of sexual assault by Boyko  J.
He  appeals  his conviction and the sentence of eighteen  months’
incarceration and three years' probation.
[2]  The appellant and the respondent had known each other for
some period of time and had been intimate.  On the evening in
question, the appellant visited the complainant at her apartment.
The complainant was on medications which had sedative effects.
There was no dispute that the appellant and the complainant had
sexual intercourse.  The issue was consent.  The trial judge
found that at the relevant time the complainant had been asleep
and could not have consented to sexual intercourse.
[3]  The appellant raises five grounds of appeal.  We will deal
with them in the order presented during argument.</pre>
      <pre>          1.   Failure to Grant Appropriate Remedy for Late
               Disclosure.</pre>
      <pre>[4]  The police officers’ reports (and their names) were properly
disclosed.   The  investigation officer’s notes, which  had  been
specifically  requested  by  defence  counsel,  had   also   been
disclosed.   It is clear that the late disclosure  of  the  other
officers’ notes resulted from inadvertence.
[5]  The trial judge considered the relevant factors and
concluded, in the exercise of her discretion, that a remedy short
of declaring a mistrial was appropriate.
[6]  The late disclosure was not of such a nature as to affect
the strategy of the defence.  The opportunity to cross-examine
the complainant on the new information was sufficient in the
circumstances.  In our view, no impairment of the right to make
full answer and defence was established as a result of the
Crown’s failure to disclose the police officers’ notes.  We see
no error in the trial judge’s exercise of her discretion.</pre>
      <pre>          2.   Admissibility of the Videotape statement.</pre>
      <pre>[7]   The appellant had spoken to a lawyer and stated that he had
been  told not to say anything.  The appellant knew that  he  was
speaking  to  a police officer, he was in custody, he  was  being
videotaped, and anything he said could be used against him.   The
finding  of the trial judge that the appellant chose to tell  his
side of the story is amply supported by the evidence.  We see  no
breach of the appellant’s Charter rights on this issue.</pre>
      <pre>          3.   Misapplication of the burden of proof.</pre>
      <pre>[8]   Due to the complainant’s condition from the medication  and
the  weaknesses  in her memory of the incident  the  trial  judge
sought  confirmation  of her evidence,  which  he  found  in  the
appellant’s  statement to the police.  The  trial  judge  clearly
accepted  parts and rejected other parts of that statement.   The
reasons of the trial judge do not disclose a failure to apply the
proper burden of proof.</pre>
      <pre>          4.   Unreasonable verdict.</pre>
      <pre>[9]   The  possibility of a conditional consent, which the  trial
judge  considered  as an alternative, was not  available  on  the
evidence.   However, we are of the view that it was open  to  the
trial  judge convict on the evidence reviewed in her reasons  for
judgment.   The  trial judge accepted the complainant’s  evidence
that  she  was asleep when sexual intercourse occurred and  found
confirmation of this evidence in the appellant’s statement to the
police.
[10] On the appellant’s own evidence, there was no air of reality
to the defence of honest but mistaken belief.</pre>
      <pre>          5.   Prior Sexual Conduct evidence.</pre>
      <pre>[11]  The trial judge held that evidence of prior sexual  conduct
was  not  admissible.  Much of that evidence was, in  any  event,
allowed  to  go  in.  The evidence of prior occasions  of  sexual
conduct  could  not have assisted the trial judge in  determining
whether  or not the complainant was consenting on this  occasion.
We  see no error in the trial judge’s decision that this evidence
was not admissible.</pre>
      <pre>          6.   Sentence.</pre>
      <pre>[12]   With   respect  to  the  sentence  of   eighteen   months’
incarceration  plus  probation, we are  not  persuaded  that  the
length  of  sentence was outside the usual range of sentence  for
this  type of offence.  The trial judge considered the imposition
of a conditional sentence.  She found that he was not a danger to
the   community.   However,  she  concluded  that  a  conditional
sentence  would not adequately reflect the principles of  general
deterrence and denunciation.
[13] Including the period of time preceding the trial, the
appellant has now been on bail for approximately three years,
apparently without any problem.  The appellant has filed fresh
evidence.  It reveals that he is married and has three teenage
children.  They are all supportive of the appellant.  The oldest
child plans to attend college next year and another child is
involved in hockey, both at a substantial cost.
[14] The appellant is self-employed and owns a contracting
company.  His wife is employed on a part-time basis.  They have
two mortgages on their house.  If he is incarcerated, the
appellant swears that they would lose their house, that the
oldest child would not be able to attend college, and that his
son would no longer be able to be involved in hockey.
[15] Much of this evidence was not presented to the trial judge.
In light of the total period of time spent on bail and the
disastrous financial results that would flow from incarceration,
this is a proper case, at this time, to impose a conditional
sentence.
[16] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is varied to
a conditional sentence on the statutory terms.  In addition, the
appellant is to be subject to a daily curfew from 7:00 p.m. to
7:00 a.m. except for work-related purposes.  In light of the
period of time the appellant has been on bail, we see no reason
to impose a probation order.
