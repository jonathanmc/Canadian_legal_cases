    <pre>HEARD:         April 20, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On Appeal from the order of Ground J. dated October 2, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                               </pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a large and complex action which is under case
management by Ground J.
[2]  In a decision dated October 2, 1998, Ground J. held that the
third party claims advanced by the appellant defendant Thomson,
Rogers against Sheldon Fenton, Rene Gareau and Geoffrey Squibb
should be struck out because they disclosed no reasonable cause
of action.  Ground J. also held that the appellant&#146;s cross-claim
against the defendants Bruno Arnold, Euromart Realty Ltd.,
Euromart Realty Corp., Euromart International Ltd. and Greater
Canada Finance Corp. should be struck out on the same basis.
[3]  Given how the third party claim and cross-claim were
pleaded, in our view Ground J. did not err in striking out these
claims.  The third party claim is set out in paragraphs 23, 24
and 25 of the appellant&#146;s pleadings.  There is virtually nothing
in those paragraphs setting out the alleged relationship or nexus
between the appellant and the third parties.  Nor is there
anything about the factual background or activities of the third
parties which, according to the appellant, anchor its claim.
[4]  In Normart Management Ltd. v. West Hill Redevelopment Co.
(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.)., Finlayson J.A. said at p.102:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is well established that the directing minds of
          corporations cannot be held civilly liable for the actions of
          corporations they control and direct unless there is some conduct
          on the part of those directing minds that is either tortious in
          itself or exhibits a separate identity or interest from that of
          the corporations such as to make the acts or conduct complained
          of those of the directing minds:  See Scotia McLeod Inc. v.
          Peoples Jewellers Ltd. (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 481 at p.491&#133;In the
          statement of claim in appeal, there is no factual underpinning to
          support an allegation that the personal defendants were at any
          time acting outside their capacity as directors and officers of
          the corporations of which they were the directing minds.
          [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant&#146;s pleadings against the third parties suffer
from the same defect.  There is simply an absence of facts,
conduct or activities in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25.  It is
impossible for the third parties to know what it is that the
appellant alleges they did that is wrong and that gives rise to
their liability to the appellant.
[6]  The cross-claim against Arnold and the Arnold group of
companies is slightly better, even though it is set out in only a
single paragraph.  The appellant does plead in paragraph 21:
&#147;Thomson Rogers adopts the plaintiffs&#146; allegations against Arnold
and the Arnold corporate defendants&#148;.  This pleading provides,
albeit only inferentially, some framework for the cross-claim.
However, paragraph 21 is such a brief and indirect allegation
that we are not persuaded Ground J. was wrong to strike it out.
[7]  However, we think that the appellant should have been given
leave to amend its claims.  The appellant&#146;s claims, as submitted
by Mr. Chernos in oral argument, rest on a theory of
disgorgement.  In brief, that theory is as follows:  The
plaintiffs allege they are victims of a fraud perpetrated by the
individual defendants and their corporations.  The appellant is
innocent of any wrong-doing and is sued on the basis of vicarious
liability for the actions of Prince.  If the appellant must
answer to the plaintiffs, it would be unfair to preclude the
appellant from recovering from those who benefited by their wrong-
doing.  The appellant&#146;s theory, if properly pleaded, may be
viable and give rise both to cross-claims, and under Rule
29.01(a) to third party claims against the defendants and their
corporations.
[8]  Accordingly, in our view the appropriate order is to dismiss
the appeal but give the appellant leave to amend.  Indeed, the
respondents agree that the appellant should be given the
opportunity to attempt to redraft its pleadings to set out, in
more detail and with greater precision, its claims against them.
Further motions on the amended pleadings should be heard by the
case management judge.
[9]  We observe that there is already an Amended Amended
Statement of Claim in this action and we are informed that
further amendments to the statement of claim are imminent.  Since
all pleadings, including cross-claims and third party claims,
flow,  at least in part, from the initial statement of claim, our
strong suggestion would be that all other parties wait for the
final version of the statement of claim and then finalize their
own pleadings.
[10] The appeal is dismissed.  The appellant shall have leave to
amend its pleadings within such time as agreed to by the parties
or as determined by the case management judge.  There shall be no
order as to costs.</pre>
