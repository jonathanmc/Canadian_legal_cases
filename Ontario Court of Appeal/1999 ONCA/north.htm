    <pre>On appeal from the order of Ground J., dated December 17, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>CATZMAN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>The appeal</pre>
    <pre>[1]  North York Performing Arts Centre Corporation (&#147;NYPACC&#148;)
appeals from the order of Ground J. declaring, among other
things, that &#147;the refund and trust obligations arising under s.20
of the Consumer Protection Act and s.9(2) of the regulations
thereto respectively are not applicable to the transactions
between Livent (whether entered into directly or through
TicketMaster as its agent) and persons who paid in advance
(either to Livent directly or indirectly to Livent through
TicketMaster) for the issuance of advance tickets (the
&#147;TicketHolders&#148;) in respect of:</pre>
    <pre>     (i)  performances scheduled to occur at the Ford Centre which
          were arranged by and then subsequently cancelled by Livent; and
          </pre>
    <pre>     (ii) events scheduled to be presented by third party renters of
          Ford Centre facilities (&#147;Renters&#148;) where the facility rental was
          cancelled by Livent.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>[2]  In addition to this declaration, Ground J. made further
declarations, adverse to NYPACC, with respect to alleged express
or implied or constructive trusts in favour of NYPACC, the
ticketholders and the renters.  No appeal has been brought in
respect of those further declarations.</pre>
    <pre>The issues on the appeal</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In this court, NYPACC limited its appeal to the following
issues, expressed in its factum in two questions:</pre>
    <pre>   1.   Are live entertainment sellers and their agents subject to
        the refund and  trust  duties  imposed  by  s.20  of  the 
        Consumer Protection Act and s.9 of the regulation thereto?
     </pre>
    <pre>   2.   Can compliance with these provincially legislated duties be
        suspended or  compromised  by  orders under the  federal  
        Companies Creditors&#146; Arrangements Act?
     </pre>
    <pre>[4]  I have concluded that the answer to the first question is in
the negative, with the result that it is unnecessary to answer
the second question.</pre>
    <pre>Relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and Regulation
[5]  Sections 18 and 20 of the Consumer Protection Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C-31, provide:

          18. This Part [Part II] applies to executory
             contracts for the sale of goods or
             services where the purchase price,
             excluding the cost of borrowing, exceeds
             $50.
     </pre>
    <pre>          20. Where a trade-in is delivered or money is
             paid, whether by way of deposit or
             otherwise, on account of the proposed
             purchase of goods or services but no
             binding contract is entered into in
             respect of the goods and no delivery of
             the goods or any part thereof has been
             made to the buyer or no performance of
             the services has been made, the seller
             shall upon the request of the buyer
             return such trade-in or refund in full
             the money so paid, as the case may be.
     </pre>
    <pre>[6]  Part II applies to &#147;executory contracts&#148;. &#147;Executory
contract&#148; is defined in s.1 of the Act as follows:

          1. In this Act,
     </pre>
    <pre>           &#147;executory contract&#148; means a contract
           between a buyer
           and a seller for the purchase and sale of
           goods or services in respect of which
           delivery of the goods or performance of the
           services or payment in full of the
           consideration is not made at the time the
           contract is entered into;
          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  Sections 9(1) and (2) of Regulation 176, passed pursuant to
the Consumer Protection Act, provide:

          9. (1)  All money received by a seller under
          an executory contract to which Part II of the
          Act applies and that is subject to rescission
          shall be retained by the seller in trust for
          the buyer until the contract is rescinded
          under section 21 of the Act or until the
          period for rescission has expired, whichever
          is the later.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  Where money is paid, whether by way of
          deposit or otherwise, on account of the
          proposed purchase of goods or services but no
          binding contract is entered into in respect
          of the goods and no delivery of the goods or
          any part thereof has
          been made to the buyer or no performance of
          the services has been made, the seller shall
          retain the money in trust for the buyer
          until,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)the goods are delivered or the services performed;
           </pre>
    <pre>          (b)the buyer requests the refund in full of the money paid; or
             </pre>
    <pre>          (c)subject to subsection (1), a binding contract is entered into.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
Ground J.&#146;s conclusions
     </pre>
    <pre>[8]  In declaring s.20 of the Act and s.9(2) of the Regulation to
be inapplicable to the transactions involving the ticketholders
and the renters, Ground J. held that:</pre>
    <pre>     (i)  the contract with them did not fall within the statutory
          definition of &#147;executory contract&#148;, because there was not a
          contract for the purchase of services, but rather a contract in
          the nature of a licence to attend a theatre and to occupy a
          particular seat for a particular performance; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     (ii) the contract with them was not a contract for &#147;the proposed
          purchase &#133; of services&#148; because the purchase was complete at the
          time the ticket was obtained, at which time the ticketholder
          acquired an enforceable right to attend a future performance or,
          failing performance, to claim rescission of the contract and
          repayment of the ticket price.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;executory contract&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The first of Ground J.&#146;s two conclusions rested on the
authority of such &#147;ticket cases&#148; as Hurst v. Picture Theatres
Ltd., [1915] 2 K.B. 1 (C.A.) and Heller v. Niagara Racing Assn.
(1924), 56 O.L.R. 355 (C.A.).  These cases address the sale of a
ticket from the perspective of a licence, irrevocable unless the
ticketholder behaves improperly or fails to comply with known
conditions, to enter on and remain in premises for the period of
the event or performance.  NYPACC urged us to accept, as an
analysis more in keeping with modern realities, that described in
Dwyer v. Hunter, [1951] N.Z.L.R. 177 (C.A.).  That case, in
assessing the relationship of hotel-keeper and guest, held (at
page 190) that, while the hotel confers upon the guest a licence
to occupy a bedroom or a dining room or a sitting room, the
licence nonetheless also involves the rendering of services.
That conclusion is not far different from Ground J.&#146;s assessment
of a ticketholder&#146;s entitlement in the present case, which he
described in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It seems to me that the nature of the
          contract [between the ticketholder and
          Livent] is a contract whereby the
          ticketholder acquires the right to attend a
          theatre and to occupy a particular seat for a
          particular performance to watch and hear the
          performance where the services of the
          performers are provided but that such
          services are provided to the producer not to
          the ticketholder. (emphasis added)
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[10] NYPACC argued that the contract between Livent and its
ticketholders falls within the statutory definition of &#147;executory
contract&#148;.  It was, NYPACC submitted, &#147;a contract between a buyer
and a seller for the purchase and sale of &#133; services in respect
of which &#133; performance of the services &#133; is not made at the time
the contract is entered into&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[11] While those words, read literally, might admit of such an
interpretation, I have no doubt that the type of transaction in
the present case is one which the Legislature could not
reasonably have intended to fall within the contemplation of
&#147;executory contract&#148;.  This is evident from a brief reference to
s.19 of the Act, which sets out the statutorily prescribed form
of an executory contract.  Section 19(1)(a) requires every
executory contract to contain &#147;the name and address of the seller
and the buyer&#148;; s.19(1)(c), &#147;the itemized price of the goods or
services and a detailed statement of the terms of payment&#148;;
s.19(1)(f), &#147;any warranty or guarantee applying to the goods or
services and, where there is no warranty or guarantee, a
statement to this effect&#148;.  In the same vein, s.19(2) provides
that an executory contract is not binding on the buyer unless the
contract is made in accordance with Part II of the Act and
regulations and is signed by the parties and a duplicate original
copy is in the possession of each of the parties.  These are
provisions that cannot realistically apply to the purchase,
typically by telephone, of a ticket for a theatrical performance
or to the form of ticket generated by such a purchase.  Although
I need not form any concluded opinion on the subject, I suggest
that legislative attention to the definition of &#147;executory
contract&#148; might usefully put beyond argument the suggestion that
such ticket sales are caught by that expression.</pre>
    <pre>&#147;proposed purchase of goods or services&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[12] The reason I need not form any concluded opinion on the
subject of &#147;executory contract&#148; is that, in my view, NYPACC&#146;s
argument clearly founders on Ground J.&#146;s second conclusion: that
the contract is not one for &#147;the proposed purchase of goods or
services&#148; within the wording of s.20 of the Act and s.9(2) of the
Regulation.</pre>
    <pre>[13] On this subject, Ground J. said in his reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          Accordingly, even if the contract between
          Livent and the ticketholder is interpreted to
          be a contract for the purchase of services,
          it is not in my view a proposed purchase in
          that the purchase is completed at the time
          the ticket is obtained because at that time
          the ticketholder has purchased or acquired an
          enforceable right to attend a future
          performance or failing performance, to claim
          rescission of the contract and repayment of
          the ticket price.
</pre>
    <pre>[14] I agree.  Omitting reference to &#147;goods&#148;, the relevant
statutory expression is &#147;proposed purchase of services&#148;, not
&#147;purchase of proposed services&#148;.  &#147;Proposed&#148; modifies &#147;purchase&#148;,
not &#147;services&#148;.  The contract is made when the ticket is
purchased and, even if the subsequent presentation of the
performance falls within the term &#147;services&#148;, they are services
to be performed at some later date.  The &#147;purchase&#148; takes place
when the ticket is sold; even on NYPACC&#146;s analysis, it is only
the &#147;services&#148; that are proposed, for they take place on a later
occasion.</pre>
    <pre>[15] This is, in my view, the proper interpretation of the
expression &#147;proposed purchase of &#133; services&#148; in s.20 of the Act
and s.9(2) of the Regulation, and it is fatal to NYPACC&#146;s
position on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In the result, the answer to NYPACC&#146;s first question is in
the negative, and it becomes unnecessary to deal with the second
question.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appeal is dismissed with costs.
