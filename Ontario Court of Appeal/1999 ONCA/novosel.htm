    <pre>HEARD:         September 21, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice B. H. Matheson dated
January 11, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The motions judge concluded that the wife's claim for an
equalization was barred and he refused, without providing any
reason, to extend the time under s. 2(8) of the Family Law Act.
He also held that the doctrine of laches applied to the wife's
claim for an interest in the husband's business.
[2]  Although the granting of an extension of time is a
discretionary matter, we see no valid reason in this case for
refusing to extend the time to bring an application for
equalization.
[3]  The parties negotiated long after the limitation period
expired and no issue of prescription was raised until after the
application was commenced.  The delay was incurred in good faith
and clearly the limitation period was missed through simple
inadvertence or because the parties agreed to waive it.  There
can be no prejudice to the husband in the circumstances.  See
Shafer v. Shafer (1998), 37 R.F.L. (4th) 104 (Ont. C.A.).
[4]  Moreover, for the same reasons we see no proper basis for
the finding that the doctrine of laches applied with respect to
the wife's claim to an interest in the husband's property.
[5]  The motions judge also found that there was no enforceable
agreement dated July 19, 1995 between the parties.  The husband
cross-appeals this finding.  In our view, this finding is amply
supported by the evidence.  There was no meeting of the minds
with respect to fundamental terms of the agreement.  We see no
error of principle in the motions judge's reasons on this issue.
[6]  Finally, we would not interfere with the motions judge's
decision to allow the partition issue to proceed to trial.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs and the cross-
appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
