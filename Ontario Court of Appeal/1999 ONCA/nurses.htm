    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]       This appeal concerns the legality of certain provisions</pre>
    <pre>of  the  central  collective  agreement  produced  by  collective</pre>
    <pre>bargaining between the Ontario Nurses’ Association and  a  number</pre>
    <pre>of  hospitals in the province.  The respondent hospitals, Orillia</pre>
    <pre>Soldiers Memorial Hospital and Sault Ste. Marie General Hospital,</pre>
    <pre>are  parties to the agreement.  Each hospital employs one or more</pre>
    <pre>members  of  the ONA who were on unpaid leave of absence  due  to</pre>
    <pre>disability.   The  ONA  argues that  certain  provisions  in  the</pre>
    <pre>collective  agreement discriminate on the basis of disability  in</pre>
    <pre>contravention of the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O.  1990,  c.</pre>
    <pre>H.19.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]        The  provisions  at issue concern  seniority,  service</pre>
    <pre>accrual  and  the  employers’ contribution to subsidized  benefit</pre>
    <pre>plans.   In  summary,  while nurses on unpaid  leave  of  absence</pre>
    <pre>remain  employees, they do not accumulate seniority  and  service</pre>
    <pre>after  the  periods  set  out in the  agreement.   As  well,  the</pre>
    <pre>employer  is  not required to contribute premiums to the  benefit</pre>
    <pre>plans   after   the  employees  have  been  receiving   long-term</pre>
    <pre>disability  payments  for  specified  periods  of  time.    Three</pre>
    <pre>separate  grievances  were  filed when  the  hospitals  acted  in</pre>
    <pre>accordance  with  the collective agreement.  A  majority  of  the</pre>
    <pre>Arbitration  Board  held that the provisions  respecting  service</pre>
    <pre>accrual  and  subsidization of benefit plans did not violate  the</pre>
    <pre>Human Rights Code.  A different majority held that the provisions</pre>
    <pre>respecting  seniority did contravene the Code.  The ONA  and  the</pre>
    <pre>hospitals  applied  for  judicial review  of  the  award  to  the</pre>
    <pre>Divisional Court.  The Divisional Court dismissed the application</pre>
    <pre>by  the  ONA and allowed the application of the hospitals holding</pre>
    <pre>that none of the impugned provisions contravened the Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]        I would allow the appeal in part and restore the award</pre>
    <pre>of  the Arbitration Board.  I agree with the Board that only  the</pre>
    <pre>provisions respecting seniority contravene the Human Rights Code.</pre>
    <pre>          
          THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[4]        The arbitration proceeded on the basis of a very brief</pre>
    <pre>statement  of  agreed facts and the collective agreement  itself.</pre>
    <pre>Although  the parties must have known that the purpose  of  these</pre>
    <pre>various  impugned  provisions was crucial to a  determination  of</pre>
    <pre>this  case, no evidence was led on these issues.  In my  view,  a</pre>
    <pre>more  complete record would have been of considerable  assistance</pre>
    <pre>in  resolving  the issues on this appeal.  I will  return  to  my</pre>
    <pre>concerns later in these reasons.  The parties urged us to  decide</pre>
    <pre>this  case on the basis of the record, such as it is, and I have,</pre>
    <pre>with some reluctance, done so.</pre>
    <pre>          
               The Grievers
</pre>
    <pre>[5]       One griever is an employee of Orillia. Her last day  of</pre>
    <pre>work  was in April 1990.  After a period on short-term disability</pre>
    <pre>and  unemployment insurance benefits, she began  receiving  long-</pre>
    <pre>term  disability  benefits.  It was agreed  that  her  disability</pre>
    <pre>falls  within  the meaning of “handicap” in s.  10(1)(a)  of  the</pre>
    <pre>Human Rights Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]        The other grievers are employees of Sault Ste.  Marie.</pre>
    <pre>They  each  suffered  work-related injuries  and  were  receiving</pre>
    <pre>unemployment insurance, long-term disability payments or workers’</pre>
    <pre>compensation benefits.  Their disabilities also fall  within  the</pre>
    <pre>term “handicap” as defined by the Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]        In the course of oral argument, we were informed  that</pre>
    <pre>two of the grievers have returned to work.</pre>
    <pre>          
               The Collective Agreement
                                          </pre>
    <pre>    [8]      This appeal principally concerns provisions in Articles

    10 and 17 of the ONA Full-Time Collective Agreement in force between

    1991 and 1993.  These provisions address four main terms: employer

    contributions to benefits, service accrual, seniority, and other</pre>
    <pre>    employees on unpaid leave of absence. This appeal deals mainly

    with the first three terms.  The effects of thes provisions are

    set out in the chart below:

    EMPLOYMENT	     SENIORITY SERVICE	EMPLOYER PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS

</pre>
    <pre>          
          Employer contributions to benefits
</pre>
    <pre>[9]        In  accordance  with Article 17.01,  the  employer  is</pre>
    <pre>required to make premium contributions to four health and welfare</pre>
    <pre>plans  for  full-time employees.  The percentage of the  employer</pre>
    <pre>contribution for active employees varies, depending on the  plan,</pre>
    <pre>from 100% for semi-private hospital care, to 50% of premiums  for</pre>
    <pre>a  dental plan.  While a nurse is on unpaid leave of absence, the</pre>
    <pre>employer continues to make premium contributions for thirty days;</pre>
    <pre>thereafter the nurse pays 100% of the premiums.  While a nurse is</pre>
    <pre>receiving  workers’ compensation payments, the employer continues</pre>
    <pre>to  make  the  same contribution as if the nurse were  an  active</pre>
    <pre>employee (full contributions).  While a nurse is receiving  long-</pre>
    <pre>term  disability  payments, the hospital makes its  contributions</pre>
    <pre>for   the   thirty   months  from  the  date  absence   commenced</pre>
    <pre>(Article 17.05); thereafter, the nurse pays 100% of the premiums.

</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  ONA  argues that this difference in treatment  between</pre>
    <pre>nurses  on unpaid leave of absence because of handicap and active</pre>
    <pre>employees violates the Code.  Before this court, counsel for  the</pre>
    <pre>ONA   also  argued  that  the  difference  in  treatment  between</pre>
    <pre>employees  on workers’ compensation and employees in  receipt  of</pre>
    <pre>long-term  disability constituted a violation of the Code.   This</pre>
    <pre>issue  was  not  raised  before  the  Arbitration  Board  or  the</pre>
    <pre>Divisional Court.  There is no evidentiary record on this  issue.</pre>
    <pre>On  very  short notice, counsel for the respondent, Mr. Gray,  in</pre>
    <pre>his  helpful  submissions,  pointed  out  that  this  distinction</pre>
    <pre>probably  arises out of the special statutory regime in force  in</pre>
    <pre>Ontario  that  has  removed workplace  injuries  from  the  civil</pre>
    <pre>courts.  In my view, the issue is not properly before this  court</pre>
    <pre>and I would not permit the ONA to raise it at this stage.</pre>
    <pre>          
          Service accrual
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The number of years of full-time continuous service is used</pre>
    <pre>to  calculate various forms of compensation such as paid vacation</pre>
    <pre>(Article 16) and place on the wage grid (Article 19.01).  A nurse</pre>
    <pre>on  unpaid  leave of absence only accumulates service for  thirty</pre>
    <pre>days (Article 10.04).</pre>
    <pre>          
          Seniority
</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Seniority is determined by a nurse's date of  hire.   Under</pre>
    <pre>the  agreement, nurses are laid off based on seniority,  provided</pre>
    <pre>the  nurses  who are entitled to remain (based on seniority)  are</pre>
    <pre>qualified  to  perform  the  available  work.   Nurses  are  also</pre>
    <pre>recalled to work in the order of seniority.  For nurses on unpaid</pre>
    <pre>leave of absence and in receipt of workers’ compensation benefits</pre>
    <pre>or  long-term disability benefits, seniority only accrues for  up</pre>
    <pre>to one year (Article 10.04).</pre>
    <pre>          
          Other employees on unpaid leave of absence
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The  benefits provided for disabled employees are the  same</pre>
    <pre>as,  or  exceed,  benefits provided to most  other  employees  on</pre>
    <pre>unpaid leave of absence.  For example, a nurse on unpaid leave of</pre>
    <pre>absence by reason other than disability accumulates seniority for</pre>
    <pre>thirty days, whereas disabled employees accumulate seniority  for</pre>
    <pre>a year.  There are exceptions for nurses on pregnancy or parental</pre>
    <pre>leave.   For  example,  a  nurse on pregnancy  leave  accumulates</pre>
    <pre>service for seventeen weeks rather than only thirty days.  It was</pre>
    <pre>not  argued that this difference in treatment infringes the Code.</pre>
    <pre>The  collective  agreement also includes special  provisions  for</pre>
    <pre>paid leave of absence including short-term sick leave of up to 15</pre>
    <pre>weeks.   Employees on short-term sick leave are treated as active</pre>
    <pre>employees.</pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  position  of  the ONA is straightforward.   Nurses  on</pre>
    <pre>unpaid  leave  of  absence  are treated  differently  from  other</pre>
    <pre>employees  on active service.  They are, however, all  employees.</pre>
    <pre>Where the reason for the absence is a handicap as defined in  the</pre>
    <pre>Human Rights Code, this group of employees is being discriminated</pre>
    <pre>against on the basis of a ground prohibited by the Code.   Having</pre>
    <pre>established  a  prima facie violation of s. 11 of the  Code,  the</pre>
    <pre>onus  is on the employer to show that the needs of this group  of</pre>
    <pre>workers cannot be accommodated without undue hardship.

</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The position of the employers is similarly straightforward.</pre>
    <pre>They argue that the Code right to equal treatment with respect to</pre>
    <pre>employment without discrimination does not include the  provision</pre>
    <pre>of  pay, benefits and other advantages when the employee  is  not</pre>
    <pre>performing  work.  Where the employer does provide pay,  benefits</pre>
    <pre>or  other  advantages for employees who do not perform work,  the</pre>
    <pre>employer must do so in a manner that does not discriminate  on  a</pre>
    <pre>prohibited  ground,  such as handicap. In the  cases  before  the</pre>
    <pre>court, the benefits and advantages provided to disabled employees</pre>
    <pre>are  the  same  as, or superior to, the benefits  and  advantages</pre>
    <pre>provided to other employees who do not perform work.

</pre>
    <pre>[16]   In  large  part,  this  case  is  about  determining   the</pre>
    <pre>appropriate  group for comparison.  The ONA argues that  but  for</pre>
    <pre>their  handicap  these employees would be on active  service  and</pre>
    <pre>therefore  the  appropriate comparator  group  is  the  group  of</pre>
    <pre>employees in the bargaining unit as a whole.  The employers argue</pre>
    <pre>that  wages,  benefits, and accumulation of service  credits  and</pre>
    <pre>seniority  flow  simply from the employer/employee  relationship,</pre>
    <pre>but  from  the  provision  of work.  Therefore,  the  appropriate</pre>
    <pre>comparator group is all other employees not providing  work,  not</pre>
    <pre>the   bargaining  unit  as  a  whole,  which  includes  employees</pre>
    <pre>providing work.</pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE BOARD
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Before  the Board, the parties agreed to frame  the  issues</pre>
    <pre>arising out of the grievances in the form of the following  three</pre>
    <pre>questions:</pre>
    <pre>          
          A.   Are  the collective agreement provisions
               relating to the accrual of seniority and
               service  for  nurses absent without  pay
               from  the  hospital and  in  receipt  of
               benefits under the Workers’ Compensation
               Act  discriminatory in contravention  of
               the Human Rights Code?
          </pre>
    <pre>          B.   Are  the collective agreement provisions
               relating to the accrual of seniority and
               service  for  nurses absent without  pay
               from  the  hospital and  in  receipt  of
               benefits  under  the  disability  income
               plan  (HOODIP or an equivalent plan)  or
               in  receipt of UI benefits referenced in
               paragraph  7  [of  the  agreed   facts],
               discriminatory in contravention  of  the
               Human Rights Code?
          </pre>
    <pre>          C.   Are  the collective agreement provisions
               relating to the hospital’s continuing to
               pay   its   contributions   to   benefit
               premiums  for  nurses  absent   and   in
               receipt of benefits under the disability
               income  plan  (HOODIP or  an  equivalent
               plan)  or  in  receipt  of  UI  benefits
               referenced      in     paragraph      7,
               discriminatory in contravention  of  the
               Human Rights Code?
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          REASONS OF THE ARBITRATION BOARD
</pre>
    <pre>[18] A majority of the Arbitration Board held that resolution  of</pre>
    <pre>these questions depended upon the application of the decision  of</pre>
    <pre>Arbitrator  Brown  in Re Versa Services Ltd.  and  Milk  &amp;  Bread</pre>
    <pre>Drivers,  Dairy  Employees, Caterers &amp;  Allied  Employees  Union,</pre>
    <pre>Local 647 (1994), 39 L.A.C. (4th) 196, affirmed by an endorsement</pre>
    <pre>of  the  Divisional  Court, delivered  February  7,  1995.  Versa</pre>
    <pre>Services concerned a collective agreement requiring employees  on</pre>
    <pre>long-term  disability to pay the cost of benefits if they  wished</pre>
    <pre>to  maintain  coverage.  The employer paid some  or  all  of  the</pre>
    <pre>premiums for employees on active service.  Arbitrator Brown  held</pre>
    <pre>that  the  right  to employer benefit contributions  was  in  the</pre>
    <pre>nature  of  compensation and it was lawful for  the  employer  to</pre>
    <pre>treat   employees   differently  for  purposes  of   compensation</pre>
    <pre>depending  on whether or not they were working. I will return  to</pre>
    <pre>the Versa Services decision below.

</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The  chair  of  the arbitration board  in  this  case,  Mr.</pre>
    <pre>Mitchnik,  and  the employer nominee, Mr. Filion, held  that  the</pre>
    <pre>reasoning in Versa Services applied not only to employer  benefit</pre>
    <pre>contributions but also to service accrual.  Mr. Filion would have</pre>
    <pre>held   that   the  Versa  Services  reasoning  also  applied   to</pre>
    <pre>accumulation  of  seniority.  Mr. Mitchnik  held  that  seniority</pre>
    <pre>accrual  primarily concerned access to the workplace and was  not</pre>
    <pre>in  the nature of compensation.  Accordingly, he held that  Versa</pre>
    <pre>Services had no application and there was a violation of the Code</pre>
    <pre>with respect to seniority accrual.

</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  union  representative, Mr. Anand, held  the  Code  was</pre>
    <pre>violated  in  all  three areas.  He rejected the  Versa  Services</pre>
    <pre>approach,  believing the case was governed  by  another  line  of</pre>
    <pre>cases  dealing  with  deemed termination and represented  by  the</pre>
    <pre>decision  of  the Divisional Court in Ontario Nurses’ Association</pre>
    <pre>v. Etobicoke General Hospital (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 40.  That case</pre>
    <pre>concerned  a clause in the collective agreement that  deemed  all</pre>
    <pre>employees  absent from work for more than twenty-four months  due</pre>
    <pre>to  illness  or  disability to be automatically terminated.   The</pre>
    <pre>Divisional  Court  held  that  the automatic  termination  clause</pre>
    <pre>violated  the  Code since it deprived handicap employees  of  the</pre>
    <pre>right  not  to  be discharged without a showing of proper  cause.</pre>
    <pre>Mr. Anand also found support for his position in the decision  of</pre>
    <pre>the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v.</pre>
    <pre>Simpsons-Sears  Ltd. (1985), 23 D.L.R. (4th) 321.   In  Simpsons-</pre>
    <pre>Sears,  the court found a violation of the Code when the employer</pre>
    <pre>discharged an employee from full-time employment because she  was</pre>
    <pre>unwilling to work on Saturday because of her religious beliefs.

</pre>
    <pre>[21]  In sum, Mr. Mitchnik and Mr. Filion held that there was  no</pre>
    <pre>violation  with  respect  to employer benefit  contributions  and</pre>
    <pre>service  accrual.   Mr.  Mitchnik and Mr. Anand  found  that  the</pre>
    <pre>provisions  in  the  agreement respecting  accrual  of  seniority</pre>
    <pre>contravened the Code.</pre>
    <pre>          
          THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT
</pre>
    <pre>[22]  The Divisional Court (Hartt, Campbell and Caswell JJ.) held</pre>
    <pre>that  this case was determined by the decision in Versa Services.</pre>
    <pre>The  court considered that it should follow Versa Services unless</pre>
    <pre>there  was  some  strong  reason to  the  contrary,  such  as  an</pre>
    <pre>indication  that  the  panel failed to  consider  some  statutory</pre>
    <pre>provision or binding authority.  The court found no such  reason.</pre>
    <pre>Thus  the  court held that Mr. Mitchnik was correct  in  applying</pre>
    <pre>Versa  Services  to  employer benefit contributions  and  service</pre>
    <pre>accrual.   However, the court agreed with Mr. Filion  that  Versa</pre>
    <pre>Services  also applied to accumulation of seniority  and  adopted</pre>
    <pre>the following part of Mr. Filion’s reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Given  that it is not discriminatory for  the
          Collective  Agreement to limit an  employee’s
          entitlement  to service credits  and  benefit
          coverage  when  absent due to  “handicap”  it
          follows,   a  fortiori,  that   it   is   not
          discriminatory for the Agreement to limit  an
          employee’s  accumulation of seniority  rights
          when  absent for similar reasons.   The  fact
          that  the  employer’s interest  in  seniority
          accumulation may not be as great as it is  in
          relation  to compensation issues is no  basis
          for  the quantum leap which distinguishes the
          two  concepts from a human rights  viewpoint.
          It  is not logical to infer that the drafters
          of  the  Code  intended to  create  seniority
          protection  for  employees off  work  due  to
          illness  or injury where it clearly  did  not
          provide   any  similar  protection  for   the
          accumulation  of service credits  or  benefit
          coverage.

          infringed  where a requirement, qualification
          or  factor  exists that is not discrimination
          on  a  prohibited ground but that results  in
          the exclusion, restriction or preference of a
          group  of  persons who are  identified  by  a

    <pre>               (a)   the requirement, qualification  or

    <pre>               (b)   it is declared in this Act,  other
               than in section 17, that to discriminate
               because  of  such  ground  is   not   an

    <pre>          (2)  The Commission, the board of inquiry  or

          qualification  or  factor is  reasonable  and
          bona  fide in the circumstances unless it  is
          satisfied  that  the needs of  the  group  of
          which  the  person  is  a  member  cannot  be
          accommodated  without undue hardship  on  the
          person  responsible  for accommodating  those
          needs,  considering the cost, outside sources

    <pre>          ANALYSIS
          </pre>
    <pre>               Standard of Review
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The collective agreement is subject to the dictates of  the</pre>
    <pre>Human  Rights Code.  While parties to a collective agreement  can</pre>
    <pre>negotiate  increased  protection  against  discrimination,   they</pre>
    <pre>cannot contract out of those provisions of the Code that have the</pre>
    <pre>effect  of  further  protecting the human rights  of  the  people</pre>
    <pre>affected:  N.A.P.E. v. Newfoundland (1996), 134  D.L.R.  (4th)  1</pre>
    <pre>(S.C.C.)  at  8-9.  The parties agreed that since the  Board  was</pre>
    <pre>interpreting  and applying questions of general law  relating  to</pre>
    <pre>the  Code,  the Board’s decision is reviewable on a  standard  of</pre>
    <pre>correctness: N.A.P.E. at p. 5.</pre>
    <pre>          
                 Employer   Contributions  to   Benefit
          Premiums
          </pre>
    <pre>               (i)  Direct discrimination under s. 5 of
          the Code
</pre>
    <pre>[25] I have briefly set out the positions of the parties.  It  is</pre>
    <pre>now  necessary  to  set  those arguments  against  the  statutory</pre>
    <pre>framework,  beginning  with  the employer  contributions  to  the</pre>
    <pre>benefit  plans.   In  Brooks v. Canada Safeway  Ltd.  (1989),  59</pre>
    <pre>D.L.R.  (4th)  321  (S.C.C.)  at  337,  a  case  concerned   with</pre>
    <pre>discrimination on the basis of sex, Dickson C.J.C.,  writing  for</pre>
    <pre>the court, stated:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Increasingly,  employee benefits  plans  have
          become  part  of the terms and conditions  of
          employment.   Once  an  employer  decides  to
          provide    an   employee   benefit   package,
          exclusions from such schemes may not be  made
          in   a   discriminatory  fashion.   Selective
          compensation  of  this nature  would  clearly
          amount   to  sex  discrimination.    Benefits
          available   through   employment   must    be
          disbursed  in  a  non-discriminatory  manner.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[26] In this passage, the court identified employee benefit plans</pre>
    <pre>as a form of compensation.  In my view, employer contributions to</pre>
    <pre>such  plans are similarly a form of compensation.  The  appellant</pre>
    <pre>provided no evidence to the contrary.  Providing different levels</pre>
    <pre>of  compensation to different groups of employees is  not  itself</pre>
    <pre>discriminatory  within  the  meaning  of  the  Code.   Prohibited</pre>
    <pre>discrimination only occurs when the distinction  is  based  on  a</pre>
    <pre>prohibited ground.  The prohibited ground alleged in this case is</pre>
    <pre>“by  reason  of  handicap” within the  meaning  of  s.  10.   The</pre>
    <pre>appellant  argues  that  the  nurses  are  denied  this  form  of</pre>
    <pre>compensation  because they are handicapped.  Thus, the  violation</pre>
    <pre>of s. 5(1) of the Code is established.  I do not agree.

</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Disabled  nurses  do not receive this compensation  because</pre>
    <pre>they  are  not providing services to their employer.  It  is  not</pre>
    <pre>prohibited   discrimination  to  distinguish  for   purposes   of</pre>
    <pre>compensation between employees who are providing services to  the</pre>
    <pre>employer   and  those  who  are  not.   It  would  be  prohibited</pre>
    <pre>discrimination for the employer to provide different compensation</pre>
    <pre>to  different  groups  of employees providing  services,  if  the</pre>
    <pre>distinction  were  based on a prohibited ground.   That  was  the</pre>
    <pre>problem  in  Brooks.   Under the disability plan  in  that  case,</pre>
    <pre>employees  who  were unable to work due to sickness  or  accident</pre>
    <pre>were  provided with benefits or, in the words of Dickson  C.J.C.,</pre>
    <pre>compensation.   However, pregnant employees who  were  unable  to</pre>
    <pre>work  in  the  seventeen-week period surrounding the birth,  were</pre>
    <pre>excluded  from the plan even when the reason for their  inability</pre>
    <pre>to work was unrelated to the pregnancy.  Instead, these employees</pre>
    <pre>were  required to draw upon the less generous pregnancy  benefits</pre>
    <pre>under  the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971, S.C. 1970-71-72,  c.</pre>
    <pre>48.  The court found that this distinction, drawn on the basis of</pre>
    <pre>pregnancy, was sex discrimination.  A critical element in finding</pre>
    <pre>discrimination was establishing the appropriate comparator group.</pre>
    <pre>The  employer  argued that since pregnancy is not a  sickness  or</pre>
    <pre>accident  it  need  not  treat pregnant  employees  the  same  as</pre>
    <pre>employees  who  are unable to work due to sickness  or  accident.</pre>
    <pre>Dickson C.J.C. rejected this approach.  Rather, he looked at  the</pre>
    <pre>underlying  rationale of the disability plan, which he  described</pre>
    <pre>at  p. 334 as “the laudable desire to compensate persons who  are</pre>
    <pre>unable to work for valid health-related reasons”.  Having decided</pre>
    <pre>to  provide  such  a  plan,  the employer  was  not  entitled  to</pre>
    <pre>distinguish  between persons who are unable  to  work  for  valid</pre>
    <pre>health-related reasons on the basis of sex.

</pre>
    <pre>[28] The Supreme Court of Canada reached a similar conclusion  in</pre>
    <pre>Gibbs  v. Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. (1996),  140</pre>
    <pre>D.L.R.  (4th) 1.  In Gibbs, the plan provided income  replacement</pre>
    <pre>to  employees  rendered unable to work by disability  while  they</pre>
    <pre>were  incapable  of returning to their jobs.  The plan,  however,</pre>
    <pre>was  discriminatory.   It  provided less  generous  benefits  for</pre>
    <pre>mental  disability than for physical disability.   At  issue  was</pre>
    <pre>whether  the  appropriate comparison was between  the  physically</pre>
    <pre>disabled and the mentally disabled  —  in which case the plan was</pre>
    <pre>discriminatory; or between the disabled generally and  the  able-</pre>
    <pre>bodied — in which case it was argued there was no discrimination.</pre>
    <pre>Sopinka  J., relying on Brooks, wrote for the majority  that  the</pre>
    <pre>appropriate comparator group could only be determined by  looking</pre>
    <pre>at the purpose of the disability plan:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The  first step is to determine, in  all  the
          circumstances of the case, the purpose of the
          disability   plan.  Comparing  the   benefits
          allocated  to employees pursuant to different
          purposes   is   not  helpful  in  determining
          discrimination  -- it is understandable  that
          insurance  benefits  designed  for  disparate
          purposes  will differ. If, however,  benefits
          are  allocated pursuant to the same  purpose,
          yet   benefits  differ  as  the   result   of
          characteristics that are not relevant to this
          purpose,  discrimination may well exist.  (at
          16-17)
</pre>
    <pre>[29]  The  purpose  of the plan in Gibbs was to insure  employees</pre>
    <pre>against the income-related consequences of becoming disabled  and</pre>
    <pre>unable to work.  Thus, it was appropriate to compare the benefits</pre>
    <pre>received  by  one group of disabled with the disabled  generally,</pre>
    <pre>but  not  the  workforce as a whole.  Again, as  in  Brooks,  the</pre>
    <pre>employer  was  not  obliged  to  provide  this  form  of   income</pre>
    <pre>replacement,  but  having  done so,  it  could  not  discriminate</pre>
    <pre>between employees on a prohibited basis.

</pre>
    <pre>[30] Similarly, in War Amputations of Canada v. Canada (1997), 36</pre>
    <pre>O.R.  (3d) 709 this court held there was no discrimination  where</pre>
    <pre>veterans  (primarily men) received different pensions than  their</pre>
    <pre>survivors  (primarily women), because the two  different  benefit</pre>
    <pre>schemes had different purposes.

</pre>
    <pre>[31]  In the case presently before the court, the purpose of  the</pre>
    <pre>employer  contributions  to  benefit  plans  is  to  provide   an</pre>
    <pre>additional  form  of compensation in exchange for  work.   Having</pre>
    <pre>chosen  to provide this form of compensation, the employer  could</pre>
    <pre>not  discriminate on a prohibited basis.  However,  the  employer</pre>
    <pre>could   distinguish  based  on  the  reason  for  providing   the</pre>
    <pre>compensation: work.  On its face, discrimination would  exist  if</pre>
    <pre>the  employer provided different levels of compensation for  work</pre>
    <pre>because    of    handicap.    Likewise,   it   would   constitute</pre>
    <pre>discrimination  if  the  employer provided  different  levels  of</pre>
    <pre>compensation  for not working because of handicap. But,  in  this</pre>
    <pre>context it makes no sense to compare working employees with those</pre>
    <pre>not   working.   As  Sopinka  J.  said,  comparing  the  benefits</pre>
    <pre>allocated  to  employees pursuant to different  purposes  is  not</pre>
    <pre>helpful in determining discrimination.

</pre>
    <pre>[32]  I  also  do  not  find it helpful  to  attempt  to  isolate</pre>
    <pre>different  elements of the compensation package such as  employer</pre>
    <pre>contributions  to premiums, vacation pay, and wages  and  ascribe</pre>
    <pre>different  purposes  to  each so as to  create  a  discrimination</pre>
    <pre>argument.    They  are  all  part  of  the  compensation  package</pre>
    <pre>negotiated  by the parties in exchange for work by the employees.</pre>
    <pre>When  the  employee is not working, different considerations  and</pre>
    <pre>different  forms  of payment may apply.  For instance,  employees</pre>
    <pre>may   receive  workers'  compensation  or  long-term   disability</pre>
    <pre>payments.

</pre>
    <pre>[33]  In  essence, the appellant’s argument is  that  the  income</pre>
    <pre>replacement plans should include payment of these premiums.  This</pre>
    <pre>is  a  matter  to  be  determined in  the  collective  bargaining</pre>
    <pre>process.   It would only be covered by the Human Rights  Code  if</pre>
    <pre>the  income replacement plan itself discriminated on a prohibited</pre>
    <pre>basis  (as  in  Brooks and Gibbs).  That is not  the  case  here.</pre>
    <pre>Leaving  aside  the  difference  between  employees  on  workers’</pre>
    <pre>compensation  and  those on long-term disability,  which  is  not</pre>
    <pre>properly  before  this court, the benefits provided  to  handicap</pre>
    <pre>employees  not  providing work are more generous  than  to  other</pre>
    <pre>employees   not   providing  work.   Therefore,   there   is   no</pre>
    <pre>discrimination  on a prohibited basis within the  meaning  of  s.</pre>
    <pre>5(1)  of  the  Code.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to  consider</pre>
    <pre>whether the employers could rely upon the justification in s.  17</pre>
    <pre>of the Code.</pre>
    <pre>          
          (ii) Constructive discrimination under s. 11
          of the Code
</pre>
    <pre>[34] The appellant also argues that the treatment of the disabled</pre>
    <pre>employees  in  respect  of benefits constitutes  constructive  or</pre>
    <pre>adverse  effect discrimination under s. 11.  Section 11  was  the</pre>
    <pre>basis of Mr. Anand's dissent.  He reasoned that the Board was not</pre>
    <pre>bound  by  Versa  Services  as  the  Divisional  Court  had   not</pre>
    <pre>considered Re Ontario Human Rights Commission et al. and Simpsons-</pre>
    <pre>Sears  Ltd.  (1985),  23 D.L.R. (4th) 321  (S.C.C.),  an  adverse</pre>
    <pre>discrimination   case.   Simpsons-Sears  was  decided   under   a</pre>
    <pre>predecessor   to   the  Code  that  did  not   include   s.   11.</pre>
    <pre>Nevertheless, McIntrye J., speaking for the court, held that  the</pre>
    <pre>Code prohibited adverse discrimination.

</pre>
    <pre>  [35]      However,  McIntyre J. also held  that  where  adverse</pre>
    <pre>discrimination is found, the working rule or condition  found  to</pre>
    <pre>constitute adverse discrimination is not struck down, rather some</pre>
    <pre>accommodation  is required from the employer for the  benefit  of</pre>
    <pre>the  complainant.   In  the  absence  of  a  statutory  duty   to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate,  McIntyre  J. fashioned a test  that  he  considered</pre>
    <pre>consistent with the intent of the Code; namely, the employer must</pre>
    <pre>show  that it has taken the reasonable steps toward accommodation</pre>
    <pre>of  the  employee’s position open to it without  undue  hardship:</pre>
    <pre>Simpsons-Sears at 336-38.

</pre>
    <pre>[36]  The  Legislature has now enacted provisions  in  the  Code,</pre>
    <pre>including    s.   11,   expressly   dealing   with   constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination.  The decision in Versa Services refers to s.  11.</pre>
    <pre>I  cannot  agree  with Mr. Anand that the failure  of  the  Versa</pre>
    <pre>Services court to explicitly mention Simpsons-Sears provided  him</pre>
    <pre>with a basis for refusing to follow it.  The principle of adverse</pre>
    <pre>or constructive discrimination was clearly before the court.

</pre>
    <pre>[37]  In  any  event, I am not satisfied that the  appellant  has</pre>
    <pre>demonstrated  a  contravention of s.  11.   In  its  factum,  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant   put   the   case  for  a  finding   of   constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination under s. 11 in this way:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Where access to benefits in employment is at
          issue, adverse effect discrimination is
          established when benefits otherwise generally
          available to employees are limited or denied
          to certain employees on the basis of a
          prohibited ground of discrimination.  Unequal
          treatment is identified by comparing the
          situation of the group adversely affected
          because of a protected ground with the group
          to whom the benefit is generally available.
          [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[38] In my view, this submission does not describe a violation of</pre>
    <pre>s.  11  of  the  Code.   Rather, the  submission  alleges  direct</pre>
    <pre>discrimination  under  s. 5, a submission  that  I  have  already</pre>
    <pre>disposed  of against the appellant.  This does not, however,  end</pre>
    <pre>the  matter.   For the reasons that follow, I am  satisfied  that</pre>
    <pre>even  if  the rule respecting employer contributions  to  benefit</pre>
    <pre>plan  premiums constitutes constructive discrimination,  properly</pre>
    <pre>understood,  the  justification in s. 11(1)(b) for  a  bona  fide</pre>
    <pre>occupational qualification [BFOQ] applies.

</pre>
    <pre>[39] The starting point for properly understanding adverse effect</pre>
    <pre>or  constructive discrimination is Simpsons-Sears.  In that case,</pre>
    <pre>at  p.  332, McIntyre J. described adverse effect or constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination in the following terms:</pre>
    <pre>          
          On  the  other hand, there is the concept  of
          adverse  effect  discrimination.   It  arises
          where   an   employer  for  genuine  business
          reasons adopts a rule or standard which is on
          its   face  neutral,  and  which  will  apply
          equally  to  all employees, but which  has  a
          discriminatory  effect  upon   a   prohibited
          ground  on one employee or group of employees
          in  that  it imposes, because of some special
          characteristic  of  the  employee  or  group,
          obligations,   penalties,   or    restrictive
          conditions  not imposed on other  members  of
          the  work force … An employment rule honestly
          made  for sound economic or business reasons,
          equally  applicable to  all  to  whom  it  is
          intended  to apply, may yet be discriminatory
          if  it  affects a person or group of  persons
          differently from others to whom it may apply.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[40] Adverse effect discrimination as explained in Simpsons-Sears</pre>
    <pre>and  constructive discrimination as codified in s. 11  appear  to</pre>
    <pre>cover  the same ground.  Both concepts are premised on a  neutral</pre>
    <pre>rule or standard that applies equally to all employees but has  a</pre>
    <pre>discriminatory  effect because it imposes a penalty  on  a  group</pre>
    <pre>because of some group characteristic protected by the Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[41] In Simpsons-Sears, the neutral rule was the requirement that</pre>
    <pre>all employees work on Friday evenings on a rotating basis and  on</pre>
    <pre>two  Saturdays  out  of  three.   The  discriminatory  effect  in</pre>
    <pre>Simpsons-Sears  occurred  because  of  the  employee’s  religious</pre>
    <pre>practices.   The  complainant became a member of the  Seventh-Day</pre>
    <pre>Adventist  Church.   A tenet of that faith is that  the  Sabbath,</pre>
    <pre>which  extends from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday,  must  be</pre>
    <pre>strictly kept.  The neutral rule would have a differing impact on</pre>
    <pre>different  groups  of  employees.  For  example,  employees  with</pre>
    <pre>children would be unable to spend time with their children Friday</pre>
    <pre>evening  and Saturday.  The impact upon the complainant was  that</pre>
    <pre>she would be unable to comply with the tenets of her religion  if</pre>
    <pre>required  to  work  at  those times.  The  discriminatory  effect</pre>
    <pre>occurs  in  the  latter and not the former  because  the  adverse</pre>
    <pre>impact  in Simpsons-Sears resulted from the exercise of religion.</pre>
    <pre>Discrimination on the basis of religion (creed under the Code) is</pre>
    <pre>prohibited.  In s. 11 terms, the Simpsons-Sears complainant was a</pre>
    <pre>member   of  a  group  identified  by  a  prohibited  ground   of</pre>
    <pre>discrimination.

</pre>
    <pre>[42] In this case, the neutral rule (a requirement, qualification</pre>
    <pre>or  factor  in the words of s. 11) may be stated as follows:  the</pre>
    <pre>employer  contributes  toward premium coverage  of  participating</pre>
    <pre>eligible  nurses  in the “active employ” of the hospital.   While</pre>
    <pre>stating  the  neutral rule is relatively simple,  describing  the</pre>
    <pre>discriminatory  effect, especially in disability cases,  is  more</pre>
    <pre>problematic.  In Versa Services, the arbitrator found  no  s.  11</pre>
    <pre>constructive  discrimination by adopting a narrow,  policy-driven</pre>
    <pre>interpretation  of  constructive  discrimination  in   cases   of</pre>
    <pre>handicap.   He reached this conclusion by reading ss. 11  and  17</pre>
    <pre>together.  For convenience, these sections are set out below:</pre>
    <pre>          
          11.  (1)  A right of a person under Part I is
          infringed  where a requirement, qualification
          or  factor  exists that is not discrimination
          on  a  prohibited ground but that results  in
          the exclusion, restriction or preference of a
          group  of  persons who are  identified  by  a
          prohibited  ground of discrimination  and  of
          whom the person is a member, except where,
               </pre>
    <pre>               (a)   the requirement, qualification  or
               factor  is reasonable and bona  fide  in
               the circumstances; or
               </pre>
    <pre>               (b)   it is declared in this Act,  other
               than in section 17, that to discriminate
               because  of  such  ground  is   not   an
               infringement of a right.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  The Commission, the board of inquiry  or
          a  court  shall not find that a  requirement,
          qualification  or  factor is  reasonable  and
          bona  fide in the circumstances unless it  is
          satisfied  that  the needs of  the  group  of
          which  the  person  is  a  member  cannot  be
          accommodated  without undue hardship  on  the
          person  responsible  for accommodating  those
          needs,  considering the cost, outside sources
          of  funding,  if any, and health  and  safety
          requirements, if any.
          </pre>
    <pre>          …
          </pre>
    <pre>          17.   (1)  A right of a person under this Act
          is not infringed for the reason only that the
          person   is   incapable  of   performing   or
          fulfilling    the   essential    duties    or
          requirements  attending the exercise  of  the
          right because of handicap.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  The Commission, the board of inquiry  or
          a  court  shall  not find a person  incapable
          unless it is satisfied that the needs of  the
          person  cannot be accommodated without  undue
          hardship   on  the  person  responsible   for
          accommodating  those needs,  considering  the
          cost, outside sources of funding, if any, and
          health and safety requirements, if any.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[43]  By  reading s. 11 with s. 17, the Versa Services arbitrator</pre>
    <pre>found  that  in  cases  of  handicap, s.  11  treats  matters  of</pre>
    <pre>compensation  differently from participation.  His  reasoning  is</pre>
    <pre>summarized in the following passages at pp. 203-4:</pre>
    <pre>          
          In my view, the Code treats compensation
          differently from participation.  The
          reference in s. 17 to a person’s capability
          to perform duties indicates this section
          applies to engagement in active employment.
          On this front, s. 17 adopts the broader
          notion of equal treatment which requires
          differences to be accommodated, so as not to
          exclude a handicapped person from a work
          place.  Section 17 cannot be construed as
          applying the same broad notion of equal
          treatment to compensation because it contains
          no reference to compensation. …
          </pre>
    <pre>          In coming to this conclusion, I have not
          overlooked s. 11 of the Code which adopts a
          broad understanding of equal
          treatment…Section 17 is addressed exclusively
          to handicap.  This section requires special
          treatment to enable people with disabilities
          to participate in active employment, but
          stops short of requiring special compensation
          measures.  This deliberate omission in a
          section dealing specifically with handicap
          should not be negated by a broad reading of
          the more general requirements of s. 11 which
          addresses all of the prohibited grounds of
          discrimination.  [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[44]  I cannot agree with this interpretation of s. 11.  Such  an</pre>
    <pre>interpretation  would offer less protection to  one  historically</pre>
    <pre>disadvantaged group (the disabled) than another and a  group  for</pre>
    <pre>whom  adverse  effects  discrimination is “especially  relevant”:</pre>
    <pre>Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3  S.C.R.</pre>
    <pre>624  at  672.  That interpretation is also inconsistent with  the</pre>
    <pre>history and plain wording of the provisions.

</pre>
    <pre>[45] The predecessors to ss. 11 and 17 were ss. 10 and 16 of  the</pre>
    <pre>Human  Rights  Code,  S.O. 1981, c. 53.  Section  10  dealt  with</pre>
    <pre>constructive  discrimination and like s. 11 of the present  Code,</pre>
    <pre>provided a justification in para. (a) for a bona fide requirement</pre>
    <pre>or  qualification or in para. (b) where  “it is declared in  this</pre>
    <pre>Act  that  to  discriminate because of  such  ground  is  not  an</pre>
    <pre>infringement  of a right”.  Unlike s. 11, there  was  no  express</pre>
    <pre>duty to accommodate in s. 10.  Section 16 dealt with handicap  in</pre>
    <pre>two  respects.   Section  16(1)(a)  deemed  inability  to  access</pre>
    <pre>premises, services, goods, facilities or accommodation by  reason</pre>
    <pre>of  handicap  not  to be an infringement of  the  Code.   Section</pre>
    <pre>16(1)(b)  was identical to present s. 17(1).  Again,  unlike  the</pre>
    <pre>present  s.  17,  there was no express duty  to  accommodate  the</pre>
    <pre>handicapped individual.

</pre>
    <pre>[46]  The present versions of ss. 11 and 17 were enacted  by  the</pre>
    <pre>Equality  Rights Statute Law Amendment Act, 1986, S.O.  1986,  c.</pre>
    <pre>64.   Notably, the long title of that Act is:  “An Act  to  amend</pre>
    <pre>certain Ontario Statutes to conform to section 15 of the Canadian</pre>
    <pre>Charter of Rights and Freedoms”.

</pre>
    <pre>[47]  A duty to accommodate was added to s. 11 as now set out  in</pre>
    <pre>s.  11(2) and the words “other than in section 17” were added  to</pre>
    <pre>the  present s. 11(1)(b).  Section 17 was substantially  amended.</pre>
    <pre>The  defence  in former s. 16(1)(a) was repealed and  a  duty  to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate  was added to what is now s. 17(2).  It seems  to  me</pre>
    <pre>that  the  repeal  of s. 16(1)(a) demonstrated the  legislature’s</pre>
    <pre>concern  that,  in light of s. 15 of the Charter  of  Rights  and</pre>
    <pre>Freedoms,  one  historically disadvantaged group  (the  disabled)</pre>
    <pre>could   not  continue  to  be  treated  differently  than   other</pre>
    <pre>historically disadvantaged groups.  The fact that the legislature</pre>
    <pre>nevertheless   maintained  a  special  justification   for   some</pre>
    <pre>differences based on handicap recognizes the reality that  unfair</pre>
    <pre>discrimination of the disabled is not always grounded in negative</pre>
    <pre>stereotypes.  In many circumstances equality of treatment of  the</pre>
    <pre>disabled  depends upon an assessment of the capabilities  of  the</pre>
    <pre>individual,  not  the  group.  Sopinka  J.  described  these  two</pre>
    <pre>different objectives of human rights legislation for the disabled</pre>
    <pre>in  Eaton v. Brant County Board of Education, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 241</pre>
    <pre>at 272-73 where, in relation to s. 15(1) of the Charter of Rights</pre>
    <pre>and Freedoms, he said the following:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The principal object of certain of the
          prohibited grounds is the elimination of
          discrimination by the attribution of untrue
          characteristics based on stereotypical
          attitudes relating to immutable conditions
          such as race or sex.  In the case of
          disability, this is one of the objectives.
          The other equally important objective seeks
          to take into account the true characteristics
          of this group which act as headwinds to the
          enjoyment of society’s benefits and to
          accommodate them.  Exclusion from the
          mainstream of society results from the
          construction of a society based solely on
          “mainstream” attributes to which disabled
          persons will never be able to gain access.
          Whether it is the impossibility of success at
          a written test for a blind person, or the
          need for ramp access to a library, the
          discrimination does not lie in the
          attribution of untrue characteristics to the
          disabled individual.  The blind person cannot
          see and the person in a wheelchair needs a
          ramp.  Rather, it is the failure to make
          reasonable accommodation, to fine-tune
          society so that its structures and
          assumptions do not result in the relegation
          and banishment of disabled persons from
          participation, which results in
          discrimination against them.  The
          discrimination inquiry which uses “the
          attribution of stereotypical characteristics”
          reasoning as commonly understood is simply
          inappropriate here.  It may be seen rather as
          a case of reverse stereotyping which, by not
          allowing for the condition of a disabled
          individual, ignores his or her disability and
          forces the individual to sink or swim within
          the mainstream environment.  It is
          recognition of the actual characteristics,
          and reasonable accommodation of these
          characteristics which is the central purpose
          of s. 15(1) in relation to disability.
          [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[48]  However,  the fact that the legislature provided  for  this</pre>
    <pre>individual  assessment in s. 17 cannot mean that the  handicapped</pre>
    <pre>can  be  deprived of the protections available under s. 11  where</pre>
    <pre>there has been constructive discrimination of the disabled  as  a</pre>
    <pre>group.   The  legislature  has expressly  exempted  s.  17  as  a</pre>
    <pre>justification  for constructive discrimination  against  a  group</pre>
    <pre>under s. 11.  It would be a strange result if courts or tribunals</pre>
    <pre>were  able to avoid this legislative choice by simply adopting  a</pre>
    <pre>narrow reading of s. 11.

</pre>
    <pre>[49] I also cannot accept the distinction drawn in Versa Services</pre>
    <pre>between  participation and compensation.  The Supreme  Court  has</pre>
    <pre>recognized   that  constructive  discrimination  in  matters   of</pre>
    <pre>compensation  is  prohibited in relation to  religion  under  the</pre>
    <pre>comparable legislation in Quebec in Chambly, Commission  scolaire</pre>
    <pre>régionale  v.  Bergevin (1994),  115 D.L.R. (4th) 609.   In  that</pre>
    <pre>case,  constructive discrimination was established because Jewish</pre>
    <pre>teachers, although allowed to be absent for religious holy  days,</pre>
    <pre>were   not   paid.    The  calendar  or  work  schedule   had   a</pre>
    <pre>discriminatory  effect  since the  religious  holy  days  of  the</pre>
    <pre>majority were recognized as holidays from work and thus they  did</pre>
    <pre>not lose any pay.  The school board was therefore under a duty to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate  the  Jewish teachers short of undue  hardship.   The</pre>
    <pre>Supreme  Court easily found that the board had not met this  duty</pre>
    <pre>because the collective agreement expressly provided that teachers</pre>
    <pre>could be absent yet paid for other “valid” reasons.

</pre>
    <pre>[54]   If,  as  would  appear  to  be  the  case,  s.  11  covers</pre>
    <pre>constructive  discrimination in matters of compensation  for  one</pre>
    <pre>group  with  protected rights under the Code, I fail to  see  the</pre>
    <pre>basis  for  exempting  another  group,  the  disabled,  from  its</pre>
    <pre>protection in those matters.  This does not mean that there is no</pre>
    <pre>justification  for such distinctions, only that the justification</pre>
    <pre>for  apparently discriminatory treatment of the group  must  take</pre>
    <pre>place   within  s.  11  and  specifically  within  the  duty   to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate  as  set  out in ss. 11(1)(a) and  (2).   The  s.  11</pre>
    <pre>analysis must also take into account the different objectives  of</pre>
    <pre>the  prohibited grounds of discrimination as explained by Sopinka</pre>
    <pre>J.  in  Eaton.   In particular, although s. 11 makes  no  express</pre>
    <pre>reference to capacity, capacity is a central concept in analyzing</pre>
    <pre>the  duty to accommodate the handicapped, whether it is under  s.</pre>
    <pre>11  or  s. 17.  Section 17 gives an employer a justification  for</pre>
    <pre>direct  discrimination on the basis of handicap under s. 5  where</pre>
    <pre>the  individual  is  incapable  and  that  individual  cannot  be</pre>
    <pre>accommodated  short of undue hardship.  It would  make  no  sense</pre>
    <pre>that  an employer faces a heavier burden in cases of constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination under s. 11.  Anne Molloy made a similar point  in</pre>
    <pre>“Disability and the Duty to Accommodate” (1992), 1 Cdn. Lab. L.J.</pre>
    <pre>23  at  36  in  her discussion of Central Alberta Dairy  Pool  v.</pre>
    <pre>Alberta  (Human  Rights Commission) (1990), 72 D.L.R.  (4th)  417</pre>
    <pre>(S.C.C.):</pre>
    <pre>          
          If logic is to prevail, it must be the case
          that the analysis of direct discrimination in
          the presence of a BFOQ [bona fide
          occupational qualification] as set out by
          Wilson J. will in the end result require the
          same kind of accommodation as would be the
          case for indirect discrimination.  Otherwise,
          the result of Wilson J.’s analysis would be
          that an employer has a heavier onus to
          discharge in cases of adverse impact
          discrimination than in cases of direct
          discrimination.  This is, at best, an
          anomalous result.  If the test actually
          develops in this way, we will be faced with
          the ridiculous situation of victims of
          discrimination arguing that the employer was
          acting unintentionally in applying a general
          neutral rule which had an unfortunate
          disparate effect on persons with disabilities
          (so that the duty of accommodation will
          clearly apply).  On the other hand, employers
          will seek to establish that the rule in
          question was direct discrimination against
          disabled people (so that the duty to
          accommodate is less clear).  This, too, would
          be an untenable result.

    <pre>[51]  The  need to avoid this anomalous result is  all  the  more</pre>
    <pre>important for the disabled since as Molloy points out, at p.  37,</pre>
    <pre>with respect to disability-based discrimination “the line between</pre>
    <pre>the two kinds of discrimination is much more blurred” than it  is</pre>
    <pre>with  respect,  for  example, to religious-based  discrimination.</pre>
    <pre>The  result can be avoided by focusing on the objectives  of  the</pre>
    <pre>prohibition  on disability-based discrimination as  explained  by</pre>
    <pre>Sopinka J.  Molloy makes the same point at p. 26:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The accommodation of differences for persons
          with disabilities therefore requires
          overcoming the ignorance, stereotypical
          attitudes and paternalism that are the source
          of much of the overt disability
          discrimination.  But overcoming the
          attitudinal problems of employers and society
          in general is only one part of the
          accommodation required by persons with
          disabilities.  The other key component is the
          physical accommodation of the special needs
          of the disabled worker.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[52]  To  summarize, s. 11 applies to constructive discrimination</pre>
    <pre>on   the  basis  of  handicap  and  includes  discrimination   in</pre>
    <pre>compensation.  The duty to accommodate the group under  s.  11(2)</pre>
    <pre>may,  however,  involve elements similar to the elements  of  the</pre>
    <pre>analysis  of the duty to accommodate the individual in  cases  of</pre>
    <pre>direct discrimination under s. 17.

</pre>
    <pre>[53] In my view, it is possible to find that the neutral rule  in</pre>
    <pre>this  case has a discriminatory effect within the meaning  of  s.</pre>
    <pre>11(1).  To repeat, the neutral rule may be stated as follows: the</pre>
    <pre>employer  contributes  toward premium coverage  of  participating</pre>
    <pre>eligible nurses in the active employ of the hospital.  This  rule</pre>
    <pre>has the effect of requiring the group of employees identified  by</pre>
    <pre>the  prohibited ground of discrimination to assume the burden  of</pre>
    <pre>paying  the  entire contributions for benefits if  they  wish  to</pre>
    <pre>maintain  coverage.  Admittedly, these employees are  treated  no</pre>
    <pre>differently than other employees on unpaid leave of absence,  the</pre>
    <pre>difference is that these employees are adversely effected by  the</pre>
    <pre>rule because of their disability.  The issue then is whether  the</pre>
    <pre>employers  are entitled to the BFOQ justification in s. 11(1)(b).</pre>
    <pre>In my view, they are.  I reach this conclusion not because of the</pre>
    <pre>distinction  drawn  in  Versa Services between  compensation  and</pre>
    <pre>participation, but rather by having regard to the nature  of  the</pre>
    <pre>accommodation   required   for   this   kind   of    constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination.

</pre>
    <pre>[54]  An example may assist in understanding the problem.  Assume</pre>
    <pre>that an employer changes from paying its employees wages based on</pre>
    <pre>hours  worked  to  paying on the basis of the  number  of  pieces</pre>
    <pre>produced.  Assume further that the disabled employees are  simply</pre>
    <pre>unable to produce as many pieces as the able-bodied employees and</pre>
    <pre>as  a result their wages are reduced.  Arguably, this constitutes</pre>
    <pre>constructive  discrimination.  The facially neutral  standard  of</pre>
    <pre>paying  by the number of pieces produced results in a restriction</pre>
    <pre>on  the ability of the disabled employees to earn the same  wages</pre>
    <pre>as  the  able-bodied employees.  In accordance with s.  11(1)(a),</pre>
    <pre>the  employer could justify the different result by showing  that</pre>
    <pre>this  standard was reasonable and bona fide in the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>However,  in  accordance with s. 11(2), the board of  inquiry  or</pre>
    <pre>court  is  only entitled to find that the standard is  reasonable</pre>
    <pre>and  bona  fide if it is satisfied that the needs  of  the  group</pre>
    <pre>cannot  be  accommodated without undue hardship  considering  the</pre>
    <pre>“cost,  outside sources of funding, if any, and health and safety</pre>
    <pre>requirements, if any”.  Nevertheless, I do not read s.  11(2)  as</pre>
    <pre>imposing  upon the employer the burden of simply topping  up  the</pre>
    <pre>wages  of the disabled employees.  That, in my view, is  not  the</pre>
    <pre>type  of  accommodation contemplated by s. 11(2) and in  fact  is</pre>
    <pre>inimical  to the principles underlying the Code.  To quote  again</pre>
    <pre>from Sopinka J. in Eaton at pp. 272-73:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The discrimination inquiry which uses “the
          attribution of stereotypical characteristics”
          reasoning as commonly understood is simply
          inappropriate here.  It may be seen rather as
          a case of reverse stereotyping which, by not
          allowing for the condition of a disabled
          individual, ignores his or her disability and
          forces the individual to sink or swim within
          the mainstream environment.  It is
          recognition of the actual characteristics,
          and reasonable accommodation of these
          characteristics which is the central purpose
          of s. 15(1) in relation to disability.
          [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[55]  Simply  topping up the wages of the disabled employees  and</pre>
    <pre>paying  them  as  if they are not disabled is nothing  more  than</pre>
    <pre>reverse stereotyping as described by Sopinka J.  Rather, it would</pre>
    <pre>seem to me that the employer in this hypothetical must attempt to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate  the  group.  For example, the employer  may  provide</pre>
    <pre>devices  and instruments that would allow the disabled  employees</pre>
    <pre>to  perform close to the same level as the able-bodied employees.</pre>
    <pre>The  duty  is  on the employer to take all steps short  of  undue</pre>
    <pre>hardship  to  accommodate the needs of the  person  discriminated</pre>
    <pre>against  so  that  they  can  compete  equally  with  the   other</pre>
    <pre>employees.   It  is  by  attempting to accommodate  their  actual</pre>
    <pre>characteristics  so  as  to  bring  them  within  the   workplace</pre>
    <pre>environment that the employer complies with the Code.  This point</pre>
    <pre>is made in the Report of the Commission on Equality in Employment</pre>
    <pre>(October 1984) [The Abella Report] at pp. 39-40 and 42:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The issue must be examined from the point of
          view of the individual who has the disability
          rather than from the point of view of the
          assumptions of the employer.  This is not to
          suggest that an employer’s needs and concerns
          are not relevant; in fact, they may be
          critically so.  But it is to suggest that the
          way one deals with this issue is first to
          determine what measures are necessary to
          maximize the ability of a qualified disabled
          individual to perform the job for which he or
          she is being employed.  The determination
          must be made individual by individual.
          Disabled persons do not expect to be hired
          for a job they cannot or could not be trained
          to do.  What they are entitled to expect,
          however, is that wherever reasonably possible
          employers make adjustments to workplaces so
          that disabled persons are not handicapped in
          their ability to perform the job.
          </pre>
    <pre>          …
          </pre>
    <pre>          Although there was general agreement that
          wherever possible incentives should be
          provided to employers to accommodate people
          with disabilities, including tax deductions
          to retrofit premises, hire support personnel,
          and make available technical aids, there was
          also general agreement that wage subsidies
          were degrading.  [Emphasis added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[56]  It  may be that this goal cannot be fully accomplished  and</pre>
    <pre>that  short  of  undue hardship the employer,  for  example,  can</pre>
    <pre>provide  technical aids that will only partly bring the  disabled</pre>
    <pre>employee to the same level as able-bodied employees.  However, in</pre>
    <pre>my  view, that is all the Code requires the employer to do.   The</pre>
    <pre>employer is not required to abandon the standard (assuming it  to</pre>
    <pre>be  a  BFOQ)  and  pay the disabled employees according  to  some</pre>
    <pre>different  standard.   Obviously, it may do so  voluntarily,  but</pre>
    <pre>this not what the Code requires.

</pre>
    <pre>[57]  The  appellant, in this case, does not seek any  reasonable</pre>
    <pre>accommodation  or  modification  of  the  rule  for  the   actual</pre>
    <pre>characteristics of its disabled members.  Indeed, in  this  case,</pre>
    <pre>there   is  no  modification  or  accommodation  possible.    The</pre>
    <pre>appellant  asks,  in effect, that the rule  as  set  out  in  the</pre>
    <pre>collective agreement be struck down.  In Simpsons-Sears, McIntyre</pre>
    <pre>J. pointed out the important distinction in remedies depending on</pre>
    <pre>whether   the   allegation   is   direct   or   adverse    effect</pre>
    <pre>discrimination.   The Supreme Court of Canada  has  applied  that</pre>
    <pre>reasoning  in  subsequent cases.  For example in Central  Alberta</pre>
    <pre>Dairy Pool at p. 428, Wilson J. held as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
          Where  the  rule established by the  employer
          fits    into   the   category   of    &quot;direct
          discrimination&quot;  and  is  not  saved  by  any
          statutory justification, it is simply  struck
          down.  The example cited by McIntyre  J.  was
          Etobicoke.   In   that  case  the   mandatory
          retirement rule discriminated directly on the
          basis of age and the employer's evidence  was
          inadequate to establish a BFOQ. The rule  was
          struck  down.  Where a neutral  rule  has  an
          adverse   discriminatory  effect,  the   same
          result   does  not  obtain.  At  p.  333   of
          [Simpsons-Sears]  McIntyre J.  contrasts  the
          approach taken to direct discrimination  with
          that taken to adverse effect discrimination:
               </pre>
    <pre>                      No  question  arises  in  a  case
               involving direct discrimination. Where a
               working  rule or condition of employment
               is  found  to  be  discriminatory  on  a
               prohibited ground and fails to meet  any
               statutory  justification  test,  it   is
               simply  struck  down: see the  Etobicoke
               case,    supra.   In   the    case    of
               discrimination  on the  basis  of  creed
               resulting from the effect of a condition
               or   rule  rationally  related  to   the
               performance of the job and  not  on  its
               face  discriminatory, a different result
               follows.  The working rule or  condition
               is  not  struck down, but its effect  on
               the  complainant must be considered, and
               if  the  purpose  of the  Ontario  Human
               Rights  Code is to be given effect  some
               accommodation must be required from  the
               employer   for   the  benefit   of   the
               complainant.  [Emphasis added.]
               

</pre>
    <pre>[58] Assuming that the rule respecting employer contributions  to</pre>
    <pre>benefits  plans  constitutes constructive  discrimination,  I  am</pre>
    <pre>satisfied   that  the  justification  in  s.  11(1)(b)   applies.</pre>
    <pre>Requiring  work in exchange for compensation is a reasonable  and</pre>
    <pre>bona  fide requirement.  There is no suggestion that the employer</pre>
    <pre>can  do anything to accommodate the needs of this group or modify</pre>
    <pre>the  requirement  to  place them in a  position  where  they  can</pre>
    <pre>perform  the  work.   Further,  as I  have  not  found  direction</pre>
    <pre>discrimination  under s. 5, the rule in the collective  agreement</pre>
    <pre>stands.</pre>
    <pre>          
               Service Accrual
</pre>
    <pre>[59]  The  discussion  concerning employer contributions  applies</pre>
    <pre>equally to service accrual.  The purpose of service accrual is to</pre>
    <pre>fix  the  level of compensation on the salary grid  and  vacation</pre>
    <pre>pay.   Accordingly,  for the purposes of s.  5,  the  appropriate</pre>
    <pre>comparator  group is other employees on unpaid leave of  absence.</pre>
    <pre>All employees within this group, handicapped and non-handicapped,</pre>
    <pre>are treated the same.  Hence, there is no s. 5 discrimination..

</pre>
    <pre>[60]  As regards constructive or adverse discrimination, for  the</pre>
    <pre>reasons  set  out above in relation to contributions to  benefits</pre>
    <pre>plans, there is no violation of s. 11. Again, as I understand the</pre>
    <pre>agreed facts, these employees are on long-term disability because</pre>
    <pre>they are unable to provide any service.  Thus, there is no amount</pre>
    <pre>of  accommodation  that  the employer could  provide  that  would</pre>
    <pre>overcome the fundamental problem that these employees are  unable</pre>
    <pre>to  work.  This term of the collective agreement is not in breach</pre>
    <pre>of the Code.</pre>
    <pre>          
               Accumulation of Seniority
</pre>
    <pre>[61] Under this collective agreement, accrual of seniority has  a</pre>
    <pre>different  purpose than service accrual or employer contributions</pre>
    <pre>to  benefit  premiums.  At pp. 55 and 56  of  his  decision,  Mr.</pre>
    <pre>Mitchnik  points out that the situation may well be different  in</pre>
    <pre>other collective agreements.  This agreement sets out the purpose</pre>
    <pre>of seniority accrual:</pre>
    <pre>          
          10.06(c)  Nurses   shall   be  selected   for
                    positions under either 10.06(a)  or
                    (b)    [permanent   vacancies   and
                    transfers]  on the basis  of  their
                    skill,   ability,  experience   and
                    qualifications.     Where     these
                    factors   are   relatively    equal
                    amongst   the   nurses  considered,
                    seniority  shall  govern  providing
                    the  successful applicant, if  any,
                    is   qualified   to   perform   the
                    available     work    within     an
                    appropriate familiarization period.
          </pre>
    <pre>          …
          </pre>
    <pre>          10.07(a)  A layoff of nurses shall be made on
                    the  basis  of  seniority  provided
                    that the nurses who are entitled to
                    remain  on  the basis of  seniority
                    are   qualified  to   perform   the
                    available  work.   Subject  to  the
                    foregoing  nurses  shall  be  first
                    laid off.
                    </pre>
    <pre>                    
                    </pre>
    <pre>                    Nurses shall be recalled in the order of
                    seniority, unless otherwise  agreed
                    between  the  Hospital  and   local
                    Association,  provided   that   the
                    nurse  is qualified to perform  the
                    available work.
                    

</pre>
    <pre>[62]   To   summarize,  in  this  agreement,   seniority   is   a</pre>
    <pre>consideration   for   the  purpose  of  filling   vacancies   and</pre>
    <pre>determining the order in which employees are laid off  and  hired</pre>
    <pre>back.   However,  seniority is not the only  consideration.   The</pre>
    <pre>seniority  clause in this agreement is a competitive clause:  see</pre>
    <pre>Arthurs,  Carter,  Fudge, Glasbeek and Trudeau,  Labour  Law  and</pre>
    <pre>Industrial Relations in Canada, Fourth Edition (1993) at p.  342.</pre>
    <pre>The  principal  considerations for filling vacancies  are  skill,</pre>
    <pre>ability,  experience and qualifications.  Seniority is  only  the</pre>
    <pre>deciding  factor where these other considerations are  relatively</pre>
    <pre>equal among the competing employees.  Similarly, for layoffs  and</pre>
    <pre>recalls, seniority only governs if the most senior employees  are</pre>
    <pre>qualified to perform the available work.

</pre>
    <pre>[63]  Thus, in this agreement, seniority is not directly  related</pre>
    <pre>to  compensation.  The purpose of seniority is not to provide  an</pre>
    <pre>additional  form  of compensation in exchange for  work.   Unlike</pre>
    <pre>service accrual, for example, years of seniority do not determine</pre>
    <pre>the  employee's  compensation.  Rather, the seniority  provisions</pre>
    <pre>are triggered simply by the status of being an employee, a status</pre>
    <pre>long-term  disabled  employees  retain.   It  follows  that   the</pre>
    <pre>relevant  comparator group with respect seniority  is  all  other</pre>
    <pre>employees.

</pre>
    <pre>[64]  It has been said that seniority is “labour’s premier equity</pre>
    <pre>tool  and should be respected as such”: The Abella Report  at  p.</pre>
    <pre>220.  “Seniority is a neutral system that is colour-blind, gender-</pre>
    <pre>blind,   and  age-blind…  It  also  offers  those  with  physical</pre>
    <pre>limitations  the  opportunity to insist on the right  to  try  to</pre>
    <pre>perform  a  job.”:  P. Nash, L. Gottheil, “Employment Equity:   A</pre>
    <pre>Union  Perspective”  (1992), 2 Can. Lab.  L.J.  49  at  54.   The</pre>
    <pre>seniority  provisions in this agreement appear to be directed  to</pre>
    <pre>achieving  fairness in competition for promotions,  lay-offs  and</pre>
    <pre>call-backs.   Nevertheless, even bona fide seniority systems  can</pre>
    <pre>have discriminatory potential.

</pre>
    <pre>[65]  So  far as possible, seniority systems should be  developed</pre>
    <pre>through  the  collective  bargaining  process.   However,   where</pre>
    <pre>collective bargaining produces an agreement that contravenes  the</pre>
    <pre>statutory protections, the arbitrator or the court, as  the  case</pre>
    <pre>may  be,  has an obligation to intervene and the employer  has  a</pre>
    <pre>duty  to  accommodate within the statutory limits.  The  affected</pre>
    <pre>griever   need   not  show  that  there  was  an   intention   to</pre>
    <pre>discriminate:  Simpsons-Sears at pp. 329-30; Eldridge v.  British</pre>
    <pre>Columbia (Attorney General) at p. 671.

</pre>
    <pre>[66] In this agreement, seniority directly affects the ability of</pre>
    <pre>employees to access, remain in, and thrive in the workplace.   It</pre>
    <pre>is  therefore  a  right  that is at  the  core  of  human  rights</pre>
    <pre>legislation  as it affects the disabled. M. David Lepofsky  notes</pre>
    <pre>that  while  the  public  considers  current  unemployment  rates</pre>
    <pre>running  between  7  and 9% to be intolerably high,  working-aged</pre>
    <pre>disabled  persons  have  confronted extremely  high  unemployment</pre>
    <pre>rates,  rates  that are several times those for the  able-bodied:</pre>
    <pre>“The  Duty to Accommodate:  A Purposive Approach” (1992), 1  Cdn.</pre>
    <pre>Lab.  L.J.  1  at 10.1  Despite advances aimed at increasing  the</pre>
    <pre>employability of disabled persons, they still encounter  “massive</pre>
    <pre>barriers” when seeking jobs.  Persons with disabilities have “too</pre>
    <pre>often  been  excluded from the labour force … [and] subjected  to</pre>
    <pre>invidious stereotyping”.  In comparison to non-disabled they  are</pre>
    <pre>“more  likely  to be outside the labour force, face  much  higher</pre>
    <pre>unemployment rates, and are concentrated at the lower end of  the</pre>
    <pre>pay scale when employed”:  Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney</pre>
    <pre>General)  at  p. 668.  Mr. Lepofsky argues, at p.  20,  that  the</pre>
    <pre>different   treatment  required  by  the   legislated   duty   to</pre>
    <pre>accommodate  is  but  a  “modest  means  for  attaining  for  the</pre>
    <pre>accommodated worker equality of treatment in the workplace — that</pre>
    <pre>is, the same opportunity to obtain and retain a job at that place</pre>
    <pre>of   employment   that   other  workers  enjoy.    Indeed,   this</pre>
    <pre>prerequisite is a sine qua non of the duty to accommodate.”

</pre>
    <pre>[67] Disabled workers meeting the Code definition of handicapped,</pre>
    <pre>who become disabled in the course of their employment and perhaps</pre>
    <pre>as  a result of the employment, will be more likely to require an</pre>
    <pre>unpaid  leave  of  absence.  Depriving those employees  of  their</pre>
    <pre>seniority during those periods of absence in excess of  one  year</pre>
    <pre>makes  them increasingly vulnerable to layoff and also less  able</pre>
    <pre>to compete equally for promotions.

</pre>
    <pre>[68]  The  right to accrue seniority is also at the core  of  the</pre>
    <pre>disabled employee’s ability to integrate into the workforce.   As</pre>
    <pre>the Abella Report points out at pp. 45-6:</pre>
    <pre>          
          It  is  not just the opportunity of  becoming
          employed  that  is  at  issue,  it   is   the
          opportunity, once employed, of being able  to
          move  through  a corporation  with  the  same
          facility as would any other employee  with  a
          disabled  individual’s  qualifications.   The
          danger  for  members of any of the designated
          groups is that, once hired, there will be  an
          assumption    by    employers    that     the
          responsibility has been discharged  and  that
          promotion,   training,  or  other   corporate
          opportunities  will be denied  for  the  same
          reasons that original employment itself might
          have  been denied.  The stereotypes  must  be
          confronted not only at the point of entry  to
          the  corporation, but throughout its  systems
          and  practices  and  at every  level.   There
          should be a presumption in favour of a  “duty
          of    reasonable   accommodation”   so   that
          employment barriers are eliminated and access
          to    the   fullest   range   of   employment
          opportunities   is   available.     [Emphasis
          added.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[69] Under this collective agreement, where candidates for a  job</pre>
    <pre>vacancy  are  relatively equal in all other  respects,  seniority</pre>
    <pre>breaks the tie.  As Mr. Lepofsky states at p. 7:</pre>
    <pre>          
          the  duty  to  accommodate serves  to  enable
          individuals to have their qualifications  and
          competence  to  contribute to  the  workplace
          evaluated  in  a  fair and  accurate  manner.
          When an employer seeks to determine whether a
          particular  candidate for a job is  qualified
          to do that job, the aim of the exercise is to
          ascertain  as  effectively  as  possible  the
          individual’s true capabilities — to  identify
          what  kinds  of  positive contributions  this
          person  could make to the workplace.   It  is
          vital  that such an appraisal be carried  out
          in  a fair and accurate manner, both from the
          perspective  of effective business  decision-
          making and from the vantage-point of the  job
          applicant.
          

</pre>
    <pre>  [70]      By depriving employees of seniority accrual  for  the</pre>
    <pre>periods when they were unable to work, disabled employees are put</pre>
    <pre>at  an  unfair disadvantage, by reason of their handicap.   Under</pre>
    <pre>this agreement, seniority accumulates from the date of last hire.</pre>
    <pre>After  the  nurse  has  successfully completed  the  probationary</pre>
    <pre>period,  which  is  calculated on the basis  of  tours  or  hours</pre>
    <pre>actually   worked  (para.  10.01(a)),  seniority  for   full-time</pre>
    <pre>employees  involves nothing more than the passage of time  as  an</pre>
    <pre>employee.2  However, while employees on active service accumulate</pre>
    <pre>seniority from the date of last hire, handicapped employees cease</pre>
    <pre>accumulating seniority one year after they become disabled.

</pre>
    <pre>[71]  Seniority is of consequence under this agreement  when  the</pre>
    <pre>disabled  employees have returned, or seek to return,  to  active</pre>
    <pre>service  and  are in competition with other employees  on  active</pre>
    <pre>service.  Thus, having regard to the purpose of seniority in this</pre>
    <pre>agreement, the appropriate comparator group is the employees as a</pre>
    <pre>whole.   Disabled  employees are denied  rights  given  to  other</pre>
    <pre>employees  in  a  manner constituting discrimination  within  the</pre>
    <pre>meaning of s. 5 of the Code.

</pre>
    <pre>[72] Having found direct discrimination within the meaning of  s.</pre>
    <pre>5,  it  is necessary to consider the effect of s. 17 of the Code.</pre>
    <pre>To repeat, s. 17 provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
          17.   (1)  A right of a person under this Act
          is not infringed for the reason only that the
          person   is   incapable  of   performing   or
          fulfilling    the   essential    duties    or
          requirements  attending the exercise  of  the
          right because of handicap.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  The Commission, the board of inquiry  or
          a  court  shall  not find a person  incapable
          unless it is satisfied that the needs of  the
          person  cannot be accommodated without  undue
          hardship   on  the  person  responsible   for
          accommodating  those needs,  considering  the
          cost, outside sources of funding, if any, and
          health and safety requirements, if any.
</pre>
    <pre>[73] In my view, s. 17 does not excuse this violation of s. 5. We</pre>
    <pre>were  not referred to any training, additional qualification,  or</pre>
    <pre>particular  on-the-job experience that is necessary to  enable  a</pre>
    <pre>nurse  to continue to accumulate seniority.  Put another way,  it</pre>
    <pre>has  not  been  shown  that  while on long-term  disability,  the</pre>
    <pre>employee  is  incapable  of  performing  any  essential  duty  or</pre>
    <pre>requirement  relating to the accumulation of  seniority  in  this</pre>
    <pre>agreement.   In  Charter  s. 15 terms, the  collective  agreement</pre>
    <pre>relies  upon  a distinction that is irrelevant to the  functional</pre>
    <pre>values  underlying  the  seniority system:  Eldridge  v.  British</pre>
    <pre>Columbia  (Attorney General) at p. 670.  Seniority for  full-time</pre>
    <pre>employees  involves nothing more than the passage of time  as  an</pre>
    <pre>employee  —  a  status  that long-term disabled  persons  retain.</pre>
    <pre>Moreover,  once the employees return to work, if  they  are  less</pre>
    <pre>qualified to perform the work for any sought-after promotion, the</pre>
    <pre>fact  that  they  have  greater seniority  than  other  competing</pre>
    <pre>employees  does  not matter.  Similarly, their greater  seniority</pre>
    <pre>will not protect them from lay-offs or guarantee their return  to</pre>
    <pre>work  if  they are not capable of performing the available  work.</pre>
    <pre>Simply  put,  I  can  see  no essential  duties  or  requirements</pre>
    <pre>attending  the  exercise of the right that  the  employee  cannot</pre>
    <pre>fulfill while on unpaid leave of absence by reason of handicap.

</pre>
    <pre>[74]  The  position of the disabled employees under  s.  17  with</pre>
    <pre>respect to seniority can usefully be compared with their position</pre>
    <pre>with respect to service accrual or contributions to benefits,  if</pre>
    <pre>I   had   found  direct  discrimination  in  relation  to   those</pre>
    <pre>compensation-related  rights.  While  they  are  disabled,  these</pre>
    <pre>handicapped  employees cannot provide their labour, an  essential</pre>
    <pre>requirement    for   receiving   compensation.     Discriminatory</pre>
    <pre>provisions  in  this collective agreement affecting compensation,</pre>
    <pre>such  as  accrual of service, or providing forms of compensation,</pre>
    <pre>such  as  employer contributions to benefits, would therefore  be</pre>
    <pre>excused  by s. 17.  In contrast, the seniority provisions  cannot</pre>
    <pre>be  justified by s. 17, since those provisions do not depend upon</pre>
    <pre>the  employee providing labour, but are triggered simply  by  the</pre>
    <pre>status of being an employee.

</pre>
    <pre>[75]  I am also impressed by the reasons of the experienced Chair</pre>
    <pre>of  this  arbitration panel, Mr. Mitchnick.  He  points  out  the</pre>
    <pre>different purposes of seniority as opposed to matters related  to</pre>
    <pre>compensation, in part, as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
               That deals with both the benefits and
          the &quot;service&quot; issues.  &quot;Seniority&quot;, on the
          other hand, more typically is a term used
          under a collective agreement to define the
          relationship of employees inter se….  While
          it might be argued that there is no more
          reason to allow the accumulation of
          &quot;seniority&quot; credits than &quot;service&quot; credits
          when an employee is not actually working,
          there does tend to be a recognizable
          distinction in the two situations with
          respect to the relative extent of the
          employer's interest (as the current
          collective agreement itself reflects)….
          </pre>
    <pre>          …
          </pre>
    <pre>          The question thus is this: given the
          relatively limited interest of the employer
          (as distinct from the &quot;compensation&quot; issues),
          does it seem more probable than not that the
          Legislature intended to create a protection
          against someone forced off work for months or
          even years with, for example, an injury
          suffered at their workplace, or engaged in a
          battle with cancer, upon their return having
          their &quot;date of hire&quot; effectively adjusted
          forward, so that they are more likely, as in
          this case, to be exposed to lay-off than
          individuals who came to the employer at some
          point after them?  We think it entirely
          probable that it did.  And, as can be seen in
          those terms, the issue of seniority is, as
          the Association urges, one much more closely
          aligned to the issue of &quot;access&quot;, than to the
          issue of &quot;compensation&quot; that we have found to
          be governed by the Versa Services line of
          cases.  [Emphasis in original.]
          

</pre>
    <pre>[76]  I  also  find support for this conclusion in the  automatic</pre>
    <pre>termination  cases.  There is a close analogy between  denial  of</pre>
    <pre>seniority  rights and automatic termination.  In both cases,  the</pre>
    <pre>clause,  even if viewed as facially neutral, has the capacity  to</pre>
    <pre>deprive the disabled worker of employment due to innocent absence</pre>
    <pre>because  of  handicap:  Ontario Nurses’ Association v.  Etobicoke</pre>
    <pre>General Hospital (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 40 (Div. Ct.) at 42-3.

</pre>
    <pre>[77]  For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Divisional Court</pre>
    <pre>that the reasoning in Versa Services governs seniority rights.

</pre>
    <pre>[78]  As the provisions denying handicapped workers the right  to</pre>
    <pre>accumulate seniority while on long-term disability violate  s.  5</pre>
    <pre>and  cannot be excused under s. 17, in accordance with  Simpsons-</pre>
    <pre>Sears, those provisions must be struck down.

</pre>
    <pre>[79]  If  I  am  wrong,  and  the seniority  provisions  of  this</pre>
    <pre>agreement do not constitute direct discrimination under s.  5,  I</pre>
    <pre>would   find   that   the   provisions  constitute   constructive</pre>
    <pre>discrimination under s. 11.  The provisions impose the burden  of</pre>
    <pre>loss   of  seniority  after  one  year’s  absence  upon  a  group</pre>
    <pre>identified  by  a  prohibited ground of  discrimination,  namely,</pre>
    <pre>disability.   This  is  a  burden  not  imposed  on  most   other</pre>
    <pre>employees.  For many of the same reasons that I have found s.  17</pre>
    <pre>does  not  excuse direct discrimination, I would hold  that  that</pre>
    <pre>these  provisions  do not constitute a bona fide  requirement  or</pre>
    <pre>qualification  within  the meaning of s. 11(1)(a).   Pursuant  to</pre>
    <pre>s. 11(2), a court cannot find that a requirement or qualification</pre>
    <pre>is  reasonable and bona fide in the circumstances “unless  it  is</pre>
    <pre>satisfied  that the needs of the group of which the person  is  a</pre>
    <pre>member  cannot  be  accommodated without undue  hardship  on  the</pre>
    <pre>person responsible for accommodating those needs”.

</pre>
    <pre>[80] In my view, when dealing with seniority in the context of  a</pre>
    <pre>collective  agreement  such as this, both the  employer  and  the</pre>
    <pre>union  are  responsible for accommodating  these  needs:  Central</pre>
    <pre>Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 at</pre>
    <pre>989.   The  union in this case obviously makes no claim that  the</pre>
    <pre>members  of  the  group  cannot be accommodated  short  of  undue</pre>
    <pre>hardship.

</pre>
    <pre>[81]  The  employer  adduced  no evidence  with  respect  to  the</pre>
    <pre>statutory  undue  hardship factors of cost,3 outside  sources  of</pre>
    <pre>funding,  and  health  and  safety requirements.   The  principal</pre>
    <pre>impact of changing the seniority rules in this type of collective</pre>
    <pre>agreement is on the other employees.  Restoring seniority for the</pre>
    <pre>disabled  employees affects the economic security  and  promotion</pre>
    <pre>opportunities of those able-bodied nurses who had benefited  from</pre>
    <pre>the  loss  of  seniority of the disabled employees in  accordance</pre>
    <pre>with  the  collective  agreement.   In  Central  Okanagan  School</pre>
    <pre>District No. 23 v. Renaud, the court considered an argument  that</pre>
    <pre>the   accommodation   necessary  to   take   into   account   the</pre>
    <pre>complainant’s  religious observances would  adversely  impact  on</pre>
    <pre>other   employees.   Sopinka  J.  held  that  more   than   minor</pre>
    <pre>inconvenience  must  be shown before the right  to  accommodation</pre>
    <pre>could  be defeated.  Speaking particularly of the impact on other</pre>
    <pre>employees he wrote at pp. 984-85:</pre>
    <pre>          
          The employer must establish that actual
          interference with the rights of other
          employees, which is not trivial but
          substantial, will result from the adoption of
          the accommodating measures.  Minor
          interference or inconvenience is the price to
          be paid for religious freedoms in a
          multicultural society.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[82]  Assuming impact on other employees is a proper factor under</pre>
    <pre>s.  11, I would apply the same reasoning to the accommodation  of</pre>
    <pre>the  seniority  rules for the disabled.  Adjusting the  seniority</pre>
    <pre>rules to remove discriminatory effects can advance the element of</pre>
    <pre>equity  implied  in  using  the  neutral  factor  of  length   of</pre>
    <pre>employment   for  calculating  seniority.   In   my   view,   the</pre>
    <pre>appropriate accommodation is to exempt employees covered by  this</pre>
    <pre>collective   agreement   from  the  provisions   curtailing   the</pre>
    <pre>accumulation of seniority, throughout the period that  the  nurse</pre>
    <pre>remains  an  employee  and falls within the  Code  definition  of</pre>
    <pre>handicap: Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud at p.</pre>
    <pre>986.</pre>
    <pre>          
          THE RECORD
</pre>
    <pre>[83] Finally, I should not leave this appeal without expressing a</pre>
    <pre>concern  with  the  record in this case.  I  have  reached  these</pre>
    <pre>conclusions  based  on  the  very  brief  agreed  facts  and  the</pre>
    <pre>collective  agreement itself.  As I stated at  the  beginning  of</pre>
    <pre>these  reasons, the parties led no evidence about the purpose  of</pre>
    <pre>the  various impugned provisions.  Similarly, no evidence was led</pre>
    <pre>as   to  the  potential  consequences  on  other  employees.  For</pre>
    <pre>instance,  in oral argument counsel for the respondents submitted</pre>
    <pre>that  many  employees on long-term disability  are  kept  on  the</pre>
    <pre>employment roles essentially for purposes completely unrelated to</pre>
    <pre>their  status as employees.  This preserves for the employee  the</pre>
    <pre>appearance of employment, the possibility (no matter how  remote)</pre>
    <pre>to  return  to  work, and the social benefit  of  a  tie  to  the</pre>
    <pre>workforce and the friends in the bargaining unit.  These benefits</pre>
    <pre>are  at  virtually  no  cost to the employer.   However,  if  the</pre>
    <pre>appellants were successful in this appeal, at some point  it  may</pre>
    <pre>be  to  the economic advantage of the employer to terminate these</pre>
    <pre>handicapped  employees  and exclude them  from  the  benefits  of</pre>
    <pre>employee  status.   Even the modest accommodation  for  seniority</pre>
    <pre>mandated by the award in this case may lead employers to  attempt</pre>
    <pre>to  terminate the employment relationship where the length of the</pre>
    <pre>absence  “undermines” the employment relationship  or  makes  the</pre>
    <pre>relationship “no longer viable”:  Brown &amp; Beatty, Canadian Labour</pre>
    <pre>Arbitration, 3rd Ed. (Aurora:  Canada Law Book, 1998)  paragraphs</pre>
    <pre>7:3210  and 7:3220.  This is just one of many troubling  examples</pre>
    <pre>raised in oral argument on which no evidence was led.

</pre>
    <pre>[84]  In  my  view,  a more complete record would  have  been  of</pre>
    <pre>considerable  assistance in resolving the issues on this  appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Such  a  record  would, moreover, have been more consistent  with</pre>
    <pre>determining  issues under a statute like the Human  Rights  Code,</pre>
    <pre>that  has  almost  quasi-constitutional  status.   Although   the</pre>
    <pre>following  comments  from MacKay v. Manitoba  (1989),  61  D.L.R.</pre>
    <pre>(4th) 385 (S.C.C.) at 388 were made in reasons for judgment under</pre>
    <pre>the   Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and  Freedoms,   they   have</pre>
    <pre>application to a case such as this:</pre>
    <pre>          
                 Charter   cases  will  frequently   be
          concerned  with concepts and principles  that
          are  of  fundamental importance  to  Canadian
          society.  For  example, issues pertaining  to
          freedom  of  religion, freedom of  expression
          and  the  right  to  life,  liberty  and  the
          security  of the individual will have  to  be
          considered by the courts. Decisions on  these
          issues must be carefully considered, as  they
          will profoundly affect the lives of Canadians
          and  all residents of Canada. In light of the
          importance   and   the  impact   that   these
          decisions may have in the future, the  courts
          have  every  right to expect  and  indeed  to
          insist  upon  the  careful  preparation   and
          presentation  of  a  factual  basis  in  most
          Charter cases. The relevant facts put forward
          may   cover  a  wide  spectrum  dealing  with
          scientific,  social, economic  and  political
          aspects.  Often  expert  opinion  as  to  the
          future impact of the impugned legislation and
          the   result   of   the  possible   decisions
          pertaining  to it may be of great  assistance
          to the courts.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Charter  decisions should not and  must
          not  be  made in a factual vacuum. To attempt
          to  do  so  would trivialize the Charter  and
          inevitably result in ill-considered opinions.
          The  presentation of facts is not, as  stated
          by   the  respondent,  a  mere  technicality;
          rather,   it   is  essential  to   a   proper
          consideration  of Charter issues.   [Emphasis
          added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[85]  However, the parties urged us to decide this  case  on  the</pre>
    <pre>basis  of  the  record,  such as it is, and  I  have,  with  some</pre>
    <pre>reluctance, done so.</pre>
    <pre>          
          DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[86]  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part  and  restore</pre>
    <pre>the award of the Board of Arbitration.  As success was divided, I</pre>
    <pre>would  not  make  any  order for costs  either  of  this  appeal,</pre>
    <pre>including the motion for leave to appeal, or of the appeal to the</pre>
    <pre>Divisional Court.
