    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                                
[1]  The appellant was convicted of three counts of sexual
touching, two counts of sexual exploitation and one count of
obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to periods of
incarceration on the various counts that totalled eleven months.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Greenspon advanced three
grounds in support of the appeal against conviction and also
sought leave to appeal against sentence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Mr. Greenspon's first submission was that the trial judge's
finding that the sexual touching took place before the
complainant's fourteenth birthday was unreasonable.  In
particular, he submitted that the trial judge gave inadequate
consideration to various flaws in the complainant's evidence and
failed to sufficiently address four contradictory statements
given by the complainant prior to the trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The trial judge was alive to the fact that the complainant
was, as he described her, a &quot;flawed witness&quot;.  His reasons reveal
a careful analysis of her evidence and demonstrate the basis upon
which he concluded from her evidence that the incidents of sexual
touching took place before her 14th birthday. He made specific
reference to entries in the complainant's diary made between the
12th and 24th of July, 1997, which indicated that the first act
of intercourse took place very shortly after she turned 14 on
June 30th, 1997 and from which he concluded, in our view
reasonably, that the earlier acts of sexual touching, including
oral sex, took place, as she testified, prior to her 14th
birthday.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Mr. Greenspon relied upon a passage appearing in the
judgment of this court in R. v. S. (W.) (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d)
242 at 250. In the case before us, the trial judge went well
beyond simply stating that he did not believe the contradictory
evidence; he set out his reasons for concluding that the sexual
touching occurred prior to the complainant's fourteenth birthday.
With respect to the four contradictory statements to which Mr.
Greenspon referred, the trial judge adverted to two of them and a
third was, in the context of the complainant's evidence as a
whole, not contradictory. The trial judge directly recognized the
problem confronting him in terms of inconsistent statements made
by the complainant, and we are satisfied that his conclusion was
one  that a reasonable trier, on this record, could reach.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Mr. Greenspon disputed the trial judge's finding that the
appellant was in a position of trust with relation to the
complainant. In our view, there was ample support, in the
circumstances disclosed by the evidence, regarding  the evolution
of their relationship, the complainant's vulnerability and
weaknesses and the significant difference in their ages, for the
trial judge's finding that the appellant stood in a position of
trust to the complainant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Mr. Greenspon submitted that the Crown failed to establish
the required acts and the mental element necessary to prove
obstruction of justice. In our view, there was a reasonable basis
for the trial judge's finding that the appellant purposely
counselled the complainant to lie about the sex acts that took
place when she was only thirteen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Mr. Greenspon submitted that the trial judge should not have
sentenced the appellant to any term of incarceration in addition
to the period in excess of six months dead time awaiting trial
and that the trial judge should have imposed a conditional
sentence. Given the circumstances of the offences of which the
appellant was convicted, the term of incarceration imposed was
not beyond the appropriate range. The trial judge specifically
considered the possibility of a conditional sentence and rejected
it, principally  for reasons of denunciation and specific
deterrence. In this, we find, he made no error in principle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed,
leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal
against sentence is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
